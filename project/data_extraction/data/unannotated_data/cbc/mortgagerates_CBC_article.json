And in some cases, they're actually rising.\n\"Usually\u00a0when the Bank of Canada cuts rates like they have, by 1.5 percentage points in a month, you can expect all rates to fall,\" said\u00a0James Laird, president of mortgage brokerage CanWise Financial and\u00a0co-founder of\u00a0Ratehub.ca.\n\"At first they did ...\u00a0but a week and a half ago, we started to see a shift [and] now we are seeing our\u00a0lenders increase rates. Every two days, we get a different lender saying we are going up by point one, point two.\"\nMortgage rates tend to move up and down based on a number of factors, but one of the main ones is the costs borne by the lenders themselves.\nPeople tend to think that when someone walks into a bank to ask for a home loan, if they are approved, the bank just takes the cash out of some safe at the back, hands it over to the borrower and charges them interest over time to make a profit.\nBut, in fact, banks don't keep that much money just lying around either \u2014\u00a0they typically borrow it themselves\u00a0and make money on the spread between how much they're charged for it\u00a0and how much they turn around and charge the borrower for it.\nThe cost of financing a variable rate loan is strongly influenced by the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, because banks tend to set their own prime lending rates based on whatever the central bank's rate is.\nThe bank has cut that rate by 150 basis points \u2014 1.5 percentage points \u2014\u00a0in the past month\u00a0to try to make it as easy and cheap as possible for people to borrow, spend and invest to stimulate the economy that has been waylaid by COVID-19.\nA few short weeks ago, it wasn't hard to find a variable rate mortgage for something around prime minus one \u2014 a full percentage point below whatever a bank's prime lending rate was at the time.\nBut a funny thing has happened since then. Prime lending rates have gone down more or less in lockstep with the Bank of Canada's moves, but those discount rates for mortgages have evaporated.\n\"About half of the savings have been passed along and half kept by banks for a higher margin,\" Laird said.\nThe reason they're doing that is the same as why\u00a0stock markets plunged\u00a0and governments rushed to\u00a0implement lockdowns on millions of people: fear.\n\"Lenders are saying, 'Hold on a second,'\" Laird said. \"If a million people are going to lose their jobs and unemployment is going to rise, maybe we should build in a bit of a risk premium to our\u00a0pricing to account for possible defaults for this new money we are lending.\"\nWhen the economic outlook was more clear, banks were happy to cut rates as low as possible to try to gobble up market share. But now, they're saying \"We better earn a bit more of a spread on this money because these things might default at a higher rate than we're used to,\" Laird said.\nThe impact isn't dramatic. Laird says a few weeks ago, the best mortgage rates were something in the range of between two and 2.5 per cent. Today, they're between 2.5 and three per cent because, as he puts it, \"they are demanding a higher risk premium than what they typically do.\"\nOthers aren't quite so diplomatic.\n\"It's total garbage,\" Marcus Tzaferis with mortage brokerage Cannect said. \"It's complete profit taking.\"\nWhile banks borrow at a rate slightly above that government rate,\u00a0Tzaferis says \"the spread between their cost of borrowing and some of their five-year fixed mortgage rates is still around 250 points, which is highly profitable for them.\"\nFixed-rate loans aren't pegged to the Bank of Canada's rate and are instead more influenced by the bond market. And there, too, Tzaferis says what's happening in the market doesn't reflect what's happening behind the scenes.\nLenders finance fixed-rate loans on the bond market, where yields have fallen to record lows in the current COVID-19 crisis. The yield on a five-year government of Canada bond bottomed out at around 0.37 per cent this month and is currently hovering just over 0.5 per cent.\u00a0\nThough banks must pay a credit spread on bond yield and that may be widening, Tzaferis says they are also widening their profit margins. Most fixed-rate mortgages are currently going for around three per cent, he points out.\nThe difference for borrowers adds up fast. Laird calculates that a theoretical buyer who put down a 10 per cent deposit on a house costing $500,000 before this crisis would likely have been able to get a mortgage rate of 2.6 per cent, which would make their payment $2,102 a month.\nIf all three rate cuts since then were to be fully factored into that loan, that borrower's monthly payment would fall\u00a0as low as $1,769 a month\u00a0\u2014 that's\u00a0$333 per month or $3,996 per year on their mortgage payments, compared to what they were paying less than a month ago.\nThe overwhelming majority of first-time buyers opt for fixed-rate loans because they like the security of knowing that their monthly payment is guaranteed to not increase.\u00a0The banks know this, Tzaferis says, and it could soon have a heavy cost for borrowers.\n\"They're using this as an opportunity to lock people into big fat juicy\u00a0and profitable five-year mortgages,\" he said. \"When their rates drop those consumers are going to have massive penalties to break them ...\u00a0tens of thousands of dollars.\"\n\"It's absolutely insanity,\" Tzaferis\u00a0said. \"This is a totally manufactured crisis to profit.\"\nLaird and Tzferis both say that the current situation can't last forever. Economists are already predicting that the COVID-19 recession is likely to be incredibly sharp, but it's anyone's guess\u00a0how long it will go on for.\nLaird says the best sign that things are getting back to normal will be when the big banks start to act in a way that seems paradoxical.\nBanks are raising their rates right now because they feel just as uncertain about the future as Canadians do. Once that cloud lifts, they'll want to start lowering rates again, and \"they won't build in that uncertainty premium like they are now,\" said Laird.\n\"As confidence returns, you'll see rates fall.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Why worries about the coronavirus are pushing mortgage rates down", "description": "Fear has pushed investors to buy up bonds, which is causing cheaper borrowing for home buyers", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-mortgage-rates-canada-1.5443071", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5443215.1580239186!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/germany-dax.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 29, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-01-29T09:00:00.512Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Economists are busy trying to calculate the potential economic toll of the coronavirus\u00a0outbreak that's currently making its way around the world. But there's one marketplace that is already, quite unexpectedly, quantifying the full force\u00a0of the bug: mortgages.\nRates for fixed- and variable-rate home loans are based on a variety of factors, but one of the biggest is the price that lenders have to pay to borrow money themselves.\nFor fixed-rate Canadian home loans, the benchmark that sets the price that consumer rates are based on is the five-year Government of Canada bond.\nInvestors who covet bonds like that one do so because they are perceived to be safe. Investors\u00a0are willing to accept the relatively meagre returns that government debt\u00a0offers because it's better than the alternative \u2014 losing money on whatever other, riskier investment they would have had to buy instead.\nCounterintuitively, the price of a bond and its yield move in opposite directions. So when appetite for bonds goes up, the amount they pay out goes down, because lenders don't have to offer quite as good a deal to find a buyer for their debt.\nThe price of bonds tends to increase when people are feeling fearful,\u00a0a situation that certainly describes the state of affairs today amid a mysterious coronavirus emanating from mainland China\u00a0that has killed more than 100\u00a0people and infected\u00a0thousands more.\nThat fear is prompting investors to pour money into the safety of\u00a0government bonds, and all that buying is pushing down the yield on that debt.\nAs recently as the start of the year, the yield on the five-year Canadian government bond was about 1.7 per cent. This week, it dipped as low as just above 1.3. In the staid world of bonds, a 40-point drop in a relatively short period is huge, and it's filtering down into the mortgage market.\nFixed-rate loans are highly influenced by bond yields, because\u00a0a\u00a0mortgage lender makes money on the spread between the\u00a0bond rate and what they offer to consumers. If the five-year bond yield goes up, they can\u00a0just pass that cost on to consumers. If it goes down, as it is now, the lender's cost of borrowing goes down, so they can turn around and lower their rates for consumers to drum up new business.\nThat's what seems to be happening.\nFixed-rate loans are falling, according to James Laird, CEO of mortgage broker Canwise Financial and co-founder of rate comparison website RateHub.ca. While specific rates will vary based on the borrower and what part of the country they're in, currently the best deal on offer for a five-year fixed loan is 2.64 per cent with a trust company\u00a0and 2.74 per cent from a big bank. Barely a month ago, those rates would have been roughly 10 to 20 points higher.\nWhile bond yields have fallen by about 40 basis points in that period, that means lenders so far have only passed on about a quarter of those savings to consumers. But that is likely to\u00a0soon change.\nLenders are always slower to pass on savings than they are to pass on added costs, Laird said, but they can only hold off for so long.\n\"If\u00a0bond yields were up by 40 points, you can guarantee far more [lenders] would have changed rates and by a greater amount,\" Laird\u00a0said. \"On the way down they're a little slower ... they enjoy thicker margins for a while.\"\nCoronavirus fears have really only sped up the process of a move toward lower rates that was already underway, he said.\nIn its policy decision last week, the Bank of Canada elected to keep its benchmark interest rate where it is for now.\u00a0But by singling out concerns over the job market, international trade and other factors, it's clear the bank is leaning more toward rate cuts than hikes, Laird said.\nVariable-rate mortgages set their rates based on what the Bank of Canada is doing, not bond yields. And based on the central bank's last statement, traders think there's about an 80 per cent chance of at least one rate cut by the end of 2020. That means home buyers with variable-rate loans can expect some relief soon, too.\nThere's also some seasonality at play in all this. All things being equal, lenders like to hit the ground running on the busy spring home buying season, so Laird often sees rate cuts in mid-February or March, regardless of what bonds are up to.\u00a0\nThe sudden impact of the coronavirus is just causing that to happen a little earlier and a little more dramatically than anticipated.\n\"It's\u00a0not like rates were on the rise and the coronavirus\u00a0caused them to do a U-turn,\" he said. \"I'd say this is another area which is putting downward pressure on bond yields, and therefore downward pressure on mortgage rates.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Canadian mortgage rates are falling as bond yields slide lower", "description": "Yield on 5-year government debt has dipped below 1.5%, lowest since 2017", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mortgage-rates-1.5070332", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5070772.1553541567!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mortgage-rates.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 26, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-03-26T19:41:11.873Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "What's bad news for some is good news for others, and Canadian mortgage-holders are the unexpected beneficiaries of some of the gloom that's hovering over Canada's economy.\nFixed mortgage rates have been falling precipitously in recent weeks, as the cost of financing those loans has gotten cheaper. Banks and other lenders get the money that they loan out in mortgages by borrowing it themselves on the bond market, and the yields on five-year bonds have been falling since late\u00a02018.\nA five-year Government of Canada bond was yielding just 1.45\u00a0per cent on Monday. That's the first time the figure has been below 1.5 per cent since the summer of 2017.\u00a0\nLast week, the yield curve on long-term lending versus short-term inverted, a rare event that has an uncanny knack for predicting recessions. (For a longer explanation on what an inverted yield curve means, read this.)\n\"There's all kinds of technical forces, and it is not necessarily the case that tomorrow we'll have a recession,\"\u00a0CIBC economist Benjamin Tal\u00a0said in an interview.\u00a0\n\"However, the\u00a0yield curve\u00a0slowing down is a clear signal \u2026 we have to listen to. We have a conflict between the stock market, which is more optimistic, and\u00a0the bond market which is more pessimistic.\"\nPut simply, bond yields are heading lower largely because investors think the prospects for the economy are looking dim, so they expect interest rates to start moving lower.\nLower bond yields are\u00a0generally\u00a0\"not a good sign from an\u00a0economic standpoint,\" says Janine White, vice-president of rate comparison website,\u00a0Ratesupermarket.ca, \"but it's great for mortgage borrowers.\"\nThat's because cheaper financing costs are allowing\u00a0the banks to cut their mortgage rates to try to entice borrowers. CBC News reported in January that Royal Bank cut its five-year posted rate to 3.74 per cent, a move that rivals were expected to match.\nRoyal Bank has since cut that rate two more times, first by 10 basis points on March 1 and then by another 15 basis points on March 13. The bank's five-year fixed rate is now at 3.49 per cent, and other lenders are indeed following suit.\nTD Bank currently has a special five-year fixed rate of 3.49 per cent. Smaller lenders\u00a0are even lower. Dominion Lending Centres is offering 3.29 per cent locked in for five years,\u00a0while HSBC Canada has a special five year of\u00a03.24 per cent at the moment.\u00a0\nAbout three quarters of Canadian homeowners opt for the security of a fixed rate loans, Tal says, but the trend toward lower rates is happening in variable rate loans, too\u00a0\u2014 albeit for different reasons.\nUnlike fixed rate mortgages which take their cues from the bond market, variable rate mortgages tend to move in conjunction with whatever the Bank of Canada is doing.\nAnd investors are betting that the central bank will\u00a0soon be moving its rate down, not up. Investors in financial instruments known as overnight index swaps are pricing in zero chance of a hike this year, but about a one-in-five chance of a cut by July, and up to a 44 per cent chance by\u00a0September.\nWhite says the variable-rate mortgage market is simply pricing in some of the negative economic indicators of late, including lower inflation and an anemic GDP number that showed Canada's\u00a0economy actually shrank to close out 2018.\n\"There's an increased probability\u00a0they will actually cut to try to fuel economic growth,\" White said, of her expectations for Canada's central bank.\nAnd economists are predicting the same thing.\n\"One of the biggest shifts that occurred in our quarterly March forecast was the removal of any further interest rate hikes from our outlook,\" TD Bank's chief economist\u00a0Beata\u00a0Caranci said in a note on Monday.\u00a0\"We hit the stop button.\"\nVariable rates have not just stopped going up, they've shifted into reverse and gone down in some cases. Rates below three per cent are now common, both at the big banks and at alternative lenders.\nThe spring is always a key time in the mortgage markets. That's because the lion's share of home purchases happen in those months, so lenders try to compete as much as possible on rates to take as big a bite as they can of that business.\nGiven that, the sudden trend towards cheaper lending could well stick around for a bit, White says.\u00a0\n\"Are we still going to be headed for interest rate increases in the next couple of years? Yes,\" she says. \"[But] for the rest of 2019 the prediction is that the variable rate is going to be stable and maybe has a chance of coming down.\"\n"}, {"author": "Robson Fletcher", "title": "Mortgages in arrears in Alberta hit highest rate since 2013", "description": "Rate seen as a 'lagging indicator' of the economy, driven largely by unemployment", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-mortgages-arrears-august-report-from-february-2019-data-1.5246010", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3378660.1565735145!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/foreclosure-sales.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 14, 2019 5:30 AM MT", "2019-08-14T11:30:00.450Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "More and more Albertans are falling behind on their mortgage payments, according to new numbers from the Canadian Bankers Association.\nThe rate of mortgages in arrears has been creeping upwards for the past 10 months on record and reached 0.49 per cent in February, according to the association's latest data.\nThat's the highest it's been since early 2013.\nMeanwhile, in the rest of Canada, the rate of mortgages in arrears has been going down, hitting 0.24 per cent nationwide at last count.\nFreida\u00a0Richer, a licensed insolvency trustee with Grant Thornton in Edmonton, says the data matches what she's been seeing with her clients.\n\"Although we've been on this road of economic recovery now for almost two years, I can tell you that from my discussions with\u00a0a lot of hardworking Albertans, there was a continued sentiment that their households are still struggling and they're simply not able to recover as quickly as they had thought or hoped,\" she said.\nShe said some of the primary reasons people fall behind on their mortgages are job loss, poor money management and family breakups.\nDivorces can be especially\u00a0devastating during a downturn in real estate, she noted, as many Alberta markets have seen in recent years.\n\"If the person left with a property has to sell it, it's a matter of time,\" she said.\n\"Are they able to continue to pay the mortgage payments, in the meantime, while they try to sell the property? And what would they be selling the property for?

That's the lowest range since the summer of 2017, he says, and a big reason why is the bond market.\nUnlike variable rate loans which take their cues from the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, lenders finance fixed-rate loans based on the rates they can get in the bond market. Essentially, they'll borrow money themselves at one rate, loan it out to a borrower at a higher rate\u00a0and make money on that spread.\nSo current rock-bottom interest rates on fixed loans are no coincidence, considering the yield on a five-year Government of Canada bond dipped below 1.3 per cent this month. If a lender can borrow funds for as little as 1.3 per cent then turn around and make money by loaning it out for twice that rate, they have every incentive to keep offering those deals.\n\"The hard cost of funding these loans is going down,\" Laird said. \"And at the same time we are at the tail end of the most competitive market, when lenders fight for [business], so that's when they are willing to thin out their margins a bit to attract volume.\"\nVariable rate loans are also sliding lower, too.\nMost borrowers prefer the peace of mind\u00a0of fixed rate loans, but lenders can tempt borrowers to variable rate loans with even better rates \u2014 even if they're only temporary.\nLaird says typically it takes a spread of about a full percentage point to entice most people to make the leap. Which is why those loans are even less popular than usual because that premium has almost completely vanished.\nHe says the best variable rate loans are about 2.65 per cent at the moment, which is barely better than the fixed rate, for a lot more risk.\nAnyone signing up for that loan today is \"assuming the Bank of Canada is going to be forced to drop their rate once or twice. That would be the only way to justify taking it,\" he said. The bank's benchmark rate is 1.75 per cent.\u00a0\nTrading in investments known as overnight index swaps suggests investors think there's about a 50 per cent chance of a rate cut by the central bank\u00a0this year \u2014 but two would be very unlikely, and never mind any more beyond that.\nLower rates could be good news for those who've already bought, too.\nA recent report by National Bank found that a little more than one out of every six mortgages in Canada is up for renewal this year, and as recently as January the bank was calculating that most of them could expect to be paying between 70 and 90 more basis points on their next loan than they were on their current one. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point, so a jump of 70 basis points would be a loan that went from 3 to 3.7 per cent, for example.)\nBut thanks to the steep slide\u00a0in mortgage rates since the start of the year, most people with loans\u00a0up for renewal now have no need to fear a big jump in their rate when the time comes.\n\"With the recent drop in mortgage rates, those households will be renewing at rates barely above their previous ones,\" National Bank economist Matthieu Arseneau\u00a0said.\nLaird doesn't see anything on the immediate horizon that could derail the era of lower rates, but he does think the federal election in October is worth paying attention to for how it relates to housing.\nHousing policy is bound to come up on the campaign trail, and he expects to hear a lot of talk about changing stress test rules and extending amortization periods in the coming months.\nBut until that happens, Laird's expectations for the mortgage market can be summed up succinctly:\u00a0\"Pretty cheap money.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Royal Bank cuts 5-year fixed mortgage rate, others likely to follow suit", "description": "Biggest bank cuts benchmark rate by 15 basis points", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mortgage-rates-1.4981657", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1310332.1526660967!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hi-mortgage.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 17, 2019 9:13 AM ET", "2019-01-17T20:57:30.546Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada's biggest bank has cut its five-year fixed-term mortgage rate, a move that other banks are likely to try to match in short order.\nRoyal Bank edged the rate on its five-year \"special offer\" mortgage down\u00a0to\u00a0 3.74 per cent, a cut of 0.15 percentage points.\nThough subtle, the move is likely to prompt similar actions by other major Canadian banks in the coming days, and it's actually overdue based on what's happening in the bond market, says\u00a0Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com.\nBanks finance mortgages for consumers by borrowing money from bond investors, and then lending it out to\u00a0mortgage holders at higher rates.\u00a0Those borrowing costs to the bank started falling precipitously in the fall, a development that has yet to filter\u00a0down to customers.\nIn November, a five-year government of Canada bond was yielding just shy of 2.5 per cent.

December and January are the \"deadest\" period for home buying, McLister notes, so RBC could be trying to drum up business while things are slow.\nWhen asked what prompted the rate drop, an RBC spokesperson said a number of factors have impacted the Toronto-based bank's cost of funds.\nRBC says that includes the rate the bank pays in the bond\u00a0market, increasing regulatory costs and market volatility.\nThe impact on consumers will be small, but could grow if it's the start of a trend.\nJames Laird, president of mortgage brokerage Canwise Financial, calculates a $400,000\u00a0mortgage at the old five-year fixed rate of 3.89 per cent would cost a homeowner about $2,080 a month. At the new rate, that monthly\u00a0mortgage payment would drop\u00a0to $2,048 \u2014 $32 a month cheaper or an extra\u00a0$384 per year.\n\"RBC is the largest mortgage lender in Canada, so whenever they move their mortgage rates, we can expect that the other four banks will follow suit,\" Laird said.\nThe trend downward in fixed mortgages\u00a0is even more interesting\u00a0considering what's happening in the variable market, which is more pegged to the Bank of Canada's rate than the bond market.\nBecause variable rate mortgages are\u00a0inching higher.\nRBC nudged the rate for its five-year variable mortgage to 3.55 per cent on Wednesday, up from 3.30 per cent.\n\"The current stable interest rate environment is causing lenders to reduce the discounts being offered on variable rate mortgages,\" Laird said.\n\n"}, {"author": "Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani", "title": "Mortgages from big banks consistently cost Canadians more, says rate comparison site", "description": "LowestRates.ca says the big banks never offer the lowest mortgage rates on the market", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mortgages-big-banks-1.5014184", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3580895.1468628471!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cmhc-risky-markets-20160427.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 12, 2019 3:14 PM ET", "2019-02-12T21:09:30.066Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Mortgage rates from Canada's big banks were consistently more expensive than those offered by smaller lenders last year, according to the latest findings from LowestRates.ca.\nThe financial\u00a0product\u00a0comparison website said the lowest rates offered by the \"Big Six\"\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and National Bank of Canada \u2014 were always more expensive than the lowest rates from smaller lenders.\nJustin Thouin, CEO of LowestRates.ca, said the big banks never offer the lowest posted rates on the market, and Canadians are not spending enough time researching rates before signing their mortgages, which could be costing them thousands\u00a0a year.\n\"We compare prices when we do less costly things, like take a trip or buy a TV, but we don't shop around for rates for homes \u2014 one of the most expensive purchases we'll likely ever make \u2014 despite the fact that the money we can save on a vacation pales in comparison to what we can save on a mortgage,\" Thouin said in a statement.\nUsing RBC's\u00a0announcement last month that it was decreasing its five-year fixed rate mortgage to 3.74 per cent as an example, the site said with the new bank rate, customers would pay $2,560 per month on a $500,000 mortgage, assuming that a down payment of at least 20 per cent was made to buy a home in order to avoid the CMHC\u00a0insurance and a 25-year amortization period.\nBut, if customers in the same scenario got the best available five-year fixed rate mortgage from a smaller lender at 3.23 per cent, the monthly payment would be $2,426, according to LowestRates.ca. That's a difference of $134 a month, and would add up to $40,200 in savings over the course of a 25-year mortgage.\n\"Brokers and smaller lenders often drop their rates first to be more competitive, and banks are slower to implement changes, because they know they own the market,\" Thouin\u00a0said.\u00a0\n\"This will only change when Canadians realize they're being overcharged and begin to shift away from the banks, and that will only happen as we increase awareness about the alternative market.\"\nBanks account\u00a0for nearly 60 per cent of all current home mortgages, according to a report from Mortgage Professionals Canada last month.

The global economy appears to be slowing and rarely do central banks increase rates when an economy is struggling.\nAny slowdown in rate hikes would be welcome news for those holding a mortgage or loan linked to the prime lending rate.\nIf you are considering a fixed rate mortgage, there is good news for you as well.\nThis week, RBC announced a reduction in their five-year fixed mortgage rate. \u00a0Fixed rate mortgages are correlated to bond yields \u2014\u00a0 if yields drop so should mortgage rates. Bond yields have been dropping for a couple months now so it is nice to (finally) see mortgage rates following suit.\nA question that I am often asked is, \"Should I get a variable or a fixed rate mortgage?\"\nI use both.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor my rental property, I prefer a variable mortgage. Not because of the reduced rate, but for the less punitive pre-payment penalty.\nBecause I never know when I'm going to sell my revenue property, I'd rather be in a mortgage that won't punish me too badly if I decide to sell before the end of my contract\nAnd historically, people save more money with a variable mortgage. That said, fixed-term mortgages offer price certainty.\nWhen rates started to increase in 2017, I decided to convert the variable mortgage on my principal residence into a seven-year\u00a0fixed term mortgage. I'm okay paying a little extra for the added peace of mind. I have no intention of selling my home, so I don't have to worry about pre-payment penalties, and I have seven years\u00a0worth of price certainty.\n\nAnother variable to consider when deciding on fixed versus\u00a0variable\u00a0mortgages is the promotions being offered by lenders.\nJust a couple of months ago, it was easy to get a variable mortgage at one per cent below the prime rate.\nThat's a significant discount and if the forecasters are right\u00a0and Canada slows its pace of rate hikes \u2014 or even cuts rates \u2014 having a variable mortgage would have been the best choice.\n\nIf the forecasters are wrong, which they often are, and rates spike then you would have been better off with the price certainty of a fixed term. Unless you can predict the future, which the experts, including myself,\u00a0cannot, it is hard to say which mortgage product is best for you.\nWith that said, it is time for my predictions.\nI would be surprised to see the Bank of Canada raising rates more than once in 2019. It also wouldn't surprise me if there were no, or even a cut in interest rates. It really depends on the extent\u00a0of the slow down in housing and energy, and how these changes affect\u00a0the overall economy.\nRates for fixed-rate mortgages are dropping and there is potential for further reductions, but I wouldn't count on it. Money can flow out of the bond market just as easily as it flowed into it. If that were to happen, bond yields and mortgage rates would rise.\nIf you are unable to decide on the best mortgage for you\u2014hedge your bets and get both. \u00a0\nSay you have a $400,000 mortgage, put $200,000 in a variable and the other $200,000 in a fixed. It is a strategy that has worked for me in the past and is a lot less nerve racking than flipping a coin.\nThis column is part of\u00a0CBC's\u00a0Opinion section.\u00a0For more information about this section, please read\u00a0our\u00a0FAQ.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/rbc-cuts-5-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-gillette-ad-targets-toxic-masculinity-business-panel-1.4985630", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1428941891638", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "CMHC to take more mortgages off banks' books to free up cash for loans amid COVID-19 crisis", "description": "Government had similar program in place during 2009 financial crisis", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cmhc-mortgage-program-1.5510802", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3668539.1467903263!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mortgage-rates-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 26, 2020 11:46 AM ET", "2020-03-26T16:31:10.768Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is expanding the number of insured mortgages it is willing to buy from banks\u00a0to give the banks more freedom to lend out more money to consumers and businesses and keep the economy humming.\nThe taxpayer-funded agency, which backstops the vast majority of Canada's housing market by insuring the loans that finance them, announced earlier this month it was willing to take up to $50 billion worth of loans off of banks' books.\nOn Thursday, the CMHC announced it would expand that mortgage-buying program to $150 billion.\n\"This action will expand the stable funding available to banks and mortgage lenders in order to ensure continued lending to Canadian consumers and businesses,\" the agency said in a statement.\nMoving loans from banks to the CMHC helps the banks' books and allows them to free up cash that they can lend out to consumers and businesses while the COVID-19 pandemic is hitting them hard and threatening the overall economy.\nCanada's big banks have promised interest rate relief for up to six months to Canadian borrowers struggling to make their payments, but the CBC has reported that the fine print of those programs make it so that the deferred interest must be paid back at some point, which makes the loan longer and more expensive.\nCanada's big banks are being flooded by requests for payment relief by borrowers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to the tune of 213,000 requests so far, Bloomberg reported Thursday.\nThe head of the CMHC, Evan Siddall, is asking mortgage holders to not overload the system in order to make sure any relief goes to those who need it most.\nPlease leave rent/mortgage relief to those who need it most.

They raise them when they want to cool down inflation. The Bank of Canada's rate filters down into the economy by impacting rates on things like mortgages and savings accounts at banks.\u00a0\nThe bank noting that its rate is as low as it can realistically go is a direct message to consumers, says James Laird, co-founder of\u00a0Ratehub.ca\u00a0and president of\u00a0CanWise\u00a0Financial mortgage brokerage.\n\"Consumers should not expect their rate to go any lower since the bank has reiterated that they are at their lower bound.\u00a0The position of the bank is to leave the rate unchanged until the economic situation stabilizes.\"\nTD Bank economist Brian DePratto agrees that the bank is saying it can't\u00a0plausibly cut its interest rate any more than it already has.

Or a savings account where it's the bank, not the saver, who collects interest.\nWelcome to the upside-down world of ultra-low and negative interest rates that is taking hold in many parts of the world where economic growth has been sluggish. Now more than a decade old, economists think it could be a feature of the global economy for years to come and change the way people save and invest.\n\"This will mean that we must save more, work longer, and expect less,\" said Olivia Mitchell, an economics professor at the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania.\nThe latest chapter is the drop in interest rates on some bank deposits below zero as central banks, particularly in Europe and Japan, try to support the economy amid uncertainty about trade by making borrowing cheaper to spur spending and investment. Official data released Friday showed that Germany's growth ground to a halt at the end of last year.\nEconomists think there are also longer-term factors causing low rates, such as aging populations in rich countries and high rates of savings in China and other emerging economies.\nLow rates first hit in the wake of the global financial crisis. The U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank slashed rates close to zero. In 2014, the ECB went negative.\nUltra-low rates have helped push up stock markets to record highs, as vanishing returns on safe assets lead to a search for returns elsewhere. Pushing people to invest in riskier assets is part of the stimulus effect central banks are trying to impart. But there are also fears that very low rates can cause markets to bubble up, and crash back down with painful consequences. So far, the dire predictions haven't come true. The current bull market in U.S. stocks turns 11 years old on March 9.\nIn Germany, some banks are now telling companies and others with large amounts of cash that they must pay a rate on large deposits instead of accruing interest. The penalty typically applies to big accounts, such as more than 500,000 euros (about $727,000 Cdn), according to financial website Biallo.de. Banks are doing this because they themselves have to pay a 0.5 per cent\u00a0penalty on deposits they hold at the European Central Bank. If banks can't find a home for depositor money, it winds up in their ECB holdings and results in their being charged.\nSmall depositors like individual consumers are so far not being charged on savings. The idea is politically toxic, especially in Germany.\nBut the low rate environment raises questions about preserving wealth, especially for those trying to save for retirement. German newsmedia are full of stories about \"penalty rates\"and criticism of the European Central Bank for, as they put it, expropriating savers.\nGerhard Michel, a financial coach in Duesseldorf, says people need to be aware that inflation eats away at savings even in more normal times, though people may be less aware of it when rates are above zero.\n\"If you look at it historically, people with savings accounts never had any kind of interesting performance,\" he said. \"The inflation rate ruins any returns on the government bond market or the savings market - and it has always been that way historically. What shocks people now is that people must say the word zero, or even negative, interest.\"\nMichel, who is 53, teaches his coachees about value investing, a more time-consuming approach that analyzes financial statements to look for companies the market may be underestimating.\nHis approach with his own money: \"I will buy stocks until the end of my days.\"\nFour trillion euros worth of government bonds of the 19 countries that use the euro now yield less than zero. Trillions more in Japanese and other government bonds trade below zero around the world. Even Greece, which defaulted on government bonds in 2012 and carries the highest debt load in Europe, was able to sell three-month notes at a negative rate.\nWhy, in fact, would anyone pay for the privilege of buying a bond?\nOne way of viewing the phenomenon is that the investor is paying for the safety of the investment. Or buyers may hope to sell the bond at a profit. That is possible if rates go even lower - as some analysts think they will.\nOn the positive side of the ledger, low or negative interest rates can make it easier for companies and consumers to borrow, stimulating economic activity. The European Central Bank says its policies created 11 million new jobs since 2013. In the U.S., home sales have picked up as mortgage rates have fallen to 3.7 per cent.\nNow, even some home buyers can get into the negative rates game.\nThe Danish bank is unusual in offering the negative rate, but mortgage rates for credit-worthy borrowers are also not far above zero in Germany. For instance, a 10-year mortgage with a large down payment can carry interest of only 0.7 per cent.\nIt's worth noting that real interest rates \u2014\u00a0in other words, when official and market rates are below the rate of inflation \u2014\u00a0have been negative at several points in history, such as in the 1970s, when inflation in the developed world ran into double digits.\nWhat's unusual today is that the actual quoted rates are below zero and that rates have been low for so long.\nInterest rates are always a tradeoff, says economist Adalbert Winkler, professor of international and development finance at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. \"Low real rates favour borrowers like mortgage holders at the expense of savers, and when rates rise it's the other way around.\"\n\"This is always the case when you have expansionary monetary policy and it doesn't make sense to deny that,\" he said.\nLow rates make it easier for governments to borrow and build infrastructure that can spur economic growth, although political pressures have meant that Europe's biggest economy, Germany, prefers to balance its budget than borrow. Other governments, such as Italy, are constrained by high debt.\nNegative rates have not yet appeared in the United States, but they could if the economy stumbles into recession, some economists say. The Federal Reserve would almost certainly cut the short-term rate to nearly zero, as it did for seven years beginning in the Great Recession.\nSince the U.S. 10-year yield is already very low by historical standards, at 1.6 per cent, it wouldn't take much to push it below zero, said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics. The Fed may try to prevent it from happening, possibly by selling Treasuries, but it's not clear they would succeed.\n\"We're not immune to it,\" he said. \"That's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-type world that we don't want to go into.\"\nSo far, Federal Reserve officials have downplayed the potential for negative rates in the U.S.\n\"That's not a tool we're looking at,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday during a congressional hearing. He cited research that negative rates can hurt banks' profits and restrain their willingness to lend.\nThe German Economic Institute in Cologne studied multiple factors believed to cause low rates and concluded it's not just due to central banks but represents a longer-term trend. So low or negative rates could be around for years.\nWith that in mind, Mitchell, the professor, persuaded her two daughters to save 18 per cent of their salaries when they found their first jobs.\n\"We're in a very different capital market regime now than in the last 30 years,\" she said.\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Ottawa unveils new mortgage stress test rules that will make it easier to pass", "description": "New rules will be in force as of April", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mortgage-stress-test-1.5467330", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5467396.1582053724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mortgage-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 18, 2020 3:04 PM ET", "2020-02-20T19:59:49.770Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Starting in April, the government will change the rules that cover mortgage lending in a way that should, in the short term at least, make it easier to qualify for a loan to buy a home.\nThe Department of Finance says that as of April 6, the so-called \"stress test\" for mortgages will be calculated in a new way.\nThe stress test was implemented in January 2018 as a way to let some of the speculation out of the housing market at the time. It does\u00a0so by making sure borrowers will\u00a0be able to pay down their debts even if rates move\u00a0higher. A would-be borrower is tested against his or her\u00a0ability to pay down the loan at a higher interest rate,\u00a0and if the borrower fails\u00a0the test, a lender isn't allowed to loan them money.\nThe rules had the effect of cooling the market, especially for first time buyers, which brought down prices in many markets because it shrank the pool of buyers.\nAt the time it was brought in, the benchmark was set at whatever the five-year posted rate at Canada's big banks is, which is currently at 5.19 per cent. But under new rules announced on Tuesday and set to be implemented in April, the new bar will be \"the weekly median five-year fixed insured mortgage rate from mortgage insurance applications, plus two\u00a0per cent.\"\n\"This will ensure that people only take on mortgages that are appropriate for the situation, but it does mean the changes in the stress test will be there if the average\u00a0\u2026\u00a0rates provided by the banks actually goes down or up,\" Finance Minister Bill Morneau said of the changes. \"It will actually adjust appropriately to dynamic market conditions.\"\nThe change tinkers with one of the major criticisms of the stress test in the first place, which was that the bar was set arbitrarily high. And non-bank lenders don't like that the\u00a0stress test rules give the big banks even more control over the market than they already had. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, says the banks would always drag their feet in changing their posted rates, no matter what was happening in the market, \"because it's the rate they use in calculating the penalty for breaking a mortgage,\" she said in an interview Tuesday. \"This takes the big banks out of it.\"\nJames Laird, co-founder of rate comparison website Ratehub.ca, says the industry will welcome anything that gives the big banks less power. \"The industry also did not like how the stress test rate didn't ebb and flow with real rates\u00a0lowering or increasing,\" he said in an interview.\nPosted rates at Canada's big banks are often much higher than rates being offered in the real world\u00a0and that gap has widened recently. It's not hard right now to find a fixed-rate mortgage for far less than three per cent, for example, despite the fact that four of Canada's five biggest banks have a posted rate of 5.19 per cent. (The fifth, TD, lowered its rate to 4.99 two weeks ago. Prior to that it was 5.34 per cent.)\nBen Gully, the assistant superintendent at banking regulator the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, said\u00a0in a\u00a0speech at the end of January\u00a0that the watchdog\u00a0was aware that the gap was\u00a0a problem. \"The difference between the average contract rate and the benchmark has been widening more recently, suggesting that the benchmark is less responsive to market changes than when it was first proposed,\" Gully said.\u00a0\n\"We are reviewing this aspect of our qualifying rate, as the posted rate is not playing the role that we intended.\"\nTuesday's rule changes are seemingly a result of that review and will have the effect of thinning out that gap \u2014 at least for now.\u00a0That should make it easier to pass the stress test, and therefore easier to buy a home. Theoretically, that should help bump up prices because\u00a0more people will be qualified to buy.\u00a0\nA quick look at the numbers shows how.\nAccording to Ratehub.ca, the average rate for a five-year fixed term mortgage is currently\u00a02.89\u00a0per cent. Under current rules, a borrower approved for that loan would nonetheless have their finances tested at the five-year posted rate of 5.19 per cent. If they don't pass the test, they can't get the loan.\nBut under the new rules, that same borrower would be tested at 4.89\u00a0per cent \u2014 a combination of their actual mortgage rate, plus two per cent.\u00a0That's a difference of 30\u00a0basis points and though small it can add up to thousands more in purchasing power.\nLaird calculates that under the old rules, a buyer with an annual income of $100,000 with a 10 per cent\u00a0down payment would have qualified for a mortgage at 2.89 per cent and could buy a home valued at $511,424 under today's stress test.\u00a0Under the new rules, that same buyer can now afford $526,632 \u2014 that's more than $15,000 more purchasing power.\n\"It's going to be a welcome change for the mortgage industry and consumers,\" Laird\u00a0said.\nCooper agrees with that assessment. \"All other things equal, it certainly boosts buying power,\" she said. \"And it's psychologically very positive.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jamie Malbeuf", "title": "Foreclosure rate steadily increasing in Fort McMurray", "description": "'There's a lot of homeowners that are very much underwater' as house prices drop", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/fort-mcmurray-foreclosure-homes-1.5405220", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2001778.1513610921!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/w-foreclosure-cp-00072702.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 05, 2020 8:00 AM MT", "2020-01-05T16:54:03.278Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Fort McMurray saw about eight times more foreclosures on homes in 2019 than in 2015, new numbers from the province show.\nIn the 2015-16 fiscal year, there were 26 foreclosure statements of claim in Alberta's oilsands capital; in 2018-19, there were 220, according to\u00a0data from Alberta Justice and Solicitor General.

As of Dec. 11, 2019,\u00a0177 foreclosed homes were sold.\nAndrew Weir, realtor and director with the Fort McMurray Real Estate Board, said the number of foreclosures on the market at any one time over the last few years has been stable at\u00a0around 100 units.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The market is a lot more balanced now than it was, and there's a lot less inventory out there,\" Weir said.\u00a0\n\"Prices have fallen a lot, to the point where we are more in line with communities outside, throughout the rest of Alberta,\" he said.\nThose\u00a0prices are now more affordable for potential homeowners, he added.
