And in some cases, they're actually rising.\n\"Usually\u00a0when the Bank of Canada cuts rates like they have, by 1.5 percentage points in a month, you can expect all rates to fall,\" said\u00a0James Laird, president of mortgage brokerage CanWise Financial and\u00a0co-founder of\u00a0Ratehub.ca.\n\"At first they did ...\u00a0but a week and a half ago, we started to see a shift [and] now we are seeing our\u00a0lenders increase rates. Every two days, we get a different lender saying we are going up by point one, point two.\"\nMortgage rates tend to move up and down based on a number of factors, but one of the main ones is the costs borne by the lenders themselves.\nPeople tend to think that when someone walks into a bank to ask for a home loan, if they are approved, the bank just takes the cash out of some safe at the back, hands it over to the borrower and charges them interest over time to make a profit.\nBut, in fact, banks don't keep that much money just lying around either \u2014\u00a0they typically borrow it themselves\u00a0and make money on the spread between how much they're charged for it\u00a0and how much they turn around and charge the borrower for it.\nThe cost of financing a variable rate loan is strongly influenced by the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, because banks tend to set their own prime lending rates based on whatever the central bank's rate is.\nThe bank has cut that rate by 150 basis points \u2014 1.5 percentage points \u2014\u00a0in the past month\u00a0to try to make it as easy and cheap as possible for people to borrow, spend and invest to stimulate the economy that has been waylaid by COVID-19.\nA few short weeks ago, it wasn't hard to find a variable rate mortgage for something around prime minus one \u2014 a full percentage point below whatever a bank's prime lending rate was at the time.\nBut a funny thing has happened since then. Prime lending rates have gone down more or less in lockstep with the Bank of Canada's moves, but those discount rates for mortgages have evaporated.\n\"About half of the savings have been passed along and half kept by banks for a higher margin,\" Laird said.\nThe reason they're doing that is the same as why\u00a0stock markets plunged\u00a0and governments rushed to\u00a0implement lockdowns on millions of people: fear.\n\"Lenders are saying, 'Hold on a second,'\" Laird said. \"If a million people are going to lose their jobs and unemployment is going to rise, maybe we should build in a bit of a risk premium to our\u00a0pricing to account for possible defaults for this new money we are lending.\"\nWhen the economic outlook was more clear, banks were happy to cut rates as low as possible to try to gobble up market share. But now, they're saying \"We better earn a bit more of a spread on this money because these things might default at a higher rate than we're used to,\" Laird said.\nThe impact isn't dramatic. Laird says a few weeks ago, the best mortgage rates were something in the range of between two and 2.5 per cent. Today, they're between 2.5 and three per cent because, as he puts it, \"they are demanding a higher risk premium than what they typically do.\"\nOthers aren't quite so diplomatic.\n\"It's total garbage,\" Marcus Tzaferis with mortage brokerage Cannect said. \"It's complete profit taking.\"\nWhile banks borrow at a rate slightly above that government rate,\u00a0Tzaferis says \"the spread between their cost of borrowing and some of their five-year fixed mortgage rates is still around 250 points, which is highly profitable for them.\"\nFixed-rate loans aren't pegged to the Bank of Canada's rate and are instead more influenced by the bond market. And there, too, Tzaferis says what's happening in the market doesn't reflect what's happening behind the scenes.\nLenders finance fixed-rate loans on the bond market, where yields have fallen to record lows in the current COVID-19 crisis. The yield on a five-year government of Canada bond bottomed out at around 0.37 per cent this month and is currently hovering just over 0.5 per cent.\u00a0\nThough banks must pay a credit spread on bond yield and that may be widening, Tzaferis says they are also widening their profit margins. Most fixed-rate mortgages are currently going for around three per cent, he points out.\nThe difference for borrowers adds up fast. Laird calculates that a theoretical buyer who put down a 10 per cent deposit on a house costing $500,000 before this crisis would likely have been able to get a mortgage rate of 2.6 per cent, which would make their payment $2,102 a month.\nIf all three rate cuts since then were to be fully factored into that loan, that borrower's monthly payment would fall\u00a0as low as $1,769 a month\u00a0\u2014 that's\u00a0$333 per month or $3,996 per year on their mortgage payments, compared to what they were paying less than a month ago.\nThe overwhelming majority of first-time buyers opt for fixed-rate loans because they like the security of knowing that their monthly payment is guaranteed to not increase.\u00a0The banks know this, Tzaferis says, and it could soon have a heavy cost for borrowers.\n\"They're using this as an opportunity to lock people into big fat juicy\u00a0and profitable five-year mortgages,\" he said. \"When their rates drop those consumers are going to have massive penalties to break them ...\u00a0tens of thousands of dollars.\"\n\"It's absolutely insanity,\" Tzaferis\u00a0said. \"This is a totally manufactured crisis to profit.\"\nLaird and Tzferis both say that the current situation can't last forever. Economists are already predicting that the COVID-19 recession is likely to be incredibly sharp, but it's anyone's guess\u00a0how long it will go on for.\nLaird says the best sign that things are getting back to normal will be when the big banks start to act in a way that seems paradoxical.\nBanks are raising their rates right now because they feel just as uncertain about the future as Canadians do. Once that cloud lifts, they'll want to start lowering rates again, and \"they won't build in that uncertainty premium like they are now,\" said Laird.\n\"As confidence returns, you'll see rates fall.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Canadian mortgage rates are falling as bond yields slide lower", "description": "Yield on 5-year government debt has dipped below 1.5%, lowest since 2017", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mortgage-rates-1.5070332", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5070772.1553541567!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mortgage-rates.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 26, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-03-26T19:41:11.873Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "What's bad news for some is good news for others, and Canadian mortgage-holders are the unexpected beneficiaries of some of the gloom that's hovering over Canada's economy.\nFixed mortgage rates have been falling precipitously in recent weeks, as the cost of financing those loans has gotten cheaper. Banks and other lenders get the money that they loan out in mortgages by borrowing it themselves on the bond market, and the yields on five-year bonds have been falling since late\u00a02018.\nA five-year Government of Canada bond was yielding just 1.45\u00a0per cent on Monday. That's the first time the figure has been below 1.5 per cent since the summer of 2017.\u00a0\nLast week, the yield curve on long-term lending versus short-term inverted, a rare event that has an uncanny knack for predicting recessions. (For a longer explanation on what an inverted yield curve means, read this.)\n\"There's all kinds of technical forces, and it is not necessarily the case that tomorrow we'll have a recession,\"\u00a0CIBC economist Benjamin Tal\u00a0said in an interview.\u00a0\n\"However, the\u00a0yield curve\u00a0slowing down is a clear signal \u2026 we have to listen to. We have a conflict between the stock market, which is more optimistic, and\u00a0the bond market which is more pessimistic.\"\nPut simply, bond yields are heading lower largely because investors think the prospects for the economy are looking dim, so they expect interest rates to start moving lower.\nLower bond yields are\u00a0generally\u00a0\"not a good sign from an\u00a0economic standpoint,\" says Janine White, vice-president of rate comparison website,\u00a0Ratesupermarket.ca, \"but it's great for mortgage borrowers.\"\nThat's because cheaper financing costs are allowing\u00a0the banks to cut their mortgage rates to try to entice borrowers. CBC News reported in January that Royal Bank cut its five-year posted rate to 3.74 per cent, a move that rivals were expected to match.\nRoyal Bank has since cut that rate two more times, first by 10 basis points on March 1 and then by another 15 basis points on March 13. The bank's five-year fixed rate is now at 3.49 per cent, and other lenders are indeed following suit.\nTD Bank currently has a special five-year fixed rate of 3.49 per cent. Smaller lenders\u00a0are even lower. Dominion Lending Centres is offering 3.29 per cent locked in for five years,\u00a0while HSBC Canada has a special five year of\u00a03.24 per cent at the moment.\u00a0\nAbout three quarters of Canadian homeowners opt for the security of a fixed rate loans, Tal says, but the trend toward lower rates is happening in variable rate loans, too\u00a0\u2014 albeit for different reasons.\nUnlike fixed rate mortgages which take their cues from the bond market, variable rate mortgages tend to move in conjunction with whatever the Bank of Canada is doing.\nAnd investors are betting that the central bank will\u00a0soon be moving its rate down, not up. Investors in financial instruments known as overnight index swaps are pricing in zero chance of a hike this year, but about a one-in-five chance of a cut by July, and up to a 44 per cent chance by\u00a0September.\nWhite says the variable-rate mortgage market is simply pricing in some of the negative economic indicators of late, including lower inflation and an anemic GDP number that showed Canada's\u00a0economy actually shrank to close out 2018.\n\"There's an increased probability\u00a0they will actually cut to try to fuel economic growth,\" White said, of her expectations for Canada's central bank.\nAnd economists are predicting the same thing.\n\"One of the biggest shifts that occurred in our quarterly March forecast was the removal of any further interest rate hikes from our outlook,\" TD Bank's chief economist\u00a0Beata\u00a0Caranci said in a note on Monday.\u00a0\"We hit the stop button.\"\nVariable rates have not just stopped going up, they've shifted into reverse and gone down in some cases. Rates below three per cent are now common, both at the big banks and at alternative lenders.\nThe spring is always a key time in the mortgage markets. That's because the lion's share of home purchases happen in those months, so lenders try to compete as much as possible on rates to take as big a bite as they can of that business.\nGiven that, the sudden trend towards cheaper lending could well stick around for a bit, White says.\u00a0\n\"Are we still going to be headed for interest rate increases in the next couple of years? Yes,\" she says. \"[But] for the rest of 2019 the prediction is that the variable rate is going to be stable and maybe has a chance of coming down.\"\n"}, {"author": "Robson Fletcher", "title": "Mortgages in arrears in Alberta hit highest rate since 2013", "description": "Rate seen as a 'lagging indicator' of the economy, driven largely by unemployment", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-mortgages-arrears-august-report-from-february-2019-data-1.5246010", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3378660.1565735145!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/foreclosure-sales.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 14, 2019 5:30 AM MT", "2019-08-14T11:30:00.450Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "More and more Albertans are falling behind on their mortgage payments, according to new numbers from the Canadian Bankers Association.\nThe rate of mortgages in arrears has been creeping upwards for the past 10 months on record and reached 0.49 per cent in February, according to the association's latest data.\nThat's the highest it's been since early 2013.\nMeanwhile, in the rest of Canada, the rate of mortgages in arrears has been going down, hitting 0.24 per cent nationwide at last count.\nFreida\u00a0Richer, a licensed insolvency trustee with Grant Thornton in Edmonton, says the data matches what she's been seeing with her clients.\n\"Although we've been on this road of economic recovery now for almost two years, I can tell you that from my discussions with\u00a0a lot of hardworking Albertans, there was a continued sentiment that their households are still struggling and they're simply not able to recover as quickly as they had thought or hoped,\" she said.\nShe said some of the primary reasons people fall behind on their mortgages are job loss, poor money management and family breakups.\nDivorces can be especially\u00a0devastating during a downturn in real estate, she noted, as many Alberta markets have seen in recent years.\n\"If the person left with a property has to sell it, it's a matter of time,\" she said.\n\"Are they able to continue to pay the mortgage payments, in the meantime, while they try to sell the property? And what would they be selling the property for?

That's the lowest range since the summer of 2017, he says, and a big reason why is the bond market.\nUnlike variable rate loans which take their cues from the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, lenders finance fixed-rate loans based on the rates they can get in the bond market. Essentially, they'll borrow money themselves at one rate, loan it out to a borrower at a higher rate\u00a0and make money on that spread.\nSo current rock-bottom interest rates on fixed loans are no coincidence, considering the yield on a five-year Government of Canada bond dipped below 1.3 per cent this month. If a lender can borrow funds for as little as 1.3 per cent then turn around and make money by loaning it out for twice that rate, they have every incentive to keep offering those deals.\n\"The hard cost of funding these loans is going down,\" Laird said. \"And at the same time we are at the tail end of the most competitive market, when lenders fight for [business], so that's when they are willing to thin out their margins a bit to attract volume.\"\nVariable rate loans are also sliding lower, too.\nMost borrowers prefer the peace of mind\u00a0of fixed rate loans, but lenders can tempt borrowers to variable rate loans with even better rates \u2014 even if they're only temporary.\nLaird says typically it takes a spread of about a full percentage point to entice most people to make the leap. Which is why those loans are even less popular than usual because that premium has almost completely vanished.\nHe says the best variable rate loans are about 2.65 per cent at the moment, which is barely better than the fixed rate, for a lot more risk.\nAnyone signing up for that loan today is \"assuming the Bank of Canada is going to be forced to drop their rate once or twice. That would be the only way to justify taking it,\" he said. The bank's benchmark rate is 1.75 per cent.\u00a0\nTrading in investments known as overnight index swaps suggests investors think there's about a 50 per cent chance of a rate cut by the central bank\u00a0this year \u2014 but two would be very unlikely, and never mind any more beyond that.\nLower rates could be good news for those who've already bought, too.\nA recent report by National Bank found that a little more than one out of every six mortgages in Canada is up for renewal this year, and as recently as January the bank was calculating that most of them could expect to be paying between 70 and 90 more basis points on their next loan than they were on their current one. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point, so a jump of 70 basis points would be a loan that went from 3 to 3.7 per cent, for example.)\nBut thanks to the steep slide\u00a0in mortgage rates since the start of the year, most people with loans\u00a0up for renewal now have no need to fear a big jump in their rate when the time comes.\n\"With the recent drop in mortgage rates, those households will be renewing at rates barely above their previous ones,\" National Bank economist Matthieu Arseneau\u00a0said.\nLaird doesn't see anything on the immediate horizon that could derail the era of lower rates, but he does think the federal election in October is worth paying attention to for how it relates to housing.\nHousing policy is bound to come up on the campaign trail, and he expects to hear a lot of talk about changing stress test rules and extending amortization periods in the coming months.\nBut until that happens, Laird's expectations for the mortgage market can be summed up succinctly:\u00a0\"Pretty cheap money.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Royal Bank cuts 5-year fixed mortgage rate, others likely to follow suit", "description": "Biggest bank cuts benchmark rate by 15 basis points", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mortgage-rates-1.4981657", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1310332.1526660967!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hi-mortgage.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 17, 2019 9:13 AM ET", "2019-01-17T20:57:30.546Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada's biggest bank has cut its five-year fixed-term mortgage rate, a move that other banks are likely to try to match in short order.\nRoyal Bank edged the rate on its five-year \"special offer\" mortgage down\u00a0to\u00a0 3.74 per cent, a cut of 0.15 percentage points.\nThough subtle, the move is likely to prompt similar actions by other major Canadian banks in the coming days, and it's actually overdue based on what's happening in the bond market, says\u00a0Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com.\nBanks finance mortgages for consumers by borrowing money from bond investors, and then lending it out to\u00a0mortgage holders at higher rates.\u00a0Those borrowing costs to the bank started falling precipitously in the fall, a development that has yet to filter\u00a0down to customers.\nIn November, a five-year government of Canada bond was yielding just shy of 2.5 per cent.

I have no intention of selling my home, so I don't have to worry about pre-payment penalties, and I have seven years\u00a0worth of price certainty.\n\nAnother variable to consider when deciding on fixed versus\u00a0variable\u00a0mortgages is the promotions being offered by lenders.\nJust a couple of months ago, it was easy to get a variable mortgage at one per cent below the prime rate.\nThat's a significant discount and if the forecasters are right\u00a0and Canada slows its pace of rate hikes \u2014 or even cuts rates \u2014 having a variable mortgage would have been the best choice.\n\nIf the forecasters are wrong, which they often are, and rates spike then you would have been better off with the price certainty of a fixed term. Unless you can predict the future, which the experts, including myself,\u00a0cannot, it is hard to say which mortgage product is best for you.\nWith that said, it is time for my predictions.\nI would be surprised to see the Bank of Canada raising rates more than once in 2019. It also wouldn't surprise me if there were no, or even a cut in interest rates. It really depends on the extent\u00a0of the slow down in housing and energy, and how these changes affect\u00a0the overall economy.\nRates for fixed-rate mortgages are dropping and there is potential for further reductions, but I wouldn't count on it. Money can flow out of the bond market just as easily as it flowed into it. If that were to happen, bond yields and mortgage rates would rise.\nIf you are unable to decide on the best mortgage for you\u2014hedge your bets and get both. \u00a0\nSay you have a $400,000 mortgage, put $200,000 in a variable and the other $200,000 in a fixed. It is a strategy that has worked for me in the past and is a lot less nerve racking than flipping a coin.\nThis column is part of\u00a0CBC's\u00a0Opinion section.\u00a0For more information about this section, please read\u00a0our\u00a0FAQ.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/rbc-cuts-5-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-gillette-ad-targets-toxic-masculinity-business-panel-1.4985630", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1428941891638", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}]
