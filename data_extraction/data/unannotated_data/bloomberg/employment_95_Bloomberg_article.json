Financial aid for low-income Canadians Bonny in Portage La Prairie, Man.: I was on social assistance until April 2020. I then started to receive my Canada Pension Plan Disability (CPPD) at the end of April 2020. Is there any financial aid for people who are only on CPPD? Payments are less than $1,000 after taxes are deducted. This is my only source of income. I can\u2019t find any type of assistance for those on a low income. (May 3, 2020) Chantel Chapman, founder of What The Finances: Thank you so much for your question and I'm really sorry that you\u2019re experiencing financial difficulty. So you\u2019re allowed to be on disability and apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) provided that you stopped working due to COVID-19 specifically. If you were not working in advance of this pandemic and there\u2019s no obvious loss of income, that would impact your eligibility. There\u2019s also another layer of eligibility, and this is that you\u2019ve had to have made a minimum of $5,000 in the last 12 months from employment or self-employment income. So unfortunately based on this scenario that you described and the information that you provided, it seems that you are not fitting the eligibility criteria for CERB. I would recommend contacting the department that handles your disability payments and having a discussion with them about your income amount if this is not a sufficient amount to meet your bare needs. Good luck with everything. (May 7, 2020) Looking for work after maternity leave Tinu from Vancouver: I was previously working a maternity coverage position last year (one-year contract) and I had to go on maternity leave before the end of the contract. My leave just ended on April 11 and I am unable to find another job due to COVID-19. Do you think I might be eligible for CERB? Thanks for your help. (May 7, 2020) Peter Papadakis, principal of financial planning and tax advisory services at Kerr Financial Consultants: To qualify for the CERB, you must reside in Canada, be at least 15 years old, have stopped working because of reasons related to COVID-19, had income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of your application, and have not quit your job voluntarily. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) states if you cannot return to work due to COVID-19 following your maternity or parental leave, you would be considered to have stopped working due to COVID-19 under the CERB program. Accordingly, you would qualify for the CERB provided you have employment insurance (EI) maternity or parental income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of your application. (May 8, 2020) Will a top-up from work impact CERB? Bethany in Edmonton: I have received a top-up from my work and it was sent as employment income. I am going to have to report it on my next update. It was under $100. I am on CERB via EI. I am confused, as I have heard mixed messages in regards to top ups to CERB and EI; that if you are on CERB via EI you can't earn any money, but if you are on CERB with the CRA, you can earn up to $1,000. Am I going to lose my CERB when I report it? (May 4, 2020) Christine Ibbotson, financial advisor and author of Don't Panic: How to Manage Your Finances - And Financial Anxieties - Before and After Coronavirus: Thank you so much for your question. I know it is a little confusing when it comes to the wording with the government benefits. The $100 bonus income will not affect your CERB benefit when you report it, nor will you lose the benefit. The exact wording from the Canadian government benefit plan is \"You cannot have earned more than $1,000 in employment and/or self-employment income for the entire four-week benefit period of your new claim.\" Since it is only an extra $100 this will not affect your benefit. (May 8, 2020) Qualifying for CEBA Ira in (location unknown): I have a small and medium-sized business (SME). In 2019 I paid $15,000 in wages for permanent employees (I issued T4s) and $15,000 for contract work (I did not issue any T4s, just had a contract signed). Does this count as $30,000 employment wages to apply for the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA)? (May 2, 2020) Barry Choi, personal finance blogger for Moneywehave.com: I wasn't able to find a definite answer on the government of Canada website, but from what I understand, income paid to both employees and contractors would count towards the minimum threshold amount of $20,000 to qualify for the CEBA.\u00a0 How is the stock market climbing in this environment? Paul in Dead Mans Flats, Alba.: With the massive job losses globally, interest rates almost in negative territory, deficits in the stratosphere, dividends being slashed, most small business on life support, most large businesses looking for bailouts, how is it possible for the stock markets to be climbing? I understand liquidity, but there is so much debt and the outlook is so grim. There seems to be this massive disconnect between the markets and reality. (April 30, 2020) Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets: Stock markets do not necessarily reflect the state of the economy; rather, they present themselves as an indicator of where the economy is going. In the current case, uncertainties surrounding coronavirus and the significant economic impact rapidly led the market to a bottom on March 23. The sharp rebound since reflects a number of long-term factors. One, corporate fundamentals are intact and have not changed from three months ago. While consumption and profits will drop in the near term, the expectation is that earnings will grow even as early as the second half of\u30002020. Two, there is unprecedented support from the government in the form of liquidity and low interest rates, which assure investors that the government will continue to prop up the economy. Three, we note there is a clear winner of this crisis, namely technology and communication services stocks that have benefited from the dislocation and are expected to be long-term performers. (May 8, 2020) Financial aid for landlords Eddie in Montreal: I am a landlord of a few triplexes which is a mix of two residential apartments and one commercial business. Will I be qualified for Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA)? My understanding from Trudeau is that the commercial rent assist will only apply to landlords that have a mortgage on their property. This is not fair and it penalizes landlords like me, as some of my properties do not have any mortgages. This is my only main income.\u3000(April 27, 2020) Rob McLister, founder of RateSpy.com: CECRA provides forgivable loans to eligible commercial property owners who waive 75 per cent of their small business tenants\u2019 rent for three months which can apply retroactively to April and May rent.\u00a0 The government pays 50 per cent of the rent, the landlord pays 25 per cent and tenant pays 25 per cent. Landlords must agree not to evict the tenants during the term of the agreement or ask tenants to repay the rent abatement later. CECRA is expected to launch in mid-May, has an August 31, 2020 application deadline and applies to mixed use properties as well (i.e. those with commercial and residential units). The problem is, CECRA requires you to have a mortgage loan secured by the commercial property, says program administrator CMHC. So, you would not qualify as of today. But there\u2019s cause for hope. The government is aware of this problem and CMHC says: \"For those property owners who do not have a mortgage, an alternative mechanism will be implemented\" with details provided \"in the near future.\" (May 11, 2020) To have your personal finance question answered an industry professional, send an email to askbnnbloomberg@bellmedia.ca.

Analysts David Mericle and Ronnie Walker estimate that the unemployment rate will peak at 25 per cent, up from a previous forecast of 15 per cent, as \u201cmore workers will lose their jobs and a larger share of them will be classi\ufb01ed as unemployed,\u201d according to a research note late Tuesday. The rate would then remain near 10 per cent\u00a0at year-end, near the highs of the last recession, they wrote. Goldman Sachs revised the figures following last week\u2019s monthly jobs report showing a record contraction in payrolls in April and a 14.7 per cent\u00a0unemployment rate, the highest since the Great Depression era. A jobless rate of 25 per cent\u00a0would be in line with estimates of the peak during the Depression. Despite expectations for a bigger hit to the labor market, the analysts see relief in sight for the world\u2019s largest economy, as some indicators point to a slow resumption of activity and companies are starting to ease back to business. Reopening still presents one of the largest risks, though, with second waves of infections possible along with a renewed tightening of restrictions, they said. The new forecast also includes a deeper hit to quarterly gross domestic product, with an annualized second-quarter decline of 39 per cent\u00a0instead of 34 per cent. But the recovery is also seen as faster than before with a 29 per cent\u00a0gain in the third quarter, suggesting a more \u201cV-shaped\u201d or immediate recovery path for the economy.

Meanwhile, although Trump has said he\u2019s in no rush to enact another round of economic stimulus, the economic team said informal discussions are under way with members of Congress and others. The April U.S. jobless rate, released Friday, tripled to 14.7 per cent, the highest since the 1930s. And it\u2019s only set to worsen in May as job cuts spread further into white-collar work. Unemployment may peak \u201cnorth of\u201d 20 per cent\u00a0in May or June before the economy starts to come back from coronavirus-related shutdowns in the second half of 2020, White House adviser Kevin Hassett said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace that Nation.\u201d The estimate was \u201cnot science as much as arithmetic,\u201d based on the large numbers of people filing initial unemployment claims at the moment, said Hassett, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers who returned to the White House to consult on virus-related matters. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin conceded on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the real unemployment rate could already be closer to 25 per cent, based on seven\u00a0million additional workers who have lost jobs since the April monthly figures were compiled, and those who\u2019ve stopped looking for work. Not Structural \u201cAren\u2019t we talking close to 25 per cent\u00a0at this point?\u201d Fox correspondent Chris Wallace asked the Treasury chief.\n\r\n\u201cChris, we could be,\u201d Mnuchin responded. \u201cThe reported numbers are probably going to get worse before they get better.\u201d Mnuchin and Hassett stressed that the jobs market collapse had come as a result of the deliberate shutdown of the U.S. economy to slow the spread of the coronavirus, not because of structural factors. White House economic director Larry Kudlow said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that a \u201cglimmer of\u00a0hope\u201d in the jobs figures was that about 80% of those tossed out of work were on furloughs or temporary\u00a0layoffs. Still, May would bring \u201cvery difficult numbers,\u201d he said. Hassett said the Trump administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve have \u201cbuilt a bridge to the other side\u201d of the Covid-19 pandemic with\u00a0up to\u00a0$9 trillion in economic stimulus programs so far, he said. \u2018More Bridge\u2019 \u201cRight now we\u2019ve bought some time,\u201d he said. Still, \u201cNobody knows for sure if it\u2019s going to work,\u201d he said. The administration is preparing for either scenario \u2014\u00a0that \u201cmore bridge\u201d will be needed, or that the economy will start to recover more quickly, he said. Trump declared Friday he\u2019s in \u201cno rush\u201d to pursue more stimulus measures, just hours after the Labor Department reported an unprecedented 20 million jobs were lost in April. The contours and contents of a new economic aid package remain unclear and are expected to be subject to more partisan efforts than the measures enacted so far. Democrats, for example, want to send aid to struggling states, which Trump and many Republicans don\u2019t. \u201cIf we go to a Phase 4 deal, I think President Trump has signaled that while he doesn\u2019t want to bail out the states,\u201d Hassett said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s willing to help cover some of the unexpected Covid expenses that might have come their way.\u201d Talks With Lawmakers \u201cRight now, the key is to watch the data and to make sure that the next move is as smart as the previous three,\u201d Hassett said. Kudlow said he and Hassett had a conference call with with 50 House members, Democrat and Republican, on Friday and plan a similar call Monday with senators from both parties. \u201cWe\u2019re collecting ideas for next steps, which will be data driven,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cWe are talking; it\u2019s informal at this stage.\u201d Mnuchin also said he was in discussions with lawmakers of both parties and that he and Trump were also \u201chaving conversations with outside people, with business.\u201d \u201cWe just want to make sure that before we jump back in and spend another few trillion of taxpayers\u2019 money, that we do it carefully,\u201d Mnuchin said. --With assistance from\u00a0Tony Czuczka"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": null, "title": "Home Economics: Trudeau extends wage subsidy as two million jobs vanish", "description": "Canada sees record job drop in April amid virus shutdown\r", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/home-economics-trudeau-extends-wage-subsidy-as-two-million-jobs-vanish-1.1433659", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 8, 2020", "content": " Canada sees record job drop in April amid virus shutdown\r\n\u00a0\nCanada\u2019s economy shed two million jobs in the month of April as a result of pandemic-related shutdowns, marking the biggest decline on record. CTV\u2019s Chief Financial Commentator Pattie Lovett-Reid says this bleak data shows just how devastating the financial fallout has been for so many Canadian families whose livelihoods have been upended by the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\u00a0\nWage-subsidy program to be extended beyond June\r\n\u00a0\r\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the federal government will be extending the emergency wage subsidy program as steep job losses continue across the country due to COVID-19. The program covers 75 per cent of workers\u2019 pay up to $847 a week to help companies keep employees at work and avoid mass layoffs. The news comes after the Canadian economy lost a record number of jobs in April as many businesses temporarily closed up shop during the lockdown.\r\n\u00a0\nAsk BNN Bloomberg: Can I qualify for CERB while stuck overseas?\r\n\u00a0\r\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt almost every aspect of life, some Canadians are looking for with financial solutions while being stuck thousands of miles away from home. Diane from Montreal says she was on a working visa in Italy when her flight home was cancelled due to the pandemic. Diane says she\u2019s been stuck in quarantine for well over a month now and she is unsure whether or not she can qualify for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) while being overseas. Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning at CIBC Wealth Advisory Service, gave Diane some insight on the criteria to qualify for the program.\r\n\u00a0\nTurn your attention to taxes with the deadline fast approaching\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhile it can be hard to focus on anything other than the pandemic, tax season is still upon us and the deadline is fast approaching. Personal Finance Columnist Dale Jackson says Canadians should be taking advantage of this time in quarantine to plan out their 2019 tax returns. But, he says, it's important to also look ahead to the 2020 tax season, especially if you have received payment from recently-introduced government programs like CERB. They will play a factor in your next tax return.\r\n\u00a0\nNearly seven out of 10 Canadians say job disruption would trigger a personal financial crisis\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn a new survey by Credit Canada, 66 per cent of Canadians say a job loss or a reduced income would result in a severe crisis of their finances. In addition, more than half of Canadians are worried that a health or mental health crisis would trigger financial upheaval in their lives. Pattie Lovett-Reid says now is the time to take control of your financial situation. She explains how Canadians can come out of the pandemic with their financial well-being intact.\r\n\u00a0\nHitting the jackpot with aid benefits\r\n\u00a0\r\nFor some, CERB means the difference between paying bills for the month or having to turn the lights off.\u00a0 But for some part-time workers, the benefit has given them more spending money than usual. For example, one group of Canadians who have particularly benefitted are students living at home, many of whom get more spending money from the CERB than from their part-time job. So how can the government make sure the benefit is going to individuals who are actually in need? BNN Bloomberg dives into the details of the aid package and how government officials will need to monitor the program to make sure help is being appropriately distributed.\r\n\u00a0\nDo the rules of tipping change during a pandemic?\r\n\u00a0\r\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic many people have turned to food delivery services as a way to still order from their favourite restaurants while staying indoors. But as the popularity of these services continues to grow, so does the risk for many workers. As couriers risk their health delivering food to paying customers during the outbreak, people are asking the question: \"Should I tip more during a pandemic?\" The Canadian Press\u2019s Audrey Carleton looks into the issue.

Financial help for small business owners without employees Rod in Hamilton, Ont.: Canadian small business owners with zero employees are excluded from the Canada Emergency Business Account relief program. We are not being given any support to help us sustain our business through this pandemic. All of the continued enhancements only apply to small businesses that have one or more employees. There are over 2,800,000 small businesses that have no employees and currently they are not eligible for the CEBA program. This is more than double the number of small businesses with employees in Canada, including myself. How do we get the government to recognize this important issue and get it to extend CEBA to the non-employer small businesses so that they too can also survive this pandemic? I am hoping that my email brings importance and interest to you. Thank you for helping with this important issue in saving all small businesses across Canada. We need to help all we can during this unforeseen time. (April 29, 2020) Mary Ng, minister of small business, export promotion and international trade: Nothing is more important to me than helping businesses and entrepreneurs through this unprecedented challenge. We know there is no one-size-fits-all solution for relief. That\u2019s why \u2013 while the Canada Emergency Business Account loan might not be for every type of business \u2013 we have created a wide range of supports to help small business owners and entrepreneurs, including those without any employees. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit gives $2,000 to millions of Canadians making under $1,000 a month, including the self-employed. We\u2019ve partnered with the provinces and territories to lower small business tenants\u2019 rent by 75 per cent. We\u2019ve deferred GST, HST and custom duty payments \u2013 which means money staying in the pockets of over 3.2 million entrepreneurs. We\u2019re also providing dedicated support to innovators, young entrepreneurs, businesses in rural communities, and Indigenous-owned businesses. Our government is still listening, and I won\u2019t rest until we have done everything possible to help small businesses. (May 6, 2020) Holding corporations and CERB eligibility Ernie in Waterloo, Ont.: My wife and I are equal shareholders of a holding corporation.\u00a0 The holding corporation owns an operating corporation.\u00a0 We are also employees of the operating corporation earning less than $1,000 per month each in payroll. Business has slowed down but is not zero. We have opted not to take payroll at this time at all. Given we control our corporation, are each of us still eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) since we have no employment income and work is nearly (but not completely) non-existent? We are still receiving business income on work performed prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, which just has delayed terms of payment. The payments from past work completed are still trickling in. Does that matter? (April 23, 2020) Robin Taub, founder of Robin Taub Financial Consulting:\u00a0 Self-employed small business owners like yourself are eligible for CERB provided you meet the following criteria: one, you stopped working due to COVID-19 and two, you don\u2019t earn more than $1,000 in a period of at least 14 consecutive days in the first benefit period and for the entire four-week benefit period of any subsequent claim. You said you were each on the payroll for less than $1,000 a month but are no longer taking any salary. Assuming you are not taking any other compensation from the business, like dividends, it appears that you both qualify for CERB. Regarding your final point, your company may collect receivables for income earned before the outbreak because of the nature of payment terms but as long as you meet the criteria described above, that shouldn\u2019t affect your ability to qualify for CERB. (April 29, 2020) Do outstanding payments impact CERB eligibility? Morgan in Toronto: I run my own photography business and have not worked since the second week of March, 2020 due to the COVID-19 situation.\u00a0 I had several upcoming bookings that have now been postponed indefinitely.\u00a0 I have applied for and received the first two CERB payments.\u00a0 I currently have one outstanding invoice for which payment is overdue, and I'm still trying to get the client to pay.\u00a0 The job was shot in December 2019 before the holidays and was then approved, delivered and invoiced in January, 2020 (client was happy with the work).\u00a0 The invoice total is over $1,000 but under $2,000 before taxes.\u00a0 After months of back and forth with the client it's looking like I may finally be paid this month, but my question is - does this late payment during this period ruin my eligibility to collect the CERB payments despite the fact that the money was \"earned\" and invoiced months before the pandemic broke out?\u00a0 (April 21, 2020) Chantel Chapman, founder of What The Finances: Thank you so much, this is a great question because a lot of people are unclear about it. You did work in December, you invoice in January and you\u2019re just being paid now. Are you eligible? Well the government made an announcement in regards to creators, saying that if you receive royalty payments for work done prior to March 1st, even if it\u2019s over $1,000, you\u2019ll still be eligible. Now the question is \u2018Does this apply to other types of payments that artists and creators receive?\u2019 and we\u2019re not that clear about it to be honest. I would say it also depends on the way you do your bookkeeping, so if you recorded this payment as a January payment versus when you actually received it, you could say you haven\u2019t received or made income in this month. The government does acknowledge this uncertainty and they said they will not be unjustly penalizing people who apply on good faith and they later find out they\u2019re ineligible. So worst case scenario, would you be prepared to pay back a portion of the money that you received for this month when that invoice came in if you had to? And if the answer is yes, I think you\u2019re applying in good faith. (May 1, 2020) Collecting CERB and CECRA Richard in Etobicoke, Ont.: Can a qualified small business owner, who has had to shut down his operation and who has been approved for the CERB, obtain benefits from the new federal rent subsidy?\u00a0 Although CERB is very helpful to cover payroll for the owner, there are still significant costs like rent and utilities. Could this owner collect both? (April 24, 2020) Mark Chan, VP of wealth planning at Gluskin Sheff + Associates Inc.: Small business owners can directly apply to benefit from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). If they are a tenant or sub-tenant of a commercial property with a valid and enforceable lease, they can also enter into a rental reduction agreement with a moratorium on eviction, for April, May and June that allows their landlord to participate in the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program. The CECRA provides eligible landlords that reduce their qualifying small business tenants\u2019 rent by at least 75 per cent with forgivable loans of 50 per cent of the original rent. For a small business tenant to qualify, its monthly gross rent must not exceed $50,000 per location, their consolidated revenue must not exceed $20 million and they must have experienced a decline of at least 70 per cent in pre-COVID-19 revenues or temporarily ceased operations. In its current form, a landlord could apply for CECRA if CEWS benefits were already received by the landlord and/or the small business tenant. (May 5, 2020) CERB eligibility for contract workers between projects Robert in Oakville, Ont.: I am self-employed as a contract consultant on specific projects.\u00a0 My last project was completed in the first quarter of 2020 prior to March 15, so I was not actively working on a project at the time the CERB program came into existence, but rather was searching for a new project.\u00a0 Now that the various restrictions have come into place due to COVID-19, it is unlikely that a project opportunity will arise for some time. My question regarding eligibility relates to the requirement that the applicant attest if they have \u201cstopped or will stop working for reasons related to COVID-19\u201d and has not \u201cvoluntarily\u201d stopped working prior to COVID-19.\u00a0 As I happened to be between projects and therefore not actively working at or since March 15, am I eligible for the CERB program or does the applicant need to have been actively working and stopped specifically due to the COVID-19 shut down? (April 28, 2020) Kelley Keehn, consumer advocate at FP Canada: Thank you for your question. Based on my interpretation of the legislation, it doesn\u2019t sound like you would be eligible for the CERB. The eligibility criteria for CERB is that you\u2019ve lost your income because of the crisis, and the fact that your contract expired before March 15 makes you really unlucky in this situation. If you had lost your contract, if it had been cancelled or disrupted because of the crisis, then you would have been eligible. However, this is my interpretation I and encourage you to challenge it. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) actually has a dedicated line for CERB questions and you can reach them by 1-833-966-2099.

As jobless claims pile up in Canada, two top Toronto labour lawyers say the COVID-19 crisis has put employers in excruciating, complex and unique legal situations. The breadth and depth of COVID-19\u2019s financial damage, combined with never-before-seen government subsidies and unemployment programs, makes advising employers more complicated than ever before. But underpinning their advice to every client, they say, is a clear set of dos and don\u2019ts. DO: Be as transparent as possible Communications with employees should be proactive and frank, according to Muneeza Sheikh, senior partner at employment and labour law firm Levitt LLP. \u201c[Employers should] advise employees from the get-go,\u201d she said during a phone call with BNN Bloomberg. \u201cSend out a company-wide memo saying, \u2018We are doing our absolute best to keep things operational, but our business has unfortunately been affected by the COVID crisis so, under these circumstances, we will keep you as best apprised as we can of any changes that might come down the pipeline\u2019.\u201d The early warning, she said, means employees are less likely to feel blindsided if layoffs or wage reductions come later. For Kevin Coon, a partner at Baker McKenzie LLP, the key to a successful workforce reduction or wage cut program is working collaboratively with employees and laying out the range of options. And options, he said, abound. They include voluntary leave, tapping the federal government\u2019s emergency wage subsidy program, or even scheduling vacation. \u201cI just had a client last week where we told everybody that anyone with more than two weeks [left of] vacation is required to book an addition week of vacation with pay by the end of June,\u201d he told BNN Bloomberg. \u201cIn anticipation that the business will be up and running in the summer/fall, they don\u2019t want people booking off vacation time.\u201d Hudson\u2019s Bay Company recently found itself defending its transparency with employees after an employment lawyer accused the retailer of shortchanging dozens of terminated employees. Employment law firm Samfiru Tumarkin LLP alleged it is aware of 94 HBC workers who were given no option but to accept a 25 per cent pay cut last month, only to be given working notice of an upcoming termination days later. A spokesperson for HBC confirmed to BNN Bloomberg that terminated employees will make 25 per cent less than their normal salaries during the\u00a0working notice period. But the retailer explained it always planned to calculate any additional severance payments using employers\u2019 unaffected salaries. The situation and subsequent bad press underscored the need for employers to be forthcoming with their staff. \u201cTransparency is extremely important, so you don\u2019t have lawyers swooping in and convincing your employees that something legally untoward has happened,\u201d said Sheikh. Coon agreed, noting any successful workforce reduction strategy must have built-in flexibility. \u201cDon\u2019t make promises at the outset,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo months from now if the situation isn\u2019t better or it is\u00a0worse,\u00a0then you may need to take additional measures.\u201d DON\u2019T: Use the crisis as an excuse to rid yourself of problem workers Employers must be crystal clear about why they are laying off an employee, said Sheikh, and never disguise the true reason for termination as COVID-related financial strain. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s employers, unfortunately, who want to get rid of employees for the wrong reasons,\u201d she noted, pointing, as examples, to employees on sick leave or maternity leave. \u201cThis crisis around COVID-19 is not a blank ticket to unlawfully terminate people and then sweep it under the rug and say it\u2019s all because of COVID.\u201d Sadly, she added, many employees are putting up with abuses about which they would otherwise cry foul because, looking at the job market, they see no other options. DO: Share the pain Employers must ensure no employee group suffers disproportionate pain, according to Coon and Sheihk. \u201cLeaders need to also be seen to be making sacrifices, and proportionately,\u201d said Coon. \u201cIf you\u2019re making an announcement that all staff are going to take a hit\u2026 then there needs to be similar announcements around senior folks about the sacrifices they\u2019re also making.\u201d That advice has already been heeded by the likes of Air Canada, whose CEO and CFO will forego their entire salaries during this period, and Cineplex Inc., whose senior executives are taking an 80 per cent pay cut. This spirit of shared pain doesn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, mean everyone takes the same wage reduction, said Coon. \u201cI\u2019ve had situations where reductions have been imposed only on people earning above a certain level of income to recognize some of the wage disparity,\u201d noted Coon. \u201cIf you [impose a 10 per cent wage reduction] across the\u00a0board it can have a bigger impact on people on the lower end of the scale, in terms of the impact on their daily living.\u201d"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Employment destruction on pace to blow away records in Canada", "description": "A report due Friday will likely show employment in Canada was decimated in April as a nationwide lockdown caused mass lay-offs.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/employment-destruction-on-pace-to-blow-away-records-in-canada-1.1431110", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 4, 2020", "content": " A report due Friday will likely show employment in Canada was decimated in April as a nationwide lockdown caused mass lay-offs. The country probably lost more than 4 million jobs, a fifth of the labor force and far and away the largest decrease in monthly employment on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. That follows the record 1-million decline in March, when the Canadian economy was essentially shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. April is the first full month that strict social distancing measures and the closing of non essential business were in effect. Several provinces in Canada are starting to slowly reopen, which may allow workers to get rehired in May and beyond. Of the 18 economists surveyed, 12 predicted a drop of 4 million or more. Estimates ranged between 1.2 million to 5.5 million, with the median forecast at 4.3 million lost jobs. Economists expect the unemployment rate to hit about 18%, more than double the 7.8% rate in March. The Canadian government has softened the blow by introducing an emergency wage benefit to cover workers who have lost work as the nation aims to halt the spread of the virus. A total of 6.7 million people had applied for compensation as of April 19, a day after Statistics Canada had completed its survey.  It\u2019s a different picture this time around for the composition of the job losses. In previous Canadian recessions, it was men and those employed in manufacturing and construction who bore the brunt of the downturn. This time, it\u2019s part-time workers and women who have been most affected, the March data show. Job posting data suggest the labor market carnage may be hitting a plateau. While postings have been down significantly on a year-over-year basis, they started to level off toward the end of April, figures from Indeed Canada show. The services sector has been hardest hit particularly within tourism, education and food services. Labor market destruction isn\u2019t unique to Canada. In the U.S., the median forecast of economists calls for an eye-popping 21 million plunge in payrolls, the most in records back to 1939."}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "OMERS to launch US$750M venture fund to back tech companies", "description": "The Ontario Municipal Employment Retirement System is launching a venture capital fund to back early-stage technology companies in North America and Europe.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/omers-to-launch-us-750m-venture-fund-to-back-tech-companies-1.1427287", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Apr 26, 2020", "content": " The Ontario Municipal Employment Retirement System is launching a venture capital fund to back early-stage technology companies in North America and Europe.

There\u2019s a student who\u2019s in her last semester and has her permanent residency in Canada. Field placement was suspended and the job market is horrible. During the academic year, students get support through student loans and bursaries but now that college is over there\u2019s no support through financial aid and no places to get hired in order to manage the cost of food, utilities and rent. Would students in this kind of situation be eligible for CERB? (April 12, 2020) Jessica Moorhouse, financial counsellor and personal finance blogger for JessicaMoorhouse.com: So I\u2019ve been fielding a tonne of questions recently about the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), most of the questions being \u2018Am I eligible, can you tell me?\u2019. The criteria of course is all on the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website so make sure to take a good look at that; but for instance, one common question I\u2019ve been getting from students is \u2018Am I eligible?\u2019 So typically if you just graduated or maybe you finished a semester and you\u2019re on summer break, this is the time you would try to find work or find that first full-time job after university. I know this is not the best time to find a job, but this is someone who graduated in 2009 during the last recession, so I feel your pain. Unfortunately, with the current [CERB] benefit and its current criteria, you\u2019re most likely not eligible. It was really developed to give financial relief to people who were already working and thus laid off, or their hours were cut to zero, or they are self-employed they can no longer earn any income through their business directly because of COVID-19. If you were already unemployed or you now just can\u2019t find a job because of COVID-19, the criteria doesn\u2019t seem to take you into consideration. So unfortunately, most likely you\u2019re not eligible, but this is why I always say wait for some good news. I\u2019m sure some more things will be coming down and hopefully they will help you in your situation. Make sure to contact the CRA directly and see if you have a special circumstance that makes you eligible [for CERB]. (April 14, 2020) Canadian government bond vs. GIC Tony in Montreal: I have $95,000 to invest. What is a safer investment? I don't want to lose my capital under any circumstance. Am I better off buying: 1) 5-year Government of Canada bond or 2) a 5-year Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) with a major Canadian chartered bank with Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) coverage? Is one investment better than the other? (April 14, 2020) Paul Harris, partner and portfolio manager at Harris Douglas Asset Management: The second option would be best for an individual that does not want to lose any capital. The individual could opt for a cashable GIC with a lower rate but would allow more flexibility in case they require the funds early. (April 14, 2020) Qualifying for CERB while on maternity leave Filippo in Montreal: I went on maternity leave in February 2019. I have not received any maternity benefits (I did earn more than $5,000 in 2019) in over a month and have two small children that are obviously at home with me due to the closure of daycares, so I cannot return to work. I am still employed and I am deemed on unpaid leave. I believe I am eligible for the CERB. Would you be able to clarify it for me? (April 12, 2020) Dilys D\u2019Cruz, VP and head of wealth management at Meridian Credit Union: Things are changing so rapidly, so it\u2019s critical for this individual to visit the government\u2019s website and check out the details [on CERB], because the government recently expanded the criteria to allow for people who have reduced their hours and are making less than a $1,000, and also if your employment insurance ran out. So, without knowing all the details in this specific case, I would highly recommend that this individual talk to her accountant and her employer to ensure that she does in fact qualify [for CERB]. But on the surface, it does look like she would qualify because she made more than $5,000 last year, she\u2019s not getting an income, and she has been impacted due to COVID-19. I also highly recommend that anybody who has been impacted financially because of COVID-19 seek the advice of a financial advisor who can steer you through the various programs the government is offering and help put you on a plan to manage through this financially difficult time. (April 15, 2020) Government aid for seniors Lilybeth in Toronto: Would you please advise on whether the Canadian government is providing assistance to seniors like me who are on a fixed income. I am receiving my CPP pension, Old Age Security pension and company pension. However, the value of my TFSA and RRSP have been drastically reduced as a result of COVID-19 and my hands are tied because if I liquidate, I will suffer a tremendous loss. I use my TFSA to supplement my income to cover living expenses. (April 2, 2020) Tony Salgado, president and founder at AMS Wealth: Yes, the Canadian government has introduced an economic measure to assist seniors who are currently drawing from their Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF). For 2020, the minimum required withdrawal has been reduced by 25 per cent for all account holders. This measure will allow seniors to retain more capital inside their registered account for future investment. However, this measure does not assist seniors who may not have a RRIF or have yet to convert their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) to a RRIF. For instance, if you are 68 years old and do not have a RRIF, this economic measure will not apply to you or provide any relief. Many seniors require more guaranteed retirement income within their retirement plan. This should be a critical discussion point when conducting financial planning as various solutions exist to provide a level of guarantee to retirees. Taking less investment risk needs to be part of the conversation. (April 14, 2020) Accessing CERB after EI benefits end Jack in Oakville, Ont.: I lost my job in 2019, and my Employment Insurance (EI) benefits ran out in December 2019. On March 18, I had an interview that went well. I was advised I would start working on March 23, with an employment agreement coming before then. I followed up and was told on March 21 that due to the situation with COVID-19, the company would not proceed with hiring me after all. Am I eligible for CERB? Had it not been for COVID-19 I would have been working now. Again, I will appreciate your help clarifying this matter. (April 14, 2020) Chantel Chapman, founder of What The Finances: I\u2019m really sorry that you were not able to go through with that job offer you had, and I hope that my answer will bring you some peace in this challenging time. So recently the government promised that they would be extending the CERB to those that have exhausted Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. Also, as the application states now, it says you are eligible if you are not able to work due to COVID-19. With your situation and because the company couldn\u2019t hire you because of COVID-19, I believe you have a strong case to be eligible. The government does acknowledge that they haven\u2019t been able to analyze every scenario and communicate eligibility so they\u2019ve recently said that they will not unjustly penalize people who applied in good faith and later find out they\u2019re ineligible. I think you\u2019re okay for eligibility but I would make sure that you have that proof of the offer. (April 15, 2020) Paying back CERB funds Leslie in Peace River, Alb.: What if my employment status changed and I want to repay the CERB funds? (April 15, 2020) Peter Papadakis, principal of financial planning and tax advisory services at Kerr Financial Consultants: Congratulations on returning to work! You are in the enviable position of not having to rely on the CERB to cover your expenses. Given the fact that the CERB is a new program, there have been many cases of people receiving double payments or receiving benefits for which they are not eligible. The CERB has many moving parts and individuals can easily receive benefits for which they are not eligible. As conditions improve, there will likely be individuals who will apply for the CERB on the assumption that they will not be receiving income for a given period, but then find themselves being called back to work. If you received a [CERB] cheque and still have it, you should mail it back to Canada Revenue Agency\u2019s tax centre in Sudbury, Ont. If you have cashed the cheque or received the CERB by direct deposit, then mail a personal cheque, payable to Receiver General for Canada, to CRA indicating that it is repayment of the CERB. You should include your social insurance number on the cheque. At the current time, CERB funds cannot be repaid electronically. (April 15, 2020) Landlords eligible for CERB? Mohamed in Oakville, Ont.: I have two rental properties and this is my only income.\u3000 One of the tenants stopped paying the rent for April (due on April 1) and he informed me that he will not be able to pay the rent for April while the other tenant paid on time.\u3000 The contribution of the first property (the one where the tenant stopped the payment) is almost 55 to 60 per cent of my monthly income.\u3000 Am I eligible to apply for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) or not, taking into consideration that I have some savings in the bank? (April 13, 2020) Kelley Keehn, consumer advocate at FP Canada: I\u2019m so sorry to hear about your situation, but how kind of you to pass on that relief to your renters albeit at a significant income loss to you. So on April 15, the prime minister announced new tweaks to the CERB program. If you earn $1,000 or less per month you\u2019re now eligible. Now your question didn\u2019t specify exactly how much you\u2019re earning, but if it is under that $1,000 per month, you\u2019re now eligible to apply. (April 15, 2020) Managing rental property costs amid the pandemic Susanna in Edson, Alb.: I am a retired veteran living on an army pension. I also have a rental property, a hotel condo, but it is now shut down indefinitely due to the pandemic. Therefore, I have zero rental income but still have to pay over $1,600 for maintaining the condo, e.g. condo fees, property taxes, repairs and maintenance, and interest payments on my home equity line of credit. Am I eligible to apply for any government relief subsidies? (April 12, 2020) Barry Choi, personal finance blogger for Moneywehave.com: Unfortunately, there are no subsidies or relief programs that the government is offering that you would qualify for. Since your condo is a rental property, you also would not qualify for any mortgage deferrals. I doubt that any programs will be introduced later that would address your situation as the government likely does not believe they're responsible for any supplementary income that Canadians may rely on. (April 13, 2020) Forced leave without pay Peter in Vancouver: My employer is asking some of us to take a mandatory leave of absence during this COVID-19 pandemic for periods of two to 16 weeks without pay but with benefits. I am in the helicopter maintenance business and this has been declared an essential service at this time. But my employer says it is in reaction to declining revenues. There have been no outbreaks at any of our facilities but their intention is to mitigate layoffs. Instead we are encouraged to take advantage and apply for the CERB to tide us over. Is this legal? (April 11, 2020) Muneeza Sheikh, employment lawyer at Levitt LLP: If your employer places you on a forced mandatory layoff, that\u2019s something which should be considered to be legally untoward or unlawful. While an employer has the right to lay you off either for 13 weeks without benefits or 35 weeks with benefits, simply sending you home on a mandatory leave even if they continue your benefits and not issuing a Record of Employment (ROE) for a layoff would qualify for a constructive dismissal. If essentially you\u2019re being told that you\u2019re still an employee but they\u2019re not going to pay you and there isn\u2019t any work to do then the legal recourse they have available is a layoff. Now that layoff in and of itself may also be challenged as a constructive dismissal unless there is a term in your employment agreement which allows your employer to do that. But if I was at the receiving end of a notice from my employer telling me to go home on a mandatory leave, I have job protection but no job and no pay, that is considered to be a constructive dismissal in that your employer is obligated to pay you at law. You should not be accepting that under any circumstances. (April 15, 2020) Tax planning strategy for real estate Ian in Mississauga, Ont.: My wife and I bought an investment property in our company and currently rent it out. We are contemplating selling our home and moving to the cottage up north but using the rental property as our city home. We bought the townhouse for about $650,000 and it\u2019s now worth about $800,000. Should we keep it in the company or buy it back personally? If so, I assume we would have to pay a taxable benefit or some kind of fair market value (FMV) rent to the corporation? What would you consider to be the best tax planning? (April 12, 2020) Silvia Jacinto, tax partner at Crowe Soberman: We don\u2019t typically advise a client to own a personal use property in a company, because as you have alluded to, this creates taxable benefit issues. As the shareholder of the company, you will be deemed to have received a taxable benefit from your company generally equal to the fair market value rent you would have had to pay another arm\u2019s length person to use the property. There is no step up in the cost of the property in the corporation for the personal use benefit and therefore this may lead to double taxation in future when the property is sold in the corporation. In addition, when the property is sold by the corporation, it will be subject to capital gains tax (no principal residence exemption is available in this situation) and you will receive a taxable dividend from the corporation if and when you extract the after-tax sale proceeds. Ultimately, you may want to consider removing the property from the corporation before any further increase in value, but this will likely result in tax consequences to both you and the corporation. Alternatively, you can keep the property in the corporation and pay the corporation fair value rent, thereby treating the property as a purely investment asset in the corporation (i.e. no different than the corporation renting the property out to an arm\u2019s length person). When the property is ultimately sold, the same capital gain and tax liability implications (as discussed above) will arise as the principal residence exemption is not available. (April 14, 2020) Bulking up a TFSA Lynne in Lethbridge, Alb.: Hello, I'm a senior and would like to keep up my retirement fund. Would it be a good idea to add to my TSFA at this time? I believe I get 1.5 per cent interest in this fund. I have lots of room in the fund for contributions, more than the $6,000 allowed for 2020. (April 12, 2020) Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning at CIBC Wealth Advisory Service: Now may actually be the perfect time to make a contribution to your tax-free savings account (TFSA) if you\u2019ve got accumulated room because you haven\u2019t always maxed out the maximum amount you put into your TFSA. If you have extra cash right now with the markets down, depending on what you invest in you might have an opportunity to top up the TFSA. Now there are all kinds of investments that one can put into the TFSA, from savings accounts with guaranteed rates of return by many of the financial institutions as well as other products like GICs, stock market portfolios, mutual funds, ETFs, what have you. An opportunity to catch up on TFSA allows you to take advantage of market up turns and invest for the long-term. Remember you can always take money out of the TFSA tax-free and then recontribute it, beginning the following year. To check your TFSA contribution limit, go online using the CRA my account, and click on TFSA contribution room. (April 13, 2020) Choosing an investment strategy Tyrell in Calgary: I am a 28-year-old from Alberta and I am in the agricultural industry (family farm) so I am still making a decent wage every month ranging between $3200 to $6000, depending on what time of year it is - which comes out to approximately $62,000 to $67,000 a year. I own a house, still owing about $250,000, but I have two roommates helping with the bills. I also have a truck with about $35,000 owing but I have no credit card debt and have about $20,000 saved up in various savings accounts and TFSAs. One day I will also inherit land worth a substantial amount but that\u2019s not what I expect or depend on in the short-term, next five to 15 years. Recently I have become really aware how important investing will be after this crash and I just wonder other than investing in diverse ETFs or in a TFSA, what are some other safe things to look into?\u3000 What are some higher risk and reward options for a person like me? And also, what are some signs we have bottomed out and the rise is on the horizon? (April 7, 2020) Filomena May, financial advisor at Filo Financial Solutions of Raymond James Ltd.: You have cash flow. Review the interest rate on the truck but you presumably have a tax deduction with the family farm. You have a small mortgage but review the rate, expecting an inheritance that will be tax-free, and you have roommates to make payments. You can accomplish more by investing wisely. Max out your TFSA room and tax-free growth. Anything that you require near-term should not be invested in riskier investments. Many ETFs are not low-risk. There\u2019s a range of great investments from stocks to high-quality mutual funds, dividend vs. growth-producing and diverse sectors. Do not focus solely on one or two industries as things change quickly. Trying to time the market is not wise during these times, as we cannot predict what will happen in the next 12 to 18 months, so it\u2019s best to add money in regularly so you are buying investments on sale.

The government has paid out $7.9 billion in unemployment insurance benefits from new claimants since March 16, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition they not be identified because the figures are not public. Another $8.4 billion has been sent to residents not eligible for jobless insurance through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which pays $2,000 a month. The money, which amounts to about 20\u00a0per cent\u00a0of what would typically be earned by Canadian workers in one month, represents a badly needed injection of income to buffer the effect of the pandemic -- providing effectively a floor to the sharpest economic contraction on record in Canada. The government has also begun issuing one-time payments to low income individuals through a sales tax credit, estimated to provide another $5.5 billion. A lot more is coming. The CERB income support program is intended to last for a total 16 weeks, costing $24 billion over that time, but is designed to be scaled up or extended if necessary. Employment insurance benefits typically last between 14 and 45 weeks, depending on region.

Combining the two benefits into one will mean a $2,000 per month payment for up to four months to workers whose income drops to zero because of the pandemic, including if they have been furloughed by their employers but technically still have jobs. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the measure allows companies to temporarily let go of workers to cut payroll costs and leave money in the affected employees' pockets. \"Companies don't need to separate their employee from their company. They just need to say, 'we can't pay you during this time period.' And when that happens, there is a direct wage subsidy to people, to employees so that they can actually live their lives,\" he said. \"When this is done, they can go back to work for their employers and that we think is critically important.\" Affected workers would have to fill out an online application and meet a few conditions to qualify. It would apply to any affected workers between March 15 and Oct. 3. Over the last week or so, there were almost one million new EI claims -- far above the typical 45,000. Depending on how things go, the unemployment rate could jump as high as 11.7 per cent by the second quarter, TD Economics wrote in a report Wednesday. Demand for the new benefit would have overwhelmed the decades-old EI system, the Liberals said Wednesday in a partial explanation for the spending change. Previously, the Liberals proposed two benefits -- one to flow through the employment insurance system and another for those who don't qualify for EI benefits, such as self-employed workers. The benefits, along with a 10 per cent wage subsidy for qualifying businesses, was part of a package valued at $27 billion in direct spending and $55 billion in tax deferrals. Now, spending will be $52 billion because the new benefit is being funded from general revenues, and not the EI fund covered by employee and employer premiums. Morneau said the change in spending plans raises the overall value of the economic response to $107 billion from $82 billion. He said more help would be announced for the oil and gas sector, airlines and the hospitality industry, but didn't put a timeline on when the details will be unveiled. TD senior economist Brian DePratto wrote in a note that the benefit should ease the burden on businesses, but there is still a need to help small- and medium-sized businesses. \"The pain that small- and medium-sized firms are feeling is intense,\" he wrote. \"We hope that additional measures to ensure that furloughed workers' firms still exist after the pandemic control measures are lifted will be forthcoming.\" The government is aiming to have the new benefit, paid once a month, available starting April 6 with payments landing 10 days afterwards, meaning the first benefits won't arrive until the middle of April at the earliest. A $300 increase to the Canada Child Benefit lands in May. Those already receiving EI benefits would receive the new benefit, dubbed the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, if payments end before Oct. 3 and they can't go back to work due to COVID-19. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who this week called on the Liberals to provide $2,000 payments to all Canadians, tweeted that the \"announcement isn't perfect, but it will help so many people.\" \"We need to work to get it to people as quickly as possible,\" he added. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business called the new benefit a \"significant step forward,\" but said it didn't change the need to increase the 10 per cent wage subsidy to 75 per cent or higher as many business and labour groups have requested. \"CFIB is focused on measures that will keep the connections between workers and employers and not require layoffs,\" president Dan Kelly said in a statement. \"This is imperative to ensure employees can go back to work the day after the emergency ends, allowing Canada's economy to return to normal as quickly as possible.\" \u00a0"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Kait Bolongaro", "title": "Canada received over 500,000 EI applications this week", "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said half a million Canadians, or about 2.5 per cent of the labor force, have applied for jobless claims this week, smashing previous records and suggesting the nation is already in a deep recession.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-received-over-500-000-ei-applications-this-week-1.1409633", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 20, 2020", "content": " Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said half a million Canadians, or about 2.5 per cent of the labor force, have applied for jobless claims this week, smashing previous records and suggesting the nation is already in a deep recession.

The Minister of Families, Children and Social Development\u2019s office confirmed Trudeau was referring to applications for unemployment insurance. The speed of the meltdown in the labor market has no precedent. The largest number of jobless claims for a whole month was 499,200 in 1957, according to Statistics Canada data. \u201cThis is of course an unprecedented situation and it is putting a lot of pressure on our system but we\u2019re on it,\u201d Trudeau told reporters Friday at Rideau Cottage, where he is\u00a0governing from home\u00a0after his wife tested positive for coronavirus.

Payrolls rose 273,000 after the prior month was revised up to also reflect a 273,000 gain, according to Labor Department data Friday that beat all forecasts in Bloomberg\u2019s survey calling for 175,000. The jobless rate fell back to a half-century low of 3.5 per cent as average hourly earnings climbed a steady three per cent from a year earlier.\u00a0 The surprisingly strong hiring signals that employment was holding up as virus concerns grew, though the report reflects conditions through mid-February, before the impact from disruptions abroad as well as the intensification of the U.S. outbreak. While the Federal Reserve has said the labour market remains strong, employment could be poised for broad disruption should the outbreak spread further through the American workplace. Such a risk to economic activity spurred the central bank to cut interest rates Tuesday in the first emergency move since the 2008 financial crisis. Speaking after the rate-cut announcement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the fundamentals of the economy remain strong, citing the low unemployment rate, solid pace of job gains and steady wage increases. Still, Treasury yields have continued to plunge on signs the virus is spreading uncontained. Airlines, Hotels In the days since the rate cut, the economic impact of the virus has become more apparent with airlines and hotels warning of lost revenue amid canceled conferences. Meanwhile, large companies are ordering employees to work from home, depriving restaurants of business. Friday\u2019s jobs report showed average hourly earnings rose 0.3 per cent from the prior month, as forecast, following a 0.2\u00a0per cent gain in January. The three\u00a0per cent annual gain also matched projections. The report reflected a second-straight month of robust government hiring, which rose by 45,000 after a 51,000 gain in January, owing to employment at state and local governments. Federal workers climbed by 8,000, which was almost entirely due to the Census Bureau adding 7,000 temporary workers for the 2020 tally. This should pick up throughout the year as hiring ramps up: The bureau plans to hire up to 500,000 temporary, part-time workers for the count. Construction employment rose by 42,000 after a 49,000 gain in the prior month. But retailers and wholesalers showed declines. More Hours Weekly hours worked rose to 34.4 hours from 34.3 in January. Economists look to hours worked for labor-market warning signs as companies often cut hours before laying off workers. The participation rate, or share of working-age people in the labor force, held at 63.4 per cent. Greater participation reinforces Powell\u2019s desire to sustain the expansion, as it shows more Americans coming in from the sidelines. Manufacturers unexpectedly added workers, gaining 15,000 despite projections for a second-straight decline. The industry was beginning to strengthen late last year after the signing of the latest trade deal with China. The U-6, or the underemployment rate, edged up to seven per cent\u00a0from 6.9 per cent.

The share of workers who say switching jobs would leave them better off financially has jumped sharply since 2018, according to a Nanos Research Group poll conducted for Bloomberg. Almost two in 10 respondents said their wages would increase if they lost their jobs or chose to find a new one. That\u2019s an improvement from prior surveys, including one in December 2018, when as few as 12 per cent\u00a0said they would be able to find a job that pays more. The results are broadly consistent with a strong labour market over the past year, and appear to reflect confidence that the economy can sustain recent wage gains. Stronger wage expectations would be good news if they encourage labour churn, whereby workers feel free to leave their jobs to find something more suitable. It\u2019s a process Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said is worth nurturing because it\u2019s an important source of productivity gains. In December, Poloz said labour churn has picked up recently, indicating workers have the confidence to leave their positions for new ones. \u201cThe average wage increase of people who switch jobs is very high, in the 10 per cent\u00a0to 12 per cent\u00a0range, because people are finding the right matches,\u201d Poloz told reporters Dec. 12 in Toronto. \u201cThose matches inevitably bring higher productivity.\u201d  The Nanos poll results are in line with findings published by the Bank of Canada in its fourth quarter survey of consumer expectations, which found rising probabilities of Canadians voluntarily leaving their jobs. The pick up in wage expectations largely reflects improved sentiment among younger workers, the data show. Last year, the nation\u2019s economy added almost 300,000 jobs, the unemployment rate hovered near four-decade lows and wages rose near the fastest pace since the recession. The strength of the labour market, in part, allowed the Bank of Canada to keep interest rates on hold, even as its counterparts in other countries lowered rates due to slowing economic growth. \u201cWe\u2019re now several years into having unemployment in the six per cent\u00a0to below six per cent\u00a0range,\u201d said Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada. \u201cThat\u2019s going to help build confidence in the job market overall.\u201d It\u2019s clear the labour market boon hasn\u2019t been equally distributed across Canada. Residents in the Prairies are most pessimistic about job pay, with only 14 per cent\u00a0expecting higher pay if they left their job. That region is also the only one where more than half of respondents expect they would get paid less if they had to find a new job. Confidence in Quebec was highest of all provinces, with 26.2 per cent\u00a0saying they would get paid more in a new position. The poll, a hybrid telephone and online random survey of 1,000 people, was taken between Jan. 27 and Jan. 29. The survey has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points."}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "Pattie Lovett-Reid: How to know when a job is right for you", "description": "Pattie Lovett-Reid", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pattie-lovett-reid-how-to-know-when-a-job-is-right-for-you-1.1388534", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Feb 12, 2020", "content": " You might not even be looking for a job, but that doesn't mean a job won't be presented to you when you least expect it. The challenge is: How do you know if this is the right opportunity for you? There are four key considerations to make: 1) Ideally, the more you find out about a potential job, the more excited you get about the work, the role within the organization and the mandate you will charged with. Does the excitement build the closer you come to the decision point? Emotional momentum is key, and it has to build on an upward trajectory as you get closer and closer to the decision. 2) Will the new position play to your strengths and passions? If it doesn't, at best you will be average and never great. 3) People tend to underestimate the importance of chemistry. If the fit is good and the chemistry is strong with the people you are going to work with, the odds of success increase dramatically. Trust has to be established and the higher up you are in an organization, the more critical this alignment is. 4) Don't make a bad economic decision. Eighty-five per cent of the time, moving to a new opportunity should mean you are advancing your compensation forward. However, there are two reasons you may want to take a pay cut: You want to make a career change, or you are in a really bad situation and it is affecting your health. It is very flattering to have a company express an interest in you. Go through the interview process and find out what you can about the company, the people and the position. Once you are presented with an offer, evaluate whether the position is right for you. If it isn\u2019t, that\u2019s okay. You have earned the right to say no.

And it may be. Sometimes just the act of looking for a new position may cause you to pause, and that\u2019s okay. It is all part of the process. But before you jump in with both feet and slam the current door behind you, here are a few considerations.\u00a0 1. You know it\u2019s time to go when you\u2019re moving toward something as opposed to away from something. In others words, you are excited about where you are going rather than complaining about where you have been.\u00a0 2. Once the decision is made to make a move, always finish strong. I've seen people stop working once they resign. Even worse is when someone decides to leave without a job offer, and their performance starts to deteriorate. If in fact you don't get a new job and your performance is compromised, your boss will sense it immediately. That can be bad news, as you could find yourself looking for a job sooner than you thought.\u00a0\u00a0 3. It\u2019s always a good idea to thank the people you work with. Exit in the most positive way possible. You shook hands on the way in so be sure to shake hands on the way out.\u00a0 4. After you leave your current job, don\u2019t speak negatively about your former co-workers or company. Industries are small, word gets around, and no one wants an employee who is disrespectful of the past.\u00a0 Once you have notified the boss you intend to leave, you may be asked to do an exit interview. This is an opportunity to give honest and balanced feedback. However, if you are entirely negative about your time at the company, it may not be taken seriously. You might want to consider a 3:2 ratio. Three positive comments for every two that are negative. I repeat: it is all about being honest and balanced.\u00a0 Finally, you may want to stay in touch with co-workers who have become friends and that's okay. However, keep in mind they still work for the company you left and it can't be all about you. Relationships go two ways. Also recognize before you try to recruit customers or clients, you likely have a fiduciary responsibility to your previous employer and could be held liable. So if you are thinking about poaching, seek legal advice before you do so.\u00a0 The best way to not burn a bridge when it\u2019s time to go is to tell your boss first, give lots of notice, and offer to help train up your replacement.

Wage gains should also support holiday shopping and ease concerns about a slowdown.

Manufacturers rebounded, adding 54,000 jobs after a 43,000 drop the prior month, mostly reflecting GM workers returning to work.

Being your own boss can be stressful but it can also provide some pretty good tax breaks. If you run a business from home it\u2019s important to establish the portion of your home dedicated to the business. The CRA officially bases that on square footage but tax experts will often suggest the one-fifth rule, meaning one-fifth of the total floor space in your home is used for business purposes. Using the one-fifth rule makes calculating office expenses simple: 20 per cent of your total home expenses. If your home is your principal place of business or you regularly meet clients or customers there, those expenses can include a portion of utilities, repairs, insurance, mortgage interest and property taxes. Deducting one-fifth of repairs and maintenance on a home should be alright with the CRA but you could run into trouble trying to deduct home renovations if it is your principal residence. Here\u2019s why: gains made on the value of your principal resident are not taxed when the house is sold, but half of gains made on the value of a business are taxed when it is sold. The CRA could consider one-fifth of your house a business and you could be subject to taxation on one-fifth of the capital gains. The line between repairs and renovations can be fine, so be sure to check with a tax expert.

In a new report released in Ottawa today, Sylvain Ricard says callers are facing too many barriers when trying to call the government for services or information. Ricard's office audited call centres at three departments that receive a lot of telephone calls: The Immigration Department, Employment and Social Development Canada and Veterans Affairs. \"Overall, we found that getting through to government call centres took time and persistence,\" the audit report says. \"In fact, we found that half of the 16 million Canadians who tried to speak to an agent could not do so.\" Seven million callers were sent to an automated system or were told to go to a website or to call back later. \"This audit is important because call centres are a key source of government information,\" Richard says in the report. \"Callers make millions of calls to the government every year to get the information they need to make time-sensitive, important decisions. For example, they may be calling to ensure that they receive benefits on time or to find out the status of an application.\" Callers to the Immigration Department face the longest wait times: 30 minutes or longer to speak with an agent. One key problem is that the Immigration call centre does not have targets for how long callers should have to wait. A decision by the previous Conservative government to close a number of in-person client offices across Canada in 2012 contributed to the longer wait times, the audit found. At Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), which manages employment-insurance claims, the Canada Pension Plan and old-age security benefits, callers are sent to an automated system when call volumes exceed a certain threshold. In its response to the findings, ESDC noted its ability to manage and improve access to call-centre agents is limited by existing technology and funding.\r\nVeterans Affairs Canada's call centre allows all callers to wait in a queue to speak with an agent. However, the audit found the department stopped offering a teletypewriter (TTY) service for people with impaired hearing without telling veterans. No documentation was found to justify this decision. For all three departments, more than a million callers who did make it into a queue for an agent eventually gave up on waiting and hung up. And the auditor general says the situation is unlikely to improve any time soon. A government strategy to modernize client services adopted in 2017 did not include call centres, even though more than 25 per cent of Canadians use the telephone to contact government. The strategy prioritized providing services online. In addition, a call-centre modernization project by Shared Services Canada that has taken five years to get off the ground has managed to upgrade only eight of the government's 221 call centres and has no plan for the remaining 213. \"While these call centres wait for modern technology, they face the risk of aging hardware breaking down and software no longer being supported,\" the AG report says. All government agencies have accepted the auditor's findings and say they are taking steps to improve service delivery. The Immigration Department hired additional call-centre agents in 2018 and is developing strategies to increase access. ESDC says it will review operations once it has been migrated to a new telephone system \u2014\u00a0a move planned to be completed in 2020. Veterans Affairs said it would extend its TTY services to include all calls handled by its national contact centre. Shared Services Canada says it has realized that \"one size does not fit all\" when it comes to its modernization strategy and has begun to reassess the plan to determine the best solutions for call centres in need of upgrades.

Treasuries rallied while the dollar and stock futures fell. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 20,000 after an upwardly revised 311,000 gain the prior month, a Labor Department report showed Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for an increase of 180,000. Average hourly earnings rose a better-than- projected 3.4 per cent from a year earlier, while the jobless rate declined to 3.8 per cent, near a five-decade low. Even with faster pay raises, the big miss on payrolls may fuel concern about the mood among U.S. consumers following a December retail-sales slump that was the worst in nine years. Economists project the expansion will slow this year, amid weaker global growth and the fading impact of fiscal stimulus such as President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts. At the same time, policy makers and economists might wait for several months of weak hiring before concluding there\u2019s cause for concern in the labor market. Some of the weakness could be chalked up to winter weather, as construction jobs fell by 31,000, though many other sectors were soft including education and health services as well as leisure and hospitality. Even with the pickup in wages, Federal Reserve policy makers have indicated this year they won\u2019t raise interest rates again until seeing inflation advance. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony last week that \u201cthe job market remains strong.\u2019\u2019 February Miss This marked the first February since 2011 that the initial reading on payrolls missed the median estimate of economists. The 20,000 gain was the lowest since September 2017, a month marked by the impact of several major hurricanes. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 4,000, trailing the 12,000 median forecast. Retail jobs fell by 6,100, while education and health services posted a meager gain of 4,000 and leisure and hospitality payrolls were unchanged. One solid reading was professional and business services, with a 42,000 increase. The labor-force participation rate was unchanged at a five-year high of 63.2 per cent, while the employment-population ratio, another broad measure of labor-market health, held at 60.7 per cent. Companies have said shortages of skilled workers limit expansion plans. In addition, broader headwinds include continuing uncertainty surrounding trade tension with China, a waning boost from fiscal policy and threats from abroad. Just this week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development cut its 2019 global growth forecast to 3.3 per cent from 3.5 per cent, China lowered its economic growth target, and the European Central Bank slashed its projection for the region. Average hourly earnings for private workers rose 0.4 per cent from the prior month, topping estimates, following a 0.1 per cent gain. The annual increase came after a downwardly revised 3.1 advance. Average hourly earnings for production and non- supervisory workers accelerated to a 3.5 per cent annual gain.

The 35-year-old, who lives in Toronto and works as a hospital discharge coordinator, is considering how much time to take off of work after she gives birth to her second child in mid-April. She\u2019s entitled to extended parental benefits for up to 18 months, rather than the standard 12 months, an option introduced by the Trudeau government in December 2017. The 18-month leave means the government\u2019s weekly allowance is adjusted for the extra time: It provides eligible parents with 33 per cent of average weekly earnings up to a maximum $337 per week, for up to 61 weeks. In contrast, the standard 12-month leave provides claimants with 55 per cent of their average weekly earnings, capped at $562 per week, for up to 35 weeks. \u201cI would love more time off with my children,\u201d Savji said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of their life. I\u2019ll never get this time back.\u201d More than 32,000 parents established a claim for extended benefits between December 2017 and December 2018 \u2014 higher than the anticipated 20,000 claims for the year, according to Employment and Social Development Canada. But it\u2019s not an easy decision for parents like Savji, who says she\u2019s grappling with a number of factors in her decision, including \u2014 of course \u2014 money and the cost of child care. Child-care fees remain \u201cout of reach for many parents\u201d in most of Canada, according to the latest annual study by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA). In 2018, child-care fees rose faster than the rate of inflation in 17 of the 28 cities surveyed, according to CCPA. But the cost of child care is uneven across the country. Fees for infant care are highest in Toronto, at a median $1,685 a month, and lowest in Montreal, at a median $175 a month, according to CCPA. That\u2019s on top of all of the other costs associated with raising children. Matthew Siwiec, financial educator and head coach at Friendly Financial Coach, says expectant parents should track income and expenses with a mock budget. \u201cYou can\u2019t really make a decision about whether to take the shorter or longer parental leave if you don\u2019t know your financial situation,\u201d Siwiec said in a phone interview. Income may include employment insurance or a company\u2019s top-up program, he said, adding that it\u2019s important to calculate that EI is taxed based on income. \u201cExpenses will also heavily change,\u201d Siwiec said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have upfront expenses in preparing for the child. And then there\u2019s ongoing expenses like diapers, increased food costs, possibly supplements for the mother and educational savings.\u201d In Savji\u2019s case, even with her employer\u2019s top-up, her income on parental leave will be a far cry from what she usually earns working full-time. And then there\u2019s the additional cost of child care. Savji said once she returns to work, child care for her baby and her first son, now 19 months old, will cost a total of about $3,100 a month. \u201cSo, now is it worth it? Is it worth is to go back early after 12 months to pay this astronomical price? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Many parents also have to weigh the impact that an 18-month leave may have on their career. \u201cYou\u2019re missing out on work experience, six months of networking, six months of keeping your skills up, and that hurts you a lot more financially than I think people realize,\u201d Bridget Casey, personal finance expert and founder of the website Money After Graduation, said in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that spending time at home with your child isn\u2019t valuable. People should definitely stay home for 18 months if they want that experience of caring for their child for that long,\u201d Casey said. But, she adds, from a financial perspective, if you earn anything over $40,000 a year, taking a longer leave may\u00a0cost you more in wages than it will save you in child-care fees. Savji said she is \u201cdefinitely\u201d concerned about the potential career repercussions if she opts for a longer leave. \u201cI just got this job. I recently got a master\u2019s [in nursing], so I\u2019m trying to utilize that to propel my career forward,\u201d she said. WAYS TO SAVE ON CHILD CARE Expectant parents may be able to take advantage of child-care subsidies. But the amounts vary depending on location, income, family size, employment status and other factors, according to CCPA. \u201cEven families that earn over $100,000 [a year] may still be eligible for some type of child-care subsidy. And households that earn around $30,000 to $40,000 typically qualify for a large subsidy,\u201d Siwiec said. \u201cApply when you know that you\u2019re pregnant because there\u2019s such a long waiting list,\u201d he added. Both Siwiec and Casey caution that not all child-care centres are eligible for subsidies. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for child care, don\u2019t just look at the cost that they post, look at what you would actually pay based on what resources are available to you,\u201d Casey said. Some parents may also be able to claim part of their child-care expenses when filing their taxes. \u201cA lot of these subsidies and deductions are there to support someone that\u2019s going back to work, doing research and going back to school. So it\u2019s important that a person makes sure they qualify,\u201d Siwiec said. February is Your Money Month at BNN Bloomberg.

Rosemary Fell never intended to get into the shearing business, but she's happy she did. Fell is a custom shearer of llamas and alpacas, which belong to the camelid family of animals that also includes guanacos, vicu\u00f1as and camels. Fell, who lives on a farm spanning more than six acres in Denman Island, B.C. with her husband, four alpacas and eight llamas, came into the niche profession \"out of necessity\"\u00a0in 2001 when she acquired a few camelids and couldn't find anyone to shear them. So she bought shears, enrolled herself in courses and began grooming them herself. Before long, word spread, and Fell left her front-desk job at a marine-propeller shop to commit herself to the trade. Fifteen years later, Fell, now in her sixties and semi-retired, is still at it, travelling to small farms throughout Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands and Powell River on the mainland to shear camelids (and sometimes Angora goats). Since a \"good season\"\u00a0of shearing generates only about $15,000 of income for the year, Fell says she services the entire supply chain to \"help buy hay.\"\u00a0She not only shears the animals but also processes the fleece and turns the material into products like hats, duvets, shawls, gloves and socks. She also trims camelid toenails, maintains hooves and volunteers as a rescue coordinator, finding homes for llamas and alpacas who need one. Fell is one of many Canadians who have made an entrepreneurial leap into off-the-beaten-path careers while workers move into self-employment amid a disparate labour market. Below, Fell explains why she loves what she does and waxes poetic on the majesty of her fleecy friends. Q: How much does the shearing service cost? A: The industry standard to shear a llama is between $25 to $35. It's around $20 to shear an alpaca, for the whole animal. Isn't that something? When I take my poodle in to have her clipped, it costs me $80. She has to be clipped several times a year, whereas a llama or an alpaca, it's once a year and in some cases, once every two years. When the animals get older their fleece does not grow as fast. Q: How long does it take to shear the animals? A: An alpaca, less than 10 minutes. A llama, 10 to 15 minutes. But it depends on the animal and how well-behaved they are. Q: When's busy season? A: It's very seasonal, because you don't shear animals during the winter months because they have to be completely dry. Generally I start shearing in late April, really May, and the season usually doesn't run any later than August, because you want the animals to have a sufficient coat to keep them warm in the winter. Q: What is the best thing about your job? A: Working with this type of animal. They're intelligent, they're beautiful, they have a wonderful byproduct being their fleece. They're very efficient with their food source: They don't just eat grass, they eat shrubs and blackberries and salmon berries, so they're very good as far as keeping your farm neat and tidy. And it's nice not to have backpacks on the trail \u2014 let them carry it. If I have one regret, it is that I wish I would have started this occupation at a younger age. I've never enjoyed a job as much as I do working with camelids. Q: What is the most challenging thing about what you do? A: Llama and alpaca shearing is not for the faint of heart. It can be dirty, dusty and sometimes you may have to deal with unruly individuals. Not every camelid is well-trained.\u00a0The hours can be long, and your schedule can be totally buggered by a change in the weather. Q: What's something surprising about alpacas and llamas? A: I don't think people realize how very intelligent they are. You only have to show them how to do something a couple of times and they remember. They also have a memory like an elephant. They'll remember you even if you haven't seen them in 10 years. They will also remember if someone has done something bad to them. I've rescued animals that were mistreated and it takes a long time to rebuild their trust. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Under an agreement with Nova Scotia's arms length business agency, NSBI, Sydney Call Centre Inc. would be eligible for a smaller rebate if it creates fewer than 750 overall jobs. Anthony Marlowe bought the former ServiCom call centre in December in a court auction that was part of the company's bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. He outbid two other interested buyers, offering $1.5 million for the idled operation that had thrown about 600 people out of work. In an emailed response Monday, Marlowe said it was always his intent to apply for the business incentive. \"Leading up to the purchase we verified that we would be eligible, like any other new Nova Scotia business, to apply for a payroll rebate, which we did post-purchase,\" said Marlowe, who reopened the call centre last month. \"We advised Nova Scotia that we were going to move forward with opening in good faith for the workers and clients, despite Nova Scotia not having fully reviewed our application, and we requested that be strongly considered during the process to approve the payroll rebate.\" Business Minister Geoff MacLellan said the awarding of the rebate by NSBI was not part of any deal by the province to clinch the sale of the call centre's Sydney-based assets. \"There was never any commitment on anyone's part to give an incentive from the province,\" MacLellan said. He said Marlowe's company, MCI, and another of the court bidders did ask him at one point about \"potential tools available.\" He said they would have been in preliminary talks with NSBI about the possibility of help, but wouldn't have had a decision by the time of the court bidding process. \"This (purchase) decision was not made assuming that there would be a payroll rebate. He (Marlowe) was taking a chance that there may or may not have been support from the provincial government.\" MacLellan, whose riding is in the Sydney area, said the fact Marlowe applied to NSBI shows he has serious expansion plans. \"The growth is going to happen here, I'm absolutely confident,\" he said. \"I think it's good news all the way around, and again this is a tax rebate so he doesn't get anything if he doesn't produce those jobs.\" In mid-January, Marlowe confirmed that about 480 workers had returned to the operation, who NSBI says are included in the 750-jobs target. He also said that he has plans to further expand the call centre and hire an additional 50 full-time equivalent positions by the spring. He said the call centre had retained all of its major clients, including OnStar and AT&T, despite the bankruptcy proceedings. Marlowe's company had been in negotiations to buy the call centre in the weeks before its sudden closure Dec. 6. The purchase was a relief to a community that has suffered from chronic high unemployment. In its news release, NSBI said payroll rebates are only paid after a business has generated actual payroll for the Nova Scotia economy. It said for every dollar a company spends on payroll from jobs created in the province, it receives between five and 10 cents back. \u00a0"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Melissa Cheok and Adrian Leung", "title": "Canada 6th in the world at attracting talent", "description": "Switzerland once again clinched the top spot in a global survey on fostering and attracting talent, in a top 10 list that includes Canada but not the U.S., and no Asian nations.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-6th-in-the-world-at-attracting-talent-1.1170592", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Nov 19, 2018", "content": " Switzerland once again clinched the top spot in a global survey on fostering and attracting talent, in a top 10 list that includes Canada but not the U.S., and no Asian nations.

G7 leaders will be faced with the task of tackling the issue starting Friday when the annual leaders summit starts in Charlevoix, Que., with the Liberal government having prioritized the changing world of work as one of the gathering's central topics for discussion. This week's gathering in Switzerland of the International Labour Organization -- the UN agency that sets international labour standards and promotes decent work --\u00a0 ended without consensus about how governments should respond to the rise of the so-called gig economy. The global labour market is challenging traditional standards that are based on workers holding full-time jobs, as well as the social programs such jobs usually produce, Labour Minister Patty Hajdu said in an interview from the gathering. \"We're proud of some of the social protections that Canada has in place, but ... they are not rapidly evolving to address what one would consider to be these arrangements that make people more private contractors and less employees,\" she said Thursday in a conference call. Federal officials have for years been studying how to respond to a rise of cross-border telework and more workers making money through platforms like Airbnb, Uber and others that may be beyond the government's regulatory reach. A committee of deputy ministers also meets regularly to review economic trends and policies, and late last year was seized with how to respond to the growing automation of jobs and tasks that could make some workers obsolete. A presentation from the December meeting, prepared by the National Research Council, noted that cab and truck divers, construction and farm workers, factory machine operators and clerical jobs were most at risk of becoming automated by 2035. There is also little data about the size of an expanding online labour market where workers perform tasks from anywhere, for companies located around the world. \"It's very hard to regulate something when you don't know how big it is,\" said economist Armine Yalnizyan, who has studied the issue in depth. \"The little we do know is that it is perhaps more important than we think for the evolution of the Canadian labour market.\" Oxford University's online labour index has estimated that Canada amounts for about five per cent of work postings on English-language platforms, with the biggest demands in the area of software development and multimedia productions. Yalnizyan, president of the Canadian Association for Business Economics, said the shift away from full-time office work may be the future of the labour force. The question for governments, she said, is how to enforce minimal labour and wage standards when there aren't mutually agreed-upon global standards. There were multiple calls for countries to boost social protections for workers and provide citizens with guaranteed basic incomes during the ILO meeting of policy-makers and labour groups, but Hajdu said she wasn't convinced that a basic income alone will effectively deal with a global labour market. \"Those are the conversations that are really interesting and certainly just starting. No one has moved yet in terms of really addressing this in a formative way.\"\n"}, {"source": null, "author": "April Fong, BNN Bloomberg", "title": "Unemployed Canadians' struggle to find work getting worse: Survey", "description": "It\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for unemployed Canadians to find work.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/unemployed-canadians-struggle-to-find-work-getting-worse-survey-1.1081628", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 23, 2018", "content": " It\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for unemployed Canadians to find work.

The workforce is booming, said Alison McMahon, who runs Cannabis At Work, a staffing agency focused on the burgeoning industry. Right now, she's recruiting for positions in everything from growing and production to sales and marketing, all across the country. Stigma may once have kept people from applying for work with a cannabis company, but those perceptions have shifted and people are now excited about the opportunities, McMahon said. \"I think that the people, at this point, who are looking at the industry and are excited really see the upside and the growth potential,\" she said. \"More and more people are open to this topic, so it doesn't end up being that big of a deal.\" The buzz around Canadian pot is allowing companies to be picky and choose top talent, said Kerri-Lynn McAllister, chief marketing officer at Lift, a company that puts on cannabis events and runs a website sharing marijuana news and reviews. \"Because of all the excitement, it's really an opportunity for companies to pick up the A-players in business or whatever field they're operating in,\" said McAllister, speaking from first-hand experience. She recently left a job in the financial tech sector to join Lift. The industry has come out from the shadows recently, McAllister said, and that's allowing companies to attract business executives, tech wizards and marketing masters who are at the top of their game. Dozens of prospective employees came to meet McMahon and her staff at the Lift Cannabis Expo in Vancouver on Saturday, resumes in hand. Chad Grant said he's been working in construction, but wants to get a job growing marijuana. \"It's going to be a big industry, so I'd like to be on the ground floor type thing,\" he said. Working with marijuana is nothing new for some of the applicants. Grady Jay said he's been growing for the underground industry for years. Now he wants to transition to working for the legal market. \"I basically want to wake up and do what I love in the morning,\" Jay said. Experience is part of what marijuana companies are looking for, particularly when it comes to production, McMahon said, noting that experience could come from working in a commercial greenhouse or the black market. Successful applicants can expect to make salaries comparable to what similar industries offer, McMahon said. A general growing position would probably make about US$50,000 per year, she said, while a director of production could expect around US$100,000. \"Some people seem to think that because it's cannabis and because of all the growth, the salaries are going to be so high,\" McMahon said. \"And that's not the case. It's a bit more mainstream around the salaries.\" Anyone who wants to get into the industry should do their research, she added. \"We can have a really great candidate with a great skill set, but if they haven't looked into what's happening with the industry at all ... that can potentially be a bit of detriment,\" McMahon said."}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": "Ross Marowits", "title": "'They can run but they can't hide': Dodging wage hikes by relocating fruitless, labour leaders say", "description": "MONTREAL \u2014 Companies might not be able to dodge rising minimum wages by relocating even their most mobile workforces to lower wage provinces, but higher costs could accelerate the pace of automation.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/they-can-run-but-they-can-t-hide-dodging-wage-hikes-by-relocating-fruitless-labour-leaders-say-1.963958", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jan 10, 2018", "content": " MONTREAL \u2014 Companies might not be able to dodge rising minimum wages by relocating even their most mobile workforces to lower wage provinces, but higher costs could accelerate the pace of automation. \"It would be foolish of some employers to think that they can escape temporarily by moving their operations,\" said Canadian Labour Congress president Hassan Yussuff. While companies may get a short-term benefit, he said the reality is that minimum wages across the country are going to keep increasing.\n\r\nUnifor president Jerry Dias said pressure is being placed on every province to boost entry wages that mostly affect retail and service sectors, where relocation is not an option. \"This is spreading across the country like a very good epidemic and so they can run but they can't hide,\" he said in an interview. Some businesses have criticized the pace of wage hikes in Ontario and Alberta. On Jan .1, Ontario boosted hourly minimum wage by 20 per cent \u2014\u00a0from an $11.60 to $14. The rate will rise to $15 an hour in 2019. Alberta is expected to raise its minimum wage to $15 later this year. But the union leaders argue that higher wages will ultimately help businesses as low-income earners are more apt to spend all they earn and boost the economy. Jobs that can easily be done from any location, such as call-centre work, are theoretically most likely to shift locations. But the reality is that many of these positions pay much higher than entry wages, said Rob Campbell, president of ContactNB, which represents New Brunswick's large contact centre community. Air Canada (AC.TO)\u00a0and WestJet Airlines (WJA.TO) say they have adjusted the wages of their call-centre positions and have no plans to move these jobs to other provinces. Some companies may move jobs say from Ottawa to Gatineau, Que., but the numbers will be very small, said Fabian Lange, associate professor at McGill University's Department of Economics. But don't expect provinces to woo businesses with the promise of lower wages. He said it would be \"politically problematic\" for provinces with lower minimum wages to run big campaigns that emphasize how many low wage workers they have. \"It would be political suicide to do that because ultimately they're all going to be at $15,\" added Dias. Provinces cannot guarantee that their minimum wages won't unexpectedly rise, said University of Alberta economics associate professor Joseph Marchand. \"No one really saw Alberta's $15 minimum wage coming. In 2014, it was one of the three lowest minimum wage provinces,\" he said.\r\nMarchand said rising minimum wages could speed up a growing trend to automate with the addition of ATMs, restaurant order screens and grocery self-checkout lines. \"It's happening because technology is moving at a constant rate so that's making capital cheaper year by year, but then if you have a drastic shift in labour costs that's only going to speed up the process.\" A report from the Brookfield Institute on the Canadian jobs most at risk of automation found employees in the lowest-paid sectors, such as cashiers and food and beverage servers, are most vulnerable. Canadian retailers such as Dollarama Inc. (DOL.TO) and Metro Inc. (MRU.TO) have said they are speeding up studies of automation as they consider options for offsetting the pending wage increase. But the shift to automation over the last couple of decades has little to do with wage hikes, said labour representative Yussuff. \"There is recognition that more and more automation is coming to a lot of sectors in society and that's long before the minimum wage has been increased.\""}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Shane McNeil", "title": "Rosenberg: \u2018Question marks beneath the surface\u2019 of Canada\u2019s huge jobs beat", "description": "David Rosenberg has some questions about Canada\u2019s December jobs numbers.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/rosenberg-question-marks-beneath-the-surface-of-canada-s-huge-jobs-beat-1.960097", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jan 5, 2018", "content": " David Rosenberg has some questions about Canada\u2019s December jobs numbers. Statistics Canada reported on Friday that the country added 78,600 new positions in December and unemployment fell to its lowest level in 41 years, but the Gluskin Sheff + Associates Chief Economist has doubts about what the gains say about the health of the overall economy. \u201cAt face value the number looks great, but just like the November number, there\u2019s some question marks beneath the surface that has me thinking it\u2019s overstating the degree of strength in the economy,\u201d Rosenberg told BNN in an interview on Friday. \u201cIt seems to be just a very highly skewed report,\u201d Rosenberg added. \u201cI think if I told [BNN] viewers that there was almost no job growth in Ontario last month, that the unemployment rate here \u2014\u00a0in the economic engine of the country \u2014\u00a0didn\u2019t decline, but stayed at 5.5 per cent and that we actually had a modest contraction in manufacturing jobs, I don\u2019t think people would be running and saying, \u2018What a great number this was.\u2019\u201d However, CIBC Capital Markets executive director of macro strategy Bipan Rai, said the jobs data was a clear indication of Canada\u2019s economic strength. \u201cIt confirms what we already knew \u2014\u00a0that the Canadian labour market is extremely robust and on fire,\u201d Rai\u00a0told BNN. \u201cIf you look at it on a 12-month basis through the end of December, this is the best year for job growth since 2002 \u2014\u00a0and I think that says something about our economy.\u201d Rosenberg raised concerns about uneven gains with some of the data, pointing to an imbalance of part-time to full-time jobs growth, a concentration of job gains in the service sector, and disproportionate job gains in different parts of the country. Quebec and Alberta each added upwards of 26,000 jobs in December, combining for roughly two-thirds of the national gains. \u201cAlberta had its best number in many years. All of a sudden the Quebec unemployment rate has gone down to 4.9 per cent \u2026 We\u2019re in a whole new world altogether when Quebec emerges as the nation\u2019s paragon of fiscal and economic virtue, but that\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d he said. Rosenberg also said that the job gains don\u2019t add up, considering Canada\u2019s economic growth and productivity levels. \u201cIf you believe this employment number, either the Canadian economy is absolutely booming in excess of three per cent, which we know it\u2019s not from the spending data, or productivity is bearing the brunt and productivity is going down,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "Bank of Canada expects 60,000 fewer jobs by 2019 due to minimum wage increases", "description": "OTTAWA \u2014 The Bank of Canada estimates there will be about 60,000 fewer jobs by 2019 due to the increases in minimum wages across the country, but that labour income will be higher due to the increases.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bank-of-canada-expects-60-000-fewer-jobs-by-2019-due-to-minimum-wage-increases-1.957879", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jan 3, 2018", "content": " OTTAWA \u2014 The Bank of Canada estimates there will be about 60,000 fewer jobs by 2019 due to the increases in minimum wages across the country, but that labour income will be higher due to the increases.

The government says almost 69,000 spaces and counting were created in 2017, double the number in 2015 and a target the Liberals had vowed to reach in every year of their mandate. The Liberals have put an extra $113 million annually into the summer jobs program to double the number of placements each year to 70,000 from 35,000 for students working at not-for-profit organizations, public sector employers and small businesses with 50 or fewer employees. The annual program is one promoted by all parties as a way to help local businesses fill positions and give students on-the-job experience. The government is releasing the 2017 numbers Tuesday\u00a0as it opens applications for the 2018 edition of the program.

The decision stems from a controversy last year when officials approved tens of thousands of dollars for anti-abortion groups in at least two ridings. Labour Minister Patty Hajdu ordered a review of the program, including funding criteria, before setting the rules for this year. The new rules are not designed to ban faith-based groups from landing federal cash, she said. \"Applicants will be required to attest that both the job and the employer's core mandate respect individual human rights in Canada,\" she said. \"We're focused on meaningful work experience for young people that will help grow the economy and strengthen the middle class.\" Federal officials reviewing applications will have to determine if a group violates the new rules. Ultimately, Hajdu as the minister in charge of the program signs off on all funding. The head of Campaign Life Coalition, a group that opposes abortion, called the decision discriminatory because groups that advocate for abortion rights will still be able to receive money. Conservative MP Brad Trost, in an online video, said anyone who wants government funding has to agree with the Liberals on abortion, gay marriage and transgendered rights. \"That's discrimination.

The Labor Department said on Friday nonfarm payrolls decreased by 33,000 jobs last month amid a record drop in employment in the leisure and hospitality sector. The decline in payrolls was the first since September 2010. The Department said its analysis suggested that the net effect of Harvey and Irma, which wreaked havoc in Texas and Florida in late August and early September, was to \"reduce the estimate of total nonfarm payroll employment for September.\" \"While nonfarm payrolls declined last month, investors will find solace in a whole host of other labour market indicators that reveal an underlying labour market that continues to show evidence of resilience and continued tightening,\" said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. Economists had forecast payrolls increasing by 90,000 jobs last month. Payrolls are calculated from a survey of employers, which treats any worker who was not paid for any part of the pay period that includes the 12th of the month as unemployed. Many of the dislocated people will probably return to work. That, together with rebuilding and clean-up is expected to boost job growth in the coming months. Leisure and hospitality payrolls dived 111,000, the most since records started in 1939, after being unchanged in August. There were also decreases in retail and manufacturing employment last month. Stripping out the effects of the hurricanes, the labour market remains strong. The government revised data for August to show 169,000 jobs created that month instead of the previously reported 156,000. Harvey and Irma did not have an impact on the unemployment rate, which fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 4.2 per cent, the lowest since February 2001. The smaller survey of households from which the jobless rate is derived treats a person as employed regardless of whether they missed work during the reference week and were unpaid as result. The decrease in the unemployment rate reflected a 906,000 surge in household employment, which offset a 575,000 increase in the labour force. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street fell marginally. DISRUPTIONS BOOST WAGES Underscoring the disruptive impact of the hurricanes, the household survey showed 1.5 million people stayed at home in September because of the bad weather, the most since January 1996. About 2.9 million people worked part-time, the largest number since February 2014. The length of the average workweek was unchanged at 34.4 hours. With the hurricane-driven temporary unemployment concentrated in low-paying industries like retail and leisure and hospitality, average hourly earnings increased 12 cents US or 0.5 per cent in September after rising 0.2 per cent in August. That pushed the annual increase in wages to 2.9 per cent, the largest gain since December 2016, from 2.7 per cent in August. The mixed employment report should not change views the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. Fed Chair Janet Yellen cautioned last month that the hurricanes could \"substantially\" weigh on September job growth, but expected the effects would \"unwind relatively quickly.\" \"The Fed has been hyper-focused on wage growth, so the above-average increase will be a welcome relief, even if there is some storm impact embedded in the number,\" said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in Boston. \"We think that the report strengthens the Fed's December hike hand.\" The U.S. central bank said last month it expected \"labour market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.\" The Fed left interest rates unchanged in September, but signaled it expected one more hike by the end of the year. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year. Annual wage growth of at least 3.0 per cent is need to raise inflation to the Fed's two-per-cent target, analysts say. The employment report added to August consumer spending, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales data in suggesting that the hurricanes will dent economic growth in the third quarter. Economists estimate that the back-to-back storms, including Hurricane Maria which destroyed infrastructure in Puerto Rico last month, could shave at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter gross domestic product. Growth estimates for the July-September period are as low as a 1.8-per-cent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.1-per-cent rate in the second quarter. Private payrolls fell by 40,000 jobs, the biggest drop since February 2010. Manufacturing employment slipped by 1,000 jobs pulled down by declines at motor vehicle assembly and chemical plants as well as textile mills. Retail employment fell by 2,900 jobs as food stores payrolls tumbled 6,900. There were also declines in employment at department stores. Construction payrolls rose 8,000 in September as a 3,900 drop in jobs at homebuilding sites was offset by increases elsewhere."}, {"source": "Reuters", "author": "Solarina Ho and Fergal Smith", "title": "Loonie edges higher ahead of trade, employment data", "description": "TORONTO\u00a0- The Canadian dollar strengthened against the greenback on Wednesday ahead of top tier domestic data this week, and as the U.S. dollar softened against a basket of major currencies.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/loonie-edges-higher-ahead-of-trade-employment-data-1.875246", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 4, 2017", "content": " TORONTO\u00a0- The Canadian dollar strengthened against the greenback on Wednesday ahead of top tier domestic data this week, and as the U.S. dollar softened against a basket of major currencies.

The U.S. ride-hailing service has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services and concern among some regulators. It has been forced to quit several countries, such as Denmark and Hungary. Losing its licence in London, one of the world\u2019s wealthiest cities, is one of the U.S. technology firm\u2019s biggest setbacks so far. The London regulator cited the firm\u2019s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers. It can operate during its appeal, which could last months. Last year, two drivers successfully argued at a tribunal that Uber exerted significant control over them to provide an on-demand taxi service and had responsibilities in terms of workers\u2019 rights. At the two-day appeal hearing starting on Wednesday, Uber said its drivers were self-employed and worked the same way as those at long-established local taxi firms. The self-employed are entitled to only basic protections such as health and safety, but workers receive benefits such as the minimum wage, paid holidays and rest breaks. This would add to Uber\u2019s costs and bureaucracy across Britain. \"The position of drivers who use the App is materially identical to the [familiar and long-established]\u00a0position of self-employed private hire drivers who operate under the auspices of traditional minicab firms,\" Uber said in its court submission. Minicabs, or private hire vehicles, sprung up in Britain more than 50 years ago. Minicabs cannot be hailed in the street like traditional taxis, but can be booked for specific times and places via a registered office with a call or via the Internet. PROTEST MARCH Uber\u2019s lawyer Dinah Rose said she would not discuss the firm\u2019s loss of licence except to say,\u00a0\"It\u2019s quite apparent from that decision that Uber is right to point out to this tribunal the regulatory constraints under which it operates.\" Around 200 trade union-led protesters marched through central London on Wednesday against what they called \u201cprecarious labour\" in the \"gig economy,\"\u00a0where people work for various employers at the same time without fixed contracts. \"All Uber wants to do is flood the market with drivers, with no responsibility nor liability \u2014\u00a0keep reducing fares to attract more customers, while drivers carry all the risks,\" Yaseen Aslam, one of the two drivers involved in the tribunal claim, told the protest. Some, however, opposed the decision by London\u2019s regulator to strip Uber of its licence, saying the firm should be allowed to operate but must grant workers\u2019 rights. In a bid to strengthen itself in Britain, Uber said on Wednesday it was seeking to appoint a U.K. chairman, in a newly created non-executive role which it began recruiting for around six weeks ago. In a further challenge for Uber, law firm Leigh Day said it would represent a female driver who says Uber is putting her and other women at risk as drivers do not know the passenger\u2019s destination until they get in the car, and that could mean travelling to a remote or unsafe area. An Uber spokesman said drivers could cancel trips without penalty and did not have to go to a particular area if they did not want to. He said many women worked for Uber due to its safety features. \"One of the main reasons why women choose to drive with Uber is because of the safety features in the app. All trips are GPS tracked and a driver is able to share a live map of their trip with a friend or loved one,\u201d he said."}, {"source": "Reuters", "author": "Lucia Mutikani", "title": "U.S. job growth slows in August after two months of gains", "description": "U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August after two straight months of hefty gains, but the pace of increase should be more than sufficient for the Federal Reserve to announce a plan to start trimming the massive bond portfolio it built to support the economy.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-job-growth-slows-in-august-after-two-months-of-gains-1.844873", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Sep 1, 2017", "content": " U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August after two straight months of hefty gains, but the pace of increase should be more than sufficient for the Federal Reserve to announce a plan to start trimming the massive bond portfolio it built to support the economy. Persistently sluggish wage growth could, however, make the U.S. central bank cautious about raising interest rates gain this year. The Labor Department said on Friday nonfarm payrolls increased by 156,000 last month. The economy created 399,000 jobs in June and July. \"We see nothing here that prevents the Fed from initiating its balance-sheet reduction plan at the September meeting,\" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Average hourly earnings rose three cents or 0.1 per cent after advancing 0.3 per cent in July, keeping the year-on-year gain in wages at 2.5 per cent for a fifth consecutive month. August's moderation in employment growth, which pushed payroll gains below the 176,000 monthly average for this year likely reflects a seasonal quirk as well as a dearth of qualified workers. Over the past several years, the initial August job count has tended to exhibit a weak bias, with revisions subsequently showing strength. \"There has been a clear tendency for the August data to be underreported initially and revised up later,\" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. The department said Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas, had no \"discernable\" effect on payrolls as the disaster struck after the survey period for the August employment report. Economists say the storm could hurt September payrolls if the disruption from the flooding lingers. With job growth slowing, the unemployment rate ticked up one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.4 per cent. Economists had forecast payrolls increasing by 180,000 jobs last month. Still, August's gains were far more than the 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Underscoring labor market strength, manufacturing payrolls surged by 36,000 job, with the motor vehicle sector adding 13,700 positions. Construction employment jumped by 28,000 jobs last month. That was the largest gain since February and came despite a lull in homebuilding activity and home sales. While last month's job gains likely keeps the Fed on course to outline a plan to start shrinking its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting, tepid wage growth casts doubts on a December interest rate increase. The anemic wage gains came on the heels of a report on Thursday showing the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.4 per cent in the 12 months to July - the smallest rise in just over 1-1/2 years. U.S. financial markets are pricing in a roughly 36 per cent probability of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting according to CME Group's FedWatch program. The Fed has increased borrowing costs twice this year. Prices for U.S. Treasuries initially rose on the data before giving up gains. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stock index futures rose. Lack of strong wage growth raises concerns about the sustainability of a recent surge in consumer spending, which spurred the fastest economic growth in more than two years in the second quarter. The labor market has continued to strengthen even as hopes for a promised tax cut this year have faded. Republican President Donald Trump on Wednesday reiterated his longstanding call for slashing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15 per cent from 35 per cent at a time when lawmakers believe they could be lucky to bring it down to 25 per cent. The Republican-led U.S. Congress faces a tough challenge in passing tax reform legislation, having already failed to deliver on healthcare reform sought by Trump. The private services sector led the slowdown in job gains last month, with payrolls rising 95,000. That was the smallest increase since March and followed an increase of 179,000 jobs in July. Retail employment increased 800 last month as a surge in hiring at building material and garden supply stores was offset by continued layoffs at clothing stores. Payrolls at nonstore retailers rose only 700 despite online retailer\u00a0Amazon.com\u00a0holding a series of job fairs to hire about 50,000 workers last month. \u00a0"}, {"source": "Reuters", "author": "Lucia Mutikani", "title": "U.S. jobless claims rise amid tightening labour market", "description": "The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a tightening labor market.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-jobless-claims-rise-amid-tightening-labour-market-1.826788", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Aug 10, 2017", "content": " The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a tightening labor market.

Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be unchanged at 240,000 in the latest week. With the labor market near full employment, there is probably limited room for claims to continue declining. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 127 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The unemployment rate is 4.3 percent. Labor market tightness could encourage the Federal Reserve to announce a plan to start unwinding its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its policy meeting next month. A Labor Department official said there were no special factors influencing the claims data and that no states had been estimated. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,000 to 241,000 last week, the lowest level since May. The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls increased by 209,000 jobs in July. The economy has added 1.29 million jobs this year.

Businesses are strongly opposed to the increase, particularly the quick pace of it. A coalition of groups including the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, Restaurants Canada and the Canadian Franchise Association are sending Premier Kathleen Wynne a letter Monday, slamming the \"arbitrary\" increase. \"Many Ontario employers, especially small businesses, are now considering closing their business because they do not have the capacity to successfully manage such reforms,\" they write. \"The business community was wholly aligned with your government's previous approach, which allowed for increases to the minimum wage that were predictable and protected against arbitrary political decision-making.\"  Business groups had been calling for the government to first perform an economic analysis, and have now commissioned their own, which the coalition said will be complete next month. \"To plan effectively and protect jobs, employers need predictability and time to adjust the cost of other inputs where we can,\" the coalition writes. \"There is no way to absorb and adjust to a 32 per cent hit in less than 18 months.\" Karl Wirtz, the CEO and founder of a packaging company in Brampton, Ont., said he may have to consider bankruptcy. \"This is something that has got me scared out of my mind,\" he said. The minimum wage increase will mean an extra $1 million for WG Pro-Manufacturing's 200 -- soon to be 245 -- employees, Wirtz said. About half of them make minimum wage and the rest will have to get commensurate pay bumps, he said. The company, which does co-packaging for foods and confectionery products, is focused on growth, Wirtz said, and as such is operating within tight margins. He hasn't budgeted for an extra million dollars a year and is locked into contracts with big customers. The only way he sees out of the pricing structure is bankruptcy. \"I want all of our workers to have a good income and good ability to have a good lifestyle,\" Wirtz said. \"I respect that. Truthfully, I do. But you have to give businesses an opportunity to phase it into their program. So yes, let's shoot for $14, let's shoot for $15, but scale it over the next coming years.\" Economic Development Minister Brad Duguid said the government is sensitive to the needs of businesses, smaller ones in particular. \"We want to ensure there's not unintended consequences, because these are complex policies,\" he said. \"If there's more work to be done in terms of the details and potential unintended consequences, that's something we're certainly happy to do with our business community.\" A recent study out of Seattle made headlines for concluding that its minimum wage increase was actually detrimental to low-income workers. But its methodology has been criticized and it bucks the trend of similar studies concluding the opposite, noted Canadian economist Lars Osberg. He is one of 50 economists in Canada who just signed a letter in support of a $15 minimum wage. \"For many years, many in the economics profession were also very concerned about this possibility of disemployment of people with minimum wage jobs,\" said Osberg, an economics professor at Dalhousie University. \"A whole raft of new studies in the last 20 years have indicated that disemployment effect is very small...On average you could say it's small to negligible.\" While businesses' concerns are understandable, he said, studies show that increasing the minimum wage increases people's purchasing power, as well as consumption and economic activity in general. \"So in that sense it's stimulative to the macroeconomy,\" he said.

Yet two months after the panel delivered its final report to Labour Minister Patty Hajdu, the Liberals have yet to release the document.\n\r\nIn an interview last week, Hajdu said the report would be released very soon. She said the government was working out the logistics of the release, including how it would be released, where the announcement would take place and \u2014\u00a0most importantly \u2014\u00a0when the public would see the document.\n\r\nHajdu said she expected the report to become the basis of a long-term plan for the government.\n\r\n\"I see the report as a real foundation and starting point, but it's not sort of the end of the story. There's a need to make sure we are continually evolving as youth evolve and as the job market evolves.\"\n\r\nThe Liberals second budget put an emphasis on skills training and getting students more on-the-job experience to help navigate a labour market defined by part-time and precarious employment and job churn.\n\r\nBut just how bad the situation is for young workers is the subject of some debate among federal officials.\n\r\nInternal government documents suggest that concerns about the number of young workers caught in part-time employment \u2014\u00a0usually considered to be precarious employment \u2014\u00a0may be overblown. The commentary on a December research paper from a national think-tank cites internal government research that shows part-time work has been relatively stable relative to the overall economy over the last two decades, meaning jumps in part-time work might just be a result of an increasing population. Even though youth are over-represented in part-time or temporary work like casual, seasonal and contract jobs, it may simply be because it represents a stepping stone towards more stable employment, say the documents, obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act."}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "Personal Investor: Get an edge on the summer job market", "description": "Dale Jackson", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/personal-investor-get-an-edge-on-the-summer-job-market-1.756553", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 19, 2017", "content": " Students are getting a hard lesson on the summer job market.

Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 211,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday, well above the monthly average of 185,000 for this year and a jump from the gain of 79,000 in March. Job gains were driven by a surge in hiring in the leisure and hospitality sector as well as business and professional services. The drop of one-tenth of a percentage point in the unemployment rate took it to its lowest level since May 2007. The decline reflected both an increase in hiring and people leaving the labor force. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell to 62.9 percent from an 11-month high of 63 percent. The rebound in hiring supports the Federal Reserve's contention that the pedestrian 0.7 percent annualized economic growth pace in the first quarter was likely \"transitory,\" and its optimism that economic activity would expand at a \"moderate\" pace. The Fed on Wednesday kept its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and said it expected labor market conditions would \"strengthen somewhat further.\" The U.S. central bank raised its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more increases this year. Average hourly earnings rose seven cents, or 0.3 percent, last month, partly because of a calendar quirk. While that lowered the year-on-year increase to 2.5 percent, the lowest since August 2016, there are signs that wage growth is accelerating as labor market slack diminishes. A government report last week showed private sector wages recorded their biggest gain in 10 years in the first quarter. NEAR FULL EMPLOYMENT The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Job growth averaged 178,000 per month in the first quarter. With the labor market expected to hit a level consistent with full employment this year, payroll gains could slow amid growing anecdotal evidence that firms are struggling to find qualified workers. Construction payrolls rose 5,000 last month and manufacturing employment advanced by 6,000 jobs. Leisure and hospitality payrolls jumped by 55,000 in April. Professional and business services payrolls rose by 39,000. Retail payrolls gained 6,300 after two straight months of declines. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc <JCP.N>, Macy's Inc <M.N> and Abercrombie & Fitch <ANF.N> have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations. Government payrolls jumped 17,000 last month. Other labor market measures also showed strength last month. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 8.6 percent from 8.9 percent in March.

Canada saw strong jobs growth in the second half of 2016. While much of that came from part-time work, suggesting a deterioration in job quality, economists expect full-time work to be stronger this year. Indeed, the number of full-time jobs has increased by 141,000 since last August, Statistics Canada said. \"We've had a very good run here from employment and I think it's sending a pretty convincing signal that the economy is starting to improve,\" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

The central bank has said there is significant labor market slack underlying the unemployment rate. The bank is expected to hold rates at 0.50 percent into next year.

Nonfarm payrolls rose by 156,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. The gains, however, are more than sufficient to absorb new entrants into the labour market. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the work-age population. Employers hired 19,000 more workers than previously reported in October and November. \"Job creation and overall labour market conditions remain solid. With the potential for stronger fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending and tax cuts, job creation appears likely to remain on a solid footing in 2017,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The economy created 2.16 million jobs in 2016. Average hourly earnings increased 10 cents or 0.4 per cent in December after slipping 0.1 per cent in November. That pushed the year-on-year increase in earnings to 2.9 per cent, the largest gain since June 2009, from 2.5 per cent in November. While the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7 per cent from a nine-year low of 4.6 per cent in November, that was because more people entered the labour force, a sign of confidence in the labour market. Economists had forecast payrolls rising by 178,000 jobs last month. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. \u00a0 Other data on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 6.8 per cent to US$45.2 billion in November as imports rose to their highest level in more than a year on higher oil prices. The employment report added to data ranging from housing to manufacturing and auto sales in suggesting that President-elect Donald Trump is inheriting a strong economy from the Obama administration. The labour market momentum is likely to be sustained amid rising business and consumer confidence. Trump, who takes over from President Barack Obama on Jan. 20, has pledged to increase spending on the country's aging infrastructure, cut taxes and relax regulations. These measures are expected to boost growth this year. But the proposed expansionary fiscal policy stance could increase the budget deficit. That, together with faster economic growth and a labour market that is expected to hit full employment this year could raise concerns about the Fed falling behind the curve on interest rate increases. Last month's wage growth left it just shy of the 3.0 per cent to 3.5 per cent range that economists say is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2.0 per cent target. \"This is coming well before any fiscal stimulus hits. It plays to the idea that the Fed may already be behind the curve, not least because the impetus from lower oil prices has turned more inflationary as well,\" said Alan Ruskin, FX Research head at Deutsche Bank in New York. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last month by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 per cent to 0.75 per cent. The Fed forecast three rate hikes this year. FACTORY JOBS INCREASE A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell one-tenth to a more than 8-1/2-year low of 9.2 per cent. Employment growth in 2016 averaged 180,000 jobs per month, down from an average gain of 229,000 per month in 2015. The slowdown in job growth is consistent with a labour market that is near full employment. There has been an increase in employers saying they cannot fill vacant positions because they cannot find qualified workers. The skills shortage has been prominent in the construction industry. \"The pool is all but drained especially for skilled workers. We can't bring factory jobs back because there's no one out there to run them,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. The labour force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose one-tenth of percentage point to 62.7 per cent in December. The participation rate remains near multi-decade lows. Some of the decline reflects demographic changes. December's job gains were broad, with manufacturing payrolls rising 17,000 after declining for four straight months. Construction payrolls fell 3,000 in December after three consecutive months of increases. Retail sector employment rose 6,300 after increasing 19,500 in November. Department store giants Macy's (M.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) this week reported a drop in holiday sales. Macy's said it planned to cut 10,000 jobs beginning this year.

I've always believed in playing to your strengths, having no regrets and life-long learning. And, at the heart of all of this, is that you have to find your passion in your job search. While \u201cpassion\u201d comes from the Greek word for suffering, today it tends to mean emotion, determination and boundless enthusiasm. Passion will help drive you to your goals and even more important, it will help get you on the road to happiness. You have heard this before: If you love something or have a true passion for it, it doesn't feel like work because it is so easy to spend time doing it. The best piece of advice I received long ago was, go after what you love and do it. Don't be afraid to try new things, live every moment of your life and your passion will grow from there. PRACTICE YOUR PASSION Early on in your career, pick the company that you want to work for. Look for organizations that will allow you to grow, develop and stretch in ways that help nurture that passion. As you progress through your career, you can then shift your strategy and pick the person or team you want to work with. Rarely do people retire from their first job. But remember, change requires courage and there will be turning points in your career. Your career may be similar to a screenwriter for a film: In any given story, there are usually two or three pivotal moments that can swing the story in either direction. It isn't right or wrong, however, to think through those decisions so that you find a clear sense of direction. In today's workplace, you have to zig and zag. No one goes straight to the top. Finally, remove all the barriers holding you back from going after your dream job. Self-belief leads to self- confidence. If you take the time to figure out who you are, what you like and what you value, the odds on finding your passion dramatically increases. If someone else believes in you \u2013 but you don't believe in yourself \u2013 then what? If you believe in yourself and no one else does, you can still go on and achieve your goals. Get excited about 2017. Your career can be a source of pride or a source of frustration; a lifelong adrenaline rush or a source of anxiety.

The dos and don'ts of asking for more money", "description": "TORONTO -- About a year into her first full-time gig out of university, Jordann Brown was startled to discover she was earning less than most other Canadians in the same type of position.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/want-a-raise-the-dos-and-don-ts-of-asking-for-more-money-1.549896", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Aug 18, 2016", "content": " TORONTO -- About a year into her first full-time gig out of university, Jordann Brown was startled to discover she was earning less than most other Canadians in the same type of position. Saddled with about $38,000 in student and car loans at the time, she'd jumped on the job offer without doing much research. But later on while scouring the Internet for tips on how to earn more, she came across salary-comparison sites detailing just how much she was in fact being underpaid. The somewhat emboldened but mainly nervous 22-year-old started making a plan to ask her boss for a wage increase. \"I decided to do it because I knew there was a good chance that I could argue successfully for a raise,\" said Brown, now 26, who works in marketing and also runs her own personal finance blog. After swaying her boss with some compelling arguments, followed by an uncomfortably long pause, her annual pay was increased by about 10 per cent. It may be a nerve-wracking experience to ask an employer for more money, but a well-prepared individual presenting a strong business case of how they add to the company's financials can be persuasive. Preparation is key, notes David King, district president of Canadian staffing agency Robert Half. In addition to knowing comparable salaries, he says, employees looking for an income boost need to highlight ways they've helped the organization increase revenues, boost efficiencies or lower costs. \"When you can draw a correlation to your value and the bottom line of the organization,\" said King, \"it certainly helps your position.\" In Brown's case, she came prepared to her meeting with lists of all her completed projects over the past year and their positive impact on the company. She also compiled good customer feedback and the skills she'd acquired since her start date. But how much to ask for -- Brown's 10 per cent raise notwithstanding -- will entirely depend on each person's situation, says Alan Kearns, founder of job coaching agency CareerJoy. \"It could be an extremely large raise. It could be a small raise,\" he notes. Variables include the worker's starting and current salary, and total compensation package -- as well as factors like if they led a project to an unexpectedly large profit. There are also some common benchmarks to consider, Kearns adds, like inflation. In 2016, the average pay bump for non-unionized employees will be 2.6 per cent, according to a projection in the Conference Board of Canada's most recent compensation planning outlook report that surveyed 370 organizations. Another salary tactic is to ask for more than the employee is willing to settle for, says Kearns, and create some wiggle room for negotiations. However you choose to stack the deck in your favour, just be sure you've taken the time to practice your spiel, says King. You don't want to stumble through a negotiation. Employees may also want to consider asking for things beyond money, he adds. Workers may be able to, for example, negotiate flexible work hours or extra vacation time in lieu of increased pay. It's best, however, to avoid bringing up personal circumstances, King stresses -- even if that's the reason behind the discussion. It's not up to an employer to pay more for the same job when an employee decides to buy an expensive vehicle, take a large vacation or purchase a costly home, says King. Another bad move is getting emotional. Like she did, Brown suggests not waiting too long to ask for a raise, as it allows pent-up resentment to transform into a demanding, frustrated tone during salary negotiations. \"It shouldn't be an argument,\" agrees King, \"and that's best avoided with the homework that's done proactively.\" Despite taking all the right steps, a jump in pay won't always come your way. If it's down to your performance at work, and not company finances, Brown suggests creating a plan to enhance your skill set -- for example, through online certifications. But if the boss makes it clear there's no opportunity to progress, that's another situation. \"Then it might be time to quietly start job searching,\" she said."}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "Canada's job market still hasn't recovered from recession: OECD report", "description": "The OECD says Canada's labour market is doing better than in many other countries but it hasn't fully recovered to pre-recession levels.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-s-job-market-still-hasn-t-recovered-from-recession-oecd-report-1.522566", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jul 7, 2016", "content": " The OECD says Canada's labour market is doing better than in many other countries but it hasn't fully recovered to pre-recession levels.

The \"highly skilled workforce expert panel\" was set up last December to develop an integrated strategy to better link the education system with the future job needs of the province's economy. The panel recommends better partnerships between educators and employers to \"bridge the gap between the skills industries need and what the workforce offers,\" and suggests all students get \"experiential learning\" or work co-op placements. \"I completely support this recommendation because I believe that young people need to have experiential learning opportunities, both in the elementary and secondary panels, and in the post-secondary education panel,\" said Premier Kathleen Wynne. Former education minister Sean Conway, who headed the expert panel, said Ontario introduced the idea of university co-op programs to the world, and must expand it. \"There needs to be specific targets so that all high school students have at least one work experiential learning opportunity before they graduate the Kindergarten-to-Grade 12 system,\" he said. \"And all students in post secondary education need to have at least one experiential learning opportunity before they graduate.\" David Billson, president and CEO of Ellipsis Digital in London, Ont., said the region's technology and digital media sector \"is starved for well-trained talent,\" and companies are having trouble recruiting new employees. \"One of the hardest things for me as a business owner is to know that our unemployment rate is hovering around seven per cent in the region, when our local technology firms have between 400 to 1,000 open jobs,\" said Billson. \"Helping us to be able to fill our talent gap will aid in ensuring a bright future for our sector.\" Ontario has to compete with American jurisdictions where there are tens of thousands of high-tech jobs going unfilled because of a lack of skilled workers, warned Conway. \"The problem that we face is also an opportunity, but it's faced by others not very far away,\" he said. Some parents don't want their kids to take a co-op course because they think it takes time away from other academic pursuits, and the government needs to help convince them that work experience is crucial to help students succeed, said Wynne. \"Getting this right is critical to the future success of our province and our economy,\" she said. \"And, yes, it's crucial to the success of the individuals and the families involved, but that's in the context of success for the province.\" Important labour market information is not as accessible as it should be, added Wynne. \"(It recommends) giving employers and job seekers better access to critical information such as where the jobs are and which skills employers are looking for,\" she said. The panel agreed that educators and employers need better information on the labour market, and the more local the data the better, added Conway. \"We don't have enough understanding locally, regionally or sectorally on the specific nature of the demand pull of the local and regional economy,\" he said. Advanced Education and Skills Development Minister Deb Matthews called the expert panel's report \"an aspirational document\" that will help build an education system that reflects the needs of Ontario employers, and promised to act on its recommendations. \"We're saying we want to see 100 per cent of students graduating from high school and everyone graduating from a post secondary institution having that work integrated learning opportunity,\" she said. \"We now have a clear plan of action.

France has a 35-hour work week and recently gave employees the right to disconnect from email after they leave the office. Sweden, meanwhile, offers workers a minimum five weeks paid vacation time. While Prime Minister Justin Trudeau managed to sneak a day off during a recent work trip abroad to celebrate his wedding anniversary, that kind of flexibility isn't afforded to most working Canadians despite work-life balance being a hot topic for years. And many Scandinavian companies have implemented a system of flexible hours and working from home as management encourages employees to craft schedules that fit their personal needs. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has found that average the Canadian works 1,704 hours annually, more than in Germany and Australia although less than those apparently tireless workers in the United States. But as younger generations in Canada move into the workforce and demand more scheduling flexibility and clearer divisions between the office and home, companies will have to do more than just talk the talk and actually implement concrete policies to attract and keep talented workers, says one researcher who's studied the issue here for more than 20 years. \"Balance is not going to be an optional discussion point pretty soon,\" said Linda Duxbury, a professor at Carleton University's Sprott School of Business. \"To keep younger talent, you're going to have to deliver on it.\" Employees crave a supportive work culture that enables a work-life balance, said Lidia Pawlikowski, a senior consultant of health and wellness at Morneau Shepell, a human resources consulting company founded by the father of Canada's current finance minister, Bill Morneau. Workers want to take guilt-free lunch breaks, squeeze a workout into their day and not remain glued to their smartphones after hours, she said. They seek work arrangements that allow them to get their work done, said Pawlikowski, but offer adequate time off and flexibility to care for any children or ailing elderly relatives in their lives. That type of workplace culture is often discussed but rarely achieved, said Duxbury, who has co-authored two national surveys on work-life balance and is working on a third. \"All of the indicators are going the wrong way,\" she said. Her 2012 study surveyed more than 25,000 full-time Canadian employees and discovered that employees' perception of work flexibility and management support remained relatively unchanged since her 2001 findings. In 2012, 27 per cent of respondents said they believed they had high flexibility, while 45 per cent acknowledged high managerial support. But she says the data for her latest study, expected to be released in several months, is likely to show those numbers have dropped. Many firms have no problem talking about balance, but are still too focused on evaluating employee productivity through hours worked, in-office presence and how tethered they are to their smartphones outside the office, she said. Some companies are also imitating Silicon Valley firms and offering perks like catered meals and dry-cleaning services -- but those types of initiatives actually erode work-life balance, Duxbury said. \"Their aim is to help people work more, not less,\" added Gerry Ledford, a senior research scientist at the University of South Carolina's Center for Effective Organizations, referring to those kinds of in-office perks. Employers offer them so that their employees never need to leave the workplace and can work as close to 24/7 as they're willing, he said. In the future, Duxbury said, companies that are failing to implement true work-life balance strategies will find themselves struggling to attract and retain talented workers. Younger Canadians entering the labour force fear the type of workplace culture their parents endured and are demanding more flexibility from employers, she said. They'll also be more likely to grapple with the double whammy of not only raising children, but caring for their aging parents as the baby boomer demographic grows older. And before long, Canada will be dealing with a shortage of workers, she said. By 2020, for example, there won't be enough qualified people to fill more than 218,000 new information and communication technology jobs in Canada, according to the Information and Communications Technology Council. \"I think that's when balance is finally going to start,\" Duxbury said. \"They're going to start taking this issue seriously.\""}, {"source": "Reuters", "author": null, "title": "Boeing to lay off 211 U.S. workers", "description": "Boeing Co said on Thursday it plans to lay off 211 employees in Washington state on July 22, a group that includes information technology workers that Boeing is letting go in a cost-cutting drive.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/boeing-to-lay-off-211-u-s-workers-1.500138", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jun 2, 2016", "content": " Boeing Co said on Thursday it plans to lay off 211 employees in Washington state on July 22, a group that includes information technology workers that Boeing is letting go in a cost-cutting drive.

Three years ago, the fashion design graduate was working as a product developer at Lululemon, earning a good salary and living in what she calls \"the best Canadian city for fashion.\" But she was also paying $900 a month in rent, saving little and saddled with student debt. \"I was a salaried employee living in a tiny bachelor apartment with a view of a parking lot,\" she said. \"I kind of knew that I would have to, at some point, leave Vancouver if I wanted to own property. I just knew what the market was like. That was kind of always in my mind, even though I did end up getting, pretty quickly after I graduated university, a good job.\" Despite the fact that her industry was booming in Vancouver -- in addition to Lululemon, Arcteryx and Mountain Equipment Co-op have head offices in the city -- Vilches decided to move to Calgary. She got a job at FGL\u00a0Sports in 2014 and has since paid off her student loans, bought a car and started building her RRSP. The 29-year-old's experience is familiar to many young professionals in British Columbia. The province, led by Metro Vancouver, topped the country in job creation last month, with year-over-year employment growth reaching a stunning 4.9 per cent compared to the national gain of 0.8 per cent, Statistics Canada says. Despite the jobs boom, many young workers getting hired still can't afford to live in the city, observers say. \"I'd love to move back to Vancouver because that's where my industry is biggest,\" said Vilches. \"But if I move back to Vancouver, I have to make sacrifices, and that would be not owning property, maybe ever. And that's a really big sacrifice for me because that's something that I want.\" Bryan Yu, a senior economist at Central 1 Credit Union, said the number of jobs in professional, scientific and technical services -- including fashion design -- grew about four per cent over the past year in B.C. Health care and social assistance grew 8.1 per cent, while information, culture and recreation, a category that includes Vancouver's growing technology sector, expanded 12.6 per cent. The strong housing market appears to be driving a 7.6 per cent gain in construction and a 16.1 per cent jump in business and building services, while a tourism boom and the low Canadian dollar seem to be pushing big gains in retail, wholesale trade, accommodations and food services, Yu said. \"There's really jobs being created across the board,\" he said. \"There are definitely gains occurring in the lower-paid sectors, but also we are seeing broad-based job gains across industries.\" B.C.'s unemployment rate fell to 5.8 per cent in April, down from 6.5 per cent in March and falling below all other provinces for the first time since 1976, Statistics Canada says. Part of the reason B.C. is doing so much better than the rest of Canada is because its economy isn't vulnerable to changes in the price of oil, Yu said. Plummeting oil prices have led to drastic job losses in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador. But Yu said the story outside B.C.'s south coast is very different. There has been little new investment in mining or natural gas, and last month, agriculture jobs dropped 11.9 per cent, while resource extraction dipped 6.2 per cent, he said. \"Vancouver is doing very well in terms of job growth, and to a lesser extent Victoria, but the rest of the province is still showing signs of job loss from a year ago,\" he said. Ken Peacock, chief economist and vice-president of the B.C. Business Council, said Metro Vancouver residents struggle with low or medium average incomes because the city has relatively few large corporate employers, which tend to pay higher wages. \"We do tend, in the Lower Mainland and Metro Vancouver, to struggle a little bit on the income front, and that is particularly true when you contrast it with housing prices,\" he said. But Peacock noted that even high-income earners are challenged by Metro Vancouver's housing market. The benchmark price for detached properties was $1.4 million in April, a 30-per-cent increase from the previous year, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver says. Keane Lim, a 29-year-old technical writer at a Richmond software company, said salaries haven't kept up with the cost of living in Metro Vancouver. It's possible that Vancouver is such an attractive place to live that employers don't feel they have to pay more, he said. \"People like to compare Vancouver to San Francisco, like, 'Oh, house prices are almost as bad as San Francisco,' but in San Francisco, you can make twice what you make here in U.S. dollars.\" He added that his parents immigrated to B.C. at a young age, studied, worked, saved money, bought a house and had a family. That's what he wants for his life, too, he said. \"You hear about millennials and how they think they're entitled to everything. I don't really think I'm entitled to a house, but it just seems impossible. It's not even realistic.

Claims for the prior week were unrevised. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast initial claims falling to 275,000 in the latest week. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong job market, for 64 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1973. While the two consecutive weeks of decline helped to unwind some of the jump in claims between late April and early May, the trend in jobless claims has become less favorable. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,750 to 278,500 last week. Economists blame a range of factors for the recent spike in claims, including the different timing of school spring breaks, which often makes it difficult to adjust the data. An ongoing strike by Verizon (VZ.N) workers as well as possible disruptions to manufacturing activity in the wake of recent earthquakes in Japan have also been cited. Economists expect the strike by the about 40,000 Verizon employees will hurt May payrolls because they would be considered unemployed as they would not have received a paycheck during the survey period. The government will release its closely watched employment report next Friday.

The number of beneficiaries in the province, where the country's vast oil sands are located, shot up 78.9 percent compared to a year ago. In Saskatchewan, the number of people on benefits increased for the fourth month in a row, up 3.5 percent to 16,740 and up 38.6 percent on an annual basis.

The number of Canadians putting forward employment insurance claims decreased by 4.5 percent in February. It was the first decline since September last year and a potentially encouraging sign as the number of claims gives an indication of the number of people who could become beneficiaries.

Still, the report was the latest indication the economy grew strongly in the first quarter after struggling with the oil price shock last year. Separate data on Friday showed activity in the housing sector held up in March, with housing starts declining less than expected to 204,251 units.\u00a0 The economy created 40,600 jobs in March, Statistics Canada said, far surpassing economists' expectations for 10,000, and driven by a 35,300 increase in full-time jobs. The unemployment rate declined to 7.1 percent, its lowest level since December. It was the last major piece of domestic data ahead of next week's Bank of Canada interest rate decision. The central bank is expected to keep rates at 0.5 percent given strong first-quarter data. Even with this week's disappointing trade report, growth is expected to surpass the central bank's 1 percent forecast for the quarter. While economists pointed to the volatile nature of the report, they were generally encouraged. \"You always take the latest print with a grain of salt, this one with a mountain of salt,\" said Derek Holt, economist at Scotiabank. \"But the trend nevertheless supports a much more encouraging picture than one might have thought given the downdraft in commodities.\" The Canadian dollar strengthened against the greenback after the report. The service sector contributed the most to the labor market's improvement, led by a 24,900 increase in jobs in healthcare and social assistance. Economists had expected to see a rebound in the sector in March after an outsized decline the previous month. There were gains in other service industries as well, including accommodation and food, and professional services. The goods-producing part of the economy fared poorly, with declines in manufacturing and construction. The natural resources sector continued to shed jobs with a loss of 2,100 positions. The sector has seen a more than 4 percent decline in jobs in the past year as commodity prices have slumped. Data from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation continued to show the regional divide in the housing market with starts declining in the oil-exposed prairie provinces but gaining in Ontario.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 215,000 last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. Data for January and February was revised slightly down to show 1,000 fewer jobs created than previously reported. Average hourly earnings increased seven cents. While the unemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent from an eight-year low of 4.9 percent, it was because more Americans continued to return to the labor force, a sign of confidence in the jobs market. The labor market has largely shrugged off slowing global economic growth, a robust U.S. dollar that has hurt manufacturing exports, and cheap oil prices, which have hit energy sector profitability. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Tuesday that slowing world growth and lower oil prices posed a downside risk to the U.S. economic outlook, adding that she considered it appropriate for policymakers to \"proceed cautiously in adjusting policy.\" Fed officials last month downgraded their economic growth expectations and forecast only two more rate rises this year. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. Financial markets have almost priced out the likelihood of a rate hike at the Fed's June policy meeting and see a roughly 47 percent chance of an increase in November and a 57 percent probability at the December meeting, according to CME FedWatch. The employment report came on the heels of recent data showing sluggish consumer spending and weak business investment on capital in the first two months of the year, as well as some deterioration in the international trade balance. Those reports prompted economists to slash their first-quarter GDP growth estimates to as low as a 0.9 percent annualized pace from as high as a 2.0 percent rate. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter. WAGES BOUNCE BACK Though employment gains have slowed after averaging 282,000 jobs per month in the fourth quarter, there is little labor market strain from the global slowdown, which helped to ignite a massive stock market sell-off at the start of the year. Wages increased last month, with average hourly earnings rising 0.3 percent. That lifted the year-on-year earnings gain to 2.3 percent from 2.2 percent in February. Economists say a growth rate of between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent in wages is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2.0 percent target. Though the Fed's preferred inflation measure is currently at 1.7 percent, Yellen has expressed skepticism over the sustainability of gains, citing transitory factors. There were improvements in other labor market measures. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose a tenth of a percentage point to 63 percent, the highest level since March 2014. Employment gains in March were broad-based. But manufacturing lost 29,000 jobs, the largest number since December 2009, despite signs of stabilization in the factory sector. Mining purged 12,000 more jobs last month. Mining payrolls have declined by 185,000 jobs since peaking in September 2014, with three-fourths of the losses in support activities. Oilfield service providers Schlumberger and Halliburton Co have announced thousands of job cuts as they try to cope with reduced profits from a prolonged slump in oil prices."}, {"source": "Reuters", "author": null, "title": "U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly rise", "description": "The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but remained below a level associated with a strong labour market.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-jobless-claims-unexpectedly-rise-1.462225", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 31, 2016", "content": " The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but remained below a level associated with a strong labour market.

While other data on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week, revisions to the prior weeks' figures showed the labour market was much stronger than previously thought. The labour market's resilience underscores the economy's strength, which has helped calm concerns of a looming recession. That could keep the Federal Reserve on course to gradually raise interest rates this year. The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, declined 2.8 percent last month after a downwardly revised 4.2 percent increase in January. Non-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, decreased 1.8 percent after advancing by a downwardly revised 3.1 percent in January. These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have increased 3.4 percent in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast durable goods orders falling 2.9 percent last month and orders for core capital goods slipping 0.1 percent. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies after the data. U.S. stock futures were down, while prices for Treasuries were mixed. SOLID LABOUR MARKET In a separate report, the Labour Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended March 19. The government also revised data going back to 2011, which showed claims trending lower than previously reported. Claims for the week ended March 5 were the lowest since November 1973. Last month's drop in durable goods orders bucks recent data that have suggested the downward spiral in manufacturing was close to an end. Several reports in recent days have shown a pick-up in regional factory activity in March, leading to optimism that a broader manufacturing survey will show the sector expanded this month for the first time since September. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hammered by the strong dollar, weak global demand and capital spending cuts by oilfield service firms like Schlumberger and Halliburton. Efforts by businesses to sell unwanted inventory have also meant fewer orders placed, adding to pressure on factories. But the dollar's gains versus the currencies of the United States' main trading partners. DXY have slowed since the start of the year and the oil price slide has become less pronounced. The drop in durable goods orders last month was led by a 27.1 percent plunge in civilian aircraft orders, which contributed to a 6.2 percent drop in bookings for transportation equipment. Orders for primary metals, fabricated metal products, machinery, computers and electronic products as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components also fell. Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 1.2 percent. Shipments of core capital goods - used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product report \u2013 fell 1.1 percent last month after sliding 1.3 percent in January. The drop in shipments in February could prompt economists to trim first-quarter GDP growth estimates, which are currently around a 2 percent annualized rate. The economy\u00a0grew at a 1.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Unfilled durable goods orders fell 0.4 percent last month after being unchanged in January.

Canada lost 2,300 jobs in February, Statistics Canada said on Friday, missing analysts' expectations for a gain of 10,000. The unemployment rate rose to 7.3 per cent, although the participation rate held steady.

Economists still expect the Bank of Canada to hold rates steady at its next meeting in April. In Friday's report, the healthcare and social assistance field saw the biggest losses, followed by the educational services sector. The natural resources sector, which has suffered from cheaper oil prices, continued to weaken. Hiring in the construction industry jumped, although the sector was little changed from a year earlier. Oil-sensitive Alberta added a meager 1,400 jobs, but an increase in people looking for work sent the unemployment rate up to 7.9 percent there, its highest since August 1995. Separate Statscan data showed Canadian household debt rose to a record 165.4 percent of income in the fourth quarter as disposable income grew more slowly than borrowers took on debt. Household credit market debt, which includes consumer credit, mortgages and other loans, rose, with mortgages making up the bulk of debt outstanding. Over 2015, mortgages surged 6.3 percent, their strongest growth since 2011.

The unemployment rate held at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent even as more people piled into the labour market. The economy added 30,000 more jobs in December and January than previously reported. The only blemish in the report was a three cent drop in average hourly earnings, but that was mostly because of a calendar quirk. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast employment increasing by 190,000 last month and the jobless rate holding steady. The employment report added to data such as consumer and business spending, in suggesting the economy had regained momentum after growth slowed to a 1.0 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 2.5 percent rate. Fears of a recession in the wake of poor economic reports in December and slowing growth in China sparked a global stock market rout at the start of the year, causing financial market conditions to tighten. Financial markets have priced out bets of a rate rise at the Fed's March 15-16 policy meeting and the probabilities for rate increases for the rest of the year remain rather small. The strong jobs market and improved growth outlook, together with signs that inflation is creeping up, could prompt the U.S. central bank to lift borrowing costs in June. The Fed raised its key overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. SLOWER WAGE GROWTH Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The labour force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, increased two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.9 percent. While wage growth weakened in February, it was largely payback for January's jump, which was driven by a calendar quirk. Growth in wages is seen accelerating as the labour market settles into full employment. The drop in average hourly earnings lowered the year-on-year gain in earnings to 2.2 percent. In February, job gains were almost broad-based, though manufacturing and mining employment fell. The services sector created 245,000 jobs after adding 153,000 jobs in January. Mining lost a further 18,000 jobs after shedding 9,000 positions in January. Mining payrolls have declined by 171,000 jobs since peaking in September 2014, with three-fourths of the losses in support activities. More losses are likely after oilfield services provider Halliburton Co said last month it would cut a further 5,000 jobs because of a prolonged slump in oil prices."}]
