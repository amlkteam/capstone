Move to Vancouver.While policymakers from Seattle to Boston lament a growing urban affordability crisis, a new study of home prices and earnings across more than 100 major U.S. and Canadian metropolitan areas shows Vancouver in an ignominious class of its own.The median cost of a Vancouver home, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is US$672,000 \u2014 costly but still 15 per cent to 26 per cent below that of San Jose and San Francisco, the two most expensive housing markets, according to Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University\u2019s City Program, whose study accounted for the difference in buying power of a dollar across geographies and currencies.What pushes Vancouver to the top of the unaffordability rankings is paltry wages. In Canada\u2019s third-largest city, the median household earns the equivalent of US$61,036 a year \u2014 in line with Columbus and less than families in Omaha, Nebraska, Kansas City, Missouri and even Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a rural community of 59,000 known for cornfields.The Pacific Coast city\u2019s property market is entering a slowdown after policymakers intervened with a slew of measures to temper demand, including a foreign buyers tax and tighter mortgage rules, along with higher interest rates. Sales hit a five-year low last month, while the number of homes on the market swelled to the most in three years.But the figures show just how difficult it will be to close the affordability gap after a run up that\u2019s seen the price of a typical home triple since 2005.\u201cYou need one of two things: either Vancouver real estate prices need to halve to attain a certain level of affordability, or you need to double incomes,\u201d Yan said.As for Toronto, Canada\u2019s biggest city is the eighth most expensive housing market on the list. With a median household annual income of US$65,833 \u2014 about as unaffordable as San Francisco or San Jose but still better than Vancouver. Low wages aren\u2019t a Canadian problem either. Calgary, the oil-and-gas capital, ranks fourth on the continent in household earnings with US$83,650, while a well-paid government sector puts Ottawa above Dallas, Portland and Chicago with US$68,925 a year.An outright correction would be potentially devastating \u2014 real estate development is the province\u2019s largest industry and housing a key driver of the local economy. Doubling incomes is wildly ambitious \u2014 similar in scale to a 10-year goal that China has set for itself.\u201cThat\u2019s the Herculean task of what Vancouver is facing,\u201d Yan says.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Yay, now we only owe $1.68 for every $1 disposable income", "description": "Yay, now we only owe $1.68 for every $1 disposable income", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/update-1-canada-q1-household-debt-to-income-ratio-falls-to-two-year-low", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dollar2.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 14, 2018 12:12 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s debt to disposable income ratio declined by the most on record in the first quarter, boosting confidence the country\u2019s households can handle higher borrowing costs.The ratio fell to 168 per cent in the first three months of 2018, from 169.7 per cent in the prior period, Statistics Canada said Thursday in Ottawa. The 1.7 percentage point decline was the most in data back to 1990, and follows an almost continual run of increases to a record 170 per cent in the third quarter of 2017.Credit-market debt rose just 0.3 per cent January to March, reflecting the lowest volume of mortgage borrowing in almost four years. Disposable income increased 1.3 per cent. Meanwhile, a separate Statistics Canada report showed the country\u2019s new housing price index was flat in April, and Toronto prices posted the first 12-month decline since 2009.The figures suggest risks from the decade-long, debt-fueled housing boom are moderating, clearing the way for the Bank of Canada to continue increasing interest rates to more normal levels. Governor Stephen Poloz has already lifted rates three times since last summer and investors predict he\u2019ll hike again at the July 11 meeting.Moderating housing costs \u201cwill give the Bank of Canada breathing room to maintain a gradual pace of tightening,\u201d Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto Dominion Bank in Toronto, said in an email.Real estate executives and policy makers have said mortgage growth should slow this year after tougher federal rules took effect. Some buyers have also been deterred by high prices in Vancouver and Toronto, and by higher borrowing costs.Mortgage borrowing declined by $2 billion to $13.7 billion in the first quarter, compared with the prior three-month period, Statistics Canada said.Home price overvaluation in Toronto has been easing and the risk of a price bust across the province of Ontario has faded to \u201clow,\u201d from \u201cmoderate\u201d last year, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said Thursday. The federal housing agency also said Ontario\u2019s rising population and incomes should support home prices after some weakness early this year.Toronto\u2019s new-home price index fell 0.5 per cent in April from March, the fourth straight decline. In Vancouver prices have been flat for four straight months.Still, dangers remain. Poloz said last week that while financial-market risks linked to consumer finances are easing, the sheer size of the debt means the tensions will persist for some time. Statistics Canada figures showed overall household borrowing remains above $2 trillion, about equal to the country\u2019s gross domestic product.Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said even though the country\u2019s debt service ratio has remained stable, he expects it to come under \u201cupward pressure\u201d in the period ahead.\u201cIn our view, this will be a key factor restraining household spending growth this year,\u201d Toronto-based Hogue wrote in a note to clients. \u201cIt will also be an element keeping the Bank of Canada cautious about raising rates.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "As middle class gets priced out of housing market, Canada takes drastic steps to make it affordable", "description": "Canada is offering free land and tax incentives to create more affordably priced options in Vancouver and Toronto", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/as-middle-class-gets-priced-out-of-housing-market-canada-takes-drastic-steps-to-make-it-affordable", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/0509toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 9, 2018 1:08 PM EDT", "content": "Jaxson Khan, 24, encountered the nightmare that is Toronto\u2019s rental market when he moved to the city to join a small tech startup. He ended up sharing a basement apartment almost an hour away from work.Fuelled by a booming tech industry, Toronto\u2019s economy has produced an all-too-familiar problem: soaring housing prices beyond the reach of the middle class. That\u2019s also plagued Vancouver where prices soared even higher than Toronto.Now, Canada is embarking on an ambitious plan to create more moderately priced rental units. With land handouts and tax incentives provided by the city and provinces, one group hopes to bring 50,000 affordable apartments to Toronto and Vancouver in just 10 years.The project, to cost at least $10 billion (US$7.8 billion), is at a scale never before seen in Canada, both in its size and speed. And it\u2019s raising questions about whether or not the country will be able to address its affordability problem before it\u2019s too late.At stake, proponents say, is the continued growth of Canada\u2019s biggest cities. Last year, Toronto ranked first in UBS Group AG\u2019s annual list of major cities worldwide with the greatest risks of a housing bust. That has made even property developers who have reaped big profits fretful that critical workers will be priced out of housing.\u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with this issue of housing, we\u2019ll hit a ceiling where we can\u2019t expand that sector of the economy that we desperately need,\u201d said Ian Gillespie, chief executive officer of Westbank Projects Corp., who spearheaded the project and recruited Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust to help.Building affordable housing can be fraught. Major cities, notably San Francisco and New York City, continue to grapple with a scarcity, even after spending billions of dollars to develop more. The median sale price of a house in San Francisco reached a new high of US$1.6 million in the first quarter, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.The Canadian plan, run by a new nonprofit called Creative Housing Society, proposes to build units aimed at people with median annual income between $40,000 to $100,000, who would spend less than 30 per cent of their household income before tax on housing costs.If we don't deal with this issue of housing, we'll hit a ceiling where we can't expand that sector of the economy that we desperately needThat\u2019s become increasingly difficult now. The average annual income needed to purchase an average-priced resale condo in the city is $100,000 up from $77,000 a year earlier, according to Urbanation Inc. On Jan. 1, the government attempted to tame housing prices with regulations that make it harder to get a mortgage. But that has driven people to the rental market, where average monthly rents surged about 11 per cent in the Toronto region in the first quarter, to $2,206 (US$1,751), Urbanation said.\u201cThese are teachers, nurses, journalists and web designers who live in the city and who in today\u2019s market, would never be able to afford a house, but are critical to the ecosystem of the economy,\u201d said Jennifer Keesmaat, chief executive officer of Creative Housing and former chief city planner for Toronto.For property developers, building affordable housing is typically a low-margin proposition, especially amid rising construction costs, land prices and interest rates. But the city and provinces are showering groups with incentives, including tax breaks, reduced fees and promises of quick approval time, as short as six months. That\u2019s spurred a host of other companies, including Canadian Real Estate Investment Trust, Greenwin Inc. and Tricon Capital Group Inc., to jump on the affordable bandwagon.Creative Housing takes it one step further. The group\u2019s proposed model includes a deal in which the city provides land free as long as affordable housing is built and maintained on it in perpetuity.It\u2019s also in talks with the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation to receive financing that freezes lending at today\u2019s interest rates for a 10-year period, Keesmaat said. Most of the equity will come from private institutional lenders. The nonprofit hopes to start building as early as next year. A spokeswoman for the Canadian housing agency declined to comment on the talks.\u201cYou need to add a significant amount of housing to even begin to respond to the demand and we\u2019re so far behind in this area that it\u2019s really hard to catch up,\u201d Keesmaat said. \u201cBut if our model works, there\u2019s almost an infinite amount of new affordable rental units that could be absorbed in the market.\u201dIt remains unclear if the Creative Housing proposal will have any more luck creating affordable units than previous plans, which have fallen short despite incentives.\u201cDevelopers are telling us they\u2019re still many years away from delivering new rental units,\u201d said Anne McMullin, CEO of Vancouver-based Urban Development Institute, referring to the prior efforts.To Neal Belovay, it\u2019s all a bit too late. He decided to move his tech startup out of Vancouver to Kitchener-Waterloo, about 4,023 kilometres (2,500 miles east), after tiring of searching in vain for people willing to live in so costly a city.\u201cYou have people fighting for their basic needs and that\u2019s finding a place to live,\u201d Belovay said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no real future for them in the city because they\u2019re not going to be able to buy a house and settle down.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "How Amazon could push Vancouver's high-flying housing prices even higher", "description": "Amazon plans to boost its Vancouver workforce five-fold to 5,000 by 2022, and the 'Amazon effect' could create more pressure in an already strained housing market", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/how-amazon-could-push-vancouvers-high-flying-housing-prices-even-higher?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/0501trudeau.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 1, 2018 12:22 PM EDT", "content": "A spate of government policies have tried to temper Vancouver\u2019s housing prices, to little avail.

Dougherty spoke Monday in the bunker-like former Canada Post mailing center that\u2019s set to be re-developed to host Amazon\u2019s new 416,000-square-foot office.\u201cIt\u2019s no joke for any metro when Amazon comes in, especially in a mid-market city,\u201d says Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at real estate portal Zillow Group Inc., which calculates Seattle rental prices increased by 50 per cent and home values nearly doubled since Amazon\u2019s start as a bookseller in the mid-1990s.Seattle was a city of about 3 million people \u2014 roughly on par with the population of Greater Vancouver \u2014 before Amazon\u2019s workforce exploded from about 5,000 workers in 2010 to about 40,000 today, helping turn it into one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities, said Terrazas.\u201cIt\u2019s the Amazon effect,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon attracts other companies that also want that talent so they build, have offices next door or adjacent to it \u2014 supply becomes a challenge.\u201dToday, so-called Amazonians occupy more office space in Seattle than the next 40 largest employers in the city combined, according to a study by real-estate data firm CoStar for the Seattle Times last year. Rent increases in neighbourhoods that experienced the biggest influx of those workers have risen 65 per cent faster over the past five years than areas with the smallest influx, according to Zillow.Anything similar in Vancouver could create additional pressure in an already strained market. Vancouver\u2019s supply of available rentals has remained below 1 per cent for three years in a row. The price of a benchmark home has risen 91 per cent in a decade. Government attempts to ease prices \u2014 including a 20 per cent provincial tax on foreign buyers, a city tax on empty homes, as well as stricter federal mortgage rules \u2014 have made little difference: prices are up 16 per cent in the past year.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "Ghost-home tax fills Vancouver coffers but rentals remain scarce", "description": "There's no sign yet that Vancouver's near-zero supply of available rentals has eased since the levy took effect at the start of 2017", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/ghost-home-tax-fills-vancouver-coffers-but-rentals-remain-scarce?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/0426vancouver.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 26, 2018 4:57 PM EDT", "content": "Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson declared the Canadian city\u2019s new tax on empty homes a success this week, thanking the absentee owners of 8,500 properties for paying up.He was less conclusive about whether the tax actually did what it set out to accomplish. \u201cThe ultimate goal here was to encourage people to rent their empty homes,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully that\u2019s happening.\u201dHopes aside, there\u2019s no sign yet that Vancouver\u2019s near-zero supply of available rentals has eased since the levy took effect at the start of 2017.The outcome of the new tax is being watched closely as cities around the world struggle with the rise of so-called ghost homes: scarcely used residences in prime urban locations seen by investors as a safe way to park their cash. Vancouver and some London boroughs were among the earliest to impose taxes on empty homes with the aim of boosting the rental supply in tight markets \u2014 a strategy that\u2019s now spread to Australia, and is being considered in Toronto and Dublin.For city coffers, Vancouver\u2019s new levy was no doubt a winner. The Pacific coast city expects to raise $30 million (US$23 million) from the tax in the first year. That will more than cover the one-time cost to implement the system, $7.5 million, and the annual operating cost of about $2.5 million.Taxing ghost owners is also more lucrative than annual property levies. The empty homes bill was as high as $250,000 for at least one vacant multi-million dollar home. That\u2019s more than the roughly $200,000 in annual property taxes that Lululemon Athletica Inc. founder Chip Wilson pays on his Vancouver home, Canada\u2019s most valuable residence.\u201cThose who didn\u2019t rent their empty property and chose to pay the empty homes tax, I just want to say thank you,\u201d Robertson told reporters Monday, promising to steer the extra revenue toward affordable housing initiatives. \u201cI know many cities will study Vancouver\u2019s model,\u201d he added, saying it has received inquiries about the tax from across North America and beyond.If observers are watching for a dramatic improvement in the plight of renters, they may be disappointed.The supply of homes available for lease in Vancouver remained below 1 per cent as of early October for the third year in a row, according to data from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. When the city announced the tax in late 2016, it expected it would boost the rental vacancy rate to about 3.5 per cent.Determining what impact ghost properties have on local housing prices and availability is vexing in part because it\u2019s tricky to determine which homes are in fact empty.Vancouver\u2019s program relies on owners to self-declare if a property was used or rented for less than six months in a year. If so, they are subject to an annual fee equal to 1 percent of the property\u2019s assessed value. False declarations incur fines of up to $10,000 a day.Robertson, who isn\u2019t seeking re-election in October\u2019s municipal ballot, has called the program a \u201ccarrot-and-stick approach\u201d intended to capture ghost homes and help return them to the rental supply. \u201cThose who are not playing ball here and who are skirting the system, we will get you,\u201d he warned this week, saying audits are underway.Earlier, a study commissioned by the city analyzed electricity consumption to estimate that in 2014 there were 10,800 unoccupied dwellings, representing about 4.8 per cent of the housing supply. It found that proportion had barely changed since 2002 and that the increase in the absolute number of ghost homes during the 12-year period \u2014 2,400 units \u2014 was \u201cdriven entirely from the growth in the overall housing stock.\u201dBy late 2016, amid mounting public frustration at spiralling housing prices, the city estimated some 20,000 homes were empty or \u201cunder-utilized\u201d when it proposed the tax. Months later, a study based on census data pegged the number of vacant dwellings at more than 66,000.Yet the new tax only captured 8,500 properties as empty, or 4.6 per cent of Vancouver\u2019s total housing stock \u2014 in line with the original study based on electricity consumption and, as a percentage, unchanged in the last decade and a half.The limited data available indicates the tax has neither ensnared a fresh batch of ghost homes previously unaccounted for nor does it appear to have reduced the share of vacant units in the total housing supply.Robertson isn\u2019t dissuaded. \u201cAt this point it looks like some signs of success and there\u2019s no reason to hold back,\u201d he said. \u201cI think at least conducting a few years of this tax makes sense.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Justin Sink and Jennifer Jacobs", "title": "Trump turns to loyalist Larry Kudlow to serve as economic adviser amid shake-up", "description": "Kudlow is seen as temperamentally and politically similar to the president, as well as having credibility on Wall Street and in Washington", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-turns-to-loyalist-larry-kudlow-to-serve-as-economic-adviser-amid-shake-up", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0314kudlow.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 14, 2018 4:21 PM EDT", "content": "Donald Trump has chosen economist and CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow to replace Gary Cohn as director of the White House National Economic Council, adding a longtime confidant to the president\u2019s inner circle.White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Kudlow \u201cwas offered, and accepted, the position.\u201d She added the administration \u201cwill keep everyone posted on the timing of him officially assuming the role.\u201dKudlow, 70, is expected to provide a familiarity and loyalty to Trump as the president removes moderating and dissenting voices from his administration. The president, who cited differences over Iran when he fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Tuesday, has tired of a senior staff that often opposed causes he championed as a candidate.A television host from New Jersey, Kudlow is seen as temperamentally and politically similar to the president. He\u2019s also seen within the White House as having credibility on both Wall Street and in Washington, where he served as an adviser to former President Ronald Reagan.That\u2019s critical to Trump, who has seen his White House hemorrhage top aides as his presidency enters a crucial stretch of foreign and domestic policy-making ahead of November\u2019s crucial midterm elections.Kudlow\u2019s views on trade, however, could be a source of friction after Trump\u2019s recent move to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\u201cHe is a cheerleader for growth,\u201d said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research. \u201cHe regularly says \u2018Free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity.\u2019 He is a forceful advocate for open markets and trade liberalization, and more generally an economic libertarian who favours low taxes and less regulation.\u201dThe president, whose outsider appeal swept Republicans into total control of the federal government, is now seen as a drag on GOP lawmakers facing re-elections. A torrent of scandals \u2014 including revelations that former staff secretary Rob Porter maintained his job despite a background check that turned up allegations of spousal abuse \u2014 have shaken the confidence of his staff. The episodes have also eroded Trump\u2019s appeal among suburban voters and led to a crackdown on security clearances culminating in the departure of some top aides.The reverberations were apparent in Tuesday\u2019s special election in a western Pennsylvania congressional district, where Democrat Conor Lamb leads a too-close-too-call race in a district the president won in 2016 by 19 points. Trump had visited the district \u2014 a prime beneficiary of his recent decision to slap tariffs on steel imports \u2014 just days earlier to campaign for Republican Rick Saccone.Trump has responded by seeking to amplify economic successes during his administration \u2014 a task in which he hopes Kudlow, a veteran of financial media, can assist.Cohn announced his departure last week after Trump moved forward with the metals tariffs \u2014 a plan Cohn had vociferously opposed.Kudlow clashed with Trump in the past. In 2016, when a tape surfaced before the election featuring Trump boasting about grabbing women\u2019s genitals, Kudlow said he was \u201cfurious\u201d and threatened to vote for Mike Pence as a write-in candidate.Earlier this month, he wrote a column for CNBC describing the president\u2019s tariffs as \u201ca regressive tax on low-income families.\u201d\u201cTrump should also examine the historical record on tariffs, because they have almost never worked as intended and almost always deliver an unhappy ending,\u201d Kudlow wrote in the March 3 column, which also included praise for other parts of the president\u2019s economic agenda. Kudlow has strongly backed the tax overhaul that Trump signed at the end of last year.Yet, as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to California, Trump said Kudlow \u201cnow has come around to believing in tariffs.\u201dIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Kudlow says he was encouraged by the president moving to grant temporary waivers on the steel and aluminum import tariffs to allies including Canada, Mexico, and Australia.\u201cHe said to me several times, \u2018I believe in global trade. I regard myself as a global trader, but it has to be fair trade to protect America,\u2019\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cI\u2019m on board with that. I personally hope widespread tariff use \u2014 it doesn\u2019t come to that. But in some cases, it will.\u201dKudlow also indicated the administration was readying a larger round of tariffs against Chinese imports. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that the president was seeking to impose tariffs on up to US$60 billion of Chinese imports in the technology and communications sectors, citing concerns over intellectual property theft.\u201cI am very strongly in favour of tariffs on China, because they continue to violate our intellectual property rights and so forth,\u201d the Wall Street Journal quoted Kudlow as saying.The president himself continued to highlight trade issues ahead of his flight Wednesday morning departing California, where he had toured border wall prototypes and held a political fundraiser.\u201cWe cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country!\u201d Trump tweeted.Kudlow\u2019s economic forecasts on CNBC and in a regular column in the past decade have sometimes been off the mark. In December 2007, the month the National Bureau of Economic Research later dated the start of the worst recession since the 1930s, he was arguing there was no recession and that the \u201cBush boom continues.\u201dKudlow contended there was no housing bubble before U.S. housing prices crashed. And he warned in 2010 that former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen would usher in a new era of higher inflation, while instead price gains have fallen short of the central bank\u2019s 2 percent forecasts.His best prediction has been that the stock market would go up if Trump were elected, contrary to many economists including Paul Krugman who predicted a decline.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Allison McNeely", "title": "Evidence of mortgage fraud in Canada raises red flag at credit rating giant", "description": "S&P Global Ratings warns it expects to see more evidence of fraud in Canadian residential mortgages amid high home prices and high household debt", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/mortgage-fraud-prompts-sp-to-lower-canada-bank-risk-metric", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/housing1.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 26, 2018 1:11 PM EST", "content": "Evidence of mortgage fraud amid surging home prices and household debt has prompted S&P Global Ratings to lower a key risk metric for Canadian banks.The credit ratings agency dropped its economic risk assessment by one notch due to evidence of residential-mortgage fraud at smaller Canadian banks, which could compound existing risks from the country\u2019s hot housing market, according to a statement Friday.

That\u2019s down from the 6.6 per cent growth rate in the fourth quarter, though it\u2019s still the second-best pace in seven quarters.Canadian banks have been anticipating a slowdown in mortgage lending amid elevated housing prices, overextended borrowers, and tougher mortgage eligibility rules that kicked in this year. Still, the nation\u2019s housing market remains robust. Canadian home sales last year were second only to a record 2016, and were helped by price gains despite government efforts to cool the market.The country\u2019s banking regulator changed the rules for borrowers in the uninsured mortgage market, making it more difficult for those with less than a 20 per cent down payment to qualify for loans as of Jan. 1. The measures, known as B-20 guidelines, require banks to test a borrower\u2019s ability to pay at the greater of the Bank of Canada\u2019s five-year benchmark rate or 2 percentage points higher than the offered mortgage rate.Mortgage lending makes up a significant part of the firm\u2019s Canadian banking division, whose earnings rose 11 per cent to $1.48 billion from a year earlier when excluding gains from selling a payments business. Royal Bank\u2019s balances represent about 15 per cent of Canada\u2019s $1.52 trillion mortgage market.Net income in the period ended Jan. 31 fell 0.5 per cent to $3.01 billion, or $2.01 a share, from $3.03 billion, or $1.97, a year earlier, Toronto-based Royal Bank said Friday in a statement. Adjusted profit, which excludes some items, was $2.05 a share, beating the $1.99 average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Royal Bank raised its quarterly dividend 3.3 per cent to 94 cents.Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on Thursday posted profit that exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates on gains from its U.S. businesses and better-than-expected provisions for credit losses.

The government will also crack down on the condo pre-sale market and beneficial ownership to ensure that property flippers, offshore trusts and hidden investors are paying taxes on gains.Premier John Horgan faces formidable demands after taking power in a fiercely contested election last July. His New Democratic Party made expensive promises to topple the Liberals, whose 16-year-rule brought the fastest growth in Canada, but also surging property while incomes stagnated.Public outrage has surged amid perceptions that global capital seeking a stable sanctuary, especially from China, is driving double-digit gains in Vancouver, the country\u2019s most expensive property market.\u201cThe expectations that we will do everything in our first budget are huge,\u201d James told reporters in the capital Victoria. \u201cOur goal is fairness \u2014 fairness for the people who live here, who work here and pay their taxes here.\u201dJames said a raft of new measures are intended to \u201cmoderate\u201d the surge in housing prices, which she said had emerged as one of the top concerns of both residents and businesses struggling to recruit workers due to the high cost of living.B.C.'s real estate market should not be used as a stock marketThe new speculator tax takes effect this fall and will apply to foreign and domestic investors who don\u2019t pay income tax in the province. It will start at 0.5 per cent of the property\u2019s assessed value in 2018 and rise to 2 per cent thereafter. Primary residences and homes leased as long-term rentals will be exempt.\u201cB.C.\u2019s real estate market should not be used as a stock market. It should be used to provide safe and secure homes,\u201d said James. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re cracking down on speculators who distort our market.\u201dThe levy, she said, will also capture \u201csatellite families\u201d \u2014 a term with Chinese origins to describe those families where the breadwinner remains in the home country while the children and spouse reside abroad to take advantage of educational and employment opportunities.The foreign buyers\u2019 tax will also be extended beyond the Vancouver region to properties in Victoria and other parts of the province. Taxes on the province\u2019s most expensive properties will also rise \u2014 homes worth more than $3 million will pay a 5 per cent property transfer tax when sold, up from 3 per cent.Separately, the government and Airbnb Inc. have reached an agreement requiring the company collect an 8 per cent provincial sales tax and as much as a 3 per cent local tax on short-term rentals, according to budget documents.Public outrage has been further stoked by fresh media reports alleging Vancouver casinos and real estate have become vehicles in recent years for laundering the illicit proceeds of high-rolling Asian gamblers and drug dealers with links to the Chinese fentanyl trade.\u201cWe\u2019re taking steps to counter tax fraud and money laundering \u2014 that starts with closing loopholes and better access to information,\u201d James said. The province has asked the federal government to create a multi-agency group to target tax evasion, money laundering and housing, according to budget documents.James vowed that investors flipping pre-sale condos will have to pay tax. Developers will be required to collect ownership information on the selling and re-selling of contract assignments in new buildings, and the data will be shared with tax authorities.She also vowed to bring more transparency to murky ownership records \u2014 it isn\u2019t clear who owns nearly half of Vancouver\u2019s most expensive properties, according to a budget document. The province will demand more information about beneficial property ownership in tax forms. That information will also be made publicly available and shared with tax authorities and law enforcement agencies, James said.The budget plan forecast a $219 million surplus in the fiscal year beginning April 1, more than the $151 million projected for the year ending March 31. The surplus is expected to rise to $281 million in 2019-2020, according to the budget. Economic growth is pegged at 2.3 per cent this year, following a 3.4 per cent expansion in 2017.Over the next three years, it includes plans to invest more than $1 billion in childcare, $1.6 billion in affordable housing, and to also eliminate healthcare premiums at an annual cost of about $1 billion.That plan will be funded by a new health tax on employers, as well as the new and expanded housing measures. Combined, they will create extra tax revenue of $880 million this fiscal year and $2.2 billion the following year, according to budget documents.New borrowing will rise to $7.7 billion in the coming fiscal year, from $1.9 billion in the current year, to help fund a record $15.8 billion in capital investments in transportation, housing, educational and health facilities, according to budget documents.Provincial debt will rise in the coming fiscal year to $69 billion, from $65 billion for the year ending March 31. Debt will increase to $73 billion by the 2020 fiscal year, the government said.Program spending is forecast to jump 3.5 per cent to $54 billion next year, from $52 billion in 2017-2018.

It was the weakest month of sales for January since 2009. The average price of a home sold in Toronto was $736,783, down 4.1 per cent from January 2017, though little changed from December.Toronto\u2019s once-hot housing market has been correcting as various levels of government and regulators took measures to curb spiraling prices and soaring debt in the country. Most recently, tougher mortgage guidelines came into play on Jan. 1, making it harder for prospective buyers to qualify for loans. Many buyers rushed into the market in December to get ahead of the rules.\u201cIt is not surprising that home prices in some market segments were flat to down in January compared to last year,\u201d said Jason Mercer, the board\u2019s director of market analysis. \u201cAt this time last year, we were in the midst of a housing price spike driven by exceptionally low inventory in the marketplace.\u201dThe industry group remains optimistic the market will stabilize, releasing a 2018 outlook last week that pointed to a slower sales start to the year as the market adjusts to the changes. \u201cAs we move through the year, expect the pace of home sales to pick up,\u201d board president Tim Syrianos said in the statement.The benchmark home price index remained relatively unchanged in January despite the slump in sales, according to Bloomberg calculations. The index has dropped nine per cent since May, mainly due to falling prices in Toronto\u2019s detached market. The condominium segment, in contrast, has seen double-digit annual growth.\u201cIt is likely that market conditions will support return to positive price growth for many home types in the second half of 2018,\u201d Mercer said.New listings rose 17 per cent from the same period last year, but it was the second lowest level for January in the past decade.

If that\u2019s true, the market should eventually stabilize once new supply kicks in.A situation where speculators are bidding up prices would be much more problematic.Canada\u2019s 2016 census, which the statistics agency is releasing piecemeal this year, is providing some insight into the debate. The results: supply may not be the big problem many people thought it was.Between 2011 and 2016, the number of households in Toronto rose to 2.14 million, an addition of about 146,200, according to the census data, the latest round of which came out Wednesday. That compares to 175,825 new homes built over that period. In other words, supply of new houses exceeded real household demand by almost 30,000 over those five years.That throws cold water on the argument \u2014 voiced particularly by the industry \u2014 that the city\u2019s affordability crisis won\u2019t be resolved unless the government introduces measures to help increase supply.Some of the imbalance between supply and household formation over the past five years is a consequence of the construction slump during the last recession. Over the previous census period \u2014 2006 to 2011 \u2014 completions totaled 160,195, compared with 188,450 new households. In other words, supply almost perfectly matched natural household demand over the past 10 years.One segment of the Toronto market where lack of supply is definitely a problem is single-detached homes. These highly-coveted properties accounted for just 29 per cent of new builds over the past five years, down from 40 per cent over the 10 years prior. They\u2019ve also been growing at a much slower pace than household formation. The number of single-detached homes in Toronto is up about 13 per cent over the past decade, versus 19 per cent in the number of households formed.The city is simply running out of room to build on large properties, evident in census data that show its population density has surpassed 1,000 people per square kilometre for the first time ever, another factor that should continue supporting prices for detached homes.If the supply imbalance does lead to a price correction in Toronto\u2019s housing market, there may be a ready supply of buyers waiting in the wings.Almost half of young adults in Toronto live with their parents, the highest ratio in Canada, according to last week\u2019s census figures. Pent up demand from these so-called basement kids may quickly emerge to take up any pricing slack.Diana Petramala, an economist at Toronto Dominion Bank, says the high proportion of young adults living with their parents is slowing the formation of new households.After all, faced with the challenges of buying a home in Toronto, where the average price was running at about $746,000 in July, younger adults are more likely to defer decisions on starting families and less likely to take on the burden of ownership.\u201cI think household formation looks low given population estimates and the age structure of the population,\u201d Petramala said in an interview last week, estimating household formation would typically have been about 16,300 higher over the five years.The age analysis, released in May, offers some insight into another impact of rising home prices in Toronto. The city was once the place young families went to start a life, but that\u2019s no longer the case.In 2001, more than 30 per cent of Toronto\u2019s population was in what can be described as the young family cohort (those aged between 0 and 9, plus those aged between 30 to 39). That was the highest share among the country\u2019s largest urban centers, and compares to 28 per cent in Montreal.While the share of that cohort has since fallen across the country, Toronto has seen one of the largest drops. The census data show the young family cohort now accounts for 24.9 per cent of Toronto\u2019s population, placing it in the middle of the pack among major cities and half a percentage point below Montreal.To date, Statistics Canada has released 2016 census data centered around household formation, age, sex and dwellings. Data on income, immigration and mobility is due in the coming months.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Bond giant Pimco thinks the Bank of Canada is about to turn cautious", "description": "The No 2 fixed-income manager is hugging the short-end of the Canadian bond market, betting the central bank isn\u2019t as hawkish as some think", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/pimco-sees-bank-of-canada-turning-cautious-bets-on-short-end", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/polox.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 31, 2017 3:22 PM EDT", "content": "By Natalie WongPacific Investment Management Co. is hugging the short-end of the Canadian bond market, betting the country\u2019s central bank will turn cautious after raising interest rates this month.Ed Devlin, head of the Canadian portfolio at Pimco, the second-biggest U.S. fixed-income manager, said two-year government bond yields are likely anchored around current levels after soaring since the Bank of Canada unexpectedly turned hawkish in mid-June and raised rates July 12. Ten-year and 30-year bond yields could rise another 25 basis points to 30 basis points, he said.\u201cThe bank wants to be cautious in its communication and the tightening of policy especially given the enormous strength of the Canadian dollar,\u201d Devlin said by phone from Montreal. Newport Beach, California-based Pimco has assets of US$1.61 trillion while Devlin oversees about $17 billion. \u201cI don\u2019t think they want financial conditions to tighten much more than they already have.\u201dTwo-year government yields have risen 58 basis points to 1.33 per cent and the Canadian dollar has jumped 7.7 per cent since June 9, the last trading day before central bank officials began to signal higher rates.

Markets are pricing in another quarter point hike by the end of the year.Any increase \u2014 the first by the Bank of Canada since 2010 \u2014 would reflect the recent acceleration in Canadian growth, but investors are looking at the decision as a possible harbinger of things to come globally and are monitoring it for clues on the central bank\u2019s resolve for withdrawing stimulus.\u201cWhile we usually do not care about Canadian monetary policy, if the BOC goes through with its first rate hike since the crisis on Wednesday, then the yield pressure may mount even further,\u201d John Cairns, a currency strategist at Johannesburg-based RMB, said in a client note.The prospect of central bank tightening has triggered a selloff in government bond markets over the last two weeks, with yields on 10-year Treasury notes jumping to as high as 2.39 per cent, from as low as 2.10 per cent in mid-June. In Canada, two-year yields have surged 26 basis points over the past two weeks, the most for that maturity among developed-market countries tracked by Bloomberg.Here\u2019s a quick guide to Wednesday\u2019s rate decision.Canada is in the midst of one of its strongest growth spurts since the 2008-2009 recession, with the expansion accelerating to an above-3 per cent pace over the past four quarters. That\u2019s the fastest among Group of Seven countries and double what the central bank considers Canada\u2019s capacity to grow without fuelling inflation.Like the U.S., the country\u2019s labour market has also been running hot, with the jobless rate at the lowest since before the recession.The improving outlook is giving Canadian policy makers confidence the economy has gathered enough steam to start weaning itself from the cheap credit that has left the country vulnerable to a financial crisis. Household debt is hovering at record levels and low borrowing costs are fuelling housing prices.That Canada would be the first country to follow the U.S. higher isn\u2019t a major surprise: the neighbours are among the world\u2019s largest two-way trading partners, and the U.S. accounts for 75 per cent of Canada\u2019s exports. No other G-7 nation\u2019s monetary policy is more closely aligned to the Fed.The main thing that prevented the Bank of Canada from following the Fed higher since 2015 was a collapse of oil prices that shaved $60 billion annually off national income.Canada \u2014 the classic small, open economy \u2014 has been a harbinger of major changes in the global monetary system in the past. In 2015, its rate cuts helped kick off a global trend that saw nations accounting for almost half of global output \u2014 including China, Denmark, Sweden, Indonesia and Australia \u2014 follow suit.Bank of Canada officials are indicating they plan to raise interest rates by at least 50 basis points \u2014 the amount of additional stimulus the central bank provided in 2015 to counter the oil collapse. Or as Governor Stephen Poloz put it in an interview with CBC Radio last month, the recovery \u201csuggests to us is that the interest rate cuts that we put in place in 2015 have largely done their work.\u201dThat will only leave the country back at 2014\u2019s still low levels, and one of the big questions from Wednesday\u2019s rate decision \u2014 and the true test of whether the country is entering a full tightening cycle \u2014 will be what Poloz indicates about hikes beyond 1 per cent.\u201cAs to whether the full report will be deemed hawkish or dovish will arguably come down to two factors \u2014 to what degree the Bank emphasizes the need for quick removal of the 50 basis point of oil-related insurance cuts in 2015 and how much future, upside inflation risks are emphasized requiring a more aggressive and traditional hiking program,\u201d Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a note last week.While the Bank of Canada has suddenly adopted a tightening bias over the past month, there is nothing specific in their comments that indicates an interest rate hike is coming Wednesday. Some economists still expect the central bank will wait a few months.Investors\u2019 rate hike expectations are in part based on conjecture. Why did the central bank choose to change its messaging last month? If he wasn\u2019t in a rush, and intended on raising rates later this year, Poloz could have set the stage at today\u2019s rate decision, which also coincides with new quarterly forecasts and a press conference.But the same questions around sluggish inflation apply in Canada as they do elsewhere. While the Bank of Canada is assuming inflation will inevitably rise as the job market tightens \u2014 indeed, Poloz said in a recent interview he expects inflation to be well into an uptrend in the first half of 2018 \u2014 there\u2019s little sign of pressure right now, something that usually signals a weaker-than-desired economy.Other developments that could give the Bank of Canada reason to pause are the Canadian dollar\u2019s surge over the past month, plus the continued slump in oil prices. And with a hawkish tone priced into the Bank of Canada\u2019s decision, the more likely direction of any surprise would be markets pricing in too much of a change in policy direction.Bloomberg.com"}]
