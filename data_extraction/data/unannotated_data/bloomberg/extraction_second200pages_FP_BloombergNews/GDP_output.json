Other major indicators back up the idea the economy no longer needs stimulus, with inflation around 2 per cent and unemployment close to record lows.While the August GDP gain was a surprise, it lacked the breadth seen in some past reports, with 12 of 20 major industries posting declines.\u2022 Non-conventional crude oil extraction was a major driver of growth in August, rising 3.2%. \u2022 The other major gain was 1% in financial services \u2022 Statistics Canada revised the June GDP figure to a 0.1% increase from a prior flat reading, which turned what was two straight months of expansion into seven.

But there are growing signs that it only represents a small slice of Europe\u2019s dirty money machine.For the Scandinavian country\u2019s biggest bank, the scandal started in Estonia, where Danske has admitted that much of US$235 billion in non-resident flows between 2007 and 2015 can be deemed suspicious. Though a huge figure, it represents less than a quarter of foreign client transactions that passed through the country at the center of the dirty money saga, according to figures provided to Bloomberg by the central bank in Tallinn.\u201cThe fact that other banks may be conducting their business in a similar way hardly detracts from Danske\u2019s guilt,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, an organized crime expert and senior researcher at the Prague-based Institute of International Relations.Yet it does speak to more of a systemic issue for the Baltics, according to Sven Stumbauer, managing director for New York-based consultancy AlixPartners.The region was keen to become a private banking centre for eastern Europe, he said. \u201cInstead of more traditional private banking, they started doing more transactional banking, meaning the money comes in and goes out more or less immediately,\u201d he said.Banks doing business in Estonia handled about 900 billion euros, or US$1.04 trillion, in non-resident, cross-border transactions between 2008 and 2015 (the central bank couldn\u2019t provide comparable data for 2007). Not all non-resident flows are suspicious. But in the Danske case, money launderers allegedly singled out such accounts.It wasn\u2019t just Estonia that attracted huge flows. Comparable figures for Latvia and Cyprus \u2014 both major channels for Russian capital flowing into the EU \u2014 are 2.8 trillion euros and 3.4 trillion euros, respectively, according to data provided by the European Central Bank and covering the same time period.The sheer scale of the non-resident flows in a country whose 2017 GDP was just 23 billion euros raises serious questions about Estonia\u2019s role in abetting Russian capital flight. Estonia, a former Soviet state, was ranked last year among the three least risky countries of the 146 included in a study by the Basel Institute on Governance. That assessment now seems very much at odds with Estonia\u2019s newly won reputation as Europe\u2019s money laundromat.The Danske scandal has stunned Europe as the region comes to grips with clear signs of wide-spread abuses in which high-profile banks repeatedly turned a blind eye to the movement of suspicious funds. Deutsche Bank AG, ING Groep NV and BNP Paribas SA are among lenders that have had to pay fines for compliance failures.Of the roughly US$1 trillion that flowed through banks in Estonia between 2008 and 2015, almost US$400 billion was in the form of dollar transactions, for which correspondent banking services are a prerequisite.John Horan, senior associate at Maze Investigation, Compliance and Training Ltd. in Belfast, says money laundering is a Europe-wide problem. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on AML in the Baltic states, and I haven\u2019t seen anything worse there than I\u2019ve seen elsewhere,\u201d he said.Kilvar Kessler, the head of the Financial Supervisory Authority in Estonia, said in August that it \u201cshouldn\u2019t be a surprise that all suspicious transfers didn\u2019t go just through Danske.\u201dThe country\u2019s prime minister, Juri Ratas, says he wants \u201cthe whole truth\u201d uncovered, which includes finding out just how widespread money laundering was for all banks that had operations in Estonia.According to Galeotti, \u201cThe problem is not a witch hunt, in my opinion, but rather that for bankers, whether in the Baltic states, or London, or Delaware, or Frankfurt, the rewards from turning a blind eye to shady business still outweigh the risks.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Milda Seputyte, Frances Schwartzkopff, Aaron Eglitis and Christian Wienberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Simon Kennedy", "title": "China will overtake the U.S. economy in less than 15 years, says HSBC, challenging Trump\u2019s claim", "description": "China also seen as single biggest contributor to global growth over the next decade", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/china-will-overtake-the-u-s-in-less-than-15-years-hsbc-says", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/us-china.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 25, 2018 3:46 PM EDT", "content": "China is on course to be the world\u2019s biggest economy by 2030, according to analysis that challenges Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the U.S. is not about to be overtaken.The forecast was made by economists at HSBC Holdings Plc in a new study of 75 nations published on Tuesday.

A NAFTA collapse coupled with a trade fight would curb growth by 0.6 percentage points next year and then another 0.7 points in 2020, the group estimates. President Donald Trump has threatened to leave Canada out of an agreement the U.S. struck with Mexico and impose auto tariffs on his northern neighbour.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development Thursday also trimmed its forecast for Canada\u2019s economic growth next year.The OECD now sees Canada\u2019s economy expanding 2 per cent in 2019, rather than the 2.2 per cent it forecast earlier.The lack of clarity on the future of the trade agreement is creating an \u201cuncertain operating environment,\u201d and only 34 per cent of business leaders believe now is a good time to invest, the lowest level since 2008, Matthew Stewart, the conference board\u2019s national forecast director, said in the report. Carbon taxes and a concern over the country\u2019s tax competitiveness are also weighing on business confidence, he said.The base case is for Canadian GDP growth to slow to 1.8 per cent in each of 2019 and 2020, after reaching a 2 per cent pace this year, principal economist Alicia Macdonald said in a phone interview.

If China doesn\u2019t retaliate at all, 3 million people could lose their jobs, they wrote in a research note Tuesday.The study highlights the more profound impacts of the tariff battle on the world\u2019s second largest economy, which is grappling with a slowing pace of growth and a massive debt pile. Things may get even worse: if the U.S. imposes 25 per cent tariffs on all Chinese imports and China retaliates with the levies already announced, the measures will mean 5.5 million lost jobs and 1.3 percentage points cut off gross domestic product growth.\u201cIf the U.S. further escalates the tariff war, the impact on China will be larger,\u201d they wrote in the note. While the overall impact is still manageable, the rising unemployment could become a major policy concern, they wrote. \u201cIf unemployment increases sharply, it will change the policy reaction function and the risk is biased towards bolstered policy easing.\u201dA cheaper yuan would help the economy weather such shocks. In a worst-case scenario in which more than 5 million jobs are at risk, choosing to devalue the currency by around 12 per cent in 2019 compared to 2018 would offset the effect on the GDP and narrow the net job losses to 0.9 million, according to the analysts.However, that would lead to US$332 billion in capital outflows, burning more than a tenth of the nation\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, they calculated.

That\u2019s up from 24 per cent in fiscal 2017, before White took over, and 28 per cent for the three months ended July 31. Bank of Montreal\u2019s U.S. lender, BMO Harris Bank, alone earned $1.02 billion (US$760 million) in the fiscal year\u2019s first three quarters, and is on pace for an annual record.\u201cWe\u2019ll produce well through $1 billion of earnings from our U.S. operations this year, and that\u2019s been a conscious acceleration,\u201d said White, who took over as CEO in November.Canada\u2019s oldest bank made its first U.S. foray in 1818 by opening an agency office in New York. Its main U.S. push began in 1984 when it acquired Chicago-based Harris Bank, starting a decades-long expansion fuelled by acquisitions across the U.S. Midwest. The lender has also boosted wealth management and investment banking south of the Canadian border.White says he sees greater opportunity for growth in the U.S. than in Canada. Bank of Montreal has personal and commercial-banking business in 10 major U.S. cities, as well as wealth-management and capital-markets operations across the country.\u201cWe\u2019ve got feet on the ground and flags flying in markets that are a third of the U.S. GDP,\u201d White said. \u201cWe have an addressable market in which we are established \u2014 our brand flies, our people know what they\u2019re doing \u2014 that is already way bigger than Canada as far as GDP potential.\u201dThe U.S. capital-markets business posted US$40 million in third-quarter profit, its lowest in at least two years. White said that, while the business will be volatile, he expects profit of US$70 million to US$80 million a quarter within a couple years.\u201cIf we continue to get constructive markets for the next year, two years we\u2019ll consistently produce that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need anything else to do that.\u201dWhite said he sees no need to push to become a \u201cTop 10\u201d player in U.S. investment banking, a goal that Royal Bank of Canada has pursued for the past eight years.\u201cWe would have to consciously change our strategy, and that\u2019s not our intention,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have an objective of Top 10 would be a very different strategy and you\u2019d have to, in my view, sacrifice profitability along the way.\u201dThe U.S. provides opportunity for Bank of Montreal regardless of the outcome of talks among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement, White said. He said he expects the talks to succeed, though even if they fail it wouldn\u2019t be a disaster.A breakdown in NAFTA talks wouldn\u2019t hit the U.S. as hard as Canada, where it would probably shave about 1 per cent off of cumulative economic growth over five years, White said. For Bank of Montreal, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest lender by assets, the impact would be negligible, he said.\u201cI\u2019m worried about it, but it\u2019s not the top of my worry list,\u201d he said. A failed deal isn\u2019t good for either country, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more problematic for Canada than it is for the United States, and it\u2019s not catastrophic in each case.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Erik Schatzker.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Satyajit Das", "title": "We may be facing a textbook emerging-market crisis", "description": "Opinion: The number of emerging markets\u00a0at risk extends well beyond Turkey and Argentina", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/we-may-be-facing-a-textbook-emerging-market-crisis", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/argentina.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 5, 2018 5:00 AM EDT", "content": "Emerging-market stresses have been building since at least 2013.

Season with narrowly based industrial structures, reliance on commodity exports, institutional weaknesses, corruption and poor political and economic leadership.Based on these criteria, the number of emerging markets\u00a0at risk extends well beyond Turkey and Argentina. Like Tolstoy\u2019s\u00a0families, each nation has different sources of unhappiness.Total emerging-market borrowing increased from US$21 trillion (or 145 per cent\u00a0of GDP) in 2007 to US$63 trillion (210 per cent\u00a0of GDP) in 2017. Borrowings by non-financial corporations and households have jumped. Since 2007, the foreign-currency debt \u2013\u00a0in dollars, euros and yen \u2013\u00a0of these countries doubled to around US$9 trillion. China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and some Eastern European countries have foreign-currency debt between 20 per cent\u00a0and 50 per cent\u00a0of GDP.In all, EM\u00a0borrowers need to repay or refinance around US$1.5 trillion in debt in 2019 and again in 2020. Many are not earning enough to meet these commitments.Turkey and Argentina have twin deficits (combined budget and current-account gaps as a percentage of GDP) of 8.7 per cent\u00a0and 10.4 per cent,\u00a0respectively, that require\u00a0financing. Pakistan has a twin deficit well above 10 per cent. Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Ukraine are at or above 5 per cent\u00a0on that basis. In India, if state governments are included the number approaches double figures. Those gauges are rising in China, Malaysia, Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Poland.Then look at reserve coverage \u2013 foreign-exchange holdings\u00a0divided by 12-month funding needs for the current account, short-term debt maturities and amortization of long-term debt \u2013\u00a0which\u00a0measures the capacity to meet immediate foreign-currency obligations. Turkey and Argentina score 0.4 and 0.6 respectively, meaning they can\u2019t cover\u00a0their needs without new borrowings. Pakistan, Ecuador, Poland, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Africa have reserve coverage of less than 1. Chile, Hungary, Colombia, Mexico and India have coverage\u00a0of less than 2. Brazil and China come in at 2.5 and 3.1 times, respectively.Even where reserve coverage appears adequate, caution is warranted. Long-term debt becomes short term with the passage of time or an acceleration event. Forex holdings may not be readily accessible. Much of China\u2019s US$3 trillion of reserves is committed to the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. The ability to turn U.S. Treasury bonds and other foreign assets into cash is limited by liquidity, price and currency effects. Reserve positions are notoriously opaque:\u00a0In 1997, the Bank of Thailand was found to have grossly overstated available currency holdings.China and India face well-documented difficulties in their financial systems.\u00a0The true level of Chinese non-performing loans\u00a0may be several times the official 1.75 per cent. India\u2019s NPL ratio is around 10 per cent\u00a0of all loans.Events in Turkey and Argentina show how these weaknesses become exposed. Global liquidity tightening, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve increasing rates and unwinding its bond purchases, reduces capital inflows and increases the cost of borrowing. Trade tensions, sanctions, the breakdown of the global institutional structure and rising geopolitical risks exacerbate those\u00a0stresses.Weaknesses in the real economy and the financial system feed each other in a vicious cycle. Capital withdrawals undermine currencies, driving\u00a0down prices of assets such as bonds, stocks and property. The reduced availability of finance and higher funding costs add to pressure on over-extended borrowers, triggering banking problems that feed back into the economy. Credit rating and investment downgrades extend the cycle.Policy responses can make things worse. Higher interest rates to prop up currencies (60 per cent\u00a0in Argentina) may be ineffective. They reduce growth and aggravate the debt burden. Weaker currencies import inflation. Supporting the financial system and the economy\u00a0pressures government finances. IMF remedies, which aren\u2019t\u00a0always effective, impose financial and human costs that many nations find unacceptable, prompting political and social breakdown. And the IMF\u2019s capacity to assist may be constrained by concurrent crises.Investors are assuming\u00a0that critical vulnerabilities have been addressed.Important changes made after the 1997 Asian crisis created different risks, however. Floating exchange rates and unrestricted foreign-exchange movement increase currency volatility and allow capital flight. While local-currency debt has increased, unhedged foreign-currency debt remains significant.Higher returns on local-currency debt attracted foreign investors to India, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa and Eastern Europe. But weakening currencies may drive them to exit, hurting all assets.Turkey and Argentina may be special cases. But given the fundamental problems, other emerging markets are likely to come under pressure.

Exports jumped by an annualized 12.3 per cent, the biggest quarterly gain since 2014.Still, the numbers may be a slight disappointment as slowing business investment brought growth in below analyst forecasts \u2014 a development that may also give the Bank of Canada pause about speeding up interest-rate hikes.Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had anticipated a 3.1 per cent advance in the second quarter, while the central bank had been forecasting a 2.8 per cent gain.Gross business investment \u2014 which had been on a run of late \u2014 was up an annualized 1.5 per cent pace in the second quarter, the slowest since the end of 2016.Gross fixed capital formation \u2014 which includes government investment \u2014 grew by an annualized 0.9 per cent, which is below economist expectations for growth of closer to 4 per cent. Growth in non-residential structures, machinery and equipment slowed to 1.9 per cent from 11.4 per cent in the first quarter.Exports were a big positive and the largest contributor to growth, confirming the sector has stepped onto much more solid footing after struggling for years following the 2008-2009 recession.Consumer spending rebounded from a tough start to the year, accelerating at a 2.6 per cent pace in the second quarter, slightly faster than economists predicted. This suggests households are overcoming concerns that had been weighing on spending \u2014 in particular whether the country was in store for a sharp housing slowdown.A correction in housing didn\u2019t materialize however and investment in residential structures rebounded in the second quarter following a sharp decline in the first three months of the year.One negative in the consumption numbers may be that the increased spending was financed by a lower household savings rate.On a monthly basis, GDP in June was unchanged from May, weighed down by a major power outage at a key facility of Suncor Energy Inc., Canada\u2019s largest oil producer by market value.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michelle Jamrisko", "title": "Canada should be afraid of this indicator now flashing red, Goldman says", "description": "The private-sector financial balance is more powerful in predicting crises than the current-account balance and Canada is running a sizeable deficit", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canada-should-be-afraid-of-this-indicator-flashing-red-goldman-says?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/canada-money.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 27, 2018 7:41 AM EDT", "content": "One under-appreciated indicator is flashing red for some developed markets, Goldman Sachs analysts say.The private-sector financial balance \u2014 an economy\u2019s total income minus the spending of all households and businesses \u2014 has proven more powerful in predicting crises than the current-account balance, Goldman analysts led by Jan Hatzius, the bank\u2019s global head of economics, wrote in an Aug. 23 research note.\u201cThe good news is that the biggest DM economies \u2014 the U.S., the Euro area, and Japan \u2014 are all running healthy private sector surpluses,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe not-so-good news is that some of the smaller DM economies \u2014 especially Canada and the U.K. \u2014 are running sizable deficits and appear vulnerable to higher interest rates and weaker asset markets.\u201dThe finding is another warning sign for the global economy at a time of sporadic turbulence arising from monetary tightening, U.S.-China trade battles, and stress in some emerging markets.A private-sector deficit means households and firms can\u2019t finance their current spending with current income and rely on net borrowing or asset sales, the Goldman analysts wrote. That makes growth and financial stability more vulnerable in an environment of rising rates or market declines, they said.Canada and the United Kingdom appear to be the most exposed, particularly given an overheated Canadian housing market and the threat of Brexit negotiations slamming income expectations and private spending, they said.A private-sector surplus, on the other hand, is a strong predictor of growth. Tallying 17 developed economies from the mid-1980s to the present, the analysts show that when the private sector balance is 1 percent of GDP higher, the GDP relative to potential rises about 0.4 percentage point faster in the ensuing three years \u2014 an impact that they judge \u201ceconomically large.\u201dA large private-sector deficit is a more reliable indicator than either debt growth or asset prices, the Goldman analysts said.

Because without this thinking you would see numbers that you wouldn\u2019t believe, in reverse.\u201dHow seriously should people take Trump\u2019s claim that stocks would crash if he were kicked out of office? As you mull over an answer, consider what someone in the other party would say.Maybe there\u2019s a less subjective way to judge \u2014 with earnings estimates, perhaps, which have changed a lot during his presidency. Or maybe valuation. Neither is perfect, but nor is any quest for science in the stock market.Before digging in, acknowledge that stocks have enjoyed unusually strong gains since Election Day, with the S&P 500 rising at an annualized rate of 20 per cent, crushing the historical return of 9.4 per cent since 1927. At the same time, note the Trump return is only about 1 percentage point higher than the yearly gain since March 2009, an era mostly overseen by Barack Obama.Changes in earnings forecasts under Trump have been stark, compared with history. Last December, analysts were predicting S&P 500 earnings of about US$146 a share for 2018, forecasts that, thanks largely to the president\u2019s tax cuts, soared over the next two months, rising four times as fast as any period Bloomberg tracks. And companies made good: S&P 500 operating income jumped 24 per cent in each of the last two quarters and analysts see combined EPS of US$159 a share for all of this year.Predictions for 2019 profits also soared, going from US$163 a share at the start of the year to US$177 a share now, an upward revision that dwarfs any since at least 2012. Add to that a small bump in valuations: the S&P 500 fetched 20.07 times annual earnings on Election Day 2016 and 20.7 times now.So say what you will about intangibles, if you believe corporate earnings and valuation call the stock market\u2019s tune, it\u2019s hard to say the equity market doesn\u2019t owe at least some of its altitude to the president.Still, looking at earnings in isolation ignores a dozen other factors in speculating on how impeachment would affect stocks, from policy to sentiment to potentially catastrophic consequences for the country\u2019s social fabric. Any one of those could easily eclipse anything having to do with corporate profits. But without an obvious framework for gauging those outcomes, the income lens is what\u2019s left.In examining Trump\u2019s claim about a crash, investors might reasonably ask how much of the policy benefit would be rolled back if his presidency were threatened. Analysts were mostly skeptical the president is in any real danger and not sure there\u2019d be any major impact should he be.Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd.:\u201cFirst of all, it is very unlikely that President Trump would be impeached. If an impeachment did happen, we\u2019d experience volatility and perhaps a significant selloff, but I believe any such market moves would be short-term in nature. There are two reasons why: 1) We have already gotten the best of his agenda \u2014 tax reform and deregulation. Other elements of his agenda which he is currently pursuing, particularly his trade policies, are not supportive of growth and actually worry many business leaders. 2) Tax reform is the gift that keeps on giving. It will add to GDP growth for years to come \u2014 in fact, the CBO projects it will have an increasingly positive impact on GDP growth in the next several years. Also, if he were to be impeached, Mike Pence would assume the mantle and he has a strong track record of stimulating growth in Indiana. We can\u2019t forget that the stock market is surprisingly resilient when monetary policy is accommodative, and it arguably is still accommodative.\u201dCraig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. in London:\u201cThe market isn\u2019t hinging on anything substantial that hasn\u2019t already been carried through. The markets have largely rallied on tax reform and we\u2019ve seen that reflected in company earnings. But if there\u2019s political instability and the U.S. economic growth slowed significantly, that would have global implications.\u201dGreg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments LLC:\u201cThe economy, amped up on stimulus, is growing by close to 4 per cent, and unemployment is below 4 per cent. If the trade wars cool off a little this fall, we still think stocks can grind higher. It\u2019s not a pretty picture here in Washington, but as long as Trump doesn\u2019t go totally off the rails, investors can compartmentalize. With two more Trump associates now facing jail time, chances have improved that the House will flip back to the Democrats, who in private concede that an impeachment debate probably will begin by late winter. But we\u2019re sticking with our call \u2014 while the House might indict Trump, Senate conviction still looks unlikely, unless there\u2019s a major change in the second point.\u201dPast instances of presidential turmoil showed contrasting stock returns. In February 1974, when Congress initiated impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon, the market was in the midst of a 1973-1974 bear market that was punctuated by an oil crisis and an implosion of the world\u2019s foreign change rate system. The S&P 500 tumbled more than 30 per cent through October that year.In December 1998, when the House launched impeachment on Bill Clinton, stocks kept rising during the last stage of the Internet boom. The S&P 500 climbed for five straight months till Clinton\u2019s acquittal in February 1999.S&P 500 futures were flat as of 9:20 a.m. in New York and the index barely budged Wednesday in the aftermath of convictions of the Trump associates that sparked renewed discussion of a potential impeachment.\u201cEquity markets don\u2019t seem to care, and we think they are right,\u201d Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note. \u201cRates are low, the dollar is strong and corporate earnings remain robust. Those are the only things stock prices can (and should) actually discount.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Dani Burger.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jeff Kearns", "title": "Tariffs hurting U.S. economy, economists warn, with more pain to come if Trump withdraws from NAFTA", "description": "In a survey, 91% said current tariffs and threats of more to come were having 'unfavourable consequential impacts' on the U.S. economy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/tariffs-hurting-u-s-economy-economists-warn-with-more-pain-to-come-if-trump-withdraws-from-nafta?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/donald_trump3.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 20, 2018 9:58 AM EDT", "content": "Business economists are sounding some sour notes about Trump administration policies, from trade to immigration to the budget, while expecting the short-term boost to growth from Republican tax cuts to lessen over time.The National Association for Business Economics survey showed 91 per cent of respondents said current tariffs and threats of more to come were having \u201cunfavourable consequential impacts\u201d on the U.S. economy, according to a report released Monday. About two-thirds saw negative effects if the U.S. withdraws from the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.In the wake of large tax cuts enacted in late 2017, the share of those saying fiscal policy is too stimulative rose to 71 per cent from 52 per cent in February, according to the responses of 251 members collected from July 19 to Aug. 2. And 81 per cent said the federal deficit\u2019s share of gross domestic product should be reduced.\u201cIn general, the panel expects the federal deficit, as a percentage of the economy, to grow in the longer term, with eight out of 10 panelists indicating that fiscal policy should help shrink the deficit as a share of the economy,\u201d said survey chair Jim Diffley, an economist at IHS Markit Ltd.The cautious views are at odds with the President Donald Trump\u2019s upbeat assessment in tweets last week saying the U.S. economy is \u201cbetter than ever.\u201d Trump has also touted low rates of youth unemployment and, recently, falling joblessness among African-American and Hispanic workers.While survey respondents continued to see deregulation and tax cuts giving a boost to growth in the short term, they also saw the effects diminishing over time as government debt continues to rise.Almost two-thirds said the U.S. corporate tax system following the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was an improvement over the previous regime in terms of equity and efficiency, while 25 per cent viewed it as \u201csomewhat worse\u201d or \u201cfar worse\u201d than before.Changes to personal income taxes fared worse, with only 31 per cent considering the new system better in terms of equity and efficiency and about 54 per cent judging it \u201csomewhat worse\u201d or \u201cfar worse.\u201dSome 37 per cent said the tax cuts would boost 2018 U.S. GDP growth by a quarter to half percentage point, while 24 per cent saw gains of a half point to three quarters of a point, the survey showed.Forecasters were more upbeat on the Federal Reserve, with 76 per cent saying monetary policy is on the right track, the most in the semiannual survey in more than 11 years, according to NABE. Nineteen percent of respondents in the current survey said policy is \u201ctoo stimulative,\u201d while four percent said the central bank\u2019s stance is \u201ctoo restrictive.\u201d\u201cMost panelists believe the Federal Reserve\u2019s current inflation target of 2 per cent should be maintained. Of the remaining panelists, more favor raising the target than lowering it,\u201d said NABE Vice President Kevin Swift, chief economist for the American Chemistry Council.Other findings included:60 per cent said economic policy should do more to mitigate climate change.74 per cent said economic policy should do more to alleviate income inequality.63 per cent saw less than a 25 per cent chance of a meaningful infrastructure package in 2019.45 per cent said the Trump administration\u2019s deregulation drive has positively affected the economy so far, while 35 per cent saw it as a near-term plus that turns negative in the long run.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Karen E.

Trade between the two countries is small, valued at roughly US$4 billion, but the diplomatic dust-up has heightened the sense of risk in the Saudi investment climate, and is certain to scare even more capital away.According to research by JPMorgan, capital outflows of residents in Saudi Arabia are projected at US$65 billion in 2018, or 8.4 per cent of GDP. This is less than the US$80 billion lost in 2017, but a sign of a continued bleed. Significantly, the projection was made before the contretemps with Canada. According to research by Standard Chartered, the first quarter of 2018 saw US$14.4 billion in outward portfolio investment into foreign equities, the largest surge since 2008. There are concerns that the government is leaning on banks and asset managers to discourage outflows, a kind of informal capital-control regime.This flight signals the dimming of the optimism surrounding Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s Vision 2030 economic plan. Many of the institutional reforms outlined in the plan \u2014 designed to diversify the Saudi economy, attract foreign investment\u00a0and create jobs \u2014 are needed to liberalize the state-led, resource-dependent economy. Investors had hoped Riyadh would follow through on economic reforms, but have been disheartened by such high-profile actions as the arrest of prominent businessmen last year, and a recent campaign to silence critics, especially women activists. These measures \u2014 add to them now the spat with Canada \u2014 indicate that the state favours regime stability and consolidation over the rule of law, and the creation of institutions and regulations that can check the state.Whatever the political compulsions behind these actions, they have done little to address the fundamental problem of the Saudi economy \u2014 that it is captive to, and reliant on, the state. For private-sector growth to take place, capital needs to feel safe, and investors need legal guarantees to protect them. But this has not happened. Instead, the business cycle continues to be fuelled by government project-spending tied to oil revenues: Government deposits appear in local banks, then loans go out to favoured private-sector contractors. Business activity ebbs and flows with the boom-and-bust cycle of oil revenues.It is striking that the capital flight is taking place despite a recent recovery in global oil prices. The Saudi current account will be supported by US$224 billion in hydrocarbon exports in 2018, a massive jump from US$170 billion last year. But this is apparently insufficient to reassure investors, who have noted the absence of a corresponding jump in foreign reserve assets. Nor has it escaped their attention that the new revenue stream is not cushioning the expansionary fiscal policy, which continues to run a deficit.All this adds up to a dismal, and familiar picture: Government spending is accelerating, growth is slow, private investors are scared, and productivity is abysmal \u2014 especially as the labour market continues to shrink from departing foreign workers, and businesses struggle to accommodate mandated hiring of Saudi citizens at higher wages. The government\u2019s response so far has been to keep borrowing, and to pay for the stimulus with debt-financing. It is doing some interesting accounting between state-owned entities, like Aramco and SABIC, to raise cash for the sovereign fund, known as the Public Investment Fund, enabling continued spending.While efforts at privatization and encouraging private-sector investment have lagged, government spending continues to focus on large, state-funded development and infrastructure projects, where the money sinks in the sand. That seems to be the destiny of the latest white elephant: Neom, a US$500-billion project to develop 10,000 square miles in the northwestern corner of Saudi Arabia, on the shores of the Red Sea. It is far from major population centres, where people are looking for work, and there is a mismatch between planned high-tech industrial projects and the Saudi labour force\u2019s available skill set. The only jobs Neom is currently creating are in low-wage construction for foreigners, of whom there are now fewer, as many are leaving due to increasing visa fees and cost of living.Government spending is accelerating, growth is slow, private investors are scared, and productivity is abysmalThis is quintessential\u00a0old-school Saudi economic management, and a long way from the spirit of the Crown Prince\u2019s reform plan. Add to this Riyadh\u2019s evident distraction with non-economic matters \u2014 ranging from the war in Yemen and the blockade of Qatar, to the arrest of activists and the campaign against Canada \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to fault investors for concluding that the government is struggling to meet its Vision 2030 goals, and for sending their money elsewhere.How to reverse the flow? There are good regulatory reforms in process in Saudi Arabia, including a new bankruptcy law and a privatization draft law. There are new openings for foreigners to buy shares on the local stock exchange and to become 100 per cent owners of businesses in key sectors like engineering. In the opening of the entertainment market, there is clearly room to grow and investment opportunity should abound.But the state needs to get out of the way. It cannot spend its way to prosperity, especially using the old techniques of project-based investment in large real-estate and infrastructure plans. Moreover, the prized assets of the state, like Aramco and SABIC, should not be used as cash cows to feed the experiments of the PIF\u2019s outward investment strategies. Most important, the government needs to demonstrate that it is prioritizing economic reforms, rather than being distracted by domestic politics and foreign-policy missteps.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Oil drives Canada's fastest economic growth spurt in a year", "description": "Further evidence of economy\u2019s solid expansion despite trade tensions", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/oil-drives-canadas-fastest-economic-growth-spurt-in-a-year", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/0612oil.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 31, 2018 12:20 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy grew at the fastest pace in a year with gains led by crude oil, further evidence of a solid expansion even as trade tensions with the U.S. remain a threat.Gross domestic product expanded by 0.5 per cent in May, faster than the 0.3 per cent forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.Non-conventional oil output jumped 5.3 per cent for the sixth gain in seven months as more production came back online after shutdowns, Statistics Canada said Tuesday from Ottawa.Nineteen of 20 industries showed gains on the month, including retail sales rising 2 per cent on the heels of weakness in April linked to cold weather.The world\u2019s 10th largest economy is on track for annualized growth of at least 2 per cent for the rest of this year after weakness in the first quarter. Consumer spending is supported by a strong job market and some companies are boosting investment as they reach their capacity limits.GDP grew by 2.6 per cent in May from a year earlier, the statistics agency said.Bank of Canada policy makers raised interest rates this month for the fourth time in a year and said more increases may be needed in a fairly tight economy. Investors were putting 25 per cent odds on another rate increase at the central bank\u2019s next meeting before Tuesday\u2019s GDP report was published.The wild card remains a growing trade fight with the U.S. that threatens the North American Free Trade Agreement and keeps pressure on other sectors including lumber and uranium.

After ramping up spending in recent budgets to finance Prime Minister\u2019s Justin Trudeau\u2019s ambitious social agenda, there is little room for expensive new initiatives for business such as a broad-based tax cut, particularly if the government wants to keep to its promise of limiting the pace of debt accumulation to below the level of GDP growth.Morneau said his February fiscal plan \u2014 which anticipates a gradual reduction of deficit spending over the next six years \u2014 will benefit from a recent pick up in oil prices but the windfalls aren\u2019t significant enough to alter the fiscal outlook, which he said is largely in line with what was projected in his February budget.\u201cI don\u2019t think we should get ahead of ourselves in assuming that that\u2019s actually going to have an enormous change in terms of our projections,\u201d Morneau said.Uncertainty over the fate of NAFTA have added to the challenges for the nation\u2019s business and Morneau said his government is still working hard on getting a deal done. Morneau said he hopes the election of a new president in Mexico will return a \u201csense of urgency\u201d to the negotiations.\u201cGetting us back to where we were, you know, maybe a month or so ago, and that opportunity is going to emerge now,\u201d said Morneau, who will be traveling to Mexico this week with Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland and Trade Minister Jim Carr to hold talks with the incoming Mexican government.Morneau said that some of the biggest issues in renegotiating NAFTA are actually between Mexico and the U.S. He\u2019s optimistic there is a \u201creasonable path\u201d toward resolving some of the sticking points for Canada \u2014 the country rejects a U.S. demand to include a sunset clause into the deal and insists the pact include a dispute resolution system.Another major file on Morneau\u2019s desk in recent months has been the government\u2019s $4.5 billion (US$3.4 billion) acquisition of the Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd.\u2019s Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which Morneau said should be finalized within the next two months.The government had an option to find another private buyer for the pipeline by July 22 before nationalizing it, but a quick sale won\u2019t happen, Morneau said.\u201cOur conclusion is that we have to think about what\u2019s our first objective and our first objective is to get the pipeline built and that objective is thwarted if there\u2019s uncertainty in terms of the ability to actually get the pipeline laid down,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just not plausible for us to do it in that timeframe.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Eddie van der Walt, Mark Burton and Rupert Rowling", "title": "Commodities just tumbled into correction \u2014 a warning sign for the economy and markets", "description": "The inputs in the global supply chain are flashing red", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/global-market-calm-at-risk-as-commodities-sink-into-correction?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/copper-pipe.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 19, 2018 1:34 PM EDT", "content": "Don\u2019t be fooled by the relative calm across financial markets: The inputs in the global supply chain are flashing warning signs.Commodities have tumbled into correction territory Thursday, sliding again in the face of the resurgent dollar and lingering global trade tensions. Among the recent milestones: Copper dipping below US$6,000. West Texas Intermediate crude testing US$68. Gold crashing through US$1,220.The metal moves, in particular, are key to investors. Prices in the sector can be used to predict the pace of global growth before other measures, like business surveys or trade data, even become available. They would have presaged an upturn in early 2016, for instance, according to Bank of England economist Tom Wise. Most forecasters didn\u2019t.\u201cMetals prices are timely, highly correlated with world economic activity and perform well at predicting short-term movements in GDP,\u201d Wise said in research published on the central bank\u2019s blog. \u201cConsumption moves very closely with GDP.\u201dAs the Bloomberg Commodity Index declines 10 per cent from its almost three-year peak in May, here\u2019s a look at how the sell-off is feeding into other assets.The moves are clearly showing up in equity markets, with miners the worst performers in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index this month.That miners are heavily exposed to metal prices is predictable, but the dependence is growing. A 10 per cent move in the LMEX Index of six base metals corresponded to a 7 per cent move in the Stoxx Europe 600 Basic Resources sub-index in the past year \u2014 that\u2019s stronger than during the preceding decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The weakness in material prices is spilling over into the currencies of producer nations.The Canadian dollar was down almost half a U.S. cent at 75.46 Thursday morning.Almost all of the 22 raw materials comprising the Bloomberg Commodity Index have fallen since the May peak, with only live cattle, cotton and orange juice futures bucking the trend. Copper, often used as bellwether for the global economy due to its wide-ranging industrial applications, fell 18 per cent in the period.The same picture is on display in emerging-market currencies, where 21 out of 24 tracked by Bloomberg declined. The biggest losers included nations such as South Africa, a producer of base and precious metals and coal; Brazil, which exports iron ore, agricultural and petroleum products; Chile, a major copper producer; and Russia, which relies on natural gas, metals and other commodity exports.\u201cA looming trade war and uncertainty about Chinese demand weigh on commodity prices and related currencies,\u201d said Georgette Boele, currency and metals strategist at ABN Amro Bank NV. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s nervousness about China, commodities will remain exposed to the trade war.\u201dIn a vicious circle, both the currencies of producer nations and commodities face not only the threat of a protectionist-driven slowdown, but also the strengthening dollar, which advanced for a third day on Thursday. The greenback is getting a lift from the trade dispute, as American growth remains robust and investors switch into U.S. assets.The recipe for other developing-nation assets is toxic. The correlation between the Bloomberg Commodity Index and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks has strengthened \u2014 in April it hit the highest level in more than five years when measured over 120 days.Of course, weakness in raw materials may be a knee-jerk change in sentiment that has little to do with fundamentals. Analysts at ING Bank NV and Commerzbank AG both see the sell-off nearing its bottom with prices expected to recover in the final quarter of the year when the hostilities of the trade war ease.\u201cPrices have come down too far and we expect a sharp counter-movement once the situation calms down,\u201d Daniel Briesemann, analyst at Commerzbank, said by phone. \u201cMany speculators have already withdrawn their positions so the headwinds base metals have faced should start to abate. Further out the fundamentals in most cases show tight markets.\u201dMeanwhile, the pass-through of commodity prices to other markets is not straightforward because raw materials have a dual role as an input cost as well as a barometer of demand. When prices fall it can feed into the real economy, working against inflation and potentially resulting in easier monetary policy \u2014 which could ultimately help spur financial assets.Yet the lower prices of raw materials have immediate implications for investment spending, and may impact consumer sentiment. For example, as much as 10 per cent of copper production is now unprofitable, according to research from BMO Capital Markets. That could eventually mean layoffs or lower capital investment, which loops back into global demand.\u201cThe potential damage to the global economy extends beyond trade,\u201d Jon Harrison at TS Lombard said in an emailed note. \u201cUncertainty may already be discouraging investment and emerging-market assets will react to U.S. threats of further escalation even if the threatened actions are not ultimately implemented.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rich Miller", "title": "The front-line fighters of the financial crisis are getting nervous about the next one", "description": "Bernanke, Geithner and Paulson worry emergency powers have faded and debt has doubled", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bernanke-geithner-paulson-voice-some-concern-about-next-crisis", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/fighters.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 18, 2018 2:05 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve policy makers appear confident that they have the weapons they\u2019ll need to fight the next financial crisis. Some of their predecessors on the front lines are not so sure.Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner and Henry Paulson all voiced varying degrees of concern about America\u2019s ability to combat another financial meltdown 10 years after they played prominent roles battling the last one.While agreeing that the banking system is a lot stronger than it was back then, they saw some weak spots in the country\u2019s crisis-fighting arsenal that didn\u2019t exist a decade ago. The trio also decried the nation\u2019s ballooning budget deficits in a joint briefing with reporters.Publicly-held federal debt now stands at 77% of GDP, double what it was in 2007\u201cWe\u2019ve got better defences against the more mild, typical sets of shocks that happen to economies and financial systems but in the extreme crisis probably less degree of freedom, more constraints than would be ideal,\u201d former Treasury Secretary and New York Federal Reserve Bank President Geithner said.The U.S. instituted a raft of reforms after the last crisis drove the economy into its worst recession since the Great Depression. Some were designed to fortify the country\u2019s biggest banks and make it easier to shut them down so they wouldn\u2019t have to be rescued by the government if they ran into trouble.Others though limited the discretionary power of the Fed, the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to provide financial institutions with support as lawmakers responded to a public backlash against bailouts and Wall Street.Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles acknowledged in April that the tools available to regulators in an emergency had changed. But he told a conference in Washington, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too negative about our ability to respond in the future.\u201dHis boss, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, has voiced confidence in the government\u2019s ability to shut down a failing financial institution in a crisis without having to sink money in it, telling lawmakers in November that no bank is too big to fail.Geithner, who is president of private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, argued that the emergency powers that proved so essential a decade ago are \u201csomewhat weaker\u201d today.Former Treasury Secretary Paulson agreed, pointing in particular to the limits that Congress placed on the FDIC and the Treasury\u2019s Exchange Stabilization Fund.\u201cThere is some concern there,\u201d said former Fed Chairman Bernanke, who is now a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, though he also noted that regulators are now more attuned to potential systemic risks.The former Fed chief, who was nominated by George W. Bush and given a second term by Barack Obama, criticized the deficit-ballooning tax cuts and spending increases agreed to by President Donald Trump and Congress as ill-timed. Bernanke noted that they come as the country is at or near full employment. He also voiced concern about the longer-term consequences of rapidly rising government debt.\u201cIf we don\u2019t act, that is the most certain fiscal or economic crisis we will have,\u201d said Paulson, who chairs his own institute in Chicago. \u201cIt will slowly strangle us.\u201dThe enlarged deficits and debt also mean that the government has less room to pump up demand than it did during the last crisis, when Obama pushed through a massive stimulus package, Geithner said.Publicly-held federal debt now stands at 77 per cent of gross domestic product, double what it was in 2007.The Fed, too, has less scope to act as interest rates are lower, Geithner said. The central bank\u2019s benchmark rate target is now 1.75 to 2 per cent. It was 5.25 per cent in July 2007.Bernanke though noted that the U.S. central bank is better positioned to respond than other advanced economies. The European Central Bank, for instance, has a benchmark interest rate of zero.The former Fed chairman said the U.S. had made \u201ca lot of progress\u201d toward being able to resolve failing financial institutions without having to bail them out.Paulson basically agreed, with one big proviso. In the midst of a crisis, policy makers may have to provide temporary support so that a collapsing institution can be liquidated over time \u2014 even if that proves politically difficult to do.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have this authority but somebody has got to be prepared to use it and use it in controversial ways,\u201d he said.Asked if policy makers and politicians would be able to set aside their differences to tackle any future turmoil given the toxic atmosphere in Washington, Paulson replied that the answer is \u201cunknowable.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cit\u2019s the right question to ask.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katherine Greifeld", "title": "World\u2019s largest money manager says Bank of Canada will hold rates in July", "description": "BlackRock changed its hike forecast after Stephen Poloz struck a dovish tone yesterday, sending the loonie to a year low", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/blackrock-says-bank-of-canadas-july-rate-hike-is-on-hold", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 28, 2018 11:09 AM EDT", "content": "The world\u2019s largest money manager is revising its expectations for the Bank of Canada\u2019s policy tightening path.BlackRock Inc. no longer sees the BOC raising interest rates at the conclusion of its July 11 meeting, after Governor Stephen Poloz struck a dovish tone during Wednesday\u2019s highly anticipated speech.

Now it\u2019s looking more like a coin flip.Since May, consumer confidence has plummeted to its lowest level since April 2016 as trade tensions with the U.S., far and away Canada\u2019s most important export market, have ratcheted higher. The data-dependent central bank has also seen economic data deteriorate, punctuated by Friday\u2019s figures that showed a retreat in April retail sales as well as slower than expected inflation for May. Canada\u2019s economic surprise index sank to its lowest level since 2013 in the wake of those releases.\u201cWednesday\u2019s speech is important indeed, especially given the disappointing real-side data and the surprising meltdown in the inflation report,\u201d said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc.Poloz is due to address the Greater Victoria Chamber of Commerce at 3:15 p.m. New York time, with a press conference to follow. The governor has largely eschewed forward guidance in favour of letting markets work out the likely course of the policy rate based on the evolution of economic data. But traders are still conditioned to react to what hints they do get from the Bank of Canada.\u201cThe market is reflecting what the data is showing, and the governor is going to have to address that in his speech,\u201d added Randall Bartlett, chief economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy. \u201cThe most recent data and the forward-looking pressures on inflation are telling you two different things.\u201dOdds of a rate increase in July moved up by about 25 percentage points after shifts to the language of the May statement seemingly paved the way for a hike in short order. The recent round of underwhelming data caused those odds to move to the downside by only half as much.\u201cGovernor Poloz may not be a fan of forward guidance, but lately the Bank of Canada has been clearer in its signals as it tries to prepare households and businesses for a higher rate environment,\u201d said Frances Donald, senior economist at Manulife Asset Management. \u201cMy advice to markets: if Poloz leans hawkish on Wednesday, believe him.\u201dOne wild card ahead of the speech: policy makers will have already viewed the summer Business Outlook Survey, to be released on Friday. This publication gives the central bank an idea of major Canadian employers\u2019 sales prospects as well as their hiring and expansion plans. Recent editions have shown that businesses still plan to invest in spite of persistent worries about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a dynamic that has helped inform the central bank\u2019s willingness to withdraw monetary accommodation.\u201cWe think there\u2019ll be a July hike but we\u2019re not pounding the table on it, particularly since the Governor knows something we don\u2019t in terms of the Business Outlook Survey,\u201d said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets. \u201cThe GDP outlook is more important than recent inflation numbers, so it depends on the message the BOS gives them on where growth is expected to go, especially capital spending.\u201dRosenberg and Bartlett also suggested that Poloz\u2019s tone and assessment of the economic outlook on Wednesday might indeed be influenced by having had a sneak peek at those results, one way or another.Some economists, however, cautioned that traders looking for Poloz to tip his hand on Wednesday may end up disappointed.\u201cIt\u2019s something to watch, and it\u2019s possible that Mr. Poloz makes comments that reverse course relative to April and May,\u201d said David Doyle, analyst at Macquarie Capital Markets. \u201cMy gut would tell me he won\u2019t do much to change those market expectations, and he will try to be quite cagey.\u201dMost agree that the recent tumble in the economic surprise index overstates any softness in Canadian activity, pointing to seasonal factors as contributing to the weakness and saying the economy is strong enough to warrant the continued normalization of monetary policy.\u201cWe\u2019re still operating at around capacity, the housing market is correcting in a gradual way, in a way that\u2019s not extremely disruptive, and the labour market is extremely hot,\u201d said IFSD\u2019s Bartlett.\u201cThe Bank of Canada sent as clear a signal as they could that a rate hike was imminent, and they would not have done so if their confidence in the medium-term outlook was not very strong and immune to some weaker-than-expected data in the short-run,\u201d added Manulife\u2019s Donald.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Odds of rate hike just dropped to 54% as inflation stalls, retail sales drop", "description": "Canada's economy showed unexpected weakness in the second quarter", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-economy-falters-as-inflation-stalls-retail-sales-drop", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/retail.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 22, 2018 9:52 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy showed unexpected weakness in the second quarter, recording sluggish readings for both inflation and retail sales.The consumer price index recorded an annual pace of 2.2 per cent in May, unchanged from April and well below economist expectations for a 2.6 per cent gain, Statistics Canada said Friday. In a separate report, the Ottawa-based agency said retailers recorded a 1.2 per cent sales drop in April, also unexpected.The reports \u2014 which come on the heels of other disappointing data \u2014 raise questions about the underlying strength of the economy and could cast some doubt about how quickly the Bank of Canada proceeds with future rate hikes.\u201cThe soft patch in Canadian data continued today,\u201d Royce Mendes, an economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to investors.The Canadian dollar fell after the reports, and was down 0.2 per cent to 74.95 US cents at 8:38 a.m. in Toronto trading. Investors pared their expectations for rate hikes this year. Swaps trading suggests a 54 per cent probability of a hike at the Bank of Canada\u2019s next rate decision on July 11, down from about two-thirds earlier in the day. A hike isn\u2019t fully priced in until October, with chances of a second hike by December below 50 per cent.As recently as last month, more than two more rate hikes had been priced in this year, adding to the three increases the Bank of Canada has already taken.The \u201cbad data make it even more difficult for the Bank of Canada to hike rates in July,\u201d said Mendes. There is \u201cstill time for the data to turn\u201d before the next rate decision with the April GDP release and June employment data due before then, he said.The inflation numbers were a major surprise given economists were anticipating a sharp pick-up in prices in May on the back of higher gasoline prices. However, a sharp decline in telephone services and cars last month acted as a brake on inflationary pressures coming from higher gas prices, the effects of minimum wage increases and higher mortgage rates.On the month, consumer prices rose just 0.1 per cent in May, down from a 0.3 per cent gain in April and well below expectations for a 0.4 per cent gain, Statistics Canada reported.Core measures of inflation \u2014 seen by officials as a better gauge of underlying inflation trends \u2014 posted their lowest readings since January.The weak April retail sales numbers reflected a sharp decrease in car sales. Even excluding autos, the numbers came in below what economists were expecting. Sales excluding car dealers were down 0.1 per cent, versus economist expectations for a 0.5 per cent gain. Retail sales were also down 1.4 per cent once price changes were factored out.One explanation for the poor retail numbers may have been poor weather, Statistics Canada said.\u201cInclement weather in many parts of Canada may have contributed to the overall decline in April,\u201d the agency said in a statement.Nor are the inflation numbers out of line with the Bank of Canada\u2019s own estimates. Its last forecasts \u2014 released in April projected second quarter inflation to average 2.3 per cent \u2014 and the numbers are currently on track for 2.2 per cent. That\u2019s still a lot higher than what the nation has been able to produce recently, with inflation averaging just 1.4 per cent between 2015 and 2017.Yet, the recent pattern has been one of weakness across the economy \u2014 which could be a concern. The poor inflation and retail sales data have come on the back of weak manufacturing sales and employment data \u2014 all within the context of growing trade worries.\u2022 The average of the Bank of Canada\u2019s three key core\u00a0inflation\u00a0measures fell to 1.9 per cent in May from 1.97 per cent in April \u2022 The \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cmedian\u201d core rates were unchanged at 1.9 per cent, while the \u201ctrim\u201d rate fell to 1.9 per cent from 2.1 per cent \u2022 Inflation for services was unchanged in May at 2.3 per cent. Goods inflation picked up to 2.2 per cent, from 2.1 per cent \u2022 Seasonally adjusted inflation was 0.1 per cent in May, unchanged from a month earlier \u2022 Car prices fell 1.5 per cent in May and telephone services were down 4.3 per cent, acting as the biggest downward contributors during the monthSales were down in 8 of 11 sub-sectors tracked by Statistics Canada Ontario (down 2.3 per cent) and Quebec (down 2.7 per cent) were the biggest drivers of the decline in retail sales in AprilBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Bets on Bank of Canada rate hike this month plunge after data Friday", "description": "Odds fall from 40% to 28%", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/steady-as-she-goes-canadian-economy-backs-cautious-rate-stance", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/loonie.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 18, 2018 2:48 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy continues to show signs of strength, but not enough to fuel inflation and prompt aggressive rate hikes \u2014 a scenario that validates the Bank of Canada\u2019s cautious stance on monetary policy.Inflation figures Friday by Statistics Canada showed few signs of any sharp pick-up in price pressures even as the economy operates near its full capacity and gasoline prices are rising.

After three hikes since July, investors are anticipating two more increases this year: in July and October.\u201cThey would say things are pretty much unfolding as expected,\u201d Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto, said by phone. \u201cYou don\u2019t accelerate the time table, you don\u2019t push it back, you just follow through on it.\u201dFriday\u2019s inflation data showed the consumer price index rising at an annual pace of 2.2 per cent in April, down from 2.3 per cent in March. A narrower gauge of core prices closely tracked by the central bank was little changed at 2 per cent.Retailers, meanwhile, recorded their largest sales gain in five months in March as the nation\u2019s households continued their car-buying binge.The Canadian dollar fell on the data, trading down 0.5 per cent to C$1.2877 per U.S. dollar at 11:45 a.m., largely due to investors paring down bets on a move at the next rate announcement May 30. The implied odds of a hike this month are now 28 per cent, versus nearly 40 per cent Thursday.\u201cThe odds of a May rate hike were scaled back notably in the wake of the data \u2014 perhaps reflecting the fact that the previous pricing required a very strong set of figures today, and that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a note to investors.After a slowdown that began in the second half of last year, most economists are anticipating growth will return to an above 2-per cent pace in coming months and continue to put pressure on Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to raise interest rates. A slump in first-quarter growth is also turning out to be less severe than initially feared. The economy probably expanded at just under 2 per cent in the first three months of 2018, better than the 1.3 per cent predicted by the central bank last month.Statistics Canada will release first-quarter GDP data on May 31, the day after Poloz\u2019s rate decision. At the bank\u2019s last rate decision April 18, officials reiterated they are in no rush to thwart the current expansion with aggressive rate hikes, particularly when plenty of headwinds remain such as uncertainty on global trade policy and the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "What will surging oil prices mean for Canada? \u2014 not what they used to", "description": "Traditional channels between our economy\u2019s prosperity and oil prices have become \u2018compromised\u2019", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/rising-global-oil-prices-wont-put-much-wind-in-canadas-sails?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/oil-alberta.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 10, 2018 1:04 PM EDT", "content": "While the rally in oil prices threatens to be a drag on global growth, it\u2019s a good thing for Canada, the world\u2019s fourth largest producer.Yet whether the benefits are large enough to make a big difference is an open question, given doubts around the sustainability of the price increases and obstacles to investment like rail and pipeline constraints. While more expensive oil should reinforce expectations that borrowing costs are eventually going higher, most economists predict little impact on growth, and views are mixed on what it means for the Bank of Canada\u2019s projected rate-hike path in the near term.Bloomberg spoke to economists at the five largest Canadian banks on what higher oil prices will mean for the economy and interest rates.According to Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt, the mere fact oil prices are moving higher has hawkish implications for the central bank and could potentially move the dial on rate increases.The most immediate impact on the economy is a boost to national income. Even if Canada doesn\u2019t produce an extra barrel of oil beyond the roughly 4.9 million it churns out daily, higher prices mean more money in the oil industry\u2019s pockets and that will spillover into wages, jobs and tax revenue.Higher oil prices \u201cfit into a broader picture that suggests there should be no hesitation to continue along a hiking path in the near term,\u201d Holt said.While corporate profits will rise and some of that will eventually spill over into the rest of the economy, the pass-through effects aren\u2019t what they once were.Right now, pipeline constraints seem to be the primary determinant of investment. The industry is also being hampered by rail bottlenecks and a less favourable tax environment after President Donald Trump cut U.S. corporate taxes. So, it\u2019s less clear what impact higher prices will actually have on oil production and investment.The Bank of Canada\u2019s latest quarterly forecasts were based on the assumption of West Texas Intermediate oil prices at US$60 a barrel, which is about $10 dollars less than its current value. According to Royal Bank of Canada economist Mark Chandler, a $10 a barrel difference implies under normal conditions a reduction in slack by about 0.25 per cent of gross domestic product. But some of these channels between oil prices and investment have been \u201ccompromised,\u201d he said.\u201cIt helps incomes,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really help GDP directly.\u201dThere is also the issue of whether the recent jump in oil prices is sustainable. Slowing global growth and the possibility of a more favourable solution to the Iran situation than feared suggest the current mark-up in oil prices isn\u2019t justified, according to Bank of Montreal economist Michael Gregory, who sees fundamentals for oil closer to US$60 a barrel. Gregory said his hunch is the Bank of Canada probably sees it the same way.\u201cBottom line, they will look past it,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cOverall, this is neutral to slightly more encouraging for the Canadian economy but not to the point where it turns the dial on any risk or maybe gets the Bank of Canada to increase proclivity to do something.\u201dThe same argument goes for inflation. While higher oil prices will only fuel the pick-up expected this year, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said he\u2019s not worried about price gains above his 2 per cent target as long as they are temporary.It\u2019s \u201cunlikely to spur an aggressive reaction from central bank officials,\u201d said Royce Mendes, an economist at CIBC World Markets. \u201cThey are trying to look for evidence of an economy that is overheating. Higher oil prices are not really evidence of that.\u201dWhatever the benefits from the pick-up in oil prices, they still won\u2019t be enough to offset the list of concerns that have been troubling the Bank of Canada recently. Foremost among those are talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the large levels of debt some households are carrying.\u201cBroadly speaking this is a fairly positive development \u2014 particularly for the oil sector, the profitability story, the income story \u2014 but again they are balancing this out against very, very stretched household finances,\u201d said Brian DePratto, an economist at Toronto Dominion Bank. \u201cThe balance of things suggest continued caution.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Elena Popina", "title": "Apple is just 16 bucks away from hitting $1 trillion market cap", "description": "Shares just need to rise 8.6 per cent, like they did last week, for stock to go over the top", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/apple-needs-an-8-6-rally-to-reach-1-trillion-milestone", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/apple.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 7, 2018 1:54 PM EDT", "content": "Apple\u2019s road to $1 trillion in market value is just 16 bucks away.That\u2019s how much each share of the iPhone maker needs to rise for Apple to reach a round-number market capitalization of $1 trillion.Apple has risen for six consecutive sessions to reach $187.47 at 11:26 a.m. in New York, bringing its market cap to about $920.8 billion.

Trump was poised to sign an executive memo issuing the instructions on Thursday at the White House. Within 15 days, USTR will come up with a proposed list of products that will face higher tariffs.\u201cThis has been long in the making,\u201d Trump said, adding that the tariffs could affect as much as US$60 billion in goods. \u201cWe have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on\u201d with China affecting hundreds of billions of dollars in trade each year, he said.Trump also directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to propose new investment restrictions on Chinese companies within 60 days to safeguard technologies the U.S. views as strategic, said senior White House economic adviser Everett Eissenstat.Policy makers across the world are warning of a brewing trade war that could undermine the broadest global recovery in years. U.S. stocks fell sharply early Thursday amid worries that the U.S. action could provoke a stern response from China, with the S&P 500 down 1.1 percent at 12:30 p.m. New York time. Meanwhile, business groups representing companies ranging from Walmart Inc. to Amazon.com Inc. are warning U.S. tariffs could raise prices for consumers and sideswipe stock prices.Even central banks, which normally stay above the fray of trade spats, are weighing in. \u201cA number of participants reported about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said this week, while cautioning that trade issues haven\u2019t changed the Fed\u2019s outlook. The Bank of England warned Thursday that increased protectionism could have a \u201csignificant negative impact\u201d on global growth.The Trump administration is framing the move as a major turning point in U.S.-China relations. It followed a seven-month investigation by USTR into allegations China violates U.S. intellectual property, under the seldom-used section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. The U.S. concluded China engages in a range of violations, including policies that force American companies to transfer technology and the accessing of trade secrets through hacking, said Eissenstat.Trump tried to make it clear he wasn\u2019t trying to provoke China.\u201cI view them as a friend. I have tremendous respect for President Xi,\u201d Trump said. But, the U.S.\u2019s trade deficit with China is \u201cthe largest deficit in the history of our world,\u201d he said.The president\u2019s action brought rare praise from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, ordinarily a foe of the administration.The president is \u201cexactly right\u201d to pursue the tariffs, Schumer said. \u201cI want to give him a big pat on the back,\u201d the New York senator added, \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that this administration is taking strong action to get a better deal on China.\u201dTrump\u2019s actions represent a \u201cseismic shift from an era dating back to Nixon and Kissinger, where we had as a government viewed China in terms of economic engagement,\u201d White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThat process has failed.\u201d\u201cThe problem is that with the Chinese in this case, talk is not cheap. It has been very expensive for America,\u201d said Navarro. \u201cFinally the president decided that we needed to move forward.\u201dBefore the tariffs become final, there will be a 30-day comment period, the White House said. Trump also directed his officials to pursue a World Trade Organization complaint against China for discriminatory licensing practices.It will be Trump\u2019s first trade action directly aimed at China, which he has blamed for the hollowing out of the American manufacturing sector and the loss of U.S. jobs. The Trump administration is also increasingly signalling it will exclude allies such as the European Union and Brazil from tariffs on steel and aluminum that take effect Friday, suggesting the U.S. is more interested in raising pressure on China, the world\u2019s biggest producer of both commodities.China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has cautioned against the U.S. taking measures \u201cdetrimental to both sides.\u201d The nation strongly opposes such unilateral and protectionist action, and will take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to firmly defend its interests, the ministry said in a statement on its website.\u201cIf Trump really signs the order, that is a declaration of trade war with China,\u201d said Wei Jianguo, former vice commerce minister and now an executive deputy director of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a government-linked think tank.\u201cChina is not afraid, nor will it dodge a trade war,\u201d Wei said. \u201cWe have plenty of measures to fight back, in areas of automobile imports, soybean, aircraft and chips. On the other hand, Trump should know that this is a very bad idea, and there will be no winner, and there will be no good outcome for both nations.\u201dChinese Premier Li Keqiang said this week that the nation will further open its economy, including the manufacturing sector, and pledged to lower import tariffs and cut taxes. In opening manufacturing further, China won\u2019t force foreign companies to transfer technology to domestic ones and will protect intellectual property, he said.Bloomberg Economics estimates a global trade conflagration could wipe US$470 billion off the world economy by 2020.\u201cUS$50 billion in tariffs against China, if that is what the U.S. moves ahead with, is serious money. Even so, the impact on China\u2019s GDP would still be just a fraction of a percent off the growth rate,\u201d Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics, wrote in a note. \u201cThe greater risk comes to China\u2019s long-term development trajectory, if the rise of economic nationalism impedes their march up the value chain.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Maciej Onoszko, Kristine Owram and Matthew Winkler", "title": "Trump has made U.S. a much better bet than Canada: top fund managers", "description": "In Canada, a ticking consumer-debt bomb and declining competitiveness are dragging on asset prices, and fund managers are looking to the U.S. with envy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/trump-tax-cuts-are-making-canadas-best-fund-managers-envious", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0316trump2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 16, 2018 3:57 PM EDT", "content": "A reinvigorated U.S. economy under Donald Trump is a better bet than Canada, where a ticking consumer-debt bomb and declining competitiveness are dragging on asset prices, according to top-performing money managers north of the border.President Trump\u2019s tax cuts and pro-business agenda have revved up growth, stocks and corporate confidence, the managers said in a panel discussion at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto offices on Wednesday. Contrast that with Canada, where minimum wage hikes and carbon levies are ratcheting up business costs as a housing boom pushes consumer credit to a near-record 170 percent of disposable income.\u201cIt\u2019s not just one thing in isolation, it\u2019s many things,\u201d said Toronto-based Noah Blackstein, whose $1.5 billion (US$1.2 billion) Dynamic Power Global Growth Class fund has outperformed 554 global peers over the past 10 years. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s of benefit to Canada.\u201dCanadian stocks have trailed the U.S. for at least a decade but that gap has only widened since Trump\u2019s election. The loonie is the worst-performing major currency against the U.S. dollar this year while Canadian bonds are outperforming on expectations of slower growth. Investors expect the Bank of Canada to lag the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates as it tries to avoid pushing consumers over the edge.Consumer leverage is making Peter Kotsopoulos think twice about investing in Canadian bank debt. Kotsopoulos, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Toronto-based MFS Investment Management Canada Ltd., prefers U.S. financials such Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. that issue loonie debt, or Maple bonds.\u201cThere is a little bit of an overhang in Canada\u2019s financial market which started to pop up a couple of years ago during the real-estate bubble,\u201d said Kotsopoulos, whose MFS Canadian Long Term Fixed Income Fund beat its domestic peers, returning 15 per cent over three years to 2017. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz will seek to weaken the currency further in order to support the country\u2019s exports, Kotsopoulos said.Further adding to the country\u2019s debt concerns, Canada\u2019s most populous province, Ontario, plans to return to deficit financing after balancing its books for only the first time in a decade in 2017-18. The plan has already prompted a warning from Fitch Ratings that it could pressure the province\u2019s ratings.Part of the under-performance of Canadian stocks can be explained by the lack of innovative companies in the country\u2019s main S&P/TSX Composite index, which is dominated by the energy sector, commodities companies and banks, the fund managers said.\u201cThe lack of tech and health care has held back Canada,\u201d said Conrad Dabiet, who manages the $3.4 billion Manulife Dividend Income Fund that beat its peers in the three years ending in 2017 with a cumulative 33 per cent return. \u201cWe need to make sure we can compete globally because a lot of these businesses are global in scale and if you miss out, you don\u2019t participate in that profit gain.\u201dWhile Canada has long heralded its corporate tax advantage over the U.S., that\u2019s also disappeared. Including state taxes, the U.S. rate has tumbled to about 26 from about 39 per cent before Trump\u2019s cuts, according to Jack Mintz, an economist at the University of Calgary and one of Canada\u2019s top tax experts. That compares with about 27 per cent in Canada, including provincial levels.To be sure, Canada\u2019s federal budget deficit at less than 1 per cent of gross domestic product is in much better shape than the U.S. where the tax cuts will push it toward 5 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2019, according National Bank of Canada.

Household borrowing is also seen as a risk factor for China and Hong Kong, according to the study.\u201cThe indicators currently point to the build-up of risks in several economies,\u201d analysts Inaki Aldasoro, Claudio Borio and Mathias Drehmann wrote in the BIS\u2019s latest Quarterly Review published on Sunday.The study offered some surprising results: for example, Italy wasn\u2019t shown as being at risk, despite its struggles with a slow-growing economy and banks that are mired in bad debts.While China was flagged, a key warning indicator known as the credit-to-gross domestic product \u201cgap\u201d showed an improvement, said the BIS, known as the central bank for central banks. This may suggest the government is making progress in its push to reduce financial-sector risk.The gap is the difference between the credit-to-GDP ratio and its long-term trend. A blow-out in the number can signal that credit growth is excessive and a financial bust may be looming. In China, the gap fell to 16.7 percent in the third quarter of 2017, down from a peak of 28.9 percent in March 2016 and the lowest since 2012, the study showed.The narrowing gap in China \u201csuggests the efficiency of financial intermediation is improving,\u201d said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong. \u201cThis helps to slow the pace of the rise of the debt-to-GDP ratio, creating conditions for an eventual deleveraging of the economy.\u201dChina is getting serious about dangers in its financial system. While derisking has been the government\u2019s mantra since 2015, the country\u2019s most powerful politicians have been ramping up directives on everything from shadow banking to stock-market speculation. Since April last year, financial regulators have targeted curbing the growth of wealth management products and interbank borrowings, with a more recent focus on reining in household debt.The Basel, Switzerland-based BIS routinely collects and analyzes data to monitor vulnerabilities in the global financial system. These figures typically include the amount of credit in an economy and house prices, as well as borrowers\u2019 ability to service their debts.For this study, the analysts assessed household borrowings and cross-border or foreign-currency liabilities as potential sources of vulnerability by back-testing them against earlier crises.

Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz held interest rates steady; Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u2019s budget added new spending; and Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa, having already balanced his budget, is plunging back into the red.The risk is the spending, instead of boosting growth, fuels inflation that could ultimately undermine Canada\u2019s economy \u2014 while leaving governments with debt-heavy balance sheets whenever a recession strikes.\u201cWe are choosing to put our strengthened fiscal position to work,\u201d Sousa said Wednesday in Toronto, announcing he\u2019d deliver a budget on March 28 with a deficit of less than 1 per cent of gross domestic product, which would mean less than $8 billion (US$6.2 billion). This year\u2019s budget is balanced, he said. \u201cI see challenges ahead.\u201dCanadian provincial and federal governments are projected to run a cumulative deficit of $31.9 billion in 2017-18, fiscal tables published by Royal Bank of Canada show. That\u2019s about 1.4 per cent of GDP. Ontario\u2019s new deficit would push the 2018-19 total to as much as US$37.3 billion, or about 1.6 per cent of GDP.The reasons are varied. Governments, for instance, have introduced new program spending aimed at reducing poverty and income inequality. The economy also faces a number of economic headwinds and risks \u2014 Donald Trump among them. Canada\u2019s economy remains vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs while talks continue on a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement. Business investment also may be faltering in an era of uncertainty.Politics is a factor. Ontario\u2019s next election is in June, and Sousa used his speech Wednesday to attack his party\u2019s top rival. Morneau\u2019s budget included repeated elements of political posturing ahead of a federal vote in 2019.The Bank of Canada, which has lifted borrowing costs three times since July, indicated on Wednesday it\u2019s in no rush to pursue further hikes in any aggressive way, citing the growing global trade tensions and softer housing data.While global growth is \u201csolid and broad-based,\u201d recent developments in trade policy have become \u201can important and growing source of uncertainty\u201d for the Canadian economic outlook, the central bank said.Morneau, meanwhile, has regularly called current interest rates \u201caccommodative\u201d and said Wednesday that\u2019s \u201cproviding opportunities for businesses, for individuals, to be able to borrow money at favourable rates.\u201d\u00a0By the central bank\u2019s own measure, interest rates are still extremely stimulative, about 2 percentage points below what it would consider \u201cneutral\u201d even with the economy operating at close to capacity.Morneau defended his fiscal plan that includes deficits that are 0.8 per cent of GDP. Business groups such as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Business Council of Canada have called on him to rein in the deficit.\u201cThe same people who say you need to lower taxes are the same people who say you need to balance the budget,\u201d he said, adding the U.S. deficit on a per-capita basis is five times the size of Canada\u2019s.Given all the trade developments, one could argue \u201crisks are tilted to the downside, and maybe running a little bit looser for longer isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing,\u201d said Jean-Francois Perrault, senior vice-president and chief economist at Scotiabank. \u201cBut we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said, given the economy is still forecast to grow above its potential.On Ontario\u2019s plan, Perrault said it will depend on how the deficits are used and could be seen as a positive if they go toward boosting business competitiveness.Ontario has already funneled a windfall from strong growth and its cap-and-trade program into higher spending, Bank of Montreal Senior Economist Robert Kavcic said in a research note. \u201cWe are late in the cycle \u2014 perhaps very late. Significant fiscal capacity to combat the next downturn is being foregone.\u201dIt\u2019s not all deficits in Canada.\u00a0Quebec has a balanced budget while British Columbia projects a narrow surplus.\u00a0Alberta\u2019s budget gap, the largest among the provinces, is expected to shrink in coming years. Even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s deficits are smaller than what were projected only a year ago as the economy performed better than expected.

Even then, he predicts one rate hike at most before the year is out. That would be a change of pace for a central bank that\u2019s tightened monetary policy at three of its past five meetings, spurred on by strong growth and a surge in employment.\u201cThe market is being too aggressive for what we\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d Basdeo said. \u201cThat market reaction is tied more toward what\u2019s likely to happen in the U.S. \u2014 that is, the fiscal impulse generates strong growth there and we benefit from that.\u201dA less hawkish BoC wouldn\u2019t bode well for a Canadian dollar that\u2019s already the worst performing Group-of-10 currency this year. The loonie fell to as low as $1.2916 per U.S. dollar Friday, the weakest since December.U.S. investors already wagering the Federal Reserve will increase rates three times this year are beginning to hedge against the likelihood of a fourth after new chairman Jerome Powell gave an upbeat assessment of the economy in front of Congress last week. While that\u2019s more aggressive than what\u2019s being priced for the BOC, traders remain hesitant to bet on too much policy divergence.Participants in the market for Canadian bankers\u2019 acceptance contracts expect officials to tighten policy by another 56 basis point by year-end, from 1.25 per cent. The odds of a hike at the BoC\u2019s April 18 meeting stand at about 38 per cent, according to overnight index swap pricing. That\u2019s down from about 70 per cent after a string of recent economic data misses and the release of a federal budget that kept the fiscal deficit steady.Pacific Investment Management Co.\u2019s Ed Devlin said he also expects the Bank of Canada to take a cautious approach to policy tightening. While it\u2019s possible officials hike twice more by year-end, the prevailing risk is for the BoC to be less aggressive than expected, not more, he said.Without the support of a hawkish BoC, the loonie will struggle to gain traction, he added.Ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations, which are scheduled to conclude their seventh round Monday in Mexico City, remain a likely source of volatility for the loonie over the medium-term. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of duties on steel and aluminum March 1 helped fuel the loonie\u2019s worst week in a year, and come on the heels of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s suggestion that Ottawa is willing to walk away from NAFTA.And while Canada\u2019s economy is coming off a stellar 2017, the country shed a net 88,000 jobs in January, its largest monthly decrease since 2009, while retail sales figures released last month showed receipts fell 0.8 per cent month-over-month in December. Friday\u2019s gross domestic product figures did little to ease concerns of a slowdown, with data showing the economy growing at an annualized pace of just 1.7 per cent in the fourth quarter amid signs indebted households have begun paring spending.\u201cWe\u2019ve come off all this strength in the data,\u201d Brittany Baumann, a macro strategist at Toronto Dominion Bank, said before the GDP figures were released. \u201cWe\u2019re now getting in this more moderation stage.\u201d Baumann expects the BOC to remain on hold for at least the next two policy meetings.The loonie\u2019s 2.6 per cent drop year-to-date is starting to leave its mark on the options market. Realized daily volatility has risen to the highest since September,\u00a0and is nearly a full per cent above its implied counterpart as traders become increasingly concerned about the currency\u2019s direction.In a sign that they\u2019re starting to price in BoC policy risk, currency puts traded this week expiring around the March 7 meeting outnumbered currency calls by about 50 per cent, according to Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation volumes. The one month 25-delta risk reversal, a barometer of sentiment and directional risk, is at its highest level since May as strikes above $1.30 begin to accumulate. A move above this level would likely see volatility rise further.\u201cIf the data is flagging a slowdown, then we should see a different tone from the Bank of Canada,\u201d BlackRock\u2019s Basdeo said. \u201cThat\u2019ll cause the repricing of fixed income assets.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Joe Deaux, Andrew Mayeda, Toluse Olorunnipa and Jeffrey Black", "title": "Trump invites \u2018easy to win\u2019 trade war as tariff anger spreads around world", "description": "Trump\u2019s aggressive stance has stoked fears of trade retaliation and roiled global markets.

We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice!The aggressive stance has stoked fears of trade retaliation and roiled global markets.

While the practical impact may yet turn out to be limited, the political environment for global trade has just taken a turn for the worse.Trade wars are never won. Trade wars are lost by both sidesEuropean equities followed Asian markets lower on Friday after losses in the U.S. the day before.

Separately, the yen spiked and Japanese assets slumped after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda discussed the timing of a possible exit from its stimulus policy in parliament.The official response in China, the world\u2019s largest steel producer, was muted. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying merely said in Beijing Friday that China urges the U.S. to follow trade rules.Industry insiders were less restrained. The U.S. measures \u201coverturn the international trade order,\u201d Wen Xianjun, vice chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, said in a statement. \u201cOther countries, including China, will take relevant retaliatory measures.\u201dLi Xinchuang, the vice chairman of China Iron and Steel Association, called the move \u201cstupid.\u201dU.S. allies, seeing their industries threatened, responded with bafflement and dismay.

Australian Trade Minister Steve Ciobo called the move \u201cdisappointing\u201d and said his country is seeking an exemption.The punitive measures would level the unfair playing field that has persisted for years, and make it easier for American companies to expand and hire workers, Trump said.U.S. companies from beer brewer MillerCoors to candymaker Hershey Co., which use aluminum for manufacturing and packaging, said operations would be hurt by the tariffs.\u201cWe buy as much domestic can sheet aluminum as is available, however, there simply isn\u2019t enough supply to satisfy the demands of American beverage makers like us,\u201d MillerCoors said in a tweet. \u201cAmerican workers and American consumers will suffer as a result of this misguided tariff.\u201dA U.S. move on tariffs risks provoking retaliation, particularly from Beijing. China has already launched a probe into U.S. imports of sorghum, and is studying whether to restrict shipments of U.S. soybeans \u2014 targets that could hurt Trump\u2019s support in some farming states.

Morneau has signed he\u2019ll keep to a plan of slow deficit reduction while lowering the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product.The plan comes amid calls\u00a0to cut corporate taxes as businesses worry about the risks posed by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s policies, at a time when the country\u2019s growth is slowing, pinched by the uncertainty associated with ongoing NAFTA talks and a wider discount for Alberta oil. Canada is losing a competitive edge, partly due to U.S. tax reform and the threat Trump could withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement,\u00a0business groups warn. Morneau is under pressure to act, but all signs are that he\u2019ll wait.\u201cFrom a macroeconomic perspective, I don\u2019t expect a whole lot,\u201d said Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto and a former top finance department official. He called on Morneau to keep his \u201cpowder dry\u201d to preserve leeway to respond to crises down the road, and to use this budget to signal \u201che\u2019s watching the situation carefully and is ready to respond if he needs to.\u201dThe most recent federal figures, released last fall, projected $86.5 billion (US$68 billion) in deficits over five years, beginning with the fiscal year that ends March 31, through 2021-22. Morneau projected the debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to 29.1 per cent from 30.5 per cent over that period.However, there are signs Morneau has less wiggle room than before. While his deficit is modest by international standards, it\u2019s seen as a political liability at home. His government has already hiked its forecast program expenses for the next three fiscal years.Next year\u2019s budget is more politically significant, with an election due that fall. Trudeau will also create a commission to study options for the creation of a national plan to cover pharmaceutical costs, according to reports by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., a potentially big-ticket item that would further strain federal spending.Meanwhile, rising interest rates and mounting debt have ended a run of windfalls from declining debt service costs, that Morneau and his predecessors have used to cut taxes and boost spending.Morneau is delivering his budget with the latest round of NAFTA talks underway in Mexico City. There have been widespread calls from the private sector for Canada to move to increase business competitiveness.\u201cI would like to see the competitiveness of Canada remain at the forefront,\u201d Royal Bank of Canada Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cI don\u2019t think tax reform is going to be in there,\u201d he said, adding the federal government should focus on creating a strong economy.The Business Council of Canada, representing chief executives of many of the country\u2019s biggest firms, warned \u201cCanada must respond now\u201d by, for example, cutting business taxes, allowing business investments to be more easily written off or punting planned changes to taxation of investments held in private corporations.The Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters industry group also called for a tax cut and a business investment tax credit. \u201cSimilar to the U.S., we believe that Canada and its provinces should be looking at a range of tax reforms to boost investment and growth,\u201d Dennis Darby, CME president and chief executive officer, said in a letter on behalf of several manufacturing groups.Tom Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Financial Ltd. and CEO of Urbana Corp., said he\u2019d rather see Morneau balance the budget than cut taxes to compete with the U.S. \u201cLess is more,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as governments go my expectations are always fairly low and I\u2019m rarely disappointed.\u201d Morneau said this month he\u2019d \u201ccarefully consider\u201d U.S. tax changes, while saying he thinks Canada\u2019s tax system is already competitive.The budget will be a key mile-marker for one of the Trudeau government\u2019s hallmark pledges to hike infrastructure spending in a bid to stoke growth, something Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said the economy can look forward to.In late 2016, Morneau announced $81 billion in new infrastructure funding, bringing the federal government total to $186.7 billion over 12 years, roughly doubling its spending rate on projects such as roads and transit. There are some signs the government is struggling to get all the money out the door, forcing it to be potentially bumped \u2014 or \u201creprofiled,\u201d in government slang \u2014 into different years.\u201cOttawa clearly has a kind of structural surplus of infrastructure dollars that will continue to go perpetually unspent,\u201d said Sean Speer, a senior fellow for fiscal policy at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and former economic adviser to Trudeau\u2019s predecessor, Stephen Harper. \u201cI honestly do think they\u2019re in a world of perpetual reprofile.\u201dA Morneau spokeswoman declined to comment on infrastructure spending. Brook Simpson, a spokesman for Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi, said federal money \u201cis a lagging indicator to project activity,\u201d as money is often only released after a project is done.\u00a0Any money that doesn\u2019t flow is reprofiled to another year and still available, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Allison McNeely and Kevin Orland", "title": "'I'm not crazy about Canada': Investors bail on trapped oil as pipeline problems worsen", "description": "With pipeline, regulatory and political frustrations reaching new heights, energy stocks have slumped to their lowest level in almost two years", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/investors-bail-on-landlocked-canada-oil-as-pipeline-woes-deepen", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/0222pumpjacks.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 22, 2018 10:08 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s energy companies can\u2019t get any love, even from many Canadians.With pipeline, regulatory and political frustrations reaching new heights, energy stocks slumped to their lowest level in almost two years this month.

On top of that, the industry is facing carbon taxes other jurisdictions don\u2019t have to pay and it\u2019s competing with American drillers which are seeing taxes cut under the Trump Administration.\u201cI\u2019m not crazy about Canada,\u201d Paul Tepsich, founder and portfolio manager at hedge fund High Rock Capital Management Inc. in Toronto, said by phone. \u201cWe\u2019ve got taxes going up and regulations going up.\u201dTepsich said he reduced the average exposure to Canadian energy equities in his clients\u2019 to well under 3 per cent from 8 per cent a year ago. And while credit exposure remains relatively steady, he has no plans to add new holdings. He\u2019s been adding to short-dated U.S. Treasuries amid market volatility and will look to selectively add U.S. energy names.The big albatross for Canadian energy companies has been weak prices, caused by the pipeline pinch. Western Canadian Select, the main grade of oil extracted by Canadian oilsands producers, is trading near the widest discount to West Texas Intermediate crude in almost four years. Alberta Energy Co. natural gas prices are also lagging their U.S. equivalent. WCS discounts would cost the Canadian economy about $15.6 billion a year, or 0.75 per cent of GDP, if maintained at current levels, Scotiabank Chief Economist Jean-Francois Perrault said in a note.The pipeline frustrations recently erupted into a trade war between oil-producing Alberta and neighbouring British Columbia after the coastal province proposed limiting new shipments of oilsands crude through its borders, possibly stalling a major expansion of the Kinder Morgan Inc. oil pipeline. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley banned imports of B.C. wine and abandoned talks to possibly buy more electricity from its neighbor.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government also announced earlier this month a plan to revamp the national energy regulator with a goal of giving the industry a speedier, more efficient approval process. But the plan also may include adding new types of projects that require federal approval and allows more input for some stakeholder groups, sparking industry fears it won\u2019t become any easier.The proposed legislation appears to effectively prevent any major new project from reaching any form of positive recommendation, the research team at GMP FirstEnergy, a major investment bank to the energy sector, said in a note. \u201cA lack of hard timelines and a regulatory process that has been subject to dithering and near endless legal challenges will become the major stumbling block for domestic and international investor confidence in the Canadian energy sector.\u201dFederal Resources Minister Jim Carr said earlier this month the Liberal government has balanced government support for the energy industry with protecting the environment and receiving input from Canadians, noting $500 billion in projects are planned over the next decade.Banker and bondholder willingness to refinance debt and give companies time to boost output helped keep many struggling producers out of bankruptcy as oil prices slumped in recent years. Investor flight means it will be tougher for Canadian energy companies to access financing for capital-intensive projects. Suncor Energy Inc.\u2019s US$14 billion Fort Hills project, approved when WTI was US$100 a barrel but started production last month, may be the last of a generation of mega Canadian oilsands projects.\u201cI\u2019m inclined to believe that we don\u2019t see another oilsands project built,\u201d Geof Marshall, the guardian of US$40 billion of assets at CI Investments\u2019 Signature Global Asset Management in Toronto, said by phone. The majority of his energy holdings are concentrated in U.S. regions like the Permian Basin, where there\u2019s more capacity to move the commodity, he said.Rafi Tahmazian, who helps manage about $1 billion in energy investments at Canoe Financial in Calgary, said he began trimming holdings of Canadian energy equities after Justin Trudeau was elected in 2015. He started shifting further into the U.S. after Donald Trump became president and vowed to trim regulations and environmental protection.Canada needs to cut taxes and ensure pipelines and LNG terminals get built, Tahmazian said.\u00a0\u201cMy job as an investor is to gauge and make investments based on my confidence in a leader of a company and a country, or a province or a state,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I have zero confidence there right now.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis and Josh Wingrove", "title": "Finance Minister Bill Morneau has little room for new budget spending", "description": "Expectations are for flat revenue and slowing growth", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trudeaus-finance-chief-has-little-room-for-new-budget-measures", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/bill-morneau.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 16, 2018 1:10 PM EST", "content": "Finance Minister Bill Morneau is being told there is little additional fiscal space for new measures as he meets private-sector economists Friday to discuss the state of the Canadian economy ahead of the Feb. 27 budget.The finance department\u2019s latest survey of economists shows projections for national income \u2014 the best indicator for revenue \u2014that are almost exactly what they were in Morneau\u2019s last fiscal update in October. Overall, they are anticipating growth to slow down to the historically sluggish levels the economy has averaged in the post-recession era, after an unexpected pick up in 2017.That effectively gives Morneau no room to ramp up spending without running higher deficits or raising tax levels, and likely means any new initiatives will probably need to be financed by reallocating spending within the existing framework or possibly tapping into existing buffers built into the fiscal plan.Speaking after announcing the date earlier this week, Morneau said the budget would \u201ccontinue to ensure that middle class Canadians are doing well\u201d and include investments in research, science and skills training for what he called the \u201ceconomy of tomorrow.\u201dStill, the Feb. 27 plan is likely only a placeholder for a more ambitious pre-election budget that should arrive at about this time next year. The constrained fiscal framework could pose a serious dilemma for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government, which says it remains committed to at least reducing the nation\u2019s debt as a share of gross domestic product.\u201cWe want to continue to show Canadians that we can make those investments while reducing the amount of debt as a function of our economy,\u201d Morneau told reporters Tuesday outside the legislature in Ottawa. \u201cThat will continue to be our anchor.\u201dToday\u2019s steady economic picture contrasts with a fiscal update in October when the government reported an unexpected windfall in revenue due to a stronger-than-expected economy. It used it to scale back deficit projections and finance new spending.In October, the Liberal government cut its deficit projection for the fiscal year that ends March 31 to $19.9 billion, down from $28.5 billion in the March budget. It also projected a cumulative deficit over the coming five fiscal years of $86.5 billion, compared with $120 billion previously.While the department doesn\u2019t typically release the results of its survey of private sector economists, Bloomberg gathered forecasts independently from Canada\u2019s six biggest banks. Here are some of the results:Economists are projecting nominal gross domestic product will average about $2.23 trillion between 2017 and 2019, almost exactly the same forecast as in October. Nominal GDP growth is forecast at 5.2 per cent in 2017, 4.1 per cent in 2018 and 3.6 per cent in 2019. Growth has averaged 3.8 per cent since 2010, well below the 7.4 per cent average over the past five decades. Unless the government changes its estimate for revenue as a share of nominal GDP \u2014 which was 14.5 per cent in October \u2014 that means the revenue picture will probably be little changed through 2019.The finance department holds as many as four economist surveys a year that in turn form the basis of its own forecasts.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shobhana Chandra, Catarina Saraiva and Rich Miller", "title": "Fed seen stepping up pace of rate hikes, Bloomberg survey shows", "description": "Fed officials penciled in three rate hikes for this year, but as economists get more upbeat about growth some of them see four", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-seen-stepping-up-pace-of-rate-hikes-bloomberg-survey-shows", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/afp_yu3v5a.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 15, 2018 3:19 PM EST", "content": "A growing number of economists expect the Federal Reserve to step up the pace of its interest-rate increases this year after congressional passage of a US$300 billion government spending package that is seen lifting U.S. economic growth and inflation.Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc., and Greg Daco, Oxford Economics\u2019 chief U.S. economist, were among those who now see four Fed rate hikes in 2018 instead of three, according to a Bloomberg survey of 29 respondents conducted Feb. 12-14. That brought the survey\u2019s median estimate for the upper bound of the central bank\u2019s federal funds rate target to 2.5 per cent by year-end. It is currently at 1.5 per cent.\u00a0\u201cStronger growth and higher inflation would increase the odds of four Fed rate hikes in 2018,\u201d Daco said in his survey comments. He added that the recent market strains won\u2019t prevent a rate increase at the central bank\u2019s next policy-making meeting on March 20-21.In their last quarterly projection in December, Fed officials penciled in three rate hikes for this year, according to the median forecast in their so-called dot plot. They tacitly reiterated that view at their Jan. 30-31 meeting, when they said they expected \u201cfurther gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\u201dEconomists are getting more upbeat about economic growth this year and next, according to the survey. They see gross domestic product expanding 2.9 per cent in 2018 and 2.5 per cent next year. GDP has averaged a 2.2 per cent advance since the expansion began in mid-2009.Inflation forecasts also edged up in the poll. Economists expect a price gauge tied to consumer spending and closely watched by the Fed to rise\u00a02 per cent in 2018 from a year earlier. That would meet the central bank\u2019s goal. The year-over-year gain in the personal consumption expenditures price index was 1.7 per cent in December, the latest available data shows.The US$300 billion package passed last week comes on top of a US$1.5 trillion, 10-year tax cut that President Donald Trump signed into law in December. Trump this week also called for increased spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects.\u201cToo much of a good thing is too much,\u201d Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc., said in his survey response. \u201cThe tax cuts, spending increases and potentially infrastructure package are likely to accelerate inflation and cause the Fed to raise rates higher and faster than expected.\u201d Bloomberg"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "President Trump's first year, in 14 metrics: Bloomberg View", "description": "The trade deficit rose, manufacturing job numbers are up and surveys by private companies show modest income gains for American households in early 2017", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/president-trumps-first-year-in-14-metrics-view-columnists", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/trump-1a.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 22, 2018 4:23 PM EST", "content": "We love data here at Bloomberg View, and think facts should support opinions instead of the other way around. Now we know that\u2019s an old-fashioned idea, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s been put to the test in the 12 months since President Donald Trump moved into the Oval Office. But we\u2019re not giving up!Last year our columnists selected a range of conventional and whimsical metrics by which to judge the success of the new president. We revisit them here. Bottom line: By these measures, he\u2019s doing better than his opponents will admit\u00a0and worse than his supporters believe.Like any president, Trump is taking credit for good economic news. He\u2019s highlighted rising stocks and falling unemployment. But Trump also, famously, regards trade deficits as a sign of economic weakness. And for people who worry about the fact that the U.S. buys more stuff from other countries than it sells them, the news has not been so good. The latest release from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis notes that the trade deficit was 12 per cent higher from January to October 2017 than during the same period of 2016. The trade deficit with China, a particular concern of Trump, is up even more.\u00a0The administration could respond to these numbers by increasing its focus on imposing and threatening tariffs. Or it could ignore them. Or, finally and least likely, Trump could decide that since trade deficits are compatible with economic growth, maybe he should stop caring so much about them.\u00a0Ramesh PonnuruA surprising amount of Americans Googled\u00a0\u201cmove to Canada\u201d in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s victory. His inauguration inspired\u00a0a\u00a0lesser rush of queries. But interest in self-exiling has flatlined ever since. Could it be that everyone who was threatening to flee has already left? Probably not. During the past year, users who searched for \u201cmove to Canada\u201d became intensely interested in a completely different topic: \u201cHow to impeach a president.\u201d So it looks like our prospective American-Canadian expats have switched gears to a slightly less dramatic plan. And\u00a0probably just as unlikely. Elaine OuThis measure, which tracks the relationship of deficits and growth, had a bigger annual improvement under former president Barack Obama than under any president since 1980, though only former president Bill Clinton saw perennial deficits transformed into annual surpluses. Under Trump, the trend is reversing. The deficit-to-GDP ratio widened to 3.4 per cent from 3 per cent since Trump became president amid lower-than-forecast tax receipts, less-than-robust wage gains and an aging workforce. The most extensive rewrite of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years by the Republican Congress and signed by Trump in 2017 will cost US$1 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Trump says that the tax cuts will eventually narrow the deficit by taking GDP growth to an unprecedented 4 per cent annual rate in the 21st century. No studies exist that show such a leap is possible. Matthew WinklerThe four Rust Belt states that gave Trump his unexpected 2016 victory have done reasonably well in the last year, showing cyclical strength but no real change in their unfortunate structural story. The unemployment rates in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin have all fallen. Yet the combined labor-force growth in those states has been a meager 0.4 per cent, suggesting that the jobs picture hasn\u2019t improved enough to change the narrative of long-term demographic decline.That kind of change will require more than presidential tweets and a corporate tax cut. Cyclical economic strength is nice and beats the alternative, but there\u2019s still no reason to believe that the Rust Belt will prosper in 2025, any more than it did in 2015. Conor SenTo the delight of supporters and the fury of opponents, Trump has followed through on his pledges to loosen regulations. \u201cThe administration has instilled a faith in business executives that new regulations are not coming,\u201d Binyamin Appelbaum and Jim Tankersley wrote recently in the New York Times.The most meaningful measures of increasing regulatory burdens come from the QuantGov project, which tracks words like \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d that create legal obligations in government manuals rather than merely counting pages. Its data show a significant slowdown in the growth of federal rules, although not an outright reversal. From Trump\u2019s inauguration through Jan. 16, 2018, restrictions grew by about 0.6 per cent, compared to 1.6 per cent in 2016.That doesn\u2019t make Trump the deregulatory champ, however, and in fact puts him slightly behind Obama\u2019s penultimate year. In 2015, restrictions grew by only 0.5 per cent. Since 1970, the number of restrictions has dropped in only three years: 1983 (-2.19 per cent), 1985 (-2.55 per cent), and 1996 (-3.16). Trump has a long way to go if he wants to beat Clinton\u2019s best year. Virginia PostrelFactory jobs have been an obsession for Trump. And after going flat for most of 2015 and 2016, their numbers have been on the increase since last January. The gains aren\u2019t much in the grand scheme of things \u2014 an estimated 196,000 manufacturing jobs added in 2017, compared with 4.7 million lost since the beginning of 2000 \u2014 and the biggest cause is probably the decline in the value of the dollar that began in December 2016. But tax cuts and the absence of new regulations have helped put U.S. businesses in a hopeful mood, and more manufacturing job gains seem likely. Justin FoxOfficial government numbers aren\u2019t out yet, but surveys by private companies show modest income gains for American households in early 2017.\u00a0It\u2019s way too soon to say whether Trump had anything to do with it; the trend just continues a recovery in real median household income that has been in place since 2014. Thanks to that recovery, income is now slightly higher than it was before the financial crisis. The continued slow expansion shows that Trump didn\u2019t immediately damage the economy when he took office. But the effects of recently passed tax and health-care legislation won\u2019t be known for a while. Noah SmithTrump promised to get U.S. corporations to bring back their foreign cash piles, which Moody\u2019s estimated at US$1.2 trillion at the end of 2016. Cash held by the foreign subsidiaries of U.S. multinationals \u2014 for the most part, tech and pharma ones \u2014 increased to about US$1.4 trillion by the end of 2017. But that doesn\u2019t mean Trump failed.The tax overhaul he signed in December imposes a 15.5 per cent tax on accumulated foreign profits, which is\u00a0expected\u00a0to bring in almost US$339 billion in tax revenue between 2018 and 2027. Apple is about to pay US$38 billion of that this year \u2014 and to invest billions more in the U.S. \u2014 now that its tax future is clearing up. Other companies, too, will probably invest some of their foreign cash in the U.S.Granted, they\u2019ll keep booking their non-U.S. sales in lower-tax jurisdictions like Ireland.\u00a0But Trump has probably done as much as he could to keep this particular promise. Leonid BershidskyOf the 33,425 civilians killed in 2017 in the Syrian war, 2,109 were children. This is according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Last year that was the metric I thought was worth watching. Despite the military defeat of the Islamic State, the resurrection of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime and an uneasy cease-fire negotiated by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the number of children killed in the Syrian war is not much smaller than it was in 2016. That year 2,372 children lost their lives in the conflict, out of 49,742 civilians who perished. Eli LakeCombining stock market performance and approval ratings provides\u00a0useful (and different) information about presidential performance.\u00a0The market boom under Trump is not the largest rally in history, but it\u2019s big. We don\u2019t know to what extent Trump\u2019s policies are responsible for the rise, but he didn\u2019t hurt and he probably helped.\u00a0At the same time, his approval ratings are under 40 per cent. In modern history, no president has entered his second year with such low numbers. We don\u2019t have to accept claims about the wisdom of crowds to agree that when a president has such low approval ratings, he\u2019s probably not doing a great job. On the stock market metric, Trump gets an A. On public approval, he gets a D.\u00a0Cass R. SunsteinA year ago, I wondered what Trump\u2019s disruptive influence would mean for the Washington real estate market. On the one hand, he was bringing in a lot of outsiders \u2014 many wealthy \u2014 who would need to find homes. On the other hand, the liberal affluent class might decide to look for another city to gentrify.What have we learned? In some ways, what we expected: Luxury housing did\u00a0very well\u00a0at the start of the year, while overall home prices rose by a piddly 1.6\u00a0per cent\u00a0\u2014 a big change for Washingtonians, who have seen the median value of homes for sale climb from US$390,000 in December of 2007 to US$535,000 at the end of 2016.The Republican tax bill Trump signed represents another rush of bad news for Washington homeowners. The District of Columbia is a high-tax jurisdiction, with a top income tax rate of 8.95 per cent. Its property taxes are on the low side, but the high value of property has more than made up for that, and homeowners can now deduct only US$10,000 in combined local and property taxes. So homeowners will now have to pay a very hefty premium for the privilege of living within the district.Many of us may have suspected that Trump would be bad for the value of our homes. But few of us could have suspected that the threat would come in the form of \u2026 higher taxes. We\u2019ll just have to sit tight and see if the next year brings further Trump-induced revisions to our bottom lines. Megan McArdleThe Stephen Bannon Index, measuring the media mentions of the Trump adviser as a proxy for bad news for Trump, ought to be obsolete. After all, Trump\u2019s scruffy Svengali was given the boot in August. Besides, lots of stories with words like \u201cMueller\u201d and \u201cRussia\u201d and \u201cguilty plea\u201d don\u2019t mention Bannon at all.Yet the Bannon Index was a reliable guide to a certain kind of bad news nonetheless. It had two big peaks and two small ones last year before exploding this January with the revelation that Bannon had deemed \u201ctreasonous\u201d Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s meeting with Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton.\u00a0There was a small peak at the dysfunctional start of Trump\u2019s administration, which included a few expressions of horror in the media that Bannon had been given a spot (later rescinded) on the National Security Council. There was a big peak in April, when White House leaks about internecine warfare between Bannon and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner kept reporters busy, along with a classic Trump dodge about how he really didn\u2019t know that Bannon fellow all that well. There was another peak when Bannon was fired in August, followed by a small peak when Bannon\u2019s preferred Senate candidate \u2014 the word \u201ccontroversial\u201d is too mousy to do him justice \u2014 managed to lose to a Democrat in Alabama, one of the nation\u2019s most conservative states.We don\u2019t know what 2018 will bring, but the Index doesn\u2019t lie. Bannon news is bad news for Trump.\u00a0Francis WilkinsonThe economy is doing well, with unemployment low and the stock market surging. Islamic State has been uprooted from its strongholds in Syria and Iraq. North Korea even stopped firing off ballistic missiles for a while and launched a charm offensive instead.In normal times, these positive trends would show up as positive responses to the standard poll question, \u201cIs the nation headed in the right direction or off on the wrong track?\u201d But there\u2019s nothing normal about the Trump presidency and Americans aren\u2019t happy about how their country is doing. In the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released on Friday, the public chose \u201cwrong track\u201d by a margin of 60 per cent to 34 per cent.That pessimism has deepened since Trump\u2019s inauguration, when the same polling group found that 52 per cent of Americans thought the U.S. was on the wrong track compared to 36 per cent who thought it was headed in the right direction.\u00a0 Albert R. HuntTrump is famously erratic, but the smart money at Ladbrokes finds the U.S. president remarkably consistent. When we checked in with Ladbrokes the week of Trump\u2019s inauguration, it was offering inauspicious odds on the reality television star. Even before Trump put his hand on a Bible, the betting class pegged his chances of avoiding resignation or impeachment during his first term at no better than 50-50.It turns out Trump is a stable bet. A year later, after tax cuts, indictments and those dismal poll numbers, not much has budged. The odds of Trump making a suspiciously early presidential departure are still about even.

While it doesn\u2019t forecast prices and doesn\u2019t yet look as far ahead as 2019, it sees global demand exceeding 100 million barrels a day for the first time in the fourth quarter of this year.Oil\u2019s slump is over \u2014 hail the return of triple-digit crude! Well, maybe, briefly.OPEC ministers and friends meeting in Doha today to assess their output deal would be wise not to get too carried away.The IEA, as I noted last week, is much less bullish about demand growth in the coming months than other pundits. For some, this raises the risk that the world\u2019s most-watched forecast significantly underestimates oil use and, as a result, the speed of oil market rebalancing and the upward pressure on prices.Broad-based economic recovery is setting the world up for demand growth of 1.7 million barrels a day in 2018, and there\u2019s a chance that it could be as high as 2 million barrels, according to Energy Aspects. Certainly there\u2019s a lot of expansion about \u2014 the World Bank has raised its global GDP growth forecast for this year to 3.1 per cent from the 2.9 per cent it projected in June. With strong economic momentum in almost every country and region, there is \u201cno real drag on oil demand growth,\u201d Energy Aspects said Jan. 15.But there could be one in the works. Rising prices can have a chilling effect on demand growth, and benchmark crude prices have risen more than 55 per cent since their rally started in June. End-user retail prices are feeling this.U.S. gasoline and diesel are both the most expensive they have been at this time of year since 2014 and, in contrast to the normal seasonal pattern, pump prices are already rising. The same is true in Europe.Strong demand growth in the developed countries of North America and Europe in the first half of 2017 was \u201clargely attributable to lower prices,\u201d the IEA says. Drivers are unlikely to benefit from similar price moves this year.What happens to car owners in rich nations isn\u2019t the only source of strain on demand. Many developing countries took the opportunity of the sharp fall in prices to reduce subsidies on oil products, which could amplify the impact of higher crude on what end users pay.And some less-developed countries are shifting to natural gas from oil. The IEA sees 540,000 barrels a day of demand for gasoil, fuel oil and crude displaced by gas in five non-OECD countries since 2014. Saudi Arabia has also cut its direct crude use for power generation by around 100,000 barrels a day in the past two years. The displacement theme will continue this year.The draw on global stockpiles should resume in the second quarter, even amid rising OPEC output, according to Energy Aspects.The IEA also sees a big rise in oil production this year, including \u201cexplosive growth\u201d in the U.S. With the pickup in non-OPEC supply exceeding the increase in demand, it sees the world\u2019s need for OPEC production falling by around 600,000 barrels a day compared with last year, to a level below last month\u2019s output. The implication of that for prices is clear \u2014 if the IEA is right, the possibility that oil reaches US$100 a barrel is remote.Higher prices may yet clip the wings of the oil demand growth that OPEC and friends need.

Futures on the S&P 500 Index dipped just 0.1 per cent as of 12:19 p.m. in Tokyo Monday, and benchmark 10-year Treasuries were little changed, after the Senate departed without a deal. U.S. stocks jumped to a record close Friday even as the impasse deepened in Washington.\u201cI\u2019m not overly worried,\u201d Jurrien Timmer, head of global macro at Fidelity Investments, said in a phone interview Wednesday. \u201cThe government would have to be shut down days and weeks on end for GDP to be affected, or earnings to be affected.\u201dBarclays Plc estimates that the shutdown will shave 0.1 percentage point off gross domestic product in the quarter \u2014 not much in an economy forecast to rise by 2.8 per cent, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Unless the stalemate lingers, the impact may have a hard time rattling markets that have been focused on benefits from the recently passed tax overhaul, improving corporate profitability and synchronized global economic growth.\u201cMany of the employees in the nonessential departments are put on furlough and then paid retroactively,\u201d notes Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research. \u201cIn 2013, we saw a 16 day shutdown and fourth-quarter GDP was 4 per cent. Whatever hit there is, gets made up quickly thereafter.\u201dThat calm prevailed as the shutdown certainly shows how desensitized investors have become to political wrangling. And why not? In 18 shutdowns over the past 42 years, the median return of the S&P 500 has been 0 per cent, according to LPL Financial Research.\u201cAlthough a government shutdown sounds scary, the reality is it has been a non-event historically for equities,\u201d LPL\u2019s Ryan Detrick wrote in a note to investors last year.In the most recent example, in October 2013, the S&P 500 slumped 2 per cent in the immediate aftermath before reversing to rise 1.8 per cent by the time a stop-gap bill was signed. Bonds likewise shrugged off the issue, with 10-year yields adding just five basis points during that span.The shutdown comes with equity markets surging around the world. The S&P 500 just capped its third straight weekly advance, to post the best start since 1987. Earnings optimism fueled partly by President Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul has led to one of the biggest upward revisions to profit forecasts on record.Global stock funds have taken in US$58 billion over the last four weeks, the most ever recorded, according to Bank of America Corp. research based on EPFR data. That includes US$23.9 billion last week, with the largest share going to to U.S. funds.\u201cIn the past if we\u2019ve had a two or three-day shutdown, it hasn\u2019t meant anything,\u201d Scot Lance, managing director at California-based Titus Wealth Management, said by phone Saturday. \u201cIf there\u2019s a dip, buy it.\u201dGoldman Sachs Group Inc., however, cautions that any short-term deal to end the current shutdown could rebound to cause pain next month. By then, the list of items to bicker over will have snowballed to include the budget for the rest of the year, a suspension of the debt limit and a deal on immigration paired with funding for border enforcement.\u201cThe risks to the economy and financial markets are somewhat higher in February than they are this month, due to the upcoming debt limit deadline,\u201d wrote economist Alec Phillips. \u201cMarkets have tended to shrug off shutdowns as long as the debt limit is not involved.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Canadians\u2019 unprecedented debt leads Macquarie to warn on rate hikes", "description": "Macquarie says the BoC rate-hiking cycle is already the most severe in 20 years and further increases will have far graver consequences than conventional analysis shows", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadians-unprecedented-debt-levels-prompts-macquarie-to-warn-on-rate-hikes?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/0118boc.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 18, 2018 3:04 PM EST", "content": "The unprecedented rise in consumer debt means the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate-hiking cycle is already the most severe in 20 years and further increases will have far graver consequences than conventional analysis shows, Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. said.Assuming just one further rate rise, the impact would be 65 per cent to 80 per cent as severe as the 1987 to 1990 cycle, according to Macquarie,\u00a0which took into account five-year bond yields, household debt and home buying. Canada\u2019s housing market slumped in the early 1990s after that rate-hike cycle and a recession.\u201cThe Canadian economy has experienced an unprecedented period of hyper-leveraging,\u201d analysts including David Doyle wrote in the note released Thursday. According to Macquarie, this is underlined by the fact that:About 30 per cent of nominal GDP growth has come from residential investment and auto sales over the past three years. This is about 50 per cent greater than what has been experienced in similar prior periods. The wealth effect from rising home prices has driven nearly 40 per cent of nominal growth in gross domestic product over the past three years, about two to four times the amount experienced previously when the BoC was hiking rates. Even as this has occurred, fixed business investment and exports have struggled, limiting the ability for a virtuous domestic growth cycle to unfold. This again is in sharp contrast to similar periods in the past when these were accelerating.New mortgage stress-test rules will also have a larger impact than estimated, Macquarie said. The new rules in isolation are expected to reduce buyers\u2019 maximum purchasing power by as much as 17 per cent. That jumps to about 23 per cent after incorporating the rise in mortgage rates since mid-2017, according to the note.Governor Stephen Poloz has indicated high household debt could make the slowing impact of rate hikes harsher, and that the impact of 2017\u2019s increases will not be fully clear for 18 months, Doyle said.\u201cWhen taken together, these observations mean the Bank of Canada is proceeding with hikes despite uncertainty surrounding the severity of tightening performed so far,\u201d Macquarie writes. \u201cThis elevates the risk of policy error.\u201dMacquarie expects only one more rate hike in either April or July.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Canadian stocks destined for another lacklustre year with only meagre gains expected in 2018", "description": "Canada's equity benchmark will rise about 4.4 per cent in 2018, a return that would lag last year's 6 per cent gain that trailed most global indexes, strategists say", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canada-stocks-set-for-meager-gains-in-2018-strategists-say", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/0102tsx.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 2, 2018 8:54 AM EST", "content": "Investors counting on a rebound in Canadian stocks following a lacklustre 2017 are likely to be disappointed.Canada\u2019s equity benchmark will rise about 4.4 per cent in 2018, a return that would lag last year\u2019s 6 per cent gain that trailed most global indexes, strategists say.The S&P/TSX Composite Index will end the year at 16,928, compared with 2017\u2019s closing mark of 16,209, according to the average of nine estimates compiled by Bloomberg. This compares with an average year-end forecast of 2,875 for the S&P 500 Index in the U.S, a projected gain of 7.5 per cent.\u201cA lot of people who are bullish are looking at valuations and thinking Canada\u2019s got to play catch-up,\u201d said Sadiq Adatia, who oversees about $20 billion (US$15.6 billion) as the chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments. \u201cI don\u2019t buy into that story.\u201dSun Life has the most bearish forecast, calling for the benchmark to end the year at 15,200, a decline of 6.2 per cent.Adatia sees four key risks facing Canadian stocks this year: high consumer debt levels, falling home prices, a potential slowdown in wage and job growth and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He believes consumer discretionary stocks are most at risk, while utilities and telecoms will be the safest investments.Unlike other forecasters, Adatia isn\u2019t bullish on the outlook for the energy patch, which he believes won\u2019t start to rebound until West Texas Intermediate prices rise above US$60. Adatia\u2019s forecast calls for crude prices as low as US$50 in 2018, from about US$60 now.Luc Vallee, chief strategist at Laurentian Bank Securities, begs to differ. Vallee sees the Canadian benchmark hitting 18,000 by the end of the year, a target that makes him the most bullish forecaster with an implied return of 11 percent. Vallee was about 300 points off on his 2017 year-end forecast of 16,500.Vallee believes WTI prices will rise to the high US$60s in 2018, allowing Canadian energy companies to \u201ccry for joy,\u201d he said. On top of that, he sees an end to the glut that held down Canadian crude prices this year as pipeline building revs up.\u201cGiven the weight of the energy sector in the TSX, it\u2019s going to explode,\u201d he said. The energy index accounts for about 20 per cent of the benchmark.Craig Fehr, Canadian investment strategist at Edward Jones & Co., is in the middle of the pack with a forecast of 17,050. He sees energy stocks getting a lift from a rebound in the oil patch, while consumer discretionary and financials will face headwinds.\u201cThat\u2019s based on my view that I think economic growth is going to slow quite materially in 2018,\u201d Fehr said.

While the jump was due to a surge in gasoline prices, the increases went beyond energy. A separate report showed retail sales surging in October, adding to evidence the expansion continues to steam ahead.The data, which beat expectations, added almost 0.78 US cents to the Canadian dollar, as market odds of a rate hike in January jumped to almost 50:50. By early afternoon the loonie was up 0.69 at 78.63 US cents.\u201cThese reports do increase the odds of more aggressive tightening from the Bank of Canada in 2018,\u201d said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.Bets in the markets of an increase in January rose to 52.8 per cent from 37.9 per cent ahead of the data, while a March hike was nearly fully priced in.If the inflation proves sustained, it will pose a challenge for the Bank of Canada. Policy makers have been keen to keep the expansion moving with low interest rates on the expectation price pressures will be muted.\u201cAll told, some upside beats on retail and inflation leave room for the Bank of Canada to tighten\u201d in the first quarter, Nick Exarhos, an economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to investors.BMO economist Douglas Porter said economists will be watching closely Gross Domestic Product data out Friday and jobs numbers early in the New Year.\u201cWhile we believe that the Bank of Canada is still more likely to wait for a spell before hiking again (penciling in the March meeting), that could change quickly if those two reports also read strong,\u201d said Porter in a note.Investors are anticipating the Bank of Canada will move ahead with three more interest rate increases by the end of next year, adding to two rate hikes this year. Inflation last hit 2 per cent in February, and last surpassed the central bank\u2019s target in January. The jump in the inflation rate was the biggest one-month increase since 2013.Persistently weak inflation had been one of the main arguments against further interest-rate increases. But inflation is coming in faster than the central bank had forecast in October, when it predicted it would average 1.4 per cent in the final three months of 2017. Policy makers don\u2019t expect a sustained return to 2 per cent inflation until the end of next year.At a rate decision this month, the central bank said the faster-than-expected inflation was due to temporary factors. Yet, today\u2019s figures suggest that shrinking excess capacity in the economy is beginning to lift inflation.The average of the Bank of Canada\u2019s three key core inflation measures \u2014 which exclude volatile items such as energy \u2014 rose to 1.7 per cent, the highest level in more than a year.And today\u2019s retail sales figures suggest growth in the final quarter of 2017 remains above the nation\u2019s non-inflationary growth rates.Retail sales increased 1.5 per cent in October, the largest gain since January, Statistics Canada said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 0.3 per cent gain. The jump represents a comeback for retailers after a recent slowdown in sales had raised worries about consumers paring back in the second half of this year.The retail sales figures bode well for October gross domestic product data, which will be released Friday by Statistics Canada.

Increased standard deductions for individual filers will bring some much-promised simplicity, but a new tax break for partnerships, limited liability companies and other \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses adds a dose of complexity.Then there\u2019s the claim \u2014 advanced most famously by Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 that the bill won\u2019t cut taxes on people at the top of the income scale. It will.Barring unforeseen surprises, the legislation is headed for Trump\u2019s desk by midweek. Immediately upon signing it, the president will make the bill a major flashpoint in the 2018 congressional elections. GOP incumbents will run on having cut taxes \u2014 and on other provisions in the legislation, including repealing the Obamacare individual mandate and opening up part of Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.But Democrats \u2014 all of whom have voted against earlier versions of the bill in the House and Senate \u2014 will seek to capitalize public-opinion polls that show the legislative push has been largely unpopular.As the last debates begin this week, here are some of the promises made about the bill, and how they stack up to reality.Middle Class BenefitsThe promise: \u201cThe greatest benefit is going to be for jobs and for the middle class, middle income,\u201d Trump told reporters on Saturday as he boarded a helicopter en route to Camp David.The reality: Middle-income groups will get a tax cut \u2014 as will people above and below the middle \u2014 though some individual households will likely pay higher taxes because of provisions that include the elimination of personal exemptions and a limit on state and local tax deductions.But the greatest benefit is for corporations. The corporate rate cut will cost US$1.35 trillion over the next 10 years, according to Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation. That\u2019s more than the estimated US$1.2 trillion from individual rate cuts. Moreover, the plan\u2019s corporate tax cuts are permanent. Most individual changes \u2014 including those for owners of pass-through businesses \u2014 expire after 2025. One change that won\u2019t go away: The bill imposes a new annual adjustment mechanism that will push Americans into higher tax brackets more rapidly.Mnuchin said Sunday that the bill is \u201call about\u201d the middle class.\u201cPeople are going to see their paychecks go up,\u201d he said during an appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d And that\u2019s true, in many cases. On Friday, House Republicans said a family of four earning \u201cthe median family income of US$73,000 will receive a tax cut of $2,059.\u201dTop Earners\u2019 BenefitsThe promise: \u201cThe rich will not be gaining at all\u201d from the tax plan, Trump said on Sept. 13. He has repeatedly said the legislation won\u2019t benefit him, even insisting he\u2019d be a \u201cbig loser\u201d if it passes.The reality: Experts say Trump and other top earners would gain considerably under the plan. Many high-earning pass-through businesses \u2014 including Trump\u2019s many companies that own real estate assets \u2014 would see temporary tax cuts. The estate tax exclusion would temporarily double \u2014 allowing heirs to inherit US$11 million tax-free.More than a year ago, Mnuchin said this: \u201cAny reductions we have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions so that there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.\u201d Democrats quickly labeled that statement \u201cthe Mnuchin Rule.\u201d But if it\u2019s a rule, the tax bill breaks it.It\u2019s true that the bill will impose new limits on the individual deductions that many top earners use to reduce their taxable income. The state and local tax deduction will be capped at US$10,000. For new purchases of homes, the mortgage interest deduction will be limited to loans of US$750,000 or less.But at the very top of the income scale, the effects of such changes were muted by a last-minute rate cut to 37 per cent from 39.6 per cent.By itself, that change would save people US$2,600 on every US$100,000 of taxable income they earn above $600,000. (In 2015, about 18,000 top earners reported ordinary taxable income of more than US$11.6 million on average, according to data from the Internal Revenue Service. Apply the proposed new top tax rate to those numbers, and the average one-year tax break for that group is more than US$287,000.)Carried InterestThe promise: \u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions,\u201d Trump said in October 2016 of the tax break that\u2019s available to investment managers. Carried interest is the portion of an investment fund\u2019s returns that is paid to fund managers. It\u2019s treated as capital gains income, eligible for tax rates as low as 23.8 per cent. During his campaign, Trump referred to hedge fund managers as \u201cpaper pushers\u201d who are \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201dThe reality: The tax legislation preserved carried interest, with an added limitation: Investment fund managers have to hold assets for three years \u2014 up from one year currently \u2014 to qualify for the low rate.Largest Tax Cut in History?The promise: \u201cIt will be the biggest tax decrease, or tax cut, in the history of our country,\u201d Trump said on Friday at the White House.The reality: As written, it\u2019s not even the largest tax cut this decade. President Barack Obama oversaw a larger one \u2014 in inflation-adjusted dollars and as a share of the economy \u2014 that made permanent most of the tax cuts adopted on a temporary basis in 2001, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The independent group said a US$1.5 trillion net tax cut would be the fourth largest tax cut in U.S. history in real dollars, and the 12th largest as a percentage of GDP.\u2018Postcard\u2019 SimplicityThe promise: \u201cWe\u2019re making things so simple that you can do your taxes on a form the size of a postcard,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters on Nov. 2, a vow he and his allies have repeated throughout the year. Trump has called it \u201ca major, major, major simplification.\u201dThe reality: It\u2019s not that simple. The standard deduction increase means fewer Americans will itemize \u2014 which should make things simpler for them until that change goes away in 2026. But the code overall remains intractably complex as a sea of deductions and loopholes were preserved or tinkered with.A brand-new deduction for some business owners \u2014 one that applies only to certain types of businesses and can be calculated in two different ways that depend on employees\u2019 wages and investments that might be decades old \u2014 will prompt at least some head-scratching.And changes to the international tax system for corporations \u2014 which would impose new levies to try to prevent the offshoring of profit and have drawn concern from the European Union \u2014 promise ample complexity of their own.Deficit IssuesThe promise: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be deficit neutral,\u201d Ryan said Oct. 1 on CBS. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Bloomberg in May: \u201cIt will have to be revenue-neutral.\u201d In Dec. 2016, he warned \u201cthis level of national debt is dangerous and unacceptable.\u201dThe reality: The legislation is projected to add US$1.5 trillion to the deficit in the first decade. Trump administration officials and congressional Republicans have said the tax cuts will spur enough economic growth to cover that deficit \u2014 but the JCT disagreed. Earlier versions of the legislation would still create deficits of roughly US$1 trillion, the scorekeeper found, even after accounting for any growth effects.To comply with strict budget rules in the Senate, GOP tax writers set the individual tax cuts to expire after 2025 \u2014 creating a potential US$100 billion dollar tax hike on individuals and families on Jan. 1, 2026, according to the JCT\u2019s scoring.Trump said Saturday he believes future Congresses will make the tax breaks permanent and \u201cmaybe even make it more generous.\u201d It may take eight years to check that claim.Bloomberg News"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michelle Jamrisko", "title": "Shanghai seen replacing Paris as global growth center by 2035", "description": "China's Beijing, Guangzhou, and Tianjin are cities to watch for growth, along with those in emerging Asia, according to an Oxford Economics study", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/shanghai-seen-replacing-paris-as-global-growth-center-by-2035", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/0715shanghai.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 14, 2017 5:51 PM EST", "content": "Shanghai\u00a0will replace Paris in the top five list of global city economies by 2035 in a sign the balance of the world\u2019s economy is shifting east, according to an Oxford Economics study.The top 780 cities in the world, which already produce almost 60 per cent of global activity, will add almost half a billion more people and US$32 trillion in output over roughly the next couple of decades, Mark Britton, an economist at Oxford Economics, writes in a research note published this week.\u00a0The eye-popping headline figures mask\u00a0significant disparities between cities studied, Britton wrote.

In her final scheduled press conference before before stepping down on Feb. 3, Yellen also said she would do her utmost to ensure a smooth transition to her nominated successor, Jerome Powell.In a key change to its statement announcing the decision, the Federal Open Market Committee omitted prior language saying it expected the labour market would strengthen further. Instead, Wednesday\u2019s missive said monetary policy would help the labour market \u201cremain strong.\u201d That suggests Fed officials expect improvement in the job market to slow.The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell after the Fed announcement, as did the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index. Trading at record highs recently, stocks jumped after the Fed\u2019s announcement before paring gains. Asked during a press conference about rising asset prices, Yellen said the high valuations don\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re overvalued and that she\u2019s not seeing a worrisome buildup of leverage or credit.The 7-2 vote for the rate move, the Fed\u2019s third this year, raises the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.25 per cent to 1.5 per cent. In another move that could tighten monetary conditions, the Fed confirmed that it would step up the monthly pace of shrinking its balance sheet, as scheduled, to US$20 billion beginning in January from US$10 billion.Through the policy adjustments and the statement, the Fed continued to seek a delicate balance between responding to positive news on growth and unemployment that encouraged gradual tightening, while signalling caution due to persistently weak inflation readings that have befuddled policy makers.That puzzle continued earlier Wednesday when Labor Department data showed consumer inflation, excluding food and energy, was lower than expected at 1.7 per cent in the 12 months through November.\u201cHurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding have affected economic activity, employment and inflation in recent months but have not materially altered the outlook for the national economy,\u201d the Fed said. Repeating language used since June, the FOMC said that \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.\u201dIn the latest set of quarterly forecasts released Wednesday, the median estimate for economic growth next year jumped to 2.5 per cent from 2.1 per cent. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how much of the change reflected confidence that the tax-cut legislation moving through Congress will boost growth, or other factors such as pickups in business spending and global growth.At the same time, the committee\u2019s median forecast for long-run expansion was unchanged at 1.8 per cent, suggesting officials aren\u2019t yet convinced the tax package will significantly affect the economy\u2019s capacity for growth.Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and the Chicago Fed\u2019s Charles Evans both dissented against the interest-rate decision, preferring to leave them unchanged. It was the first meeting with more than one dissent since November 2016; Kashkari\u2019s dissent was his third this year. Evans dissented for the first time since 2011.What Our Economists Say: \u201cThe most important takeaway from the December FOMC meeting is that even though policy makers are becoming more bullish on economic prospects, they are not shifting to a more hawkish policy stance.\u00a0An extended inflation soft patch is giving the Powell-Fed a free pass to continue along Janet Yellen\u2019s gradualist path toward policy normalization.\u201d \u2014 Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, Bloomberg Economics.That follows a solid rebound for the expansion since a disappointing start to 2017. Gross domestic product grew at more than a 3 per cent annualized pace in both the second and third quarters, and is on track to expand in the fourth quarter by 2.9 per cent, according to the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow tracking estimate.Despite the upgrade in near-term growth expectations, policy makers left the number of hikes projected for 2018 effectively unchanged. The median forecast pegged the federal funds rate at 2.1 per cent at the end of next year.That could, in part, reflect lingering concerns over sluggish wage and price gains. The Fed\u2019s preferred gauge of inflation, based on consumer spending, gained just 1.6 per cent in the year through October.Weighed against unemployment, which has dropped to a 16-year low at 4.1 per cent, that weakness has puzzled economists and made some policy makers declare the Fed should hold off on additional rate increases until prices respond more briskly.The committee lowered its median estimate for the unemployment rate, expecting it to hit 3.9 per cent by the end of 2018, compared with a September projection of 4.1 per cent.The committee left its median estimate for the lowest sustainable\u00a0level\u00a0of long-run unemployment at 4.6 per cent, suggesting that officials still expect the drop in joblessness to eventually boost inflation. Forecasts showed little change in the inflation outlook over the next three years.Yellen is expected to chair the committee\u2019s next meeting on Jan. 30-31 for what will be her last FOMC gathering of her time on the committee spanning three decades as chair, vice chair, San Francisco Fed president and governor.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rachel Evans, Sabrina Willmer, Nick Baker and Brandon Kochkodin", "title": "With $20 trillion between them, Blackrock and Vanguard could own almost everything by 2028", "description": "Two towers of power are dominating the future of investing", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/a-20-trillion-blackrock-vanguard-duopoly-is-investings-future", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/funds.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 4, 2017 12:01 PM EST", "content": "Imagine a world in which two asset managers call the shots, in which their wealth exceeds current U.S. GDP and where almost every hedge fund, government and retiree is a customer.It\u2019s closer than you think. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group \u2014 already the world\u2019s largest money managers \u2014 are less than a decade from managing a total of US$20 trillion, according to Bloomberg News calculations. Amassing that sum will likely upend the asset management industry, intensify their ownership of the largest U.S. companies and test the twin pillars of market efficiency and corporate governance.None other than Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, widely regarded as the father of the index fund, is raising the prospect that too much money is in too few hands, with BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Corp. together owning significant stakes in the biggest U.S. companies.\u201cThat\u2019s about 20 per cent owned by this oligopoly of three,\u201d Bogle said at a Nov. 28 appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \u201cIt is too bad that there aren\u2019t more people in the index-fund business.\u201dVanguard is poised to parlay its US$4.7 trillion of assets into more than US$10 trillion by 2023, while BlackRock may hit that mark two years later, up from almost US$6 trillion today, according to Bloomberg News projections based on the companies\u2019 most recent five-year average annual growth rates in assets. Those gains in part reflect a bull market in stocks that\u2019s driven assets into investment products and may not continue.Investors from individuals to large institutions such as pension and hedge funds have flocked to this duo, won over in part by their low-cost funds and breadth of offerings. The proliferation of exchange-traded funds is also supercharging these firms and will likely continue to do so.Global ETF assets could explode to US$25 trillion by 2025, according to estimates by Jim Ross, chairman of State Street\u2019s global ETF business. That sum alone would mean trillions of dollars more for BlackRock and Vanguard, based on their current market share.\u201cGrowth is not a goal, nor do we make projections about future growth,\u201d Vanguard spokesman John Woerth said of the Bloomberg calculations.While bigger may be better for the fund giants, passive funds may be blurring the inherent value of securities, implied in a company\u2019s earnings or cash flow.The argument goes like this: The number of indexes now outstrips U.S. stocks, with the eruption of passive funds driving demand for securities within these benchmarks, rather than for the broader universe of stocks and bonds. That could inflate or depress the price of these securities versus similar un-indexed assets, which may create bubbles and volatile price movements.Stocks with outsize exposure to indexed funds could trade more on cross-asset flows and macro views, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The bank found that, for the average stock in the S&P 500, 77 per cent might trade on fundamentals, versus more than 90 per cent a decade ago.That\u2019s not BlackRock\u2019s experience. \u201cWhile index investing does play a role, the price discovery process is still dominated by active stock selectors,\u201d executives led by Vice Chairman Barbara Novick wrote in a paper in October, citing the relatively low turnover and small size of passive accounts compared with active strategies.Another concern is that without the prospect of being part of an index, fewer small or mid-sized companies have an incentive to go public, according to Larry Tabb, founder of Tabb Group LLC, a New York-based firm that analyzes the structure of financial markets. That\u2019s because their stock risks underperforming without the inclusion in an index or an ETF, he said. Benchmarks are governed by rules or a methodology for selection and some require that a security has a certain size or liquidity for inclusion.We\u2019re not near a tipping point yet. Roughly 37 per cent of assets in U.S.-domiciled equity funds are managed passively, up from 19 per cent in 2009, according to Savita Subramanian at Bank of America Corp. By contrast, in Japan, nearly 70 per cent of domestically focused equity funds are passively managed, suggesting the U.S. can stomach more indexing before market efficiency suffers.There\u2019s even further to go if you look globally: Only 15 per cent of world equity markets \u2014 including funds, separately managed accounts and holdings of individual securities \u2014 are passively managed, said Joe Brennan, global head of Vanguard\u2019s equity index group, in an interview.BlackRock and Vanguard\u2019s dominance raises questions about competition and governance. The companies hold more than 5 per cent of more than 4,400 stocks around the world, research from the University of Amsterdam shows.That\u2019s making regulators uneasy, with SEC Commissioner Kara Stein asking in February: \u201cDoes ownership concentration affect the willingness of companies to compete?\u201d Common ownership by institutional shareholders pushed up airfares by as much as 7 per cent over 14 years starting in 2001 because the shared holdings put less pressure on the airlines to compete, according to a study led by Jose Azar, an assistant professor of economics at IESE Business School. BlackRock and Vanguard are among the five largest shareholders of the three biggest operators.\u201cAs BlackRock and Vanguard grow, and as money flows from active to large passive investors, their per centage share of every firm increases,\u201d said Azar in an interview. \u201cIf they cross the 10 per cent threshold, I think for many people that would make it clearer that the growth of large asset managers could create serious concerns for competition in many industries.\u201dBlackRock has called Azar\u2019s research \u201cvague and implausible\u201d while other academics have questioned his methodology. One of those is Edward Rock. A law professor at New York University, Rock says a variety of legal rules in fact discourage stakes above 10 per cent and he favors creating a safe harbor for holdings up to 15 per cent to incentivize shareholder engagement. The firms are among the biggest holders of some of the world\u2019s largest companies across a range of industries including Google parent Alphabet Inc.and Facebook Inc. in technology, and lenders like Wells Fargo & Co. In the U.S., both companies supported or didn\u2019t oppose 96 per cent of management resolutions on board directors in the year ended June 30, according to their own reports.\u201cWe\u2019ve put more and more efforts behind it but we\u2019ve always had a substantial effort,\u201d said Vanguard\u2019s Brennan. \u201cWe\u2019re permanent long-term holders and, given that, we have the strongest interest in the best outcomes.\u201d Their size could also help companies change for the good. Both firms were among the first to join the Investor Stewardship Group, a group of institutional asset managers seeking to foster better corporate governance, according to the organization\u2019s website. Vanguard has doubled its team dedicated to this over the last two years and supported two climate-related shareholder resolutions for the first time. BlackRock has more than 30 people engaging with its portfolio companies. Active managers will be watching these developments closely. While many concede that stemming the passive tide is a challenge, they may see better days as central banks start unwinding a decade of easy monetary policy that\u2019s sapped volatility.Data show performance among active managers is improving. Some 57 per cent of large-cap stock pickers underperformed the S&P 500 in the year ended June 30, compared with 85 per cent the year before, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices show. And if indexing distorts the market so much that it\u2019s easier to beat, more investors will flock to stock pickers, says Richard Thaler, Nobel laureate, University of Chicago professor and principal at Fuller & Thaler Asset Management.Right now, though, the duo\u2019s advance appears unstoppable, and the benefits they\u2019ve brought with low-cost investments may outweigh some of the structural issues.\u201cGiven that they\u2019ve grown so big because their fees are so small, these are the kinds of monopolies that don\u2019t keep me up at night,\u201d said Thaler.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn and Theophilos Argitis", "title": "The loonie is on fire as Canada\u2019s jobless rate falls to lowest in decade", "description": "Canada's economy gained 79,500 jobs last month, a surprise jump in hiring that defies a slowdown in the rest of the economy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-jobless-rate-falls-to-lowest-in-a-decade-on-hiring-surge", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/loonieflight_np.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 1, 2017 1:02 PM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy is showing unexpected resiliency in the second half of the year despite slumping exports, driven by the strongest job market since the 2008-2009 recession.The jobless rate plunged to 5.9 per cent in November as employers added another 79,500 workers during the month, bringing gains over the past 12 months to nearly 400,000, Statistics Canada said Friday from Ottawa.The Canadian dollar soared on the data, rising more than a cent to 78.67 US cents.The increased employment is helping to fuel household spending, a separate report showed. Economic growth in the third quarter slowed to an annualized 1.7 per cent on a sharp drop in exports, but the decline was tempered by stronger-than-expected consumption.The data indicates an expected slowdown for Canada\u2019s economy in coming quarters may be less severe than anticipated, raising the prospect of faster interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada.\u201cAll told, some great numbers on the monthly GDP front and on jobs, which should support the loonie and dent fixed income,\u201d Nick Exarhos, an economist at CIBC\u00a0Economics, said in a note to investors.Both the employment gain and jobless figure in November beat the consensus economist forecasts for a 6.2 per cent unemployment rate and 10,000 new jobs. Third-quarter gross domestic product growth was also slightly higher than the 1.6 per cent rate forecast by economists.The employment gain for November is the 12th straight, the longest since a 14-month span that ended in March 2007.Household consumption increased by an annualized 4 per cent, the GDP report showed, versus estimates for below 3 per cent growth. Statistics Canada also revised up second-quarter consumption growth to 5 per cent. That\u2019s the best two-quarter gain since before the 2008-2009 recession.The spending is being fuelled by a buoyant jobs market that is driving incomes.

The increase in gross domestic product probably slowed to less than a 2 per cent annualized pace between July and September, economists predict, less than half the rate in the first six months of this year.The quarter also may mark the start of what analysts believe will be a gearing down in spending by the nation\u2019s highly indebted households that will act as a long-term drag. Future GDP growth is seen limited to no more than 2 per cent as consumer spending slows to some of the weakest levels on record outside of recession.The economy has been growing \u201con the backs of the consumer\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s clearly unsustainable,\u201d said David Stonehouse, a Toronto-based portfolio manager who helps oversee $6 billion in fixed-income assets at AGF Management Ltd.The GDP data is due at 8:30 a.m. Ottawa time, along with November jobs numbers. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast annualized growth of 1.6 per cent in the third quarter, down from 4.5 per cent in the second quarter. The big drag in the third quarter comes from a sharp drop in exports \u2014 plagued by temporary plant shutdowns \u2014 that should reverse by the end of the year.An expected slowdown in consumption however will be more lasting. Household spending growth is expected to slow to 2.8 per cent in the third quarter, the slowest pace in a year, from 4.6 per cent in the prior period.And consumption is expected to continue slowing in coming quarters, with economists forecasting quarterly annualized growth of 1.6 per cent by the start of 2019.Bank of Canada economists have come to similar conclusions. According to the central bank\u2019s latest projections, consumer spending\u2019s contribution to growth over the next two years will be near record lows outside of recession, adding 1.3 percentage points to total growth in 2018 and 1 percentage point in 2019. That would be down from 2.1 percentage points in 2017.By 2019, overall GDP growth is projected to slow to 1.5 per cent \u2014 half the 3 per cent rate projected for 2017 \u2014 as households pull down economic activity.Household spending has carried the country\u2019s economy for much of the decade since the 2008-2009 recession, particularly in the two years following the collapse of oil prices in 2014 when it accounted for just about all of Canada\u2019s economic growth.Consumers, benefiting from a buoyant jobs market and rising home values, accelerated their spending in the first half of this year, when household consumption rose at an annualized 4.6 per cent pace in the second quarter, following a 4.8 per cent gain in the first quarter. That\u2019s the best two-quarter gain since before the 2008 recession.But a mounting debt load \u2014 Canadian households are carrying more than $2 trillion of debt, driven in large part by soaring home prices in major cities \u2014 will take a toll, particularly as the Bank of Canada raises interest rates. In the long term, consumption will be subject to the same source of structural constraints hampering potential growth in the rest of the economy: low productivity and aging demographics.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the past three quarters isn\u2019t anywhere near a sustainable rate of growth,\u201d said James Marple, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.Of course, economists and policy makers have long underestimated the ability of the consumer to dominate the growth story. At the start of last year, the Bank of Canada was forecasting a contribution to growth for consumption in 2017 of half its latest estimates.But Canada\u2019s consumption-led growth model is approaching its limits. It may work when the economy has plenty of spare capacity, as has been the case for a decade. It works less well when the economy is running up against constraints, as it is now.Faster-than-expected growth in the first half of the year led the central bank to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade, with moves in July and September.Much will depend on other engines of growth, particularly business investment that not only bolsters the economy today but gives it more scope to grow in the future. And here the numbers are looking better. Investment is poised to be the strongest part of Friday\u2019s GDP report, with economists calling for a 4.6 per cent annualized expansion in gross fixed investment.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Mark Deen", "title": "OECD warns markets too optimistic as global economy set to peak", "description": "The OECD cautioned investors that asset prices have gotten too high for a global economy that is set to peak next year and a market downturn could put the expansion ...", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/oecd-warns-markets-too-optimistic-as-global-economy-peaks", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/1128money.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 28, 2017 10:45 AM EST", "content": "The OECD cautioned investors that asset prices have gotten too high for a global economy that is set to peak next year and a market downturn could put the expansion at risk.World output will probably grow 3.7 per cent in 2018, the best in years, before slowing to 3.6 per cent in 2019, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Tuesday in a semi-annual report.

That\u2019s followed Friday by Statistics Canada\u2019s gross domestic product numbers for the third quarter and October jobs data that will show the extent to which the economy continues to eat into its spare capacity.The reports are widely seen reinforcing market expectations for continued interest rate increases, but only gradually as the Bank of Canada tiptoes its way to more normal levels.Poloz\u2019s main message at his last Financial System Review in June \u2014 which came just before his first rate increase in seven years \u2014 was that despite an unsustainable jump in Toronto home prices earlier this year and the consequent rise in debt levels, the financial system\u2019s resilience was actually strengthening on the back of an improving economy.And since then, Canada\u2019s economy has done even better than Poloz had thought at the time.While economists expect Statistics Canada to report a slowdown to 1.8 per cent annualized growth in the third quarter, growth in the second quarter turned out to be a much stronger 4.5 per cent and the economy is on pace for 3 per cent growth for all of 2017.Toronto\u2019s housing market, meanwhile, is cooling after Ontario imposed a foreign-buyer tax and the country\u2019s main financial regulator tightened mortgage-qualification rules.Stronger economic growth and cooler housing should mean \u2014 in the eyes of policy makers \u2014 the financial system has only become more resilient over the past six months.Of course, what has changed since June is that Poloz raised the central bank\u2019s key interest rate twice, and the Bank of Canada has said it\u2019s monitoring closely how the higher borrowing costs will impact the economy. It\u2019s one of the reasons the central bank claims it will remain cautious on future hikes.But the initial signs should be comforting.A soft landing seems to be playing out in Toronto\u2019s housing market and households are hardly slowing their credit growth.Year-over-year benchmark home price gains in Toronto averaged 27 per cent in the first six months of 2017, according to the city\u2019s realtor board. Since June, that average has halved to 13.6 per cent. Vancouver\u2019s housing market underwent a similar slowdown after a foreign-buyer tax was imposed in August 2016, and is now recovering.Stronger demand and tighter supply mean the Toronto and Vancouver markets are \u201cstill on an upward trajectory, but it\u2019s on a more stable upward trajectory,\u201d said Royce Mendes, an economist at CIBC World Markets. New regulations in places like Toronto and Vancouver \u201cwill be more like a bump in the road than a car driving into a sink hole.\u201dHousehold credit data \u2014 the latest were released Friday \u2014 show year-over-year growth still hovering at the 5.5 per cent range it\u2019s averaged over the past 18 months, with consumer credit gains offsetting slowing residential loan borrowing.One issue likely to remain an area of concern is the growing share of uninsured mortgages, which is being fuelled by higher Toronto and Vancouver home prices and tighter qualification rules for insured mortgages.Specifically, the central bank said in its June FSR that it worries some home buyers are finding new ways to finance larger deposits \u2014 so-called co-lending arrangements \u2014 to skirt the tougher qualification rules. Essentially, they are borrowing to finance larger down payments.The latest data suggest the uninsured market has only gotten larger since the June FSR. As of September the number of uninsured mortgages in Canada was $662.7 billion, up 17.5 per cent from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year increase since 2004. Uninsured mortgages now represent 48 per cent of outstanding mortgages, from 36 per cent just five years earlier.Last month, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions also stepped in to make it harder for home buyers to qualify for an uninsured mortgage. The issue is likely to be top-of-mind at the central bank, if tighter regulations of the federally regulated sector are only pushing borrowers to private lenders outside of the regulated space.\u201cYou\u2019re kind of back to these non-banks and these provincially-regulated institutions apparently just skating along,\u201d said Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management. \u201cThere could be some talk about the composition of the financial sector and just where the risk is accruing. It\u2019s still a fairly serious risk.\u201dThe Bank of Canada sometimes comes under criticism for its role in fuelling all this household debt, with some suggesting the central bank should stop worrying about the impact of raising interest rates and hike more aggressively in order to curb borrowing more quickly.This month, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development flagged Canada as leading the advanced and developed world in household borrowing, and how that poses a risk to growth. Canada currently has the second-highest gross debt to income ratio in the Group of 20, the International Monetary Fund reported in October.Canada\u2019s debt addiction is frequently the subject of such warnings, yet CIBC\u2019s Mendes says they\u2019re misleading. He says the overall economic backdrop in Canada is much better than in other countries with less debt.\u201cDespite the fact that we have a high level of household debt or high ratio of household debt to income, the quality of that debt is probably pretty high compared to other nations, and that\u2019s one reason to have some confidence in Canada,\u201d he said.For example, the risks are nowhere near where they were in the U.S. before the financial crisis, according to Mendes. He says the proportion of non-prime mortgage origination is about 10 per cent of the total, compared with 33 per cent in the U.S. before the crash.\u201cSome of these international organizations make too big a deal of this one metric,\u201d Mendes said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the be all and end all of economics. It also doesn\u2019t tell you the distribution of the debt. If all the debt is held by people with really well-paying jobs and lots of money in the bank, then that doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dThe Bank of Canada publishes its Financial Stability Report on Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. in Ottawa, and Statistics Canada\u2019s releases data on GDP and the labour market Friday at 8:30 a.m.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "GDP revisions show oil shock wasn't as bad for Canada's economy as initially feared", "description": "The revisions may suggest to Bank of Canada policy makers there's even less slack in the economy than assumed, which could have implications for interest rates", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/gdp-revisions-show-oil-shock-wasnt-as-bad-for-canadas-economy-as-initially-feared", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/1124oil.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 24, 2017 8:18 AM EST", "content": "It seems Canada weathered the oil collapse better than previously thought.Numbers recently published on Statistics Canada\u2019s online database show that between 2014 and 2016, the nation\u2019s economy generated $24 billion (US$19 billion) more output in nominal terms than first estimated, according to Bloomberg calculations.\u00a0The agency\u2019s fully revised data will be officially released on Dec. 1, along with\u00a0a report on third quarter 2017 gross domestic product.In real terms \u2014 which adjust the numbers for inflation and are the more conventional marker of economic activity \u2014 the\u00a0update shows Canada\u2019s growth rate over the three-year period averaged 1.8 per cent, compared with a previous estimate of 1.7 per cent.The revisions may suggest to\u00a0Bank of Canada policy makers there\u2019s even less slack in the economy than currently assumed, which could have implications for interest rates.

Removing those barriers could boost OECD growth by between six and 20 per cent, they estimated.\u201cIt\u2019s about the sheer scope for growth \u2014 six per cent is what we arrived at for advanced economies, for emerging market countries it\u2019s even higher. So why aren\u2019t we going for it?,\u201d Fordham said. The proposals in the report would contribute \u201csignificantly more than the monetary-fiscal policies that are under discussion.\u201dFemale participation rates are often significantly below those of men, even in advanced economies. The share of women working or actively looking for work in OECD countries averaged 64 per cent last year, compared with a male participation rate of 80 per cent.That gap is particularly large in Italy and Japan. The gulf is more than 10 percentage points in the U.S. and the U.K., and it\u2019s only slightly lower in France and Germany.Policies reducing gender inequality are vital given relatively sluggish growth prospects in advanced economies and the more limited potential of other reforms, the report said.The European Commission estimates that if all of its possible structural reforms \u2014 including those on tax, unemployment benefits, product markets, human capital and R&D investments \u2014 were implemented, they could lift EU growth by about 6 per cent over 10 years. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus could potentially boost U.S. GDP by 1 to 1.5 per cent over 2018-21.\u201cI\u2019d suggest that the Trump administration have a look at this report,\u201d Fordham said. \u201cMany of the ways to remove barriers to women are pretty easy to implement \u2014 and you can see that in the case where we compare the U.S. and Canada.\u201dFemale labour force participation in Canada has risen gradually since 1990, helped by tax reforms, family support and wage and income equalization, the report said. The public sector has made gender diversity an objective, and private firms and institutions have started to collect metrics to track and reduce wage discrepancies.But progress in the U.S. has stalled. There are few U.S. federal mandates that support equal pay between men and women, no laws that guarantee paid family leave and tax rules continue to penalize married couples.Both Canada and the U.S. nevertheless have a gender wage gap that exceeds the OECD average.\u201cConstraints on women\u2019s economic empowerment are rooted in unaddressed gender inequalities in society,\u201d the report said. \u201cLayers of disadvantage \u2014 including those related to poverty, ethnicity, disability, age, geography, and migratory status \u2014 remain powerful obstacles to equal rights and opportunities for hundreds of millions of women.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Bank of Canada caution on rates a mistake as debt swells, Dodge warns", "description": "Former bank governor says keeping rates low only encourages Canadians to pile on more debt, putting financial stability at risk", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/former-governor-says-poloz-caution-a-mistake-canada-eco-watch", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/bankers.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 1, 2017 9:46 AM EDT", "content": "One of Governor Stephen Poloz\u2019s predecessors says the Bank of Canada\u2019s current approach to increasing interest rates is too cautious.David Dodge, who led the Canadian central bank\u00a0between 2001 and 2008, thinks Poloz should focus more on the long-neglected issue of financial stability and take the opportunity to raise rates now that the economy is running more or less at potential. Poloz kept his benchmark rate at 1 per cent last week and indicated\u00a0he\u2019s in no rush to tighten, given that he still sees signs of wage and inflation slack.Keeping borrowing costs low will only encourage households and businesses to keep adding debt, risks that should factor in more to the central bank\u2019s decision making, Dodge said in a telephone interview.\u201cWhile I understand why they want to be cautious, and I think that\u2019s quite correct, the fact that they are not moving to deal with what is a problem in financial markets arising from this very long period of very low interest rates I think is a mistake,\u201d Dodge said.Interest rates could rise by a full percentage point and still remain well below the 3 per cent the Bank of Canada estimates is \u201cneutral\u201d for the economy \u2014 neither stimulative or contractionary.\u201cIt\u2019s not like the bank is being unreasonable,\u201d\u00a0said Dodge. \u201cTheir\u2019s would be more or less the mainstream view, whereas I put a little bit more emphasis\u201d on financial system distortions. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through earlier periods,\u201d he said, in reference to the financial crisis.While government debt levels are low, Canada has by far the most private sector debt relative to GDP in the Group of Seven.\u201cIf we think we are actually growing at about the capacity of the economy and are pretty much balanced, then indeed we should have rates that are higher than they currently are,\u201d Dodge said.In his twice-annual testimony to lawmakers Tuesday, Poloz reiterated that the central bank will be cautious in making future changes to interest rates.With growth expected to slow next year after what is shaping up to be a strong 2017, Poloz highlighted the main sources of uncertainty for the central bank, including soft inflation and wage growth, as well as high household debt. \u201cWe are at a crucial spot in the economic cycle, and significant uncertainties are clouding the way forward,\u201d he told a parliamentary committee.The fact new government spending measures, outlined last week by Finance Minister Bill Morneau, could pressure the central bank to move rates higher is already drawing opposition attention to the matter.\u201cI want to highlight the potential risks that Canada faces as interest rates inevitably begin to rise,\u201d Pierre Poilievre, the opposition Conservative Party lawmaker responsible for finance issues, said in a phone interview.\u201cWe have both growing household debt and growing government debt,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to know more about the burden that these higher rates will mean for Canadian taxpayers and families over the next decade.\u201dPoloz has cited the increased sensitivity of the economy to higher interest rates as one reason to remain cautious, but at a press conference last week he wouldn\u2019t be drawn on whether the new spending measures were stimulative.The\u00a0Bank of Canada\u2019s latest credit data show growth in debt financing is slowing from elevated levels earlier this year. Still, 2017 is on pace for the strongest year since the 2008-2009 recession.Total business and household credit in the economy reached $4.08 trillion in September, 7.2 per cent above year ago levels.The increase is mostly due to a surge in borrowing by businesses, which have increased credit by 9.1 per cent from a year ago, accounting for 60 per cent of all credit taken out in the economy over that time.That could be a good thing if it means companies are financing investments.\u00a0Since corporate borrowing is rising faster than investment, however, it may suggest instead that companies are taking on debt to fund share buybacks or higher dividends, Dodge said. The debt baton is simply being passed from one sector to another.\u201cThe bank talks about the household sector, which is worrisome,\u201d Dodge said. \u201cBut we also have a number of corporations which are overextended, which is also quite worrisome from the perspective of future macro financial stability.\u201dThe rising level of business credit may reflect a number of other things as well. According to\u00a0Doug Porter, Bank of Montreal chief economist, economic data show companies have also been ramping up inventories this year, which needs to be financed.They are also in the process of repairing income statements, after a tough couple of years of profits, and may need some debt to get investments going.\u201cWe might be at the stage of the cycle where businesses do need a bit of financing to support modest increases in capital spending,\u201d Porter said. \u201cBut perhaps a year from now as earnings grow they won\u2019t need as much external financing.\u201dSince the Oct. 25 decision and Poloz\u2019s talk of being cautious, investors have pared bets on a rate increase at the Dec. 6 meeting to a one-in-four chance, from about 50-50 early last week. Language in the statement accompanying the rate decision may have something to do with that.The Bank of Canada\u2019s rate statements often have language to describe the appropriateness of monetary policy or stimulus. Reappearing in last week\u2019s statement after a two-month absence was this phrase: the \u201ccurrent stance of monetary policy is appropriate.\u201dA variation of that phrase has appeared 21 times in Poloz\u2019s statements dating back to 2014, but only once immediately preceding a rate change \u2014 the surprise rate cut in January 2015.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada's shrinking economy signals slowdown could be worse than feared", "description": "Canada\u2019s GDP unexpectedly contracts for the first time in almost a year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/update-1-canadian-gdp-unexpectedly-fell-in-aug-amid-industry-shutdowns", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/roadclosed.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 31, 2017 1:36 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy unexpectedly contracted in August, adding to signs of a faster-than-expected cooling following a torrid pace of growth in the first half of this year.Canada\u2019s GDP shrank 0.1 per cent versus estimates for a 0.1 per cent gain. It was the first monthly decline since October 2016 and follows a flat reading in July.The drop was led by across-the-board weakness in goods-producing industries, including a 1 per cent fall in manufacturing and a 1.4 per cent decline in oil and gas.Statistics Canada cites maintenance shutdowns in manufacturing and conventional oil for decline.The Canadian dollar weakened against its U.S. counterpart after the disappointing data further dampened prospects of another Bank of Canada interest rate hike this year.Most analysts are anticipating a slowdown in the second half of this year after growth was running at a 4 per cent clip in the first six months of 2017. Tuesday\u2019s numbers suggest there could be a more pronounced drop than expected.If the economy fails to post gains in September, third quarter annualized growth would be on pace for a sub-2 per cent increase. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News are forecasting growth to average 2.1 per cent in the second half.The nation\u2019s currency dropped 0.44 cents to 77.57 U.S. cents after Tuesday\u2019s report, which may fuel concern the Bank of Canada\u2019s caution with raising interest rates will only deepen.

But while there is no debate that today\u2019s soft reading is a surprise and a disappointment, there were some special factors involved, including a monster mash of maintenance shutdowns. And, keep in mind that even with a two-month dip, the economy has still managed to grow 3.5% in the past year, and at that same strong pace over the past six months. We continue to expect something closer to 2% over the next year. Today\u2019s soft reading will reinforce the Bank of Canada\u2019s new-found caution, keeping them on hold well into 2018 (we are still calling for March for the next hike).\u201dThere were positives in the data, with 12 out of 20 sub-sectors posting gains. Services-producing industries posted a 0.1 per cent increase.Non-durable manufacturing fell 2 per cent, with chemical producers posting a 7.3 per cent drop, the largest in the last 20 years. Statistics Canada cited \u201cplant maintenance shutdowns and lower demand from export markets\u201d for the drop.Shutdowns in Newfoundland impacted conventional oil and gas production, which was down 5.2 per cent in August.The real estate broker industry posted its first gain in five months, up 0.3 per cent.

This time around, it\u2019s the risk of a sickly China that poses a bigger threat.The world\u2019s second-largest economy is now trying to ward off the sniffles. While output is still growing at a pace that sees gross domestic product double every decade, the problem remains that much of that has been fueled by a massive buildup of credit.Total borrowing climbed to about 260 per cent of the economy\u2019s size by the end of 2016, up from 162 per cent in 2008, and will hit close to 320 per cent by 2021 according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.\u00a0Economy-wide debt levels are on track to rank among \u201cthe highest in the world,\u201d according to Tom Orlik, BI\u2019s Chief Asia Economist.That path may be what prompted outgoing People\u2019s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan to warn of the risk of a plunge in asset values following a debt binge, or a \u201cMinsky Moment,\u201d earlier this month. Given that China is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to contribute more than a third of global growth this year, controlling China\u2019s debt matters far beyond its borders.There are two key components of China\u2019s credit clampdown, each posing challenges to policy makers.First is wringing out bets on property prices. As President Xi Jinping put it in a keynote policy speech to the Communist Party leadership on Oct. 18: Housing is for living in, not for speculation. The latest data show that in some areas, prices are still surging in many cities despite a raft of measures to make it harder for investors to buy real estate with borrowed money. Xi\u2019an, China\u2019s ancient capital, saw home values soar almost 15 per cent in September from a year before.It will be up to regulators to come up with measures that deliver on Xi\u2019s mandate without tipping housing into a downward spiral. Property crashes in the U.S., Japan and U.K. over the past three decades amply illustrated how damaging they can be to economies.The second key challenge is progress in aligning borrowing costs with borrowers\u2019 ability to repay \u2014 rather than with their relationship with the state.China\u2019s financial system has long let companies that are state owned or are seen to be implementing state initiatives get funding more cheaply than others. That\u2019s thanks to the assumption the government would step in if needed to back them up. To help encourage capital to be deployed more efficiently \u2014 and to prevent firms that are effectively insolvent keep going thanks to continued funding \u2014 policy makers have begun to gradually take away implicit support.In 2014, a solar-panel maker\u00a0Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. became the first Chinese company to default on a domestic corporate bond. Since then, even some state-owned firms have been allowed to default. Handling that process is delicate.\u201cIf tomorrow you suddenly withdraw that implicit government support, you would get a freeze-up in credit flow,\u201d said Kenneth Ho, head of Asia credit strategy research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Hong Kong. \u201cIf they do it too quickly the system will collapse. They\u2019ve been going at the right speed.\u201dHo anticipates that the number of defaults allowed will go up, though doesn\u2019t see any surge. \u201cWe\u2019re in an upward cycle in terms of recognizing defaults, but it\u2019s a long cycle,\u201d he said.One thing could propel defaults is higher yields, and they do appear to be on the climb again. Benchmark 10-year government bonds are hovering around the highest yields since 2014, at 3.83 per cent.To be sure, China\u2019s economy continues to defy predictions of an actual debt crisis or a housing bust. Instead, there are signs of a controlled easing. Home prices in September rose in the fewest cities since January 2016, amid curbs on debt-fueled buying.A domestically triggered crisis is unlikely, at least in the next five years, according to\u00a0a report by Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies. \u201cTrouble is more likely to come from some combination of capital flight and sudden withdrawal of external credit,\u201d wrote Victor Shih, a professor at the University of California at San Diego and author of the report.Still, few countries that have experienced China\u2019s pace of debt growth have unwound things without some sort of crunch. Investors, companies and governments around the world will want China to break that mold.\u00a0An indication of the ripple effect China can have on global markets came in 2015 when a devaluation of the yuan, followed by other changes to how the tightly controlled currency is traded, sent shock waves through global markets.

Over the past four quarters, the economy expanded by an average 3.7 percent, the best performance in a decade.That will have an impact on the government\u2019s bottom line. The budget forecast a shortfall of $28.5 billion for 2017-18. CIBC World Markets Deputy Chief Economist Benjamin Tal expects it instead to come in between $15 billion and $16 billion, including the so-called budgeted risk adjustment.\u201cThat\u2019s dramatically better than expected, mostly due to the fact the economy was way stronger,\u201d Tal said in a telephone interview.Annual deficits over the coming few years will hover in the same general range, with the forecast ratio of the federal debt relative to the nation\u2019s economy also set to improve, Tal said. \u201cThe highlight will be a much lower deficit.\u201dBrian DePratto, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, expects a deficit of about $16 billion for the fiscal year, also including the risk adjustment. \u201cThe fall fiscal update or Budget 2018 will provide an opportunity for the government to credibly re-commit to a fiscal anchor, such as a reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio over a five year horizon,\u201d DePratto wrote in an Oct. 11 research note.The growth outlook has improved substantially since the annual budget released in March. \u201cWhat a difference half a year can make,\u201d he said.In the midst of the better budget news, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government is facing a backlash over tax proposals. The measures, introduced in July, were aimed at restricting the ability of high earners in particular to skirt the top marginal income tax rate by using corporations, converting income to capital gains or paying relatives who didn\u2019t actually work for them. The government is backtracking on some of the proposals.Trudeau was the only Canadian party leader to pledge deficits in the 2015 election campaign, though said they would not exceed $10 billion annually and that he\u2019d balance the budget by the 2019 election. His latest projections instead forecast deficits of at least $23 billion in each of his first four full years in power, with no projected return to surplus.In addition, Morneau has been at the center of a controversy over his personal finances. He announced on Oct. 19 that he would put his family\u2019s assets in a blind trust and sell about one million shares in Morneau Shepell Inc., the human resources and benefits firm his family founded and that he once led.The minister has faced allegations of conflict of interest because he owned the shares. He\u2019s also under pressure to withdraw a proposed law that opens the door to a type of pension plan he advocated for while still at Morneau Shepell. The finance minister produced a letter last week to demonstrate he followed\u00a0the advice of the country\u2019s\u00a0ethics watchdog on how to handle his assets, and said he moved to sell the shares to avoid what he called further \u201cdistraction.\u201dThe budget update gives Morneau a chance to shift focus away from the tax flap and questions over his ethics. Though challenges also loom for the country\u2019s fiscal outlook.Borrowing costs are rising, albeit slowly, and health transfers to provinces and direct transfers to the elderly are expected to be higher by 2021-22 than forecast just six months ago, DePratto said, leaving scant wiggle room for new spending.\u201cAlthough we expect a much better near-term fiscal outlook, the likely path for revenue and expenditures results in a fairly persistent deficit, rather than the steady, if modest, improvement envisioned in Budget 2017,\u201d he wrote.\u00a0\u00a9 Bloomberg News"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Retail drop, subdued inflation put Bank of Canada rates on hold", "description": "The retail sales number was the big disappointment", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/retail-drop-subdued-inflation-put-bank-of-canada-rates-on-hold", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/cashregister1.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 20, 2017 5:13 PM EDT", "content": "An unexpected decline in retail sales and scant evidence of inflation pressure will give the Bank of Canada little reason to press ahead with a third-straight rate increase next week.Statistics Canada reported Friday retail sales declined 0.3 per cent in August, versus a median forecast of a 0.5 per cent gain. They also showed that excluding a jump in gasoline, inflation was little changed in September.The two indicators are the last of any significance before the Bank of Canada\u2019s Oct. 25 rate decision, and suggest no urgency for Governor Stephen Poloz to increase borrowing costs again after two hikes since July.

Monthly retail sales are little changed since touching a 2017 high in May. In volume terms, sales fell 0.7 per cent in August, the biggest decline since March 2016.Motor vehicle sales were one sector of strength, and the total number also got a boost from higher gasoline prices.

Excluding gas, the annual inflation rate was unchanged at 1.1 per cent. The average of the Bank of Canada\u2019s three key core inflation measures was 1.6 per cent, versus 1.57 per cent in August. The core rate is the highest since JanuaryWhile the inflation rate remains below the central bank\u2019s target, the Bank of Canada has justified this year\u2019s rate hikes by citing quickly vanishing excess capacity in the economy and by claiming the forces keeping inflation subdued are temporary.Outside of gasoline however, the report showed inflation pressures remain muted in most sectors.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Steve Matthews", "title": "Trump's short list for Fed chair features these hawks and doves", "description": "Fed Chair Janet Yellen, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell and former Governor Kevin Warsh are among the possibilities", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trumps-short-list-for-fed-chair-features-these-hawks-and-doves", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/federal-reserve.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 5, 2017 1:39 PM EDT", "content": "Here\u2019s a look at the candidates President Donald Trump is considering over the next few weeks\u00a0to nominate as chairman of the Federal Reserve and where they stand on monetary policy.Trump has met with Fed Chair Janet Yellen, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell and\u00a0former Governor Kevin Warsh as he considers his choice to head the U.S. central bank, three people familiar with the discussions said last week.\u00a0Stanford University economist John Taylor is also on the list of recommendations put together by Trump\u2019s advisers. There\u2019s no clear front-runner and outlier candidates haven\u2019t been ruled out.Trump has said he expects to make a decision on the Fed-chair search this month. That\u2019ll kick off a months-long process of Senate confirmation before Yellen\u2019s current term expires in February.\u00a0Hawk or Dove?\u00a0Yellen, 71, has had a track record of keeping rates low over her four-year term. She has consistently supported gradually tightening policy and gradually unwinding the balance sheet. Yellen has been a \u201csuper-dove,\u201d though \u201csprouting a few hawk feathers,\u201d Amherst Pierpont Securities Chief Economist Stephen Stanley said.Last month, Yellen said it\u2019s uncertain exactly why inflation has been running below the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target \u2014 which it has mostly missed for the past five years. Weak inflation \u201cstrengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments\u201d in rates.Regulatory Views: Yellen has defended stricter banking rules introduced after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. \u201cAny adjustments to the regulatory framework should be modest,\u201d she said in August.Pros: Trump told the Wall Street Journal in July that he favors low rates, adding: Yellen has\u00a0\u201chistorically been a low-interest-rate person.\u201dCons: Yellen is a Democrat appointed by Barack Obama who\u2019s led the regulatory policies the Trump administration is seeking to change. She\u2019s an academic, while the administration has preferred installing business people into top positions.Hawk or Dove? From the little we know, Cohn would likely be at least as dovish as Yellen. In 2015 when Cohn was still president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., he questioned Yellen\u2019s plan to hike rates, saying she had \u201cno legitimate argument to raise rates without inflation being close to \u2014 or having some inkling that it\u2019s approaching \u2014 2 per cent.\u201d Cohn, 57, has criticized the Fed\u2019s move toward transparency, arguing in a March 2016 speech that the central banks\u2019 \u201cvery definitive forward guidance has gotten the markets very confused.\u201dRegulatory Views: In February, Cohn said rolling back regulations is a central priority\u00a0for the White House. \u201cWe need to deregulate and cut down the regulatory process to grow jobs in this country.\u201dPros: Cohn, who has helped lead the president\u2019s drive on a tax overhaul, would seem to meet Trump\u2019s twin goals of wanting low interest rates and pushing deregulation. Most Republican policy makers are more hawkish, by contrast.Cons: Cohn\u2019s prospects have dimmed after he publicly criticized remarks the president made in the wake of racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Cohn was at Goldman when the firm engaged in some of the era\u2019s most controversial trades, and he helped manage the firm\u2019s pre-crisis bet against the housing market. That background would be sure to be scrutinized in any congressional hearings.Hawk or Dove?\u00a0The Fed governor was rated as neutral on monetary policy by the Bloomberg Intelligence Fed Spectrometer. He\u2019s never dissented on the Federal Open Market Committee since taking office in 2012. A survey of 30 economists in March found he was slightly more dovish than average Fed central bankers.Powell, 64, in August presaged comments by Yellen that the softness in inflation this year was a \u201cmystery\u201d and said the low price readings allowed the Fed to be patient in raising interest rates. He also privately voiced skepticism of the third round of asset purchases \u2013 known as quantitative easing \u2013\u00a0launched in 2012, but ended up voting for the initiative championed by then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.Regulatory Views: Powell this month said he wants to preserve gains from post-crisis reforms, though \u201cwe can do it more efficiently. That\u2019s the process we are actively engaged in right now.\u201dPros: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin favors Powell, according to Politico. \u201cPowell has Republican credentials, knows the board and FOMC well\u201d and \u201chas impressed with his grasp of monetary economics,\u201d Deutsche Bank Chief Economist Peter Hooper wrote in a report.Cons: Powell\u2019s continuity might not be as appealing as a bigger Fed overhaul for the Trump administration. Powell \u201cappears to largely support\u201d the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that increased regulations in the financial industry, which conflicts with plans by this administration on scaling back rules, Capital Economics Chief U.S. Economist Paul Ashworth wrote in a report.Hawk or Dove?\u00a0The former Fed governor is among the most hawkish of the contenders. In January, Warsh said the Fed was close to achieving its goals of maximum employment and price stability. \u201cTell me again why interest rates seem to be so far away\u201d from the historical target,\u00a0Warsh\u00a0said.Warsh, 47, has said central bankers should be concerned about elevated asset prices. \u201cI see way too much complacency,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I see volatility measures in the stock market and bond market at historic lows, if I were a central banker, I wouldn\u2019t take comfort from that.\u201d As a Fed governor, he opposed the second round of quantitative easing, then voted to support the stimulus to provide a greater consensus behind Bernanke.Regulatory Views: He co-wrote a commentary in July supporting the Trump administration\u2019s plans for higher growth in part by reducing regulations. He has said Fed regulation \u201cnow micromanages big banks and effectively caps their rate of return.\u201dPros: His regulatory views fit closely to Trump\u2019s so he would be more likely to overhaul rules as opposed to fine-tuning them. While less dovish than Yellen, \u201cWarsh has never seemed doctrinaire on rates,\u201d said\u00a0Amherst Pierpont\u2019s Stanley. Warsh\u00a0also has a personal connection. He\u2019s married to Jane Lauder, daughter of Trump friend Ronald Lauder and a global brand president at the cosmetic company founded by her grandmother, Estee Lauder.Cons: He\u2019s the youngest and least experienced of the contenders. His concerns about inflation as a Fed governor have proven to be misplaced, as\u00a0inflation has undershot the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent goal. His candidacy has attracted opposition from left-leaning activists, particularly for his cheerleading prior to the financial crisis of Wall Street innovations.Hawk or Dove?\u00a0He\u2019s likely among the most hawkish of the contenders. Taylor created a widely cited rule for setting interest rates that\u2019s named after him. The 70-year-old has called for rules-based policies and argued the Fed has engaged in too much discretion. He\u2019s also argued the Fed\u2019s unconventional policies, including asset purchases, haven\u2019t work. \u201cThe Federal Reserve is a little behind the curve\u201d in raising rates, Taylor said in January.A strict adherence to the so-called Taylor Rule would have required the Fed to hold interest rates higher during most of Yellen\u2019s four-year term, though its policy prescription varies a lot depending on what assumptions are made about the economy\u2019s potential rate of growth.Regulatory Views: Taylor has argued less regulation is key to pro-growth policies. \u201cTo turn the economy around we need to take the muzzle off, and that means regulatory reform, tax reform, budget reform, and monetary reform,\u201d he wrote in his blog.Pros: Taylor has served in four presidential administrations. He was part of the Council of Economic Advisers under Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush. George W. Bush named him undersecretary for international affairs at the Treasury. His Taylor Rule has been widely quoted by leading central bankers including those at the Fed.Cons: \u201cThe various iterations of the Taylor policy rule almost certainly would mean higher rates,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence economists wrote in report. \u201cIf Trump wants to push for 3 per cent GDP growth, Taylor will almost certainly make the task all the more challenging.\u201dBloomberg"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Canada\u2019s GDP stall shows housing is becoming drag on the economy", "description": "Canada's surging economy took a pause in July, data showed today, ending an eight-month stretch of gains", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-gdp-unchanged-in-july-on-oil-slump-key-takeaways", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/house22.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 29, 2017 10:09 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s surging economy took a pause in July, amid slumping oil and automobile production, and as a slowing housing market curbed construction and banking.GDP was little changed, ending an eight-month stretch of gains for Canada\u2019s economy.

The above potential growth is soaking up all the remaining excess capacity in the economy, prompting the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates twice since July.Even with very little growth in August and September, Canada\u2019s economy would still probably be poised to grow at a rate of 2 per cent or more in the third quarter.Monthly growth has averaged 0.4 per cent in the previous eight months, the best stretch of growth since at least 2010.The figures seem to show the slump in housing has become a drag.

Instead, he hailed the merits of transfers to families, a tax cut to middle-income earners and infrastructure spending.\u201cI would say we\u2019re very much on track,\u201d Morneau said in a televised interview with Erik Schatzker from Bloomberg\u2019s Ottawa office. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a really positive trajectory, what we\u2019ve said to people is we\u2019re going to remain fiscally prudent, we\u2019re going to continue to lower the amount of debt as a function of our GDP.\u201dThe government\u2019s main fiscal objective will be to lower the debt-to-output ratio, he said. Deficits coming in less than initially projected are a testament to his administration\u2019s fiscal \u201cprudence,\u201d he added.Last fiscal year\u2019s deficit came in at about $18 billion \u2014 or more than $11 billion less than initially budgeted \u2014 and this year\u2019s $28.5 billion projected gap is poised to be below target by a similar magnitude. Canada\u2019s spending gap is less than 1 per cent of GDP, the lowest among the Group of Seven nations after Germany, Morneau said.The pick-up in economic growth poses a challenge for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals, who have put government spending at the forefront of their economic agenda. While a strong economy that has returned to full capacity is good news, it makes the case for deficits less compelling, since the spending threatens to crowd out other parts of the economy. The growth is already fueling a stronger dollar and higher interest rates.Morneau was bullish on the economy\u2019s ability to withstand the currency surge. Canada\u2019s dollar, known as the loonie, is up 8.9 per cent against the U.S. dollar this year, among the best performers for major currencies.\u201cThe current state of the dollar is a reflection of our positive economy, and that\u2019s something that we expect as a ramification of doing well,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cBut we think that we can continue to be successful with that level of the dollar. It will clearly mean that we\u2019ll have to continue to invest in productivity so that businesses are successful.\u201dMorneau signaled the nation\u2019s growth rate \u2014 which came in at 4.5 per cent annualized in the second quarter \u2014 can continue to be strong, despite some one-time factors that have contributed to the economy. He said a tax cut for those earning between roughly $45,000 to $90,000, and increased child-benefit payments, have injected money into the economy.\u201cWhile we can\u2019t argue exactly what the rate will be on a sustained basis, we\u2019ve done some things that have changed the trajectory,\u201d he said.One example of how the government is trying to improve the economy\u2019s long-term performance, while making the system more fair, is through proposed tax reforms aimed at high-income earners who incorporate to lower their tax bills, Morneau said. The measures have stirred outcry since being proposed in July.\u201cWe\u2019ve got some advantages that go only to a small subset of wealthy Canadians,\u201d he said, adding the government also wants to be sure the tax system creates incentives for \u201cpeople to invest in their active business.\u201dBank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has twice tightened monetary policy this year. Morneau said the rate hikes are \u201can expected outcome\u201d of a strong economy, with the two increases \u201cjust really taking off the reduction that was put in place by our central bank governor when we had really a significant decrease in oil prices.\u201d Nonetheless, he said rates remain at \u201cpretty historically low\u201d levels.\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be some headwinds, but things, as I say, they\u2019re positive right now and the increase in rates is a reflection of that positive economic situation,\u201d the finance minister said.Risks remain for the Canadian economy. At the same conference, economists warned record high consumer debt could undermine the nation\u2019s ability to recover. There are the negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement that could end badly. Trade tensions heightened late Tuesday after the U.S. Commerce Department imposed duties on Bombardier Inc. Rival Boeing Co. accused the Canadian company of selling jets at less than fair value.Aubrey Basdeo, head of Canadian fixed income at BlackRock, said at the conference that Canada is essentially running twin deficits \u2014 current account and budget \u2014 that could undermine investor confidence. He\u2019s disillusioned that the money is being spent on things that spur \u201cconspicuous\u201d consumption rather than long-term growth.Morneau acknowledged there\u2019s uncertainty in the outlook, but signaled it was all the more reason to spend rather than push to return to surplus.\u201cI\u2019m always going to worry and think about what risks might be around the corner,\u201d the minister said. \u201cBut the other part of the job is is to make sure we\u2019re doing the things that can enhance our long-term growth.\u201dThe country has a low total debt load relative to other countries, he said. \u201cHaving that great balance sheet is an advantage.\u201dMorneau will have a chance to pitch his economic vision \u2014 cash transfers to lower earners, higher taxes on higher earners and a focus on infrastructure spending \u2014 to his G-7 colleagues next year when Canada chairs the group of nations. He said his G-7 agenda will be \u201cvery aligned\u201d with his domestic one, including a focus on next-generation jobs.\u201cWe\u2019re going to think about how do we build an ability for countries to think about education and training and retraining,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cWhat are the approaches that we need to take to make sure that citizens feel engaged, and part of the work force, and part of the economy for the long-term?

The U.S. is slightly below average.There are a few factors that are closely associated with a high share of offshore wealth-to-GDP \u2013 proximity to Switzerland, the presence of national resources, and political and economic instability. That could be why the U.S. is slightly below the average, said economist Gabriel Zucman, one of the authors.Offshore wealth boosts inequality when it\u2019s factored into tax data, because it belongs mostly to the richest households. In the U.K., Spain, and France, about 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the wealth of the richest 0.01 per cent of households is held abroad. Russia\u2019s richest hold as much as 60 per cent of their wealth overseas. \u201cThe way that we measure inequality in economics, and the social sciences, is that we rely a lot on tax data,\u201d Zucman said. \u201cThere\u2019s the obvious problem that there is tax avoidance: if you only look at tax data there is risk that you\u2019re going to underestimate the true concentration of wealth.\u201dAlso worth noting: Hong Kong is rising as a destination for overseas cash, probably thanks to the rise of the super-rich in China and increased international pressure on more storied tax havens, like Switzerland.Who Owns the Wealth in Tax Havens?

The country\u2019s economy has turned out to be much stronger than anyone was predicting only a few months ago, giving policy makers scope to bring rates back up to more normal levels.The only debate is whether Governor Stephen Poloz will move at Wednesday\u2019s meeting or wait until October, and whether current projections for as many as three more rate increases by the end of 2018 are too conservative.Economists are primarily in the wait-a-month camp \u2014 only five of 26 surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the central bank to hike its 0.75 per cent benchmark rate this week.Investors are hedging, with traders assigning a 57 per cent chance of an increase.The main benefit of waiting until the October decision, which coincides with new quarterly forecasts and a press conference, is that it gives Poloz time to provide more direction to investors about how he sees the data, presumably to limit unnecessary market volatility. At Wednesday\u2019s decision, all investors get is a press release of about 300 words.\u201cWe expect to see a bit more of a hawkish tone in the September statement setting up October but from a communications perspective it favors an October move,\u201d said Brian DePratto, an economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.At the same time, Poloz already laid the groundwork for any future hikes at the July 12 rate decision, which was also accompanied by new forecasts and a press conference, by saying the next move would be \u201cguided by incoming data.\u201dWhich has been almost universally strong, including a GDP report last week that confirms the country is in the middle of its strongest growth spurt in more than a decade and eating into slack much more quickly than the Bank of Canada had anticipated only two months ago.Nor is it uncommon for the central bank to move at rate decisions that aren\u2019t accompanied by its so-called Monetary Policy Reports. Since the current format was instituted in 2002, 16 of the 37 rate moves have occurred in non-MPR rate decisions.Hawkish TurnIn a span of a few months, Poloz has gone from being seen as overly dovish, to one of the world\u2019s more hawkish central bankers.The Bank of Canada is now expected to move faster on interest rates than even the Federal Reserve. While futures trading implies the Bank of Canada will hike rates almost three times by the end of 2018, they are barely pricing in a full hike for its U.S. counterpart over the same stretch. Which explains why yields on two-year government bonds in Canada have surged in recent weeks and are now at about parity with the U.S.Canada is seen catching up with the U.S. on short-term rates by the end of 2018.Then again, there isn\u2019t much Poloz can do about the data. Few developed economies are growing as quickly as Canada. Quarterly growth has averaged 3.7 per cent over the past four quarters, compared to 2.2 per cent in the U.S. Economists are now projecting growth of above 3 per cent in Canada for all of 2017, a full percentage point above the U.S.Beating the U.S. by a full percentage point or more has happened only five times since 1980.Smoking GunWhile there are plenty of reasons to conclude rate hikes are in store for Canada, it\u2019s tougher to see the country\u2019s central banks getting far ahead of the Federal Reserve.Canada has made up much of the ground it lost to the U.S. recovery after oil price collapsed in 2014, but there\u2019s still some way to go. Since the end of 2013, U.S. growth has averaged about 2.2 per cent versus 1.9 per cent in Canada. That plays into the idea that the U.S. cycle is more advanced than Canada\u2019s \u2014 as Poloz had been known to emphasize until recently.Further, there\u2019s no sign of significant inflation pressure, and the Bank of Canada is an inflation targeting central bank.\u201cThey have the luxury of waiting until October simply because they don\u2019t have the smoking gun of inflation,\u201d said Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada.Plus, policy makers will want to limit any further gains in the Canadian dollar, which is up almost 9 per cent since early June when the central bank first adopted a tightening bias.That ties in closely with concern about the sustainability of the recovery, which has relied heavily on consumers and housing. Since the start of 2014, consumption and residential investment has accounted for 90 per cent of all growth.Over the last four quarters, that\u2019s come down to about 62 per cent, close to the historical average, on the back of business spending on investment and inventories that\u2019s already much stronger than usual and will probably slow. The last thing businesses need is an even stronger Canadian dollar.Longer RecordAlong with the GDP data last week, Statistics Canada released a methodically consistent revision of national accounts that allowed it to provide comparable data going back an additional 20 years, to 1961 instead of 1981.The revisions showed that in the first half of 2017, household consumption and residential investment combined totalled 64.3 per cent as the share of the total economy, a record. The average since 1961 has been 59 per cent.This provides possibly the strongest argument for why policy makers should be cautious when it comes to raising rates: it\u2019s not exactly clear how the Canadian economy will react, since it\u2019s all unprecedented. Borrowing costs have never been this low, Canadians have never been as indebted and the nation\u2019s economy has never been so reliant on consumption and housing.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Seven top takeaways from the best GDP data Canadians have seen in many a year", "description": "Canada\u2019s growth beats the G7 amid the biggest binge in household spending since the last recession", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-economy-surges-4-5-on-consumer-spending-key-takeaways", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cheer2.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 31, 2017 2:29 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy unexpectedly accelerated in the second quarter to a Group of Seven-beating 4.5 per cent annualized pace amid the biggest binge in household spending since the last recession.Economists had anticipated a 3.7 per cent pace, matching the first quarter rate that was left unchanged Thursday by Statistics Canada. The better-than-expected result was due to stronger consumption growth than economists had predicted.The surge in growth should help cement the chances the Bank of Canada will continue raising interest rates in coming months as the nation\u2019s economy nears full capacity. The central bank forecast in July spare capacity would be eliminated by the end of this year, and that was with second quarter growth forecasts of 3 per cent.Canada\u2019s economy also grew at a more-than-expected 0.3 per cent pace in June, on the back of higher construction.\u2022 Canada\u2019s consumers, benefiting from a buoyant jobs market and rising home values, are on a tear. Household consumption rose at an annualized 4.6 per cent pace in the second quarter, following a 4.8 per cent gain in the second quarter. That\u2019s the best two-quarter gain since before the 2008 recession.\u2022 It\u2019s a tale of two industries for Canada\u2019s housing market. Residential construction was little changed with repair and renovation work posting stronger gains but overall residential investment figures were hurt by slumping activity in the resale market. Total investment in residential structures fell at an annualized 4.7 per cent pace due to a sharp decline in the so-called ownership transfer costs associated with real estate transactions(down an annualized 24.1 per cent)\u2022 The broad-based nature of the expansion \u2014 which the Bank of Canada has been highlighting in recent months as a justification for higher rates \u2014 continued in the second quarter. All major components of growth except for residential investment increases \u2022 Another positive was the big jump in inventories in the second quarter wasn\u2019t reversed in the second quarter. Inventories were up, adding 0.1 percentage points to growth in the quarter. Business investment grew for a second straight quarter, something that hasn\u2019t happened since 2014. The back- to-back annualized gains were 7.1 per cent in the second quarter and 13.7 per cent in the first quarter. That\u2019s the strongest two-month gain since 2012\u2022 More positives: The pick-up in consumption was financed by gains in disposable income, not a lower savings rate. In fact, the household savings rate increased to 4.6 per cent in the second quarter from 4.3 per cent. The national savings rate fell to 3.4 per cent from 4 per cent on less saving by corporations and borrowing from governments \u2022 Exports delivered. A surge in oil production helped fuel an annualized 9.6 per cent gain in exports of goods and services, the fastest gain since the first half of 2014, outpacing the 7.4 per cent gain in imports \u2022 The second quarter gain is the strongest since 2011. Canada\u2019s economic growth over the past two quarters was the best first half for the economy since 2002.Avery Shenfeld, CIBC chief economistCanada\u2019s second quarter let the good times roll, so much so that the country\u2019s national humility has almost everyone assuming that this can\u2019t last. The 4.5% pace for real GDP in the quarter handily topped consensus, as did the 0.3% monthly advance for June. That has the economy up 4.3% from a year ago, a result flattered a bit by the depressing impact of Alberta wildfire\u2019s in the prior year. Other than housing and a return to a more typical inventory pace just about every source of demand did well, with final domestic demand up 3.5% and a nice contribution from net exports. A big gain in construction was the surprise within in the June data, although that was helped by the end of a Quebec strike. A rise in the savings rate and good compensation will leave more room for consumer spending in Q3. Look for estimates for that quarter to move up. Odds of a September rate hike by the Bank of Canada are certainly enhanced by this report.Douglas Porter, BMO chief economist Bottom Line: Even the naysayers will struggle mightily to find fault in this rock-solid report. Growth was very well balanced in the quarter, easily riding over the start of a cooldown in housing, and the sturdy June figure suggests some of the momentum was maintained heading into Q3. In what has become almost a seemingly monthly ritual in 2017, we are nudging up our call on Canadian GDP growth yet again to 3.1% for the year and 2.5% for Q3 \u2014 and would readily allow that there is some upside risk. While still-low core inflation and a stronger Canadian dollar give the BoC room to be patient and deliberate (i.e. unlikely to move next week), we do believe that this suite of robust numbers all but locks in another rate hike this year \u2014 and we suspect that is the message they will send quite clearly at next week\u2019s decision.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Canada this week could break its longest streak of low growth since 1926", "description": "We find out this week whether the Canadian economy has entered rarefied territory", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/record-span-of-sub-3-growth-nearing-an-end-canada-eco-watch", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/0501manufacturing.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 29, 2017 12:02 PM EDT", "content": "Statistics Canada reports growth data on Thursday that will confirm the nation\u2019s economy has entered rarefied territory.Economists are forecasting an expansion in second-quarter gross domestic product at about the same 3.7 per cent pace recorded in the first three months of this year. Even with an anticipated second-half slowdown, that should leave Canada flirting with 3 per cent growth for all of 2017.If that happens, it would end a five-year stretch of sub-3 per cent growth that\u2019s already tied as the longest on record in data going back to 1926. The nation is benefiting from a confluence of developments that include a synchronized global recovery and rising trade volumes, the bottoming of the oil shock in western Canada, federal deficit spending, rising industrial production in developed economies and soaring home prices in Toronto and Vancouver.The surprise surge in activity over the past year is having one lasting impact: it will eliminate fully Canada\u2019s existing economic slack in coming months, if it hasn\u2019t already. That would be quite a milestone. According to Bank of Canada estimates, the economy has been in a state of excess capacity for 35 straight quarters.The mix of no slack with low potential growth means interest-rate increases are almost certainly in the cards even at very low growth rates since it won\u2019t take much to push the economy into excess demand, according to Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia.The Bank of Canada estimates the nation\u2019s economy can\u2019t grow much beyond 1.4 per cent before fuelling inflation. In other words, Canada may be entering an era of slow growth and rising interest rates, which is not exactly a dream scenario for policy makers.\u201cThere is no way around it,\u201d said Perrault, \u201cTwo per cent is not high compared to history, but it is compared to trend.\u201dIn addition, fiscal stimulus may no longer be needed in an economy with no slack and low potential growth as it can accelerate rate increases and crowd out private players.That doesn\u2019t mean arguments can\u2019t be made for bigger government. There could be an argument for financing productivity-enhancing infrastructure or redistributing income more fairly. More government debt and less private debt is also probably more stable in a world with record household debt and relatively low government borrowings.But the tradeoffs to deficits are becoming more stark.\u201cThe fact that you are running expansionary fiscal policy at a time when growth is as strong as it is, clearly you will have higher interest rates than you would otherwise have,\u201d Perrault said.In some ways, the latest growth spurt merely serves to highlight how sluggish Canada\u2019s economy has become in recent years.No one predicted the bump up in growth, in large part because no one expected Canada\u2019s highly indebted consumers would have the capacity to continue to press on the accelerator. But they did.Growth in consumption \u2014 which accounts for about 57 per cent of real GDP \u2014 is forecast to surpass 3 per cent in 2017, the first time that\u2019s happened since 2010. In a January survey of economists, the highest estimate for consumption growth was 2.2 per cent, with a median forecast of 1.9 per cent.There are two main reasons for the better-than-expected numbers.One, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s fiscal policy has clearly had an impact, particularly tax cuts and enhanced child benefits that came into effect last year. More significant may be a surge in home prices and housing wealth in Toronto and Vancouver that\u2019s prompting households to ramp up spending. The value of residential real estate in Canada jumped by $384 billion in the year through March, Statistics Canada reported earlier this year.Neither factor is seen as a sustainable source of growth, and a payback effect is expected in coming years. Economists estimate household spending growth will fall back below 2 per cent by 2018, which is a slower pace than the overall economy \u2014 a rare occurrence. Consumption has only lagged the economy once in the past 15 years.That will likely mean the Canadian economy\u2019s moment in the sun will be brief. Economists are already forecasting a sharp decline is already under way this quarter and the central bank expects growth will fall back quickly to about 2 per cent levels next year, bringing it closer in line with longer-term fundamentals that are hobbled by an aging labor force and falling productivity.Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said that residential investment and the wealth impact of housing have been accounting for about half a percentage point of growth.\u201cA good chunk of it has been tied to house prices,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cOur best guess that starts to roll off in the second half of this year.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Don't be smug, ETF investors.

Academics and financial pundits\u00a0have posited that index investing may be pushing up consumer prices, though there are also critics who are skeptical that it kills competition. But if your concern about index investing starts and ends with the notion that some fund managers will lose their jobs, that you might have to pay slightly more for an airline seat, and that it\u2019s a small price to pay for lower fees in your 401(k), your conclusion might be incredibly wrong.The rising stock market, and the fact that index funds have beaten every variety of their active rivals, could be blinding investors to increasing damage that indexing is already doing, and could still do, to the market and the economy. The real concern is not just that actively managed funds could disappear but that the entire market could be left for dead.Earlier this summer,\u00a0another media outlet published a popular\u00a0and debated\u00a0article on the complete calamity that could happen if climate change continues on its current path.\u00a0So, given that these are the dog days of summer and that even a CEO-led revolt against President Donald Trump can\u2019t shake the market,\u00a0we decided to give passive investing the worst-case scenario treatment.Like climate change, the forces driving investors to passive investing may be too far along to turn back. The velocity toward index-driven dystopia appears to be increasing.Indexing has, of course, been around awhile. Nonetheless, earlier this summer, this statistic from a Bank of America report seemed to catch many\u00a0by surprise: Funds run by Vanguard, the giant index fund company, now own at least 5 per cent of 490 of the S&P 500 companies, up from just 115 seven years ago.The same report said that passively managed assets as a percentage of all managed assets had risen to 37 per cent. Soon afterward, a report from Deutsche Bank predicted that half of all assets would be passively managed by 2021. While the\u00a0reports inflated the figures by looking at mutual fund assets instead of all assets invested in the U.S. market, what is striking is that at 19 per cent \u2014 the total amount of the U.S. stock market owned in index funds or ETFs at the end of July, according to data from Morningstar and Gadfly calculations \u2014 the effects of passively managed funds are already being felt. Imagine when it actually gets to 37 per cent, or 50 per cent.The Stock Market Could Get a Lot RiskierPassive investing, which was supposed to make it easier for the set-it-and-forget-it set, could\u00a0make the market intolerable, especially for individuals. The idea of investing in a diversified portfolio is that you get a basket of stocks. When some are expensive, others are cheap, and that can offer protection when the\u00a0stock market drops.\u00a0Index funds, though, are pushing up the value of all stocks, leaving few safe havens.At the height of the dot-com bubble, for instance, when the most expensive stocks in the market, mostly tech\u00a0shares, were trading at 50 times earnings, the cheapest stocks by quintile were trading at less than 8 times earnings. The market\u2019s cheapest 20 per cent of stocks are now trading at nearly 11 times earnings and becoming more expensive.But the real problem will be volatility. A few years ago, some investors used to joke that if the market was totally passive, not only would there be no volatility, there would be no stock movement, at least not for individual stocks. The market would move in lockstep\u00a0when people bought or sold an index fund.\u00a0But that\u2019s not how it\u2019s playing out, or likely will. The Bank of America report on indexing last month pointed out that while the market overall seems smooth at the moment, there has been a recent spike in the volatility of stocks that are owned largely by ETFs and index funds, probably because of liquidity.Even small trades could cause bigger price swingsWith fewer shares to trade, once more are locked up in ETFs and index funds, even small trades could cause bigger price swings. In the six months ending in May, Bank of America found that the average volatility of the 100 most passively owned stocks\u00a0tripled to 45 per cent above the rest of the market.The CBOE Volatility Index has averaged 20.5 over the past decade. If it were 45 per cent higher, that would bring it to nearly 30, or 20 per cent higher than where it was at the peak of last year\u2019s high-yield debt concerns and not much lower than where it was during much of the worries about European debt in 2012. And that would be the average level of volatility based on a market where just 20 per cent of all equity is indexed. The VIX traded as high as 80 during the financial crisis, which means already at times of stress the VIX, which is called the market\u2019s fear gauge, could get up to 120, or about 10 times where it is now.Income Equality Income inequality is already a problem in America. Index funds are making it worse. A study published last year by the European Corporate Governance Institute examined the compensation of the top five highest paid executives for each company in the S&P 1,500 plus 500 other public companies. It found that executives at companies in industries with high common ownership were paid 25 per cent more than executives in industries with lower levels. What\u2019s more, CEOs received most of the excess pay gains. After controlling for other factors, the study found that CEO pay tends to jump 10 times as much as the pay of the other top executives after a rise in passive ownership.The compensation study also found that as index fund ownership of a company rose,\u00a0the pay of top executives was more closely tied to the performance of the industry\u00a0than that of their own company. The higher the level of passive ownership, the study found, the more a\u00a0sort of reverse competition started to dominate an industry.\u00a0The\u00a0fallout:\u00a0If the market were mostly index-owned, executives might actively work to help their rivals, at least\u00a0if they wanted to see their paychecks grow.\u00a0According to the Economic Policy Institute, the current ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay is 271 to 1. If index funds come to dominate the market, CEOs could soon make $338,000 for every $1,000 paid to the average employee.Innovation Competition is what academics worry about when they worry about passive investing. Traditionally, preserving competition was mostly about maintaining a certain number of companies in every industry. Federal antitrust laws block monopolies. But academic studies have shown recently that index funds or horizontal ownership, where the same investors own a good percentage of the shares in rival companies, can also stifle competition.Horizontal ownership has risen sharply in the past decade and a half. For a large company, the chance that at least one of its large shareholders owns shares in a rival has risen to 90 per cent, up from just 16 per cent in 2000. And the more horizontal ownership there is, it appears, the less competitive a company, and an industry, becomes. In 2014, two economic consultants, Jose Azar and Isabel Tacu, and a Michigan economics professor, Martin Schmaltz, found that in the airline industry, where common ownership had risen to 70 per cent, prices were as much as 12 per cent higher because of common shareholders.But the bigger problem is not prices but innovation. If CEOs have an incentive not to compete, then they might not try all that hard to innovate, spending less on research and development. Indeed, R&D spending has slumped since the 2008 financial crisis. Late last year, a study by a New York University professor, Thomas Philippon, and a graduate student, German Gutierrez, examined the reasons R&D spending has been weaker than expected since at least 2002 but plunged after the Great Recession.They found only three factors that at least mathematically appeared to correlate with the drop in R&D. One was an increase in index investors.The effect on investing, and the economy in general, is immense. At roughly 20 per cent of the market, passive investing, by Philippon and Gutierrez\u2019s calculations, at least in part, could be holding down corporate investment by $125 billion a year. If passive investing were to reach 50 per cent, the amount could drop by $328 billion a year, which is equal to about 2 per cent of U.S. GDP. Remember when the economy used to grow by 4 per cent? Indexing could be a big part of the reason it no longer is. A Disappearing Market Initial public offerings have long been a cornerstone of what drives American capitalism, allowing companies to become bigger. But bankers at some of the top underwriters have expressed concerns that if the passive trend continues, IPOs could become a thing of the past. That opinion could be in part be perspective: Investment bankers who sell IPOs rarely come in contact with index fund managers. Without active fund managers, IPO bankers would have no investors to market to or figure out how to price an offering.But you can imagine an IPO market that is dominated by IPO index funds. Bankers might like that \u2014 no need to market deals because the IPO funds have to buy no matter what. Pricing, however, would most likely become a function of the amount of money in IPO index funds and their rules, and without any mechanism for rewarding the individual value of a business, there might not be many who want to do an offering.There are no US$17 trillion economies, or even close to it, that exist without a public marketThat might already be starting. The number of IPOs has plunged recently, which is odd given that the stock market in general, and tech stocks in particular, have been hitting new highs. Usually that would result in a good IPO market. The fact that 20 per cent of the market is now owned by indexes, perhaps drawing money away from mutual funds and other institutional investors that would put money in IPOs, could be playing a role.IPOs And it\u2019s not just the IPO market that is being deserted. The number of public companies has been falling, too. And the general worry is about the stocks left behind. Demand is shrinking for companies that are not in an index. And as the shares of those companies stop reflecting what executives think is the value of their companies, the executives may abandon the public market, choosing to go private or get bought.But it\u2019s not just the left-behind stocks. Even companies in index funds may soon start to believe their stock prices no longer reflect their value despite good earnings or a new product. Those companies might abandon the public market as well. Eventually, as the index doomsayers suggest, there could be either very few, or no, public companies.And then you have to worry about the U.S. economy in general. There are no US$17 trillion economies, or even close to it, that exist without a public market. Perhaps indexing, and the growth of the private market, and private equity funds, and the still very liquid bond market, will morph the U.S. finance market into something that can support the world\u2019s largest economy without a public stock market that is neither well used or loved. But at the very least, if indexing continues the way it has, we are likely to see a much different financial landscape then we do now, and fast.Stephen Gandel is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering equity markets.

Energy stocks account for 20 per cent of the benchmark\u2019s weight.However, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Canadian investors. Of the 143 index members that have reported second-quarter earnings, 64 per cent have beat analyst estimates and 30 per cent have missed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This is a significant improvement from the first quarter, when 49 per cent beat and 43 per cent missed, and an indication that corporate fundamentals are improving.\u201cInvestors are finally going to come to grips with Canadian growth and earnings growth is a little bit better than everybody thought so that\u2019s where you can get more upside,\u201d Belski said.An upbeat earnings season hasn\u2019t had much impact on valuations yet. The gap in forward price-to-earnings between the S&P/TSX and the S&P 500 Index is the biggest it\u2019s been since 2008. Several strategists and investors say a gap this big can\u2019t last and will either be narrowed by declines in the U.S. or gains in Canada.\u201cThere\u2019s a good case to be made for the bout of serious underperformance in Canada to subside,\u201d Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.Any recovery in the S&P/TSX will need energy stocks behind it, given their importance to the benchmark. Although there are plenty of unknowns for oil prices \u2014 including OPEC\u2019s commitment to production cuts and U.S. shale producers\u2019 ability to fill the gap \u2014 there are also signals that investors are getting more bullish on energy.Traders invested $42 million in the iShares S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF in July, the biggest exchange traded fund tracking Canada\u2019s energy index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That inflow was the largest since September 2016, a month when oil prices rose 7.9 per cent and energy stocks gained 3.5 per cent.Canadian oil producers are also more resilient than they were before the downturn following significant cost-cutting efforts. Meanwhile, the price discount between Western Canada Select and WTI has narrowed to about $10, the smallest in more than two years and down from a high of more than $40 a barrel in 2013 \u2014 another positive sign for the Canadian oil patch.\u00a0A rebound in Canadian stocks also won\u2019t get far without the help of financials, which account for 34 per cent of the S&P/TSX. Financials have lost 0.5 per cent this year as concern about overheated housing markets weighed on shares of the big banks.Belski said that will change as investors look for dividend growth as an alternative to bonds in a rising-rate environment. Canada\u2019s five largest banks have averaged dividend growth of 64 per cent since 2008 compared with 32 per cent for the five top utilities stocks on the S&P/TSX over the same period.\u201cWe still believe that most investors are under-exposed financials,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the next three to five years in equity investing around the world, one of the biggest secular themes is going to be dividend growth and Canadian financials are among the best dividend growers in the world.\u201dJohn Aiken, financials analyst at Barclays Capital, said he expects bank valuations to continue to rise in the back half of the year as stocks are buoyed by a steady domestic economy, the strongest employment landscape since the financial crisis and rising interest rates, which will boost net interest margins.\u201cFurther, we believe strengthening commodity prices, most notably WTI, could be the fuel that drives further upside to bank valuations,\u201d Aiken wrote.Not everyone is bullish on Canadian equities. David Doyle, market strategist at Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. called Canada, its equity market and the loonie \u201cmaximum underweights\u201d in a recent note, citing the Bank of Canada\u2019s recent interest-rate hike.\u201cEven a modest rate-hike cycle introduces downside risks to our base case for a prolonged period of subdued 1 per cent real GDP growth,\u201d Doyle wrote. \u201cA \u2018made in Canada\u2019 recession has moved from being an interesting outlier scenario to worthy of serious consideration.\u201dAnd a new wrinkle has presented itself in growing tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, which pushed Canadian stocks to their biggest weekly decline since June.But the economy\u2019s growth of well over 3 per cent in the first half of 2017 \u2014 the fastest among the Group of Seven \u2014 will give equities the chance to climb out of the doldrums, Belski said. He has a 16,000 target on the S&P/TSX, which would be up 6.4 per cent from Friday\u2019s close.\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to see is an improving Canadian economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a nice opportunity for a game of catch-up in Canadian stocks, especially considering that U.S. stocks are sitting near all-time highs.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Home building is booming in Canada", "description": "A report Wednesday showed building permits unexpectedly rose 2.5 percent in June to the second-highest level on record", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/home-building-is-booming-in-canada", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/housing.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 9, 2017 10:21 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian home construction is on pace for its best year since the 2008-2009 recession, with builders showing no sign of being slowed by rising interest rates or fears of a housing correction.Work began on an annualized 222,324 homes in July, the third-fastest monthly pace since 2012, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp. reported Wednesday.

Permits for single-family residences fell 12.5 percent in June from the previous month, while for multiple-unit residences they increased 12.5 percent.For starts, the gain in July was led by a jump in new multiple-unit construction in the country\u2019s three largest urban centers: Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. New multiple-unit construction was up 9 percent to an annualized 145,543 units in July.

The officials, speaking anonymously because they\u2019re not authorized to comment, are concerned a series of rate hikes would lead consumers to claw back spending, stunting a recovery from a two-year oil shock.While Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau have steadfastly declined to comment on monetary policy, as is customary, some officials privately think Poloz hiked too soon. The concern comes amid global warnings that an era of rock-bottom interest rates has left consumers and countries alike over-leveraged and more vulnerable than ever to hikes.There\u2019s no sign the government will intervene publicly in any way. The discontent, however, signals Trudeau and Morneau also don\u2019t plan to rein in a spending program, focused on infrastructure and payments to families, that\u2019s projected to result in deficits totalling $102 billion over the Liberal government\u2019s first four fiscal years.\u201cI do not comment on the Bank\u2019s independent decision,\u201d Morneau said in a statement this week. The government has \u201cmore work to do,\u201d he said, hinting at unease with the current recovery. \u201cAs we look at our next steps, it\u2019s clear we will move forward by continuing with an approach that\u2019s working, always with a strong middle class and long-term economic growth as our goals.\u201dRebecca Ryall, a spokeswoman for the Bank of Canada, declined to comment.Household debt is at unprecedented levels in an economy that has relied mostly on consumer spending for growth since the 2008-09 recession. The central bank decided July 12 to raise borrowing costs against a backdrop of broadening disinflation that seemed to argue against such a move.Household spending contributed 2.4 percentage points of the 3.7 per cent gross domestic product growth in the first quarter. That\u2019s the largest contribution made by households since 2010.In announcing the rate increase, policy makers said an acceleration in growth, and its broadening to more sectors and regions, has increased \u201cconfidence\u201d the economy will continue to absorb excess capacity. The central bank estimates the economy will return to full capacity by the end of this year.Red InkEconomists expect the deficit to shrink as the economy kicks into high gear, and one official said the government also expects higher revenues to narrow the gap. However, calls have surfaced for Trudeau to begin balancing the books now that Canada leads the Group of Seven in GDP growth.While Morneau has avoided commenting on the rate hike, he praises the growth that made it possible, which can be partly attributed to the government\u2019s fiscal measures. \u201cThe fact that the economy is going well is a positive,\u201d Morneau said at a July 18 press conference, where he acknowledged rising interest rates could slow consumer spending. \u201cThe changes in behavior would largely be around new purchases. That would be the most significant impact I would expect.\u201dA spokesman for Trudeau declined to comment on monetary policy.Trudeau faces potential political fallout from any hike. Canada\u2019s most indebted households overlap demographically with his base of support \u2014 higher debt servicing costs spell trouble for the poster-family of Trudeau\u2019s first budget \u2014and polling has shown Canadians aren\u2019t immediately feeling the boom.Indebted FamiliesThat all underpins the officials\u2019 concern. Canadians are uncharacteristically vulnerable to increases in rates because of high levels of debt, the officials said. Complicating forecasts is that an entire generation of young adults has grown up with the belief that money is essentially free to borrow and won\u2019t adjust quickly enough, they said.The scale of concern varies among the officials, who acknowledge Poloz may yet be proven right. If Canada is entering a sustained expansion, then growth will more than account for rising rates.However, if Poloz\u2019s timing is wrong and the hike triggers a pullback in consumer spending, Canada\u2019s economy will be in trouble, the officials said. Low inflation and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar further indicate Poloz might have started a policy action that wasn\u2019t needed, one official said.Another wrinkle is the outlook for Alberta, the hub of Canada\u2019s energy sector, where a recovery was seen as the final domino that led to a rate hike. However, persistently low crude prices and a rising currency \u2014driven in part by Poloz\u2019s rate increase \u2014are a recipe for another slowdown in an oil sector whose revenues are largely derived in U.S. dollars, the officials said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Top takeaways from Bank of Canada's decision to hike rates today", "description": "With the hike, Canada becomes the first G7 nation to join the U.S. in raising rates, fuelling speculation the world\u2019s central bankers are heading into a tightening cycle", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-raises-benchmark-rate-to-0-75-key-takeaways?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/stephen-poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 12, 2017 1:47 PM EDT", "content": "The Bank of Canada raised interest rates for the first time since 2010, citing a recent acceleration of growth that it predicts will eliminate fully the economy\u2019s economic slack by the end of this year.The central bank\u2019s benchmark rate was raised to 0.75 per cent, from 0.5 per cent, at a rate decision Wednesday. It said future rate moves will be \u201cguided\u201d by the data, while downplaying recent sluggishness in inflation.With the hike, Canada becomes the first Group of Seven country to join the U.S. in raising interest rates on Wednesday, potentially fueling speculation the world\u2019s central bankers are heading into a tightening cycle.\u2014 The Bank of Canada said recent data has increased its \u201cconfidence\u201d the economy will continue to grow above potential, meaning excess capacity is being absorbed. The central bank estimates the economy will return to full capacity by the end of 2017. In April, it had predicted the closing of the output gap in the first half of 2018. The bank estimates the degree of excess capacity in the second quarter of this year is between zero and 1 per cent of GDP \u2014 The central bank downplayed recent weakness in inflation, judging the sluggishness as \u201cmostly temporary.\u201d It predicted inflation will return \u201cclose to\u201d its target of 2 per cent by the middle of 2018 \u2014 which is later than it had predicted in April. It gave a nod to the sluggishness by saying the overnight rate will be guided by its inflation outlook \u2014 There was no reference to the 2015 rate cuts. One of the big questions investors had ahead of the rate decision was whether the central bank\u2019s focus was the 50 basis points of cuts implemented in 2015. Just last month, Governor Stephen Poloz said that what the recovery \u201csuggests to us is that the interest rate cuts that we put in place in 2015 have largely done their work.\u201d The statement did say the adjustment to lower oil prices is largely completeCanada is in the midst of one of its strongest growth spurts since the 2008-2009 recession, with the expansion accelerating to an above-3 per cent pace over the past four quarters. That\u2019s the fastest among Group of Seven countries and double what the central bank considers Canada\u2019s capacity to grow without fueling inflation.Investors are looking at the decision as a possible harbinger of things to come globally and are monitoring it for clues on the central bank\u2019s resolve for withdrawing stimulus, with the prospect of central bank tightening has triggered a selloff in government bond markets over the last two weeks.\u2014 The central bank cites broadening of Canadian growth across industries and regions as one reason for its confidence in sustainability of expansion \u2014 The Bank of Canada cites broadening growth across countries as well \u2014 The central bank estimates GDP growth of 2.8 per cent in 2017, versus an April forecast of 2.6 per cent. Growth in 2018 is estimated at 2 per cent, and 1.6 per cent in 2019 \u2014 The better than expected growth in 2017 is largely being driven by household spending, which is contributing 1.9 per centage points to the growth rate.
