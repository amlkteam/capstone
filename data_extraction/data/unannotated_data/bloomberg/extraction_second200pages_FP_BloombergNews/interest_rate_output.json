Since then, they\u2019ve been little changed even as market transactions have fallen sharply.To be sure, risks remain. Young home buyers have never faced anything other than historically low mortgage rates and many will have to refinance over the next few years, while policy makers remain concerned about a cluster of highly indebted borrowers.Growing signs of a sustainable housing market allow the Bank of Canada to keep moving ahead with modest interest-rate increases in an economy that\u2019s otherwise at full capacity. Government officials can also hold back on new interventions that could spook households.\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re settling into this environment in Canada where price growth is going to be flat in real terms,\u201d something that hasn\u2019t happened outside of a recession since the 1990s, Bank of Montreal Senior Economist Robert Kavcic said by phone from Toronto.Prices and sales showed modest gains or losses for October in reports Thursday from the Canadian Real Estate Association and from the Teranet land registry. That\u2019s a switch from most of the last year where they swung in response to tougher mortgage qualification rules and the first interest-rate hiking cycle from the central bank in almost a decade.Home sales held close to their 10-year average after falling for a second month in October, the realtor group said. Benchmark prices rose 2.3 per cent from a year earlier, and gains in Vancouver and Toronto were close to the national average.Canada would stand out if it comes through its housing boom without a crash like those seen in the U.S., the U.K. or Spain. \u201cOverall, yes the medicine is working,\u201d Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a phone interview.\u201cWe are reaching some sort of landing, how soft it will be I don\u2019t know, but we aren\u2019t in a free-fall by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Tal said.Even with the latest figures showing stability, it could take years to unwind the imbalances that have built up. The rise of the million-dollar home in some of Canada\u2019s biggest cities has also created affordability challenges for buyers as builders struggle to offer new supply.\u201cIts absolutely fair to say the Canadian housing market is off the boil,\u201d Lascelles said, adding a note of caution: \u201cThere is no pre-ordained conclusion here.\u201dWith assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "Ontario sharpens axe as it readies plan to cut mounting $15-billion deficit", "description": "Ontario has the world's largest largest pile of sub-sovereign debt, clocking in at $338 billion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/ontario-sharpens-axe-as-it-readies-plan-to-cut-mounting-deficit", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/ontario.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 15, 2018 9:43 AM EST", "content": "Investors will be watching for hints as how Ontario plans to start tackling the world\u2019s largest largest pile of sub-sovereign debt when the Canadian province gives a snapshot of its finances on Thursday.Finance Minister Victor Fedeli will unveil the new government\u2019s economic and fiscal outlook in the provincial legislature starting at about 1:15 p.m. While not an official budget, the document will outline the government\u2019s initial assessment of a province that\u2019s growing moderately while steadily racking up debt.Ontario\u2019s deficit is poised to reach about $15 billion (US$11 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, more than double the previous government\u2019s forecast, while net debt stands at about $338 billion, the highest of any sub-sovereign borrower rated by Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\u201cGiven that the new government stands for good management, I would expect them to address the deficit as a priority,\u201d Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI would expect a significant reduction of the deficit fairly early in its mandate.\u201dPremier Doug Ford has committed to balancing the books over time and has already begun to rein in spending, scrapping a pilot basic income program and capping social assistance. Together with other measures, that could save $2 billion this year, according to report from Toronto-Dominion Bank last week. Allowing other programs to lapse could save another $1 billion while freezing a minimum wage hike may support employment and boost revenues, the bank said.But the Progressive Conservative government, which swept to power in June, also made some costly campaign pledges which could push the budget shortfall to as high as $18.7 billion in 2019-20, according to TD. Those promises included a cut to corporate and personal income taxes and reduction in the gas tax.\u201cHow this is going to line up with the campaign promise to balance is going to be interesting,\u201d said Joey Mack, Toronto-based director of fixed income at GMP Securities LP. \u201cBut given all the announcements pointing to huge deficits, I don\u2019t think we will get too much reaction\u201d if the deficit stays below $18 billion, he said.Ontario is expected to grow at about 2 per cent this year and 1.9 per cent next year according economists\u2019 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.Ontario bonds have declined 1.5 per cent this year, trailing the 1.3 per cent drop for Quebec and 1.1 per cent for the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch bond index of provincial borrowers. Investors in Ontario\u2019s 2.9 per cent bonds due 20128 demand about 67 basis points over similar duration federal Canada debt, according to bid prices in Bloomberg.While risk premiums aren\u2019t a source of big concern, the absolute yields are rising as the Bank of Canada and other central banks around the world increase interest rates to cool inflationary pressures. Since the end of June, when Ford took office, the yield investors demand to hold province\u2019s debt maturing between three months and five years have increased between 40 and 50 basis points, Bloomberg data show.\u201cAn interest rate increase of 25 basis points will cost Ontario taxpayers an additional $100 million a year in interest payments,\u201d Fedeli wrote in a Nov. 1 opinion column for the Toronto Sun. \u201cFor the government of Ontario, interest rate increases pose a significant challenge.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Housing jitters fade as Canadians turn optimistic they\u2019ll see higher property values over next six months", "description": "The level of optimism about price gains is now pushing well past the average over the last five years, a Nanos Research poll shows", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/housing-jitters-subside-in-canada-amid-rising-optimism-on-prices?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 12, 2018 12:40 PM EST", "content": "Canadians seem to have gotten over their recent housing scare.Polling data from Nanos Research shows 44.2 per cent of respondents now expect the value of real estate in their neighbourhoods to increase over the next half year.

Inflation expectations, which have slipped slightly in recent weeks according to some measures, were described as \u201clittle changed, on balance,\u201d the same as in the last statement.By keeping the door open to a fourth 2018 hike in December, officials are sticking to their gradual upward path, trying to prolong the second-longest U.S. expansion on record without making an error. Leaving monetary policy too loose risks stoking excess inflation and asset bubbles, while tightening too fast could cause a recession.The unanimous 9-0 decision left the benchmark federal funds rate in a target range of 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent, following eight quarter-point hikes since late 2015. The interest rate the Fed pays banks on excess reserves \u2014 a tool for keeping the effective funds rate within the Fed\u2019s target range \u2014 was left unchanged at 2.2 per cent, as expected.In one of the only other tweaks to the statement, the FOMC said growth in business fixed investment has \u201cmoderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year,\u201d compared with the previous assessment that it has \u201cgrown strongly.\u201d Third-quarter data showed non-residential investment increased at the slowest pace in almost two years.Meanwhile, household spending \u201chas continued to grow strongly,\u201d the Fed said, echoing its previous assessment of consumption, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the economy.Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are feeling their way toward a more normal policy setting after years of extraordinary stimulus.The tightening cycle may be crimping some segments of the economy. U.S. stocks suffered their steepest losses last month since 2011 in part because of concern the Fed could slow the economy too much. Sales of previously-owned homes were down 4.1 per cent in September from a year earlier, and the cost of a 30-year fixed mortgage hit an eight-year high last week.The task of getting policy right is also complicated by harsher political scrutiny. President Donald Trump criticized past rate shifts and blamed the Fed for the market meltdown in advance of this week\u2019s midterm elections, which delivered control of the House of Representatives to Democrats.A year since being nominated by Trump to helm the Fed, Powell is overseeing an economy in a sweet spot: It grew 3 per cent over the past four quarters, and for the first time since the Fed introduced its 2 per cent inflation objective in 2012, both the headline and core measures of year-on-year price changes hit the goal in September.Unemployment is at 3.7 per cent, the lowest in 48 years, while rising wages and demand for labour are pulling more people into the workforce, helping offset retirements by baby boomers.Fed officials will update their forecasts in December having previously penciled in three increases in 2019, which would put the main rate roughly at levels that policy makers see as neither boosting nor restraining the economy.Thursday\u2019s Fed decision will be the last one without a press conference by the chairman. Powell\u2019s final regularly scheduled quarterly briefing will occur after December\u2019s gathering, and in 2019 he will begin speaking to reporters after every FOMC meeting.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Higher interest rates, tougher mortgage rules drive surge in Toronto private lending", "description": "Twenty per cent of refinancing for mortgage deals in the second quarter were funded by private lenders, a 67 per cent jump from the first quarter of 2016", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/tougher-mortgage-rules-drive-toronto-surge-in-private-lending?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/sold3.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 31, 2018 2:14 PM EDT", "content": "Higher interest rates and tougher lending standards are driving a surge in private lending to homeowners in the Toronto area.Twenty per cent of refinancing for mortgage deals in the second quarter were funded by private lenders, a 67 per cent jump from the first quarter of 2016, according to a report Tuesday by Toronto brokerage Realosophy and property data provider Teranet.Purchasing homes and paying off mortgages are getting harder in Canada\u2019s biggest city due to a combination of rising interest rates, higher home prices and tougher standards to qualify for a mortgage. The new rules require borrowers to prove they can make payments at higher rates and apply to new mortgages as well as refinancings or transfers to a new bank.The changes are a boost to private lenders, which are willing to take on riskier financing arrangements than traditional lenders.

The share of mortgages financed by private lenders has increased from a low of 12 per cent in 2016 to 20 per cent in the second quarter of 2018.Most of these lenders are mortgage brokers who have set up mortgage investment corporations to raise money for lending, John Pasalis, president of Realosophy said in an email.Total private mortgage volume jumped to $1.5 billion in the second quarter, from $920 million in the first quarter of 2016, the report said. Almost half of private lending activity during that period was on detached homes that were refinanced; the next highest segment was for condo refinancing.Generation Xers, or people in their 30s and 40s, were the largest group of consumers turning to private lenders, accounting for 42 per cent of all transactions, according to the report.

That\u2019s the crux of a lawsuit by hedge fund Mosten Investment LP, which sued Manulife, claiming it should be allowed to deposit unlimited amounts of capital and earn high interest rates based on a 1997 insurance policy. Bank of Montreal and Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc. face similar legal challenges.\u201cGiven the new Saskatchewan regulations, Manulife and the other life insurers involved in similar matters plan to make submissions to the court, asking it to dismiss the claims that life insurers can be compelled to accept unlimited premium payments,\u201d the Toronto-based insurer said Tuesday in a statement. \u201cManulife believes these regulations should accelerate the resolution, in its favor, of the principal matters in the Mosten litigation in Saskatchewan.\u201dManulife jumped 5.6 per cent to $20.98 at 9:52 a.m. in Toronto, the biggest jump in two years. \u201cThis change of law could put the litigation to rest,\u201d Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst with National Bank Financial said Tuesday in a note to clients. \u201cThe amendments to the Saskatchewan Insurance Act could protect MFC (and others) even if plaintiff litigation goes against them.\u201dThe case is tied to life insurance policies sold more than two decades ago, when interest rates were higher, that allowed holders to invest their surplus funds into side accounts with guaranteed rates of at least 4 per cent. Mosten claims it should be allowed to deposit unlimited amounts of capital with Manulife based on a universal life insurance policy it owns. Manulife reiterated in the latest statement that Mosten\u2019s position is \u201clegally unfounded.\u201dShort seller Carson Block, who runs Muddy Waters, announced a short position in the firm this month, saying the trial could lead to billions in losses for the Canadian insurer that operates John Hancock in the U.S. Block declined to comment Tuesday on the Saskatchewan ruling, saying they are gathering more information.Ronald Miller, a lawyer at McDougall Gauley who represents Mosten, didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails requesting comment.Mosten is led by Michael Hawkins, a consultant and farmer in Ontario who started buying these life insurance policies from others in 2007 in provinces that allowed such deals, the Wall Street Journal reported this month. He placed the policies in a trio of private partnerships named after old Saskatchewan railway stops \u2014 Ituna, Mosten and Atwater, and investors of those partnerships earned a share of interest income on the policies, the Journal said.Interest rates have since tumbled, so that a 4 per cent rate on a policy today is more than double the Bank of Canada overnight rate.The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, which appealed to the Saskatchewan regulators in the Manulife case, said in a separate statement that it plans to ask other Canadian provinces and territorial governments to take similar steps.\u201cWe intervened in the Saskatchewan litigation as the position taken by the Ituna Investment LP, Mosten Investment LP and Atwater Investment LP is contrary to the nature and intended purpose of the product, fundamental insurance law concepts and Canada\u2019s regulatory system,\u201d President and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Frank said.Bank of Montreal and Industrial Alliance also welcomed the move.\u201cWe are pleased to see regulation in Saskatchewan that reinforces our view of the case \u2014 universal life insurance policies are simply not designed to accept unlimited deposits,\u201d the bank said in an emailed statement.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michelle F.

Privately, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency stopped JPMorgan from expanding into additional states while resolving compliance breakdowns as part of an unwritten regulatory policy, the people said.While banks often have private conversations with regulators and even gauge their reactions to potential plans, the people with knowledge of the matter described the ban as one of the more extreme ways they exerted their control behind the scenes.Regulators went to even harsher lengths earlier this year to punish Wells Fargo & Co., placing a cap on its assets after a pattern of lapses and abuses. Janet Yellen, who served as Federal Reserve chair under President Barack Obama, announced the unprecedented punishment on her final workday in office.JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, operated 5,130 branches in 23 states at the end of last year. With fresh assurances from regulators under President Donald Trump, the people said, it\u2019s planning to open 400 branches in as many as 20 new markets in the next five years, including plans to build in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. This is the first time the bank is opening branches in a new state in more than a decade. The moves could translate into an additional US$1.5 billion of revenue a year by 2022, according to Morgan Stanley.\u201cWe are extremely excited to be expanding again, as smart regulatory policy and a competitive corporate tax system help us to deliver on our commitment to invest in our customers and communities,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said Oct. 12.JPMorgan has resolved many of its compliance issues, but the OCC still has open enforcement actions against the bank, according to agency data.JPMorgan is embarking on the biggest expansion of its consumer bank in a decadeAndrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the bank wouldn\u2019t comment on supervisory issues.\u201cOpening new branches is a sustainable and long-term investment in the communities we serve,\u201d Gray said. \u201cEntering new markets will bring the full force of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and philanthropic capabilities, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and allow us to serve more customers and local businesses by lending and investing in their community.\u201dOCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard declined to comment.In loosening their grip on JPMorgan, authorities removed a critical barrier to the lender\u2019s growth. A 1994 law prohibits mergers between banks if the transaction would give any of them control of more than 10 per cent of U.S. deposits. With US$1.3 trillion, JPMorgan already controls more than 10 per cent \u2014 second only to Bank of America Corp. \u2014 which means adding branches in new markets is one of its only avenues for expansion.The rule reversal comes amid anti-regulatory fervor under Trump. It\u2019s also consistent with the declared willingness of the new OCC head, Joseph Otting, to give financial institutions more flexibility when resolving concerns raised by OCC staff. Otting worked closely with future Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at OneWest Bank, now part of CIT Group Inc., when the lender came under fire for its mortgage-servicing business.The OCC has overturned measures put in place by Thomas Curry, who led the agency from 2012 to 2017. He instituted tough standards in an effort to change the perception that regulators were too close to the institutions they were meant to police.Banks are responding to friendlier regulators under Trump by pushing into new markets and reassessing deals that likely would\u2019ve been vetoed under Obama. Many elected officials and policymakers blamed reduced oversight for the 2008 financial crisis, which triggered the longest and deepest recession since the 1930s.One person familiar with JPMorgan\u2019s plans said regulation was only partly to blame for JPMorgan not broadening its consumer bank in the decade after the crisis. The bank constantly evaluated ways to expand the consumer bank, but executives were hesitant due to the cost and difficulty, the person said.JPMorgan is embarking on the biggest expansion of its consumer bank in a decade as new liquidity rules encourage banks to draw more funding from deposits, which tend to be cheaper, and rising interest rates stiffen the competition for retail customers. Bank of America also announced plans to open up branches in new markets earlier this year.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to do this for 10 years,\u201d Dimon said in September.With assistance from Jesse Hamilton.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Piotr Skolimowski", "title": "Canada\u2019s household debt flashes red in Morgan Stanley risk report", "description": "Risks come from the combination of falling house prices, rising interest rates and weaker credit growth", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/australian-household-debt-flashes-red-in-morgan-stanley-report", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/atm.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 29, 2018 9:45 AM EDT", "content": "Australia\u2019s economy is most at risk in the developed world from household debt reduction because of weak house prices and potential tax changes that could curb property investments, according to Morgan Stanley.Sweden and Canada as the second-most at risk, followed by Norway.That\u2019s the conclusion from the bank\u2019s Household Deleveraging Risk Indicator, which looks at relative debt and structural weaknesses. \u201cThese economies now face a crucial juncture as housing markets weaken, forcing a reappraisal of leverage and wealth, and global financial conditions tighten, increasing the consumption drag from debt service and rising savings,\u201d the bank\u2019s strategists said in a report.Morgan Stanley notes that households in the U.S., Japan, European Union and U.K. cut debt since the global financial crisis.

Still, the risk of a longer than usual recession \u201cremains elevated\u201d as regulators impose so-called macroprudential measures that will tighten lending standards and slow credit growth.In the case of Canada, the risks come from a combination of falling house prices, rising interest rates and weaker credit growth.

He made it through the presidential election, and China\u2019s devaluation, when violent selloffs in U.S. equities gave way to heroic recoveries. Going by the charts, he says, this episode looks the same. But going by his nerves it\u2019s different.\u201cThere\u2019s less conviction that something is there to bail us out,\u201d said Adams, a strategist for Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. \u201cThis time, no one\u2019s really expecting much out of the markets.\u201dWhile Adams is a long way from throwing in the towel, he\u2019s not imagining things when it comes to subtle shifts in market behaviour. One is the persistence of losses. As of Tuesday, stocks in the S&P 500 had dropped in 18 of the 23 days since peaking in September, roughly twice the frequency of the last three corrections.They lurched lower again Wednesday. So steady has the grind been that one of the longest-term technical indicators, the 200-day moving average on the S&P 500, just fell for the first time in 2 1/2 years.Instead of the pattern traders are used to \u2014 one or two nerve-shattering plunges followed by a V-shaped surge \u2014 the selling that began three weeks ago has been slower and steadier. One moderately bad day follows another, with fewer breaks. The S&P 500 has declined in 12 of the last 14 days, something that hasn\u2019t happened since March 2009.Nobody\u2019s saying the market can\u2019t bounce back \u2014 after Tuesday\u2019s midday rebound, many saw signs of the old pattern re-emerging \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to deny the ground has shifted. Gone are days when the Federal Reserve was a reliable backstop for liquidity. Instead, the central bank has raised interest rates eight times and shows little inclination to stop.Selloffs in 2011, 2014 and 2015 all came with Fed-fomented anxiety, though back then policy makers weren\u2019t doing much, said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at RW Baird. \u201cIn the present example, rates are actually going up. That\u2019s certainly a different environment than what we\u2019ve experienced in the past years.\u201dWhat's the positive catalyst for the future to take this market higher to the next level? Right now, there isn't oneHigher yields, concern over slowing growth and signs of inflation have combined to send the S&P 500 down 6.5 per cent from a record high in September. That\u2019s rough, but not as bad as earlier downdrafts. In February, a blow-up in volatility sent stocks into the fastest correction since the 1950s. In January 2016, the S&P 500 lost 11 per cent in 15 trading sessions. It swooned 11 per cent in six sessions after China devalued the yuan in 2015.Which isn\u2019t to say the latest episode has been easy. The 14-day relative strength index recently fell to 17.7, an extremely oversold reading that has only been seen one other time since 2012.To Michael O\u2019Rourke, JonesTrading\u2019s chief market strategist, these travails seem more significant than past ones because the length of the decline suggests nothing is emerging to arrest it.\u201cWhat\u2019s the positive catalyst for the future to take this market higher to the next level? Right now, there isn\u2019t one,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cPeople are concerned about earnings, that was the one thing holding this tape up.\u201dProfit growth has repeatedly come to the market\u2019s rescue in past quarters and indeed may do so again. Estimated at around 21 per cent, income growth for S&P 500 companies is poised to be among the highest of the bull market.Whether this will be enough to lift the markets from the worst start to October in a decade is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201cInvestors have more things to worry about now than they\u2019ve had in the past \u2014 issues that have built up over the year,\u201d said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. \u201cThe only thing we had in February is an increase in interest rates. This time, we have a jump in interest rates plus slower global growth, the trade issue tensions \u2014 which have been rising all year.

It would be the third increase this year and the fifth since the central bank began raising rates last year. The decision will be accompanied by new forecasts that are likely to show an improving outlook.Policy makers are determined to return the nation\u2019s historically low borrowing costs to more normal levels, as a run of strong data suggests the economy is coping with higher rates. It\u2019s a confidence that has only increased since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reached the last-minute agreement with President Donald Trump last month.\u201cThe uncertainty related to NAFTA was a key road block in preventing a hike this week,\u201d said Ian Pollick, head of rates strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The pact \u201chas effectively sealed the deal for the third interest rate hike of 2018.\u201dThe increase would also put the Bank Canada more in sync with the Federal Reserve, which has raised rates three times this year as well \u2014 making the two central banks easily the most hawkish in the Group of Seven.Still, borrowing costs remain low compared with historical levels. Indeed, the policy rate remains below the rate of inflation \u2014 an abnormal situation for an economy that is running up against capacity constraints.Even so, Bank of Canada officials have taken pains to make clear they will proceed only gradually given major risks to the outlook, including lingering trade tensions and the impact of higher rates on indebted households. In practice, that has meant increases about once a quarter.There is some speculation Poloz may choose to accelerate that schedule now that the trade deal is signed, though the market consensus is that it simply cements the existing path. Swaps trading suggests four more rate increases \u2014 including one on Wednesday \u2014 by the end of next year. That would bring the policy rate to 2.5 per cent, where the hiking cycle is expected to end.A 2.5 per cent rate would only bring borrowing costs to the bottom end of what is the Bank of Canada\u2019s best guess of the \u201cneutral\u201d rate \u2014 a level that is neither stimulative or contractionary. The central bank estimates this rate could be as high as 3.5 per cent, meaning there could be scope for even more increases beyond the four expected by investors.Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, says the market may be underestimating the extent of the cycle. He cites \u201cserious\u201d capacity constraints and a favorable outlook stoked by a strong U.S. economy and poised to get a boost from the new Royal Dutch Shell Plc-led natural gas project in British Columbia.\u201cThese outcomes should push Canada into modest excess demand through 2019,\u201d Perrault said in an Oct. 15 quarterly forecast, predicting the policy rate will rise to as high as 3 per cent.The central bank has acknowledged its models say it\u2019s behind the curve. At the September decision, policy makers even debated the possibility of removing the word gradual from their rate statements.But high household debt will continue to be a constraint, as will recent developments that have seen a collapse in Canadian oil prices relative to world prices. A strengthening Canadian dollar is another reason for Poloz to be wary of raising much above 2 per cent, according to CIBC\u2019s Pollick.\u201cWe see them going in October and January and then they\u2019re done,\u201d Pollick said. \u201cThat\u2019s the tightening cycle.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Hot economy puts onus on Bank of Canada amid Ottawa\u2019s deficit spending", "description": "For the first time in a decade, Canada's policy makers are worrying the economy is running too hot instead of too cold", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/hot-economy-puts-onus-on-bank-of-canada-amid-trudeaus-deficits", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/stephen-poloz1.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 23, 2018 4:27 PM EDT", "content": "For the first time in a decade, Canada\u2019s policy makers are worrying the economy is running too hot instead of too cold.The federal government and Bank of Canada are set to release key reports that will paint a picture of an economy running at full steam, with the jobless rate at near-historic lows, consumer spending and housing holding up in the face of rising interest rates, and businesses starting to invest again. A booming U.S. economy, coupled with averting a trade war with Canada\u2019s biggest trading partner, is only stoking growth.The Canadian economy is a case of too much of a good thingThe problem is the Canadian economy is no longer built for speed, given its aging workforce and a long record of business under-investment. This poses a new set of problems for policy makers, in particular how quickly to put the brakes on the expansion before it overheats and what to do about structural issues that limit how much the economy can grow.\u201cEssentially what\u2019s happening in the Canadian and U.S. economies is these economies are sprinting in the middle of a marathon and that will lead to exhaustion,\u201d Frances Donald, head of macro strategy at Manulife Asset Management, said in an interview.Most analysts believe 2 per cent growth is the Canadian economy\u2019s absolute top speed limit, before inflation begins picking up. But demand is growing more quickly than that. Last year, growth actually exceeded that pace by more than a full percentage point and is expected to remain above 2 per cent over the next couple of years.While there is little evidence of overheating just yet, warning signs are starting to appear with companies running up against capacity constraints and complaining they can\u2019t find workers to expand.One question this raises for policy makers is how much will they need to slow everything down. The economy is awash in stimulus in the form of cheap credit from Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz and deficit spending by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that it no longer needs. Another question: Is there anything they can do to raise the country\u2019s so-called speed limit and reduce the capacity constraints the economy is facing?The Bank of Canada\u2019s efforts to cool the economy are already underway. The central bank has increased rates four times since last year, and investors are expecting at least three more hikes over the next 12 months including one at a rate decision Wednesday. The monetary policy report that will accompany the rate decision should provide more insight into how quickly Poloz and his team plan to move again.\u201cThe Canadian economy is a case of too much of a good thing and we think the Bank of Canada is even behind the curve a bit\u201d on rate increases, said Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, who expects the central bank\u2019s policy rate to double from current levels by early 2020.Up until now, Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government has shown no interest in withdrawing its stimulus. Its fiscal plan \u2014 which will be updated in coming weeks (no release date has been published) \u2014 has been essentially to keep expenditure levels and deficits elevated until at least after next year\u2019s federal election.This opens the Liberals to criticism they are taking on debt for little gain, given the economy is running at capacity and the central bank is trying to cool it down. A faster draw down of deficits would theoretically ease pressure for rate hikes, a plus for the country\u2019s most indebted households, who are disproportionately young urban families with huge mortgages in places like Toronto.\u201cAt this point of the cycle you want to see surpluses and paying down debt,\u201d said Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.At the same time, it\u2019s hard to argue Canada\u2019s deficits \u2014 which aren\u2019t growing \u2014 are out of control. Nor is fiscal policy a great tool to fine tune a soft landing for the economy. Government is just not that nimble, even if the Liberals wanted to slow things down.The government can also counter that its deficits are addressing some of the structural issues constraining the economy\u2019s potential growth rate. The tax cuts Finance Minister Bill Morneau is expected to announce in his budget update fall into this category. So do some other policy initiatives the Liberals have undertaken, like increasing immigration levels to alleviate some of the labour shortages, spending more on infrastructure and trying to get more women into the labour force.The truth, however, is the bulk of the government\u2019s deficit spending \u2014 the Liberals ran combined deficits of $38 billion in their first two budgets, or just under 1 per cent of output \u2014 went to finance other priorities.\u201cMost of it in my opinion is not productivity enhancing,\u201d said Randall Bartlett, chief economist at the Ottawa-based Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy.With assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Toronto rent boom drives record-breaking sales in apartment buildings", "description": "Multi-residential apartment sales reached $1.2 billion in the third quarter, taking the largest chunk of commercial deals, a report from Avison Young says", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/toronto-rent-boom-drives-record-breaking-sales-in-apartments", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/toronto-apartments.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 22, 2018 9:48 AM EDT", "content": "Rising rents across Toronto led to record-breaking sales for multi-residential apartment buildings in the third quarter, according to a report released Friday by commercial real estate firm Avison Young Canada Inc.Demand for other commercial real estate assets continued to outstrip supply, the report said.

Delinquencies reached 1.06 per cent in the second quarter, close to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis.The Bank of Canada has raised rates four times since mid-2017 and is widely expected to do so again next week as it seeks to normalize the cost of borrowing. Johnston said higher rates, slowing economic growth and a reduction in mortgage volumes will likely strain household balance sheets.\u201cWe are probably hitting that level out point, and maybe even a bit of a backup as we go forward now,\u201d Johnston said in a telephone interview, referring to delinquency rates, which peaked at 1.65 per cent in early 2010 and have since trended steadily downward. \u201cWe are starting to see interest rates have an effect,\u201d he said.Equifax tracks the proportion of people who fully pay off their credit cards each month, data that provides a good measure of cash flow, Johnston says. The proportion has declined on a year-over-year basis every month since August 2017, shortly after the Bank of Canada started hiking rates again after a seven-year hiatus. \u201cWe do think cash flows are starting to be impacted,\u201d he said.According to Johnston, about 43 per cent of all non-mortgage debt is lines of credit, much of it home equity lines of credit, which is variable rate. Every time borrowing costs rise by 25 basis points, \u201cyour monthly payment changes. We\u2019re starting to see that flow through a little bit, because people are still using a lot of lines of credit.\u201dThere\u2019s also a \u201clag effect\u201d of about 3 months to 6 months between when credit growth slows and when delinquency rates rise, he said. Johnston declined to give an exact forecast for delinquencies, saying the timing is tricky, but probably in the fourth quarter this year or the first quarter next year, the rate will start to tick higher \u201cby a few basis points.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t see it spiking or whip-lashing back up,\u201d he said.

Yet analysts continue to predict gains for the loonie, with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey showing it appreciating to 80 US cents by the end of next year from current levels around 76.90.\u201cGood economic conditions in Canada are leading toward ongoing tightening by the Bank of Canada,\u201d said Greg Anderson, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Bank of Montreal, who expects the Canadian dollar to strengthen to about 78.74 US cents over the next three months.While the price of WCS is trading close to its widest discount to WTI on record, the world\u2019s 11th largest economy is running near its potential and the unemployment rate has fallen to around 5.9 per cent as other sectors such as technology boom. Businesses see their sales outlook improving, according to Bank of Canada\u2019s survey conducted last month. And that was even before the country cemented a deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which had been a source of considerable uncertainty.The fixed-income market is currently pricing in about four increases over the coming year for the BOC\u2019s benchmark, which currently stands at 1.5 per cent. The odds of an increase at next week\u2019s meeting have climbed to around 84 per cent and economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict it will rise to 1.75 per cent, the highest in a decade.Oil prices are no longer a good proxy for Canadian currency trends, in part because the local energy sector isn\u2019t receiving the kinds of foreign investment it used to, according to Bank of Montreal\u2019s Anderson. Government data show that oil and gas accounts for around 15 per cent of the foreign stock of investments in Canada. That\u2019s down from about 17 per cent in 2014, before a decline in oil prices triggered a swath of restructuring across the industry.The correlation between the loonie and WCS was strong as recently as 2016, before falling off, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The correlation was strong even for most of 2015 as well, when a sharp decline of oil prices triggered an outflow of investment in Canadian energy industry.That said, energy products \u2014 including oil \u2014 do still account for a significant chunk of the nation\u2019s exports, so it certainly can\u2019t be ignored by the nation\u2019s central bankers. It\u2019s something that the Bank of Canada may point as a reason to insist on pursuing a gradual tightening path, according to Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at TD Securities.There is also potential for energy to recover some of its influence on the currency further down the track with the development of a $40 billion liquified natural gas project on the coast of British Columbia. But cash is unlikely to flow from that for quite some time and it\u2019s largely irrelevant for the loonie at the moment, according to Darcy Briggs, a Calgary-based portfolio manager at Franklin Bissett Investment Management, which has around $6 billion in fixed-income assets.With the new North American free trade agreement pending ratification, and the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate hike path priced-in, some strategists are watching Canada\u2019s terms of trade. For example, lumber has slid by nearly half since a May peak, and that can weigh on the loonie, said Shaun Osborne, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia.\u201cIt\u2019s not just Canadian oil prices that have declined, quite a few relevant Canadian commodities have as well.\u201d said Osborne. \u201cAnd that has a long-run impact on the value of the Canadian dollar.\u201dWith assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Gregory Calderone, Sarah Ponczek and Kasper Viita", "title": "No end in sight to stock slump as traders say \u2018bad day\u2019 was overdue", "description": "Wall Street\u2019s worst daily loss in eight months is reverberating around the globe", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/no-end-in-sight-to-stock-rout-as-traders-say-bad-day-was-overdue", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/trader.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 11, 2018 11:51 AM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks fell for a sixth day Thursday, extending the longest losing streak of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, as an early rally in tech folded and energy shares plunged.

A quick survey of 10 sell-side and buy-side traders found an \u201cuptick in hedging activity\u201d through the day.

At Wednesday\u2019s close, the gains had been whittled to 4 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. Investors have been selling their most beloved shares in sectors like technology, and piling into discarded ones, signaling a rotation out of the \u201cgrowth\u201d investment style and into \u201cvalue\u201d.Speaking to reporters Wednesday, President Donald Trump again criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, saying the central bank \u201chas gone crazy\u201d tightening too fast.

That to me means you\u2019re going to take this back. I don\u2019t know if it takes a day or a week. I would absolutely be buying this.\u201dWednesday felt extra painful because gains had gotten so reliable lately, according to Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy for E*Trade Financial Corp. From trade tensions to hints of inflation setting off scares, the market has been resilient this year.\u201cWe\u2019ve been used to one direction lately, and that\u2019s up,\u201d Loewengart said in a message. \u201cNaturally there are ebbs and flows, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now. While it may be tempting to make a move to mitigate portfolio risk based on today\u2019s activity, timing the market rarely works to an investor\u2019s benefit.\u201dBut some investors, including Alon Rosin, Oppenheimer\u2019s head of institutional equity derivatives, have been looking to hedge risk. His team has been looking to add November ETF downside trades and long volatility exposures over the past two weeks, as profit warnings form companies such as BorgWarner and Delphi Technologies have raised red flags.\u201cMany are pointing to overall confusion, gross exposure reductions (selling longs/covering shorts), risk parity/factor related unwinds, etc., driving the overall selling,\u201d Rosin said in an email. \u201cETF options volumes have been relatively light since Friday\u2019s initial breakdown and we would like to see that pick up and more activity in the puts before any true stabilization kicks in for a trade-able bottom.\u201dMost attributed Wednesday\u2019s weakness across consumer goods stocks to comments from LVMH\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony, who said on a call with analysts that Chinese customs authorities are stepping up border checks on returning travellers, reinforcing concerns over the U.S., China trade war.But even with trade concerns creeping back into the limelight, consensus is that this isn\u2019t the beginning of the end.

The relationship has come completely apart only three times in that period, and each episode was followed by an equity market slump, including the last one, in 2014.More synchronized weakness could also leave investors exposed, upending diversification strategies that helped them hedge losses in either market.\u201cIt\u2019s always hard to judge at what point you hit an inflection point where the correlation between yields and stocks goes into reverse,\u201d says Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co. \u201cOne of the markers to when that happens is typically when you move from a deflationary era or at least a deflationary mindset to more of an inflationary mindset.\u201dIt\u2019s potentially a big deal.An enduring rupture in positive correlations \u2014 yields moving up along with stocks \u2014 would signal a break in the weak-growth, low-interest regime seen over much of the past decade. Markets driven by negative tandem moves \u2014 yields up, shares down \u2014 have tended to be in the grip of inflationary pressure or potential economic over-heating.\u201cThe correlation between stocks and bond yields has been positive for the better part of the past 20 years,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence equity strategists Gina Martin Adams and Aditya Kalgutkar wrote in a note on Tuesday. \u201cEach flip to a negative correlation (2006-07, 2013-14) preceded a significant equity-market correction.\u201dThe dynamic has entered center stage in the past few days, after the yield on the 10-year benchmark raced to a seven-year peak while the S&P 500 Index fell four straight days to the lowest in a month. Those moves could be just a taste of what\u2019s to come.\u201cDon\u2019t be lulled by how well the stock market has weathered rising yields and creeping inflation thus far,\u201d Leuthold Group\u2019s James Paulsen wrote in a research note this week. \u201cWall Street\u2019s Overheat Mindset (as signified by the stock/bond yield correlation) appears to be on the cusp of greater anxiety.\u201dPaulsen reckons investors\u2019 yield-risk sensitivities have been dulled, but that as Wall Street worries more about inflation, stocks will show an increasing reaction to rising rates. While both price growth and yields remain low by historic standards, he expects \u201coverheat pressure\u201d to become a more dominant force, potentially triggering further adverse equity moves.That would mark a departure from the post-crisis era \u2014barring 2013\u2019s Taper Tantrum \u2014 in which bonds picked up the slack as stocks tumbled. That dynamic has juiced vanilla 60/40 portfolios and risk-parity strategies along the way.Not everyone thinks we\u2019re there. So far, inflation remains consistent with a broader environment of strengthening growth \u2014 a positive backdrop for equities, says Schwab\u2019s Sonders. In her view, price pressures are still relatively benign. \u201cRates are coming up from an incredibly low level. It\u2019s going to take a while before they start to bite.\u201dDiversification-minded investors have plenty of reasons to take solace. If price pressures are set to spur a shift in market regimes, some investors haven\u2019t got the memo.The recent Treasury rout has been driven by an uptick in real yields rather than market-derived inflation expectations.What\u2019s more, the yield curve has been gripped by bear steepening lately \u2014 an advance in longer-dated yields outpacing the shorter end.That\u2019s typically a boon for financials and cyclicals, helping benchmark stock indexes to rally, according to Pravit Chintawongvanich, equity derivatives strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that when the correlation was negative (yields up/stocks down) and rates were very high, inflation was the primary concern for rates,\u201d he wrote in a note. \u201cWe think the weakness in stocks and jump higher in the VIX reflects higher risk premium across the board \u2014 the unexpected jump higher in rates and rate vol reverberating through to the equity market.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Andrew Mayeda", "title": "IMF cuts forecast for global growth for first time in two years as trade war takes toll", "description": "Risks to the global outlook have risen in the last three months and tilt to the downside, the IMF warns", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/imf-cuts-forecast-for-global-growth-as-trade-war-takes-toll", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/caution.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 9, 2018 7:29 AM EDT", "content": "The International Monetary Fund\u00a0said the world economy is plateauing as the lender cut its growth forecast for the first time\u00a0in more than two years, blaming escalating trade tensions and stresses in emerging markets.On the eve of its annual meetings in Bali, Indonesia, the fund on Tuesday projected a global expansion of 3.7 per cent this year and next, down from the 3.9 per cent projected three months ago. It was the first downgrade since July 2016.While the global economy is still on track to match last year\u2019s pace, which was the strongest since 2011, the new outlook suggests fatigue is setting in and the overall performance masked divergence with mounting weakness in emerging markets from Brazil to Turkey.The fund left its 2018 U.S. forecast unchanged but cut its expectation for next year, citing the impact of the trade conflict.Risks to the global outlook have risen in the last three months and tilt to the downside, the IMF said. Threats include a further\u00a0inflaming of the trade war between the U.S and countries including China, and a sharper-than-expected rise in interest rates, which would accelerate capital flight from emerging markets.\u201cThere are clouds on the horizon. Growth has proven to be less balanced than we had hoped,\u201d IMF Chief Economist Maurice Obstfeld told reporters Tuesday in Bail. \u201cNot only have some downside risks we identified in the last WEO been realized, the likelihood of further negative shocks to our growth forecast has risen.\u201dThe warning comes as finance ministers and central bankers from the IMF\u2019s 189 member nations prepare to meet this week in Bali, Indonesia for the annual meetings of the fund and its sister institution, the World Bank. The Trump administration\u2019s trade dispute with China is expected to be front and center, as are the consequences of the Federal Reserve and other major central banks tightening monetary conditions after a decade of easy money.If the trade war continues, it could take a significant bite out of global growth, according to the fund. It estimates global output could fall by more than 0.8 per cent in 2020 and remain 0.4 per cent below its trend line over the long term, in a scenario where Trump follows through on all his threats, including global duties on cars. Output could fall by more than 1.6 per cent in China and over 0.9 per cent in the U.S. next year, according to the IMF\u2019s models.The IMF\u2019s cut to its outlook was broad-based. The fund downgraded its forecast for U.S. growth next year to 2.5 per cent, down 0.2 percentage point from July, after factoring in the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and retaliatory duties by other nations. It left its U.S. growth projection for this year at 2.9 per cent.President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on US$250 billion in Chinese goods this year, and Beijing has retaliated with levies US$110 billion of American products. The IMF projections don\u2019t take into account Trump\u2019s threat to expand the tariffs to effectively all of the more than $500 billion in goods the U.S. bought from China last year.The IMF also cut its outlook for China as a result of the tariffs, shaving its projection for growth next year to 6.2 per cent, down 0.2 point from three months ago.The euro area will expand 2 per cent this year, down 0.2 point from July, as a result of weaker than expected growth in the first half of the year.The fund upgraded its forecast for Japan slightly to 1.1 per cent growth this year, up 0.1 point from July.Several emerging markets had their forecasts cut, including Argentina, Brazil, Iran and Turkey, reflecting factors including tighter credit.The IMF said it expects inflation to accelerate around the world this year, due largely to increasing commodity prices. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as energy, will vary from country to country, it said.In the U.S., the core personal consumption expenditure index, the Fed\u2019s preferred measure for inflation, will rise to 2.1 per cent in 2018 and 2.3 per cent next year, as the government\u2019s fiscal stimulus pushes growth above potential, the IMF said.Over the longer term, the IMF sees aging populations and sluggish productivity growth as a major challenge to advanced economies. Global growth will slow to 3.6 per cent by 2022-2023, as growth in rich nations falls back to potential, it said.Most of the \u201cmeager gains\u201d from growth have gone to the well off, fuelling support for protectionism and anti-establishment leaders, said Obstfeld. \u201cPolicymakers must take a long-term perspective to address this malaise. Inclusive fiscal policies, educational investments, and ensuring access to adequate health care can reduce inequality and are key priorities,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Schatzker, Ivan Levingston and Natalie Wong", "title": "Muddy Waters' Carson Block shorts Manulife Financial; stock slumps", "description": "Block said the company's life insurance subsidiary just concluded a trial with a hedge fund that could lead to billions in losses", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/muddy-waters-carson-block-shorts-manulife-financial", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/manulife.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 4, 2018 2:16 PM EDT", "content": "Muddy Waters has found its latest target: Canadian insurer Manulife Financial Corp.Short seller Carson Block, who runs Muddy Waters, announced a short position in the firm Thursday, and said its life-insurance subsidiary just concluded a trial with a hedge fund that could lead to billions in losses. Block expects a verdict this year. Manulife said in a statement that it disagrees with Block\u2019s conclusions.In a report, Muddy Waters said it believes investors aren\u2019t aware of the material risks to Manulife posed by the trial. The insurer was taken to court by hedge fund Mosten Investment LP, which claims it should be allowed to deposit unlimited amounts of capital with Manulife and earn at least 4 per cent in annual interest based on a 1997 universal life insurance policy it owns.\u201cThis really looks to be more an issue of incompetence from the 1990s,\u201d Block, Muddy Waters\u2019 chief investment officer, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cThis could effectively make this hedge fund, if it wins, the highest yielding money-market type product in the developed world.\u201dManulife shares were down 3.89 per cent Friday morning at $21.96.Toronto-based Manulife is one of the biggest life insurers in the world and operates in the U.S. as John Hancock. The lawsuit also involves a Bank of Montreal operation and iA Financial Group. Bank of Montreal declined to comment while a spokesman for iA Financial Group said it wouldn\u2019t comment while the matter was still in litigation. Lawyers representing Mosten didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Manulife said it believes that Mosten\u2019s position is \u201clegally unfounded.\u201d\u201cWe firmly believe that the consumers purchasing universal life policies, and the insurers issuing these policies, never intended to have the policies function as deposit or securities contracts,\u201d Manulife said in the statement. \u201cWe have a sound, highly rated global franchise. We expect we will prevail with respect to this matter and that it will not affect our business operations or our ability to meet obligations to our customers, vendors and other key stakeholders.\u201dManulife dropped as much as 4.1 per cent after Block\u2019s comments to the lowest since 2016. The shares were down 2.9 per cent at 1:18 p.m. in Toronto.The Mosten case isn\u2019t the first time policies written in the 1990s have come back to bite insurers. Products such as universal life insurance and long-term care policies sold decades ago were built under the assumption that interest rates would be higher. As those rates fell after the financial crisis, some companies, including Aegon NV\u2019s Transamerica, boosted the cost of their products, prompting lawsuits from policyholders.In a worst-case scenario, Manulife could face what Block called a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d if it loses the Mosten case at trial. The hedge fund could pile money into the policy and demand its guaranteed return, while the insurer is limited in its investment options to generate the needed funds.If these issues hurt Manulife\u2019s credit ratings, that could also prompt some customers to look elsewhere for coverage, Block said. It\u2019s also hard to predict exactly how the trial will play out, but he said he believes there\u2019s potential for Mosten to prevail on at least some of its claims.\u201cNobody thought, hey, maybe somebody would try to stick billions of dollars in there in an environment in which interest rates are very low,\u201d Block said in the interview.Manulife has been seeking to trim risk at the company by winding down poorly performing books of business and appointing Naveed Irshad to lead that effort in North America.Muddy Waters has previously built short positions in companies ranging from French retailer Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA to Chinese tutoring firm TAL Education Group.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn, Jacqueline Thorpe and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Household debt will pose major risk to Canada\u2019s economy for next three years, economists warn", "description": "Past 2020, \u2018it's really going to hit the fan'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/consumer-debt-will-pose-major-risk-to-canadas-economy-for-years", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/debt.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 3, 2018 10:51 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy faces a major risk through the next three years from how debt-laden consumers cope with higher interest rates, according to economists from three of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions.Risks in the housing market remain, even after the slowdown in sales earlier this year after the government imposed new regulations, according to Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife Asset Management. Consumers still have to prove they can be resilient to higher interest rates, Donald said Tuesday at the Bloomberg Canadian Fixed Income Conference in New York.\u201cThis is something that we are going to have to deal with for several years,\u201d she said.Consumers no longer have the capacity to lead Canada through another recession the way they did after the global financial crisis a decade ago, said Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. While Canada\u2019s fastest population growth in decades provides some support to demand for housing, high debt levels remain a problem that could exacerbate the next recession, she said.Past 2020, \u201cit\u2019s really going to hit the fan,\u201d Caranci said. \u201cAt that point you have high level of indebtedness combined with income stress happening simultaneously. So we are definitely not out of the woods.\u201dThe next recession for Canada will be different than the previous because it will be \u201ca household led recession,\u201d Caranci said.The risks around consumer finances will lead the Bank of Canada to remain cautious about raising interest rates, said Stefane Marion, chief economist at National Bank of Canada. The central bank will re-assess its path after moving the policy rate to 2 per cent, he said, adding that will help avoid a consumer-led downturn. \u201cI don\u2019t see an accident waiting to happen in the housing sector,\u201d Marion said.U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields could rise towards 3.5 per cent in a time of government deficits and tightening by the Federal Reserve, Marion said, something that will be felt in Canada and its mortgage rates, Marion said.All three economists said that the risks of higher interest rates will be felt more around 2020.

The measure uses an aggregate of all housing categories, including single-family detached homes and condos.While rising prices had been the culprit behind the loss of affordability between 2015 and 2017, mortgage-rate increases accounted for the entire rise in carrying costs over the past year, the bank said. The country\u2019s central bank has risen interest rates four times since July, 2017.\u201cWe expect the Bank of Canada to proceed with further rate hikes that will raise its overnight rate from 1.50 per cent currently to 2.25 per cent in the first half of 2019,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis will keep mortgage rates under upward pressure and boost ownership costs even more across Canada in the period ahead.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Christopher Condon and Rich Miller", "title": "U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates, says more hikes coming", "description": "The Fed reaffirmed their outlook for further gradual hikes well into 2019, risking fresh criticism from President Donald Trump", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-to-highest-level-in-more-than-a-decade", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/jerome-powell.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 26, 2018 3:31 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve officials raised interest rates for a third time this year and reaffirmed their outlook for further gradual hikes well into 2019, risking fresh criticism from President Donald Trump.The quarter-point increase boosted the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent. The move reflected an upbeat assessment of the economy that was identical to the central bank\u2019s last policy statement eight weeks ago, despite concerns over Trump\u2019s escalating trade war.Growth and job gains have been \u201cstrong\u201d and inflation remains near the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target, the Federal Open Market Committee said in its statement Wednesday following a two-day meeting in Washington.Barring a negative surprise in the economy, updated \u201cdot plot\u201d forecasts made a December rate hike almost certain, as the number of FOMC officials expecting another increase by year-end grew to a bigger majority of 12, from eight in the previous round of projections in June.In the statement\u2019s only change from the previous one issued Aug. 1, the committee dropped its long-standing description of monetary policy as \u201caccommodative.\u201d That\u2019s an acknowledgment rates have moved closer to the neutral level which neither boosts nor restrains the economy.The tweak in language led investors to sell the dollar and buy Treasuries on the assumption it meant the Fed would be less aggressive in the future. The Bloomberg dollar spot index fell as much as 0.3 per cent to a session low and the yield on 10-year Treasuries dropped to as low as 3.061 per cent from around 3.08 per cent before the decision.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues are trying to pull off a feat the central bank has accomplished only once in its 104-year history: Engineer a soft landing of the economy by raising rates just enough to prevent overheating, but not so much that they trigger a recession.During a press conference after the decision, Powell said the removal of the sentence about policy accommodation doesn\u2019t signal a change in the Fed\u2019s path for gradual tightening guided by incoming economic data. Even after today\u2019s hike, policy remains accommodative, he told reporters. \u201cThis is a pretty good moment for the U.S. economy,\u201d he said.While calling the economy strong and financial vulnerabilities moderate, he also said the central bank is hearing a \u201crising chorus\u201d of concern about tariffs and the U.S.\u2019s turn toward protectionist trade policies. Asked about the pressure from Trump to keep rates low, Powell said the Fed is focused on its mission to keep the economy healthy and doesn\u2019t consider politics in the process.After eight hikes since late 2015, the fed funds rate is now at the highest level since October 2008, just after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.Voters on the committee backed the decision 9-0.Trump isn\u2019t making the Fed\u2019s tricky task any easier. Aside from criticizing recent Fed rate hikes, he\u2019s launched a trade war with China that threatens both to slow growth and boost inflation. Tariffs on an additional US$200 billion of imported goods from China took effect Monday, along with retaliatory levies from Beijing.Fed officials remained skeptical that Trump\u2019s tax cuts will result in a persistent boost to economic growth. While they raised projections for expansion this year and next, they predicted that growth would slow to 1.8 per cent by 2021. That\u2019s in line with their estimate for the economy\u2019s long-run potential and contrasts with the Trump administration\u2019s goal of sustained 3 per cent growth.In their post-meeting statement and updated economic projections, Fed policy makers made no mention of trade worries and showed no sign they would soon halt the upward march of rates.\u201cThe committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labour market conditions and inflation near the committee\u2019s symmetric 2 per cent objective,\u201d the statement said, repeating previous language.The committee, enlarged to 16 by the recent addition of new Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, continued to anticipate three hikes in 2019, according to the median estimate.Investors have questioned whether the Fed will ultimately prove so aggressive, preferring to price in two increases next year. If the central bank\u2019s outlook prevails, traders will eventually be forced to adjust their rate-hike expectations and lift long- term rates.It was the first time since this round of rate increases began in late 2015 that the Fed hasn\u2019t described policy as \u201caccommodative.\u201d Any signal in that change, however, is unclear.\u201cThe removal of \u2019accommodative\u2019 is not a dovish signal,\u201d said Carl Riccadonna, chief U.S. economist at Bloomberg Economics. \u201cThe rates projections show that the vast majority on the committee continue to believe that rates are below neutral.\u201dThe location of a neutral rate for policy is the subject of heated debate, with estimates within the committee ranging from 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent. Powell has repeatedly played down the importance of neutral given economists\u2019 inability to know precisely where it lies.Moreover, policy makers haven\u2019t agreed on what they should do when rates reach neutral. Some favour a pause while others argue they should push rates above neutral before stopping.Fed officials, in the statement, repeated their assessment that \u201crisks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.\u201dThe median forecast in the most recent set of projections continued to show officials expect borrowing costs to move above their estimate for the long-run neutral rate, reaching 3.4 per cent in 2020, the same as in the June forecasts.The new projections also included the first numbers for 2021, when officials see rates remaining steady at 3.4 per cent. The median long-run neutral estimate moved up slightly to 3 per cent from 2.9 per cent.The Fed\u2019s hike widens a gap with its peers elsewhere. The European Central Bank said it will maintain its policy rate of minus 0.4 per cent at least through next summer, while the Bank of Japan is set to stick with its current settings until 2020.Higher U.S. rates, though, may force more emerging markets to tighten monetary policy to defend their currencies at a time when investors are punishing those with fault lines such as large current-account deficits.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Home sales over $4 million jump 34% in Toronto as luxury market \u2018runs full throttle\u2019", "description": "Vancouver though is another story", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/luxury-home-sales-are-booming-in-toronto-tumbling-in-vancouver?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/sothbeys.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 26, 2018 10:21 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s luxury-home market has a split personality: East versus West.Sales for $1 million or more in the Toronto region bounced back after a slowdown earlier this year, climbing 19 per cent in July and August from the same period in 2017, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty Canada said Wednesday. The increase was even greater \u2014 34 per cent \u2014 for a subset of transactions priced above $4 million.Deals went the opposite way in Vancouver, a pricier market that\u2019s still adjusting to new regulations, including a provincial foreign buyers tax and speculation tax, on top of the rising interest rates that affect the whole country.

Condos in Vancouver, however, were bucking the trend, with sales rising as buyers shifted away from the city\u2019s costlier detached homes.That growth was short-lived.

In the Toronto region, meanwhile, luxury-condo purchases had their strongest gains of the year, jumping 28 per cent.In Montreal, where July and August\u2019s $1 million-plus sales jumped 19 per cent, sustained demand will continue to fuel growth this fall, according to Sotheby\u2019s.

Still, American consumers could start feeling the cost of the tariffs for everyday goods, as the latest move brings all Chinese imports subject to a new tariff to US$250 billion, roughly half of China\u2019s shipments to the U.S. last year.President Donald Trump is barreling ahead with his vow to punish China for alleged unfair trading practices, despite an invitation this month from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to restart trade talks with Beijing.

Some of this has to do with the complexities of the event, as well as how hard it is to identify forces lurking below the surface that had built up over the years.Even a decade later, many people still cling to false ideas about the underlying causes (there wasn\u2019t just one, folks!) of the crisis. What follows are my 10 favorite flawed memes, misunderstandings and just outright falsehoods about the financial crisis and its aftermath:\u00a0No. 1. Lehman\u2019s collapse caused the crisis: \u201cIf only we had saved Lehman Brothers, we could have avoided the crisis,\u201d goes a popular lament. This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the scale of the dislocations. To accept this premise \u2014 former Lehman employees are some of the loudest apostles of this theory \u2014 then one has to pretend an entire universe of other issues didn\u2019t exist.Lehman, like Bear Stearns before it, suffered from many of the same issues that afflicted most of the U.S.\u2019s other big banks and brokers: too much junk paper, too much leverage, too little capital and deficient risk controls. Lehman was simply among the most overleveraged and undercapitalized of the lot.No. 2. If not for X, we would have been OK: Take your pick of things to insert here, but it\u2019s important to understand that this was not a single event, but rather the result of many factors that came together over time. These include: the Federal Reserve\u2019s ultralow interest rates, a fundamentally weak recovery from the dot-com collapse, the housing boom and bust, huge amounts of financial leverage, securitization of mortgages, the embrace of derivatives and reckless deregulation of the financial industry that enabled much of the above, and more. No. 3. Repeal of Glass-Steagall: The argument is that in the decades after Glass-Steagall was enacted during the Great Depression, Wall Street crises were confined to Wall Street and didn\u2019t spill onto Main Street. See as examples the 1987 stock-market crash or the Mexican peso crisis of 1994. But the causative issue we run into to is the but-for test. Would we have had a crisis if Glass-Steagall were still in place? I don\u2019t see how we can make that claim. Perhaps had Glass-Steagall not been repealed, the crisis might have been smaller, but it is very hard to say it wouldn\u2019t have occurred anyway.No. 4. Bailouts were the only option: There were many other options, but they would have been very painful and required considerable foresight. I believed then (and still believe) that the best course of action would have been prepackaged bankruptcies for all the insolvent institutions instead of bailouts. I would have had the federal government provide debtor-in-possession financing, allowed qualified private institutional investors to bid on the assets thereby letting markets set the valuations, with the government picking up the rest. It would have been more difficult in the short term, but the economy would have rebounded much sooner.No. 5. Taxpayers were repaid in full and even made a profit: There are two major issues with this claim: The first is that the Troubled Asset Relief Program and most other loans and bailouts were all (or almost all) repaid. But to make that happen, the federal government in a move\u00a0questioned by tax experts\u00a0allowed failed American International Group to carry forward the net operating losses for use to offset future earnings; this was a stealth bailout worth tens of billions of dollars that didn\u2019t appear to \u201ccost\u201d anything. Meanwhile the Federal Reserve kept rates at zero for almost a decade. This resulted in a huge transfer from savers to bailed-out lenders.The federal government also took a huge amount of risk during a period when financial markets tripled. And that is before we account for all of the collateral losses and moral hazards we created.No. 6. No one went to jail because stupidity isn\u2019t a crime: This one is laugher, from the behavior of the executives at Lehman Brothers to all of the foreclosure fraud that took place. Jesse Eisinger, author of \u201cThe Chickenshit Club: Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosecute Executives,\u201d explained how the white-collar defence bar successfully lobbied and undercut the Department of Justice during the years before the crisis. You can\u2019t convict a criminal if you don\u2019t have the personnel, intellectual firepower or stomach to prosecute in the first place.No. 7. Borrowers were as blameworthy as lenders: First, we know that for huge swaths of the banking industry, the basis for lending changed in the run-up to the crisis. For most of financial history, credit was granted based on the borrower\u2019s ability to repay. In the years before the crisis, the incentive to lend shifted: It was based not on the likelihood of repayment but on whether a loan could be sold to someone else, often a securities firm, which would repackage the loan with other loans to create a mortgage-backed security. Selling 30-year mortgages with a 90-day warranty changes the calculus for who qualifies: just find a warm body that will make the first three payments; after that it\u2019s someone else\u2019s problem.Second, we know that if you offer people free money, they will take it. This is among the reasons we have banking regulations in the first place. We expect the banking professionals to understand risk better than the unwashed masses.No. 8. Poor people caused the crisis: This is another intellectually dishonest claim. If any U.S. legislation such as the Community Reinvestment Act was the actual cause of the crisis, then the boom and bust wouldn\u2019t have been global. Second, if poor people and these policies were the cause, then the crisis would have been centered in South Philadelphia; Harlem, New York; Oakland, California; and Atlanta instead of the burgeoning suburbs of Las Vegas, Southern California, Florida and Arizona. The folks making this argument seem to have questionable motivations.No. 9. The Fed made a mistake by stepping in when Congress refused: Congress is the governmental entity that should have done more in response to the crisis. But it didn\u2019t, and all of those members who opposed efforts to repair the economy and financial system should have been thrown out of office. The Fed gave cover to Congress, creating congressional moral hazard and allowing it to shirk its responsibilities. We don\u2019t know how the world would have looked if that hadn\u2019t happened, but I imagine it would be significantly different than it does today \u2014\u00a0and not necessarily better.No. 10. Lehman could have been saved: This is perhaps the most delusional of all the claims. Lehman was insolvent. We know this from an accounting sleight-of-hand it performed called Repo 105, in which it which\u00a0\u201csold\u201d US$50 billion in holdings to an entity it owned, booked a profit just before quarterly earnings, then repurchased the holdings. The sleuthing done by hedge-fund manager David Einhorn reached the same conclusion about Lehman\u2019s solvency long before the collapse; the Fed itself also made clear that it couldn\u2019t take on Lehman\u2019s losses.When people stubbornly refuse to acknowledge facts, when they insist on staying married to their own faulty belief system, it becomes very challenging to respond with sound policies.

The derivative bets may help explain the fund\u2019s turbulence \u2014 because while investments in futures can boost potential returns, they can also generate out-sized losses.Gross realized almost US$153 million of losses on interest-rate futures in the first half, a significant dent for what was a US$2-billion fund at the time. It suffered several big swings during the first six months of this year, most notably a 3 per cent plunge on May 29. That drop, which was the year\u2019s largest single-day decline by a big bond fund, jarred investors and increased scrutiny of Gross\u2019s stewardship.\u201cLosing 3 per cent in a day in equities is not calamitous, but in bonds it is enormous,\u201d said Richard Klitzberg, an asset management consultant to institutions and high-net-worth families. \u201cHe was running billions of dollars and either got the trade completely mis-positioned or was very highly levered.\u201dErin Passan, a spokeswoman for Janus Henderson Group Plc, declined to comment. Gross didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.The fund\u2019s share price has yet to fully recover from the May 29 decline, which Gross attributed to a bet that yields on German bunds and U.S. Treasuries would converge. After the 3 per cent plunge, Janus said in July that the fund had scaled back the money-losing convergence bet.The Aug. 30 filing suggests Gross used futures to double down on the strategy, only to have it go awry.Interest rate futures would be the simplest way to execute Gross\u2019s convergence trade, said David Ader, chief macro strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence, adding that the Janus fund could go long on 10-year Treasuries futures and short on those for 10-year bunds.Janus disclosed that the fund did hold some futures tied to U.S. and German debt, as well as options on such futures, as of March 31 and June 30. The filings don\u2019t show positions on other days during the first half of the year like May 29, instead reporting the average exposure to futures during the period.Unconstrained bond funds, which represent a US$120-billion niche within the fixed-income world, free managers like Gross to hold various types of assets, ranging from cash to banks loans and derivatives. Gross\u2019s strategy has been to invest most of his assets in lower-rated corporate bonds while employing derivatives to enhance returns.The strategy has backfired this year, with Janus Unconstrained down 5.6 per cent through Sept. 11, among the worst performers in its class. Its assets dropped to US$1.15 billion as of Aug. 31 from about US$2.2 billion at the end of December.The average value of the fund\u2019s futures contracts purchased rose to US$1.45 billion in the first half of this year from US$112 million reported for the six months ended Dec. 31, according to the filings. The average value of its futures contracts sold also rose, to US$1.1 billion from US$214 million, over the same time period.Janus Unconstrained\u2019s combined losses on futures tied to commodities, currencies, equities and interest rates totaled US$212 million during the first half of this year, including the US$153 million lost on interest-rate bets. Though the total was partially offset by roughly US$86 million of gains on options, that\u2019s a lot of money for any fund to lose on futures, said Ader.\u201cIt gives new meaning to the term unconstrained,\u201d he said.\u2013With assistance from John Gittelsohn.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Onur Ant", "title": "Turkey just hiked its interest rate 625 basis points to 24%, the most in 15 years, to save its currency", "description": "That's twice as much as economists had predicted", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/turkey-central-bank-raises-benchmark-rate-to-24-lira-rallies", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/lira.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 13, 2018 8:15 AM EDT", "content": "Turkey\u2019s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by the most since Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power 15 years ago, countering the president\u2019s call for lower borrowing costs just two hours before the decision was announced. The currency rallied.The Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor Murat Cetinkaya on Thursday increased the one-week repo rate by 625 basis points to 24 per cent, more than the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey that called for a hike of 325 basis points.The bank\u2019s decision came shortly after Erdogan triggered tumult by repeating his hostility to higher borrowing costs and issuing an order that limited the use of foreign currency in domestic transactions. The independence of monetary policy has been in doubt since Erdogan pledged in his election campaign this year to take on a greater role to bring interest rates lower.\u201cGreat decision \u2014 made all the more difficult by the huge pressure on the central bank from Erdogan,\u201d said Bluebay Asset Management LLC strategist Tim Ash. \u201cThe Turks just gave themselves a chance to hold the lira and rebuild the trust of the market.\u201dThe lira rose after the decision and was trading 3.1 per cent higher at 6.1604 per dollar at 2:23 p.m. in Istanbul. It has lost around 40 per cent of its value this year.Turkey\u2019s financial troubles have helped fuel an investor exodus from emerging markets in other regions \u2014 with the Argentine peso and the South African rand sliding. Rising U.S. interest rates have discouraged the riskier reach for yield, deepening home-grown crises.Before the move by policy makers in Ankara Thursday, the run on the currency forced the central bank to deliver some tightening where it could. They increased the cost of cash to commercial lenders by around 150 basis points last month by forcing them to use a borrowing tool costlier than the one-week repo rate.Earlier in the day, Erdogan published an executive decree that forces contracts between two entities in Turkey to be made in liras rather than foreign currencies.The measure applies to contracts on the buying and selling of any kind of property, real estate, transportation, financial leasing, leasing, services and products, according to the decree published in the Official Gazette.The measure will create \u201ctotal chaos\u201d and is probably impossible to implement within the time frame allotted, according to Hulusi Belgu, head of the Turkish shopping malls investors association.

Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite Index came close a four-year low, ignoring policy makers\u2019 attempts to lift sentiment.Here\u2019s what strategists are saying about the current state of play in Asian stocks:\u201cThere\u2019s more contagion coming from Turkey and Argentina events to the more externally susceptible economies like Indonesia and Philippines,\u201d said Ken Peng, strategist at Citigroup Inc. Both Southeast Asian nations have \u201cdouble deficits, they have inflation that is relatively high and rising. And their reserves are falling.\u201dThe \u201cclear concern\u201d in the short term is trade tensions, said Michael McCarthy, Sydney-based chief market strategist at CMC Markets. While signs of a de-escalation would be positive, that seems unlikely in the current environment, he added.\u201cThe biggest risk is trade,\u201d Citi\u2019s Peng said, citing that \u201cpeople are very afraid of\u201d the additional $200 billion in tariffs. He noted that the midterm elections on Nov. 6 is key and trade tensions may dissipate after that.The slump in Asian stocks is mainly due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against emerging-market currencies, Paul Kim, chief investment officer at Eastspring Investments said. He expects an outflow from emerging markets with the Federal Reserve still on course to increase interest rates.\u201cWe maintain a bearish stance on Asia and EM equities and expect further downgrades to consensus earnings estimates in coming months,\u201d said Jonathan Garner, managing director at Morgan Stanley, citing \u201ca slowdown in China\u2019s growth consequent upon credit tightening\u201d and weaker demand in autos and technology hardware.\u201cAsia is certainly cheaper and oversold now than the start of the year, and in my view closer to the end of its falls than the beginning. But given the risk around U.S. equities and the fact that any falls in U.S. equities will lead to a broad global risk-off sentiment, I suggest, it maybe premature to go in yet,\u201d AMP\u2019s Naeimi said.\u201cWe see that light at the end of the tunnel, but we\u2019re still kind of in the darkness ourselves,\u201d Citi\u2019s Peng said.

He\u2019ll now remain in office until the end of January 2020, roughly halfway through a period intended to smooth the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union.It also means he\u2019ll be available for longer should talks with the EU fail and force a so-called hard Brexit in March 2019.\u201cI have been discussing with the governor his ability to be able to serve a little longer in the post in order to ensure continuity through what could be quite a turbulent period for our economy in the early summer of 2019,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cThe governor has agreed, despite various personal pressures to conclude his term in June.\u201dThe pound was little changed after the news, despite the extension being shorter than some reports had suggested. \u201cI suppose its a compromise between acceding to the chancellor\u2019s wishes that he stays for as long as possible, and his own desire to go,\u201d said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank AG. \u201cIf he\u2019d gone for the full 12, that would have taken him through to mid-2020 and then his successor probably wouldn\u2019t have had much time to get their feet under the table before the transition deal expires.\u201dThe decision is likely to prove controversial as Carney\u2019s tenure at the BOE has long drawn both criticism and praise. He was seen as a key source of financial stability in the political power vacuum that followed the Brexit vote, but also drew the ire of pro-Brexit lawmakers who believe he waded too far into the political debate. He has been accused for much of his time at the bank of botching messages on policy.Carney himself has said many times his plan was to return to Canada following his tenure at the BOE. His new exit date effectively wipes out speculation he planned to run in the nation\u2019s next federal election, which has to be held by October 2019 at the latest.As the March Brexit deadline nears, the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the bloc remains unclear, with Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s current plan is proving unpopular with lawmakers both at home and abroad. Even so, the BOE raised interest rates to the highest since 2009 last month, and said a gradual series of hikes would be needed in coming years to control inflation.In a letter to Nicky Morgan, chair of the panel of lawmakers that scrutinizes the Treasury, Hammond said that the extension allows \u201cfor a new Governor to be appointed during the autumn next year.\u201dStill, the latest extension raises questions about the government\u2019s grasp on the Brexit process if Carney\u2019s presence is needed to ensure stability. It could also mean the Treasury is struggling to find a replacement while it focuses on the political negotiations.\u201cI recognize that during this critical period, it is important that everyone does everything they can to support a smooth and successful Brexit,\u201d Carney said in a letter to the chancellor. \u201cI am willing to do whatever I can in order to promote both a successful Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England.\u201dPotential candidates to succeed Carney include Andrew Bailey, currently head of the Financial Conduct Authority, or colleagues on the BOE\u2019s rate-setting committee such as Andy Haldane, Ben Broadbent or Dave Ramsden. Female candidates mentioned include Sharon White, head of the communications regulator, and Santander U.K. Plc Chair Shriti Vadera.\u201cIt provides a bit of stability, but the likes of Andrew Bailey, who was tipped to take over, I don\u2019t think would have made any radical departures in terms of monetary policy from the expected path,\u201d said Hetal Mehta, an economist at Legal & General Investment Management. \u201cWhoever would take over, had they taken over in June next year, or now its going to be January 2020, would be looking at a very gradual policy normalization, subject to the negotiations in terms of our relationship with the EU.\u201dCarney, the former Bank of Canada chief, was appointed BOE governor in late 2012 after previously saying he wasn\u2019t interested in the job. He initially said he\u2019d serve just five years of what is usually an eight-year term, but following the Brexit referendum agreed to remain in place an additional year to the end of June 2019.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada loses 51,600 jobs, led by Ontario's biggest drop in 9 years", "description": "Ontario lost 80,100 jobs in August, all part-time, the biggest decline since 2009", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadian-economy-loses-51600-jobs-led-by-plunge-in-ontario?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/jobless2.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 7, 2018 3:15 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy unexpectedly lost 51,600 jobs, with wage gains slowing and Ontario recording its biggest employment drop in nearly a decade, removing any urgency for the central bank to accelerate rate hikes.The nation\u2019s largest province lost 80,100 jobs in August, all part-time, the biggest decline for Ontario since 2009. Nationally, the economy lost 92,000 part-time workers, though a 40,400 gain in full-time employment is one sign the labour market is firmer than the headline number suggests.The data released Friday by Statistics Canada in Ottawa reversed strong employment gains made earlier this summer, including sharp increases in Ontario. But the overall picture is one of a labour market gearing down markedly from last year and an economy not at risk of overheating. That reinforces expectations the Bank of Canada will take a cautious approach to increasing borrowing costs.The jobs numbers are \u201cconsistent with a gradual rate hike path and really not a whole lot of urgency,\u201d said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.The Canadian dollar slipped after the jobs report, down as much as 0.3 per cent to 75.8 US cents. The currency rose as much as 0.4 per cent Thursday after Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said the central bank\u2019s top officials debated this week whether to accelerate the pace of potential interest rate hikes, before finally choosing to stick to their current \u201cgradual\u201d path.The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since mid-2017 to keep inflation from moving permanently beyond its 2 per cent target, and indicated it will need to make additional hikes to keep price gains from accelerating because the economy is roughly at capacity.So far in 2018, the economy has shed 14,600 jobs, but the number masks a 97,300 gain in full-time jobs. Part-time employment is down by 111,900 this year.The net loss in August \u2014 which was the second largest monthly decline since the last recession \u2014 drove the unemployment rate to 6 per cent, from 5.8 per cent a month earlier, while wage gains decelerated to their slowest this year. However, the jobless rate still remains near four-decade lows.Economists had expected a gain of 5,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.Other highlights:\u2022 Wage gains for all workers slowed in August, with average hourly pay up 2.9 per cent from a year ago. That\u2019s the slowest pace since December. Wage gains for permanent employees were down to 2.6 per cent, the slowest since October.\u2022 Actual hours worked were up 1.6 per cent from a year ago, after an increase of 1.3 per cent in July, reflecting the increase in full-time workers.\u2022 By industry, the decline was broad-based and included a loss of 16,400 jobs in construction and 22,100 in the professional services sector.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Satyajit Das", "title": "We may be facing a textbook emerging-market crisis", "description": "Opinion: The number of emerging markets\u00a0at risk extends well beyond Turkey and Argentina", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/we-may-be-facing-a-textbook-emerging-market-crisis", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/argentina.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 5, 2018 5:00 AM EDT", "content": "Emerging-market stresses have been building since at least 2013. Investors may have forgotten the effect of the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d\u00a0on the so-called Fragile Five\u00a0\u2013 Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey and South Africa \u2013 a term coined by Morgan Stanley to describe their vulnerability to capital outflows. Monetary accommodation, lower current-account deficits and growth disguised the underlying challenges, attracting more capital to those markets.The textbook recipe for an emerging-market crisis requires a large dose of debt and an associated domestic credit bubble, including misallocation of capital into uneconomic trophy projects or financial speculation. Then add: a\u00a0weak banking sector, budget deficits, current-account gaps, substantial short-term foreign-currency debt and inadequate forex\u00a0reserves. Season with narrowly based industrial structures, reliance on commodity exports, institutional weaknesses, corruption and poor political and economic leadership.Based on these criteria, the number of emerging markets\u00a0at risk extends well beyond Turkey and Argentina. Like Tolstoy\u2019s\u00a0families, each nation has different sources of unhappiness.Total emerging-market borrowing increased from US$21 trillion (or 145 per cent\u00a0of GDP) in 2007 to US$63 trillion (210 per cent\u00a0of GDP) in 2017. Borrowings by non-financial corporations and households have jumped. Since 2007, the foreign-currency debt \u2013\u00a0in dollars, euros and yen \u2013\u00a0of these countries doubled to around US$9 trillion. China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and some Eastern European countries have foreign-currency debt between 20 per cent\u00a0and 50 per cent\u00a0of GDP.In all, EM\u00a0borrowers need to repay or refinance around US$1.5 trillion in debt in 2019 and again in 2020. Many are not earning enough to meet these commitments.Turkey and Argentina have twin deficits (combined budget and current-account gaps as a percentage of GDP) of 8.7 per cent\u00a0and 10.4 per cent,\u00a0respectively, that require\u00a0financing. Pakistan has a twin deficit well above 10 per cent. Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Ukraine are at or above 5 per cent\u00a0on that basis. In India, if state governments are included the number approaches double figures. Those gauges are rising in China, Malaysia, Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Poland.Then look at reserve coverage \u2013 foreign-exchange holdings\u00a0divided by 12-month funding needs for the current account, short-term debt maturities and amortization of long-term debt \u2013\u00a0which\u00a0measures the capacity to meet immediate foreign-currency obligations. Turkey and Argentina score 0.4 and 0.6 respectively, meaning they can\u2019t cover\u00a0their needs without new borrowings. Pakistan, Ecuador, Poland, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Africa have reserve coverage of less than 1. Chile, Hungary, Colombia, Mexico and India have coverage\u00a0of less than 2. Brazil and China come in at 2.5 and 3.1 times, respectively.Even where reserve coverage appears adequate, caution is warranted. Long-term debt becomes short term with the passage of time or an acceleration event. Forex holdings may not be readily accessible. Much of China\u2019s US$3 trillion of reserves is committed to the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. The ability to turn U.S. Treasury bonds and other foreign assets into cash is limited by liquidity, price and currency effects. Reserve positions are notoriously opaque:\u00a0In 1997, the Bank of Thailand was found to have grossly overstated available currency holdings.China and India face well-documented difficulties in their financial systems.\u00a0The true level of Chinese non-performing loans\u00a0may be several times the official 1.75 per cent. India\u2019s NPL ratio is around 10 per cent\u00a0of all loans.Events in Turkey and Argentina show how these weaknesses become exposed. Global liquidity tightening, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve increasing rates and unwinding its bond purchases, reduces capital inflows and increases the cost of borrowing. Trade tensions, sanctions, the breakdown of the global institutional structure and rising geopolitical risks exacerbate those\u00a0stresses.Weaknesses in the real economy and the financial system feed each other in a vicious cycle. Capital withdrawals undermine currencies, driving\u00a0down prices of assets such as bonds, stocks and property. The reduced availability of finance and higher funding costs add to pressure on over-extended borrowers, triggering banking problems that feed back into the economy. Credit rating and investment downgrades extend the cycle.Policy responses can make things worse. Higher interest rates to prop up currencies (60 per cent\u00a0in Argentina) may be ineffective. They reduce growth and aggravate the debt burden. Weaker currencies import inflation. Supporting the financial system and the economy\u00a0pressures government finances. IMF remedies, which aren\u2019t\u00a0always effective, impose financial and human costs that many nations find unacceptable, prompting political and social breakdown. And the IMF\u2019s capacity to assist may be constrained by concurrent crises.Investors are assuming\u00a0that critical vulnerabilities have been addressed.Important changes made after the 1997 Asian crisis created different risks, however. Floating exchange rates and unrestricted foreign-exchange movement increase currency volatility and allow capital flight. While local-currency debt has increased, unhedged foreign-currency debt remains significant.Higher returns on local-currency debt attracted foreign investors to India, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa and Eastern Europe. But weakening currencies may drive them to exit, hurting all assets.Turkey and Argentina may be special cases. But given the fundamental problems, other emerging markets are likely to come under pressure.

Governor Stephen Poloz\u2019s job is to wean Canada off of easy money in a way that doesn\u2019t inadvertently damage the expansion and to do that, he needs to decide on two things: How high do interest rates need to go, and how quickly should policy makers raise borrowing costs to get there?As many as three more increases are priced in over the next year. In all, the market is expecting a string of hikes that will bring official borrowing rates back up to 2 per cent for the first time in a decade. Canada has the second highest central bank rate in the Group of Seven after the U.S.This is considered a gradual path for rate hikes. The central bank\u2019s models are already telling policy makers they\u2019re behind the curve on normalizing borrowing costs but last week\u2019s developments on the North American Free Trade Agreement highlight why Poloz will avoid rushing. Canada is still on the outside looking in on a NAFTA deal, has already been hit by U.S. metals tariffs and is facing Donald Trump\u2019s repeated threats of auto tariffs. None of this will be resolved by Wednesday and may be enough in itself to keep policy makers on hold.With the possibility of a trade shock to the economy still real, the Bank of Canada is wary of the consequences of having to reverse policy in midstream. And trade is just one of a long list of uncertainties \u2014 the list includes questions over whether the economy truly is at capacity \u2014 that has kept the central bank spreading out rate hikes.Another major unknown for policy makers is how high rates should go. The central bank\u2019s economists estimate the economy\u2019s \u201cneutral\u201d rate \u2014 a level that is neither stimulative or contractionary \u2014 is somewhere around 3 per cent, but Poloz has been explicit that there is plenty of uncertainty around that figure.It\u2019s possible that given high debt levels and other factors, such as the inability of the nation\u2019s businesses to capitalize on strong global demand, the economy can\u2019t really cope with an official rate of interest much above 2 per cent. Lending rates offered by commercial banks to their best customers are typically another 2 percentage higher than the overnight rate.Which is why markets are anticipating Poloz won\u2019t raise his benchmark rate much beyond 2 per cent by next year, and that he\u2019ll leave it there indefinitely until the question of what is \u201cnormal\u201d can be answered with more certainty.While normal remains a puzzle, there is more certainty about what is abnormal. For Poloz, it\u2019s a situation where the policy rate is below the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent inflation target. And, he has claimed, there is nothing in the economy now that would justify rates below that level.Canada is experiencing broad-based growth and absorbing much of the remaining slack in the economy. Evidence of tightening is mounting: the unemployment rate is hovering at four-decade lows, workers are getting bigger pay raises, and companies are reporting record job vacancies. Inflation is at a G7 leading 3 per cent.Which is why the central bank\u2019s hiking path still has at least a bit to go.\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "With all this talk about trade, we\u2019re missing the real problem with Canada\u2019s economy", "description": "The biggest threat to Canada's economic expansion lies within its own borders", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-isnt-the-biggest-problem-facing-canadas-packed-economy", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/al-hstfiles-02.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 29, 2018 1:39 PM EDT", "content": "The biggest threat to Canada\u2019s economic expansion lies within its own borders, even as President Donald Trump pushes protectionism from abroad.The home-grown news is that the Canadian economy is closer to overheating than faltering on the back of the trade uncertainty, forcing the Bank of Canada to respond with higher interest rates.Statistics Canada is expected to report Thursday that growth accelerated to an annualized 3 per cent in the second-quarter, the fastest pace in a year. That should offset a weaker start to 2018 and puts the expansion on track for a gain of more than 2 per cent for the whole year after 2017\u2019s strong 3.1 per cent advance.Such robust demand is exposing how little spare capacity the economy has. Companies are running up against production constraints and labour shortages, while an inflation rate of 3 per cent is the highest in the Group of Seven.\u201cTrade uncertainty is on everyone\u2019s mind but demand is strong and so for a number of our clients labour is a bigger issue, and it includes both finding qualified skilled labour as well as upward pressure on labour rates,\u201d Royal Bank of Canada Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said in a telephone interview last week.The evidence of tightening is everywhere: the unemployment rate is sitting at four-decade lows; pay raises are picking up; and companies are reporting increasing number of job vacancies. Job listings show businesses giving thousands of dollars in signing bonuses to hairstylists and mechanics.At the same time, Canada now relies entirely on immigrants to grow its workforce as the population ages. According to Statistics Canada, the number of landed immigrants in the labor force in July was up by 164,000 over the previous 12 months, and down 72,000 for people born in Canada.Economists including those at the Bank of Canada estimate the nation\u2019s economy can\u2019t grow more than 2 per cent before inflation kicks in. Which is why the big question for financial markets right now is not how fast the expansion runs, but how quickly rates rise and by how much.\u201cJust about every firm I talk to is talking about labour shortages,\u201d said Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia. \u201cThe labour issue is a dominant issue facing businesses right now.\u201dTo be sure a breakthrough on trade would help ease some of those capacity constraints. While companies can\u2019t do much about demographics, they can find ways around labour shortages by buying more equipment and adopting new technologies. More certainty on trade should bolster their confidence and willingness to invest, and make them willing to offer higher wages to draw more people into the labour force.No one though is expecting another investment renaissance in Canada that could change the overall growth trend, partly because companies are wary of overextending themselves in an economy that\u2019s slowing down.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s willingness to increase immigration will help, but this too is increasingly becoming a politically contentious issue. More immigrants are also no panacea, since evidence suggests they may be less productive than the workers they replace.All this may leave companies struggling to keep up with demand in the future, potentially fuelling inflationary pressures.Investors see near-certain odds that by October, the Bank of Canada will raise borrowing costs for a fifth time since the hiking cycle began in July 2017, with as many as two additional increases by mid-2019.The central bank\u2019s own models say it\u2019s behind the curve on normalizing borrowing costs from historically low levels, but Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has stuck to a gradual path in the belief there\u2019s still some slack in the labour force, particularly among youth and women, that could be drawn in with lower rates.Economists also don\u2019t unanimously agree that supply is the major bottleneck in advanced economies like Canada. It may be that companies aren\u2019t investing in capacity because demand is being weighed down by other things like unequal distribution of wealth or a debt overhang. If demand is the problem, rate hikes may not be the solution.But the Bank of Canada\u2019s options are limited, given its prime mandate is to tackle inflation, not structural problems such as income inequality or production constraints. And with inflation already a full percentage point above the 2 per cent target, Poloz\u2019s patience is being tested.With assistance from Doug AlexanderBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michelle Jamrisko", "title": "Canada should be afraid of this indicator now flashing red, Goldman says", "description": "The private-sector financial balance is more powerful in predicting crises than the current-account balance and Canada is running a sizeable deficit", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canada-should-be-afraid-of-this-indicator-flashing-red-goldman-says?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/canada-money.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 27, 2018 7:41 AM EDT", "content": "One under-appreciated indicator is flashing red for some developed markets, Goldman Sachs analysts say.The private-sector financial balance \u2014 an economy\u2019s total income minus the spending of all households and businesses \u2014 has proven more powerful in predicting crises than the current-account balance, Goldman analysts led by Jan Hatzius, the bank\u2019s global head of economics, wrote in an Aug. 23 research note.\u201cThe good news is that the biggest DM economies \u2014 the U.S., the Euro area, and Japan \u2014 are all running healthy private sector surpluses,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe not-so-good news is that some of the smaller DM economies \u2014 especially Canada and the U.K. \u2014 are running sizable deficits and appear vulnerable to higher interest rates and weaker asset markets.\u201dThe finding is another warning sign for the global economy at a time of sporadic turbulence arising from monetary tightening, U.S.-China trade battles, and stress in some emerging markets.A private-sector deficit means households and firms can\u2019t finance their current spending with current income and rely on net borrowing or asset sales, the Goldman analysts wrote. That makes growth and financial stability more vulnerable in an environment of rising rates or market declines, they said.Canada and the United Kingdom appear to be the most exposed, particularly given an overheated Canadian housing market and the threat of Brexit negotiations slamming income expectations and private spending, they said.A private-sector surplus, on the other hand, is a strong predictor of growth. Tallying 17 developed economies from the mid-1980s to the present, the analysts show that when the private sector balance is 1 percent of GDP higher, the GDP relative to potential rises about 0.4 percentage point faster in the ensuing three years \u2014 an impact that they judge \u201ceconomically large.\u201dA large private-sector deficit is a more reliable indicator than either debt growth or asset prices, the Goldman analysts said.

The deceleration ends CIBC\u2019s three-year streak of outpacing Canada\u2019s other large lenders on mortgage growth. Royal Bank of Canada said this week that mortgage balances were 5.9 per cent higher than a year earlier.CIBC executives said in May that domestic loan growth would \u201cmoderate\u201d in the second half of the year, with Canadian banking head Christina Kramer estimating that it would fall to \u201clow-single-digits\u201d by year-end. Her forecast was less than Canada\u2019s other big lenders, which have maintained \u201cmid-single-digit\u201d growth expectations for the year.Despite the mortgage slowdown, CIBC posted a 16 per cent jump in Canadian personal and commercial banking earnings due to a \u201csignificant\u201d expansion of deposit margins and growth in credit cards and unsecured loans amid rising interest rates, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Glass said.\u201cThose would be the major offsets in terms of mortgage growth declining,\u201d Glass said in a phone interview. \u201cMortgages are a key product for us \u2014 it\u2019s very important from a client relationship perspective \u2014 but it\u2019s not a high margin product, so if mortgages come off it has a far smaller impact than rate increases do, for instance.\u201dCIBC has the greatest relative exposure to Canada\u2019s housing market, with a higher percentage of earnings coming from domestic personal and commercial banking than its bigger rivals. CIBC\u2019s growth has cooled since it stopped expanding its team of mobile-mortgage advisers that fuelled a surge in home-loan balances, with year-over-year growth peaking last year at around 12 per cent. Government measures to slow Canada\u2019s heated housing market, including tougher mortgage-qualification rules imposed in January, have also affected demand.Net income for the quarter rose 25 per cent to $1.37 billion, or $3.01 a share, from $1.1 billion, or $2.60, a year earlier, CIBC said in a statement. Adjusted profit, which excludes some items, was $3.08 a share, compared with the $2.93 average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank increased its quarterly dividend 2.3 per cent to C$1.36 a share.Shares of CIBC rose 0.8 per cent to $122.74 at 10:41 a.m. in Toronto, its highest intraday price since Jan. 22 and the best performance in the S&P/TSX Canadian Banks Index. The stock has gained 0.2 per cent this year, compared with the 2.4 per cent advance of the eight-company index.On Wednesday, Royal Bank posted third-quarter profit that beat estimates on gains in wealth management, capital markets and personal-and-commercial banking. Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal are scheduled to report results on Aug. 28, followed by National Bank of Canada on Aug. 29 and Toronto-Dominion Bank on Aug. 30.Here\u2019s a summary of CIBC\u2019s results:Revenue rose 11 per cent to $4.55 billion from a year earlier, while non-interest expenses increased 4.9 per cent to $2.57 billion.The bank set aside $241 million for soured loans, up 15 per cent from a year earlier due mainly to higher losses in its CIBC FirstCaribbean bank.Earnings from Canadian personal and small business banking climbed 14 per cent to $639 million.Canadian commercial banking and wealth management profit rose 20 per cent to $350 million.U.S. commercial banking and wealth, including contributions from its PrivateBank takeover, were $162 million, compared with $41 million a year ago.Capital markets earnings increased 5.2 per cent to $265 million.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Lu Wang and Elena Popina", "title": "S&P 500\u00a0in longest bull run ever but still this market has plenty of skeptics", "description": "Despite various crises nipping at its heels, what hasn't killed this bull market has usually made it stronger", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/sp-500-ends-drought-with-new-high-as-bulls-and-bears-duke-it-out", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/longest-bull-ever.png", "publishedAt": "August 22, 2018 4:42 PM EDT", "content": "For a few minutes, anyway, investors had permission to put the traumas of February and March behind them in stocks. Then Washington crashed the party and the celebration went back on ice.The S&P 500 has come virtually straight down after peeking above its Jan. 26 high around midday Tuesday, as the legal entanglements of two former aides to President Donald Trump drained the market of cheer. More reversal than rout, the downdraft was still a blow for bulls who\u2019ve waited six months to call the correction over.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to create a lot of fear that will cause people to sell, but it will definitely force people to step back and refrain from buying,\u201d said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. \u201cFewer buyers in a rather thin market can cause a further downside.\u201dAfter spending 142 trading days without a record, the dry spell ended Tuesday as the S&P 500 climbed to a new intraday high of 2,873.23. The elevation had additional poignancy, arriving the night before the 9 1/2-year bull market becomes by some measures the longest in history.Still, if you\u2019re tempted to bail there may be reason to restrain the impulse. If history is of any guide, investors have often been better off ignoring the clustering milestones and hanging on, because buying stocks after a breakout has proved to be a winning strategy.Since 1927, the S&P 500 has endured 17 other prolonged stretches without records. After the drought ended, all but one saw stocks go higher over the next 12 months. On average, the index rose 13 percent, compared with 7.7 percent over any one-year period.\u201cThere is a lot of talk about the end of cycle and how close it is,\u201d said Andrew Hopkins, head of equity research at Wilmington Trust Co., which oversees more than $80 billion. \u201cBut from an economic standpoint, it doesn\u2019t look like that way. It looks like we\u2019re still in pretty solid shape.\u201dIndeed, U.S. gross domestic product expanded at the fastest pace in four years during the April-June period and corporate America just posted two quarters of 24 percent profit increases. The buoyancy is in stark contrast with the rest of the world, where the MSCI Emerging Market Index is down 18 percent from its peak and the Stoxx Europe 600 index is headed for its third monthly decline in four.The resilience has done little to mute bears, who say growth is peaking and a confluence of forces \u2014 from rising interest rates to a potential global trade war \u2014 threaten to derail the economy.While the market is near uncharted territory, the euphoric buying that drove stocks to one of the best starts of a year is nowhere to be found. Over the past month, investors put $15 billion into exchange-traded funds that focus on U.S. stocks. That compared with $40 billion during January.Rather than relentlessly chasing winners, investors are slowly rotating money out of darling companies, such as tech giants, and into laggards like drug makers and industrial conglomerates. A preference for safety is creeping back, with consumer staples and health-care shares leading the market over the past two months.As a result, fewer stocks are flagging momentum warnings. At Monday\u2019s close, 67 members in the S&P 500 posted readings above 70 in their 14-day relative strength index, one third of what was seen seven months ago.\u201cI would be more concerned if there weren\u2019t worries in the market. That would mean you get an euphoric blow-off,\u201d said Malcolm Polley, who oversees $1.2 billion as president and chief investment officer at Stewart Capital Advisors LLC in Indiana, Pennsylvania. \u201cThe fact that there are worries means people are realistic in their assumptions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market always climbs a wall of worries \u2014 always.\u201dSkepticism has been the signature characteristic of this bull market. Since the rally began in March 2009, fear has been a constant companion, from Europe\u2019s debt crisis in 2010 to the downgrade of U.S. sovereign rating in 2011 and China\u2019s currency devaluation in 2015. Now it\u2019s fear of peaking growth.Yet, what hasn\u2019t killed this bull market has usually made it stronger. Five 10 percent corrections later and $300 billion pulled out of U.S. equity ETFs and mutual funds, the decade-long advance just equaled the No. 1 title from the one during the dot-com era.Is it closer to the end of the cycle than to the start? Sure, nobody doubts that. And there are tangible signs that equity valuations are getting stretched. Sure, the S&P 500 trades at 2.2 times sales, in line with the peak levels seen in 2000. But look at the median price-sales ratio for the index\u2019s members, which strips out market-cap bias: it\u2019s twice as high. In other words, overvaluation was highly concentrated to tech giants in the years of internet frenzy. Right now, everything is expensive.While bulls take comfort in forecasts for sales and profits to keep rising over the next two years, helping ease the multiple pressure, skeptics find fault in the downward slope of the growth trajectory. Both S&P 500 revenue and earnings will increase at roughly half this year\u2019s pace in 2020, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\u201cThe earnings and economy growth were better. The question is, can you do it again?\u201d said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Bailing out too early can be costly. A study by Bank of America Corp. on market peaks since 1937 shows that being uninvested in the last year of an advance meant foregoing one-fifth of the rally\u2019s overall return. While every episode is different, that math roughly translates into additional 550 points in the S&P 500, if the bull market goes on for another year.Rather than worrying over what could trigger the next drawdown, investors should focus on things that could drive the market higher, according to Steve Auth, chief investment officer of equities at Federated Investors Inc. His list of positive catalysts include: persistently subdued inflation, a signal from the Fed to end rate hikes, easing trade tensions, and a lasting trend in better-than-expected economic and earnings data.Bears \u201cmay be waiting in vain\u201d for the next selloff, Auth wrote in a note to clients this month, reiterating his call for the S&P 500 to end the year at 3,100. \u201cStocks running out of excuses for not going up.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Torres", "title": "Fed signals it's ready to hike interest rates again if economy stays on track", "description": "Fed minutes showed that officials may raise rates again 'soon' if the economy keeps performing well", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-signals-its-ready-to-hike-interest-rates-again-if-economy-stays-on-track", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/powell.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 22, 2018 3:50 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. central bankers are ready to raise interest rates again so long as the economy stays on track, according to a record of the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent policy meeting.\u201cMany participants suggested that if incoming data continued to support their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate to take another step in removing policy accommodation,\u201d minutes of the July 31-Aug. 1 Federal Open Market Committee meeting released Wednesday in Washington said.The minutes said that \u201cfurther gradual increases\u201d in their target rate \u201cwould be consistent with a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labour market conditions and inflation near the committee\u2019s symmetric 2 per cent objective over the medium term.\u201dLed by Jerome Powell, a Trump appointee who took over the chairmanship in February, policy makers are gradually raising rates.

The president nominates the Fed\u2019s chairman and other governors in Washington, but the agency is independent and has historically frustrated presidents by raising interest rates without regard for politics.Trump has publicly lamented the central bank\u2019s recent rate increases, but his private remarks to donors are the most personal criticism of Powell\u2019s performance to emerge so far. The people who described the comments asked not to be identified because the fundraiser was closed to the public.His jabs built on an attack he leveled at Powell\u2019s Fed in July, when he pronounced himself \u201cnot thrilled\u201d with the rate increases. That broadside, in an interview with CNBC, broke with a more than two-decade-old norm of presidents avoiding comments on monetary policy out of respect for the Fed\u2019s independence.The dollar, as measured by the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, reached its weakest level of the day following the report on Trump\u2019s comments at the fundraiser.Even as Trump complains, the Fed is moving more slowly to raise interest rates than it has in previous economic expansions. Interest rates are low by historical standards given an unemployment rate below 4 percent and, in recent months, accelerating economic growth.Powell and his colleagues have justified a cautious approach toward increasing rates by pointing to sluggish inflation, which has shown no sign of jumping significantly past the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target.The Fed last raised rates in June, to a target range of 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent. That\u2019s seen by most economists as below the so-called neutral rate of interest by about 1 percentage point, meaning the Fed is still adding fuel to U.S. growth rather than restraining the economy.The Fed has penciled in two more interest rate increases this year, according to projections it updated in June. Investors see a 90 per cent chance that the Fed will raise rates at its September meeting.White House spokesman Hogan Gidley and Federal Reserve spokesman David Skidmore declined to comment.About 60 people attended Trump\u2019s fundraiser at the Southampton home of Howard Lorber, the chairman of hot dog company Nathan\u2019s Famous.

It was a humid night and Trump joked that Lorber could have afforded better air conditioning, according to one of the people.An RNC spokeswoman said the event raised about US$3 million for the Trump Victory Committee, which benefits both the president\u2019s campaign and the party.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Crystal Tse and Manuel Baigorri", "title": "Cryptocurrency's millennial mining tycoon is planning a $3-billion IPO", "description": "If the IPO proceeds, it would be a major test of investor appetite for crypto companies after digital coins tumbled more than 75 per cent since January", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/cryptocurrencys-millennial-mining-tycoon-is-planning-a-3-billion-ipo?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/bitcoin-mining.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 15, 2018 1:01 PM EDT", "content": "Bitmain Technologies Ltd., the world\u2019s biggest producer of cryptocurrency mining chips, is planning a Hong Kong initial public offering that could raise as much as US$3 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said.The Beijing-based company, whose 32-year-old co-founder Jihan Wu is one of the most powerful players in crypto, plans to file a listing application with the Hong Kong stock exchange as early as September, according to the people.

These are particularly good for the brute-force number crunching required by cryptocurrency miners, who verify virtual currency transactions and earn crypto-denominated rewards by solving complex math problems. ASICs are also useful for the heavy workloads associated with some forms of AI, such as machine learning.Wu said in the May interview that Bitmain booked US$2.5 billion of revenue last year and that he and co-founder Micree Zhan together owned about 60 per cent of the business. He added at the time that he was open to a listing in Hong Kong \u2014 or in an overseas market with U.S. dollar-denominated shares \u2014 in part because it would give early investors including Sequoia Capital and IDG Capital a chance to cash out.Details of Bitmain\u2019s listing haven\u2019t been finalized, and its fundraising target could change, the people said. Nishant Sharma, a Beijing-based spokesman for Bitmain, declined to comment.Speculation about Bitmain\u2019s IPO plans and finances has intensified in recent days. The cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk reported on Aug. 10 that Bitmain was seeking to raise as much as $18 billion in an IPO, citing documents it had obtained. Unverified investor presentations purporting to show details of Bitmain\u2019s business have been circulating online, prompting discussions in crypto circles over the company\u2019s exposure to falling virtual currency prices.While Bitmain gets most of its revenue from mining equipment sales, it also runs some of the world\u2019s biggest mining collectives, in which members combine their processing capacity and split the rewards.The company\u2019s outsized role has prompted a backlash from some virtual currency purists, who disdain anything that hints of a concentration of power in the crypto ecosystem. Wu\u2019s support for Bitcoin Cash, an offshoot of Bitcoin, has also stoked controversy.Despite its dominant position, Bitmain will face plenty of competition as it courts investors. Canaan Inc., a maker of crypto mining gear that\u2019s also working on AI applications, has already filed for a Hong Kong IPO. The company will aim to raise about US$1 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said in May. Ebang International Holdings Inc., another producer of mining gear, has also disclosed its intention to list in the city.There\u2019s no guarantee investors will pile in, especially given the recent weakness in Hong Kong\u2019s stock market amid jitters over rising interest rates and a U.S.-China trade war. The city\u2019s benchmark Hang Seng Index has dropped 18 per cent from this year\u2019s high in January, one of the biggest declines among major markets worldwide over the period.\u201cI don\u2019t think people will be too interested,\u201d said Alex Wong, Hong Kong-based director of asset management at Ample Capital Ltd., in reference to share sales by crypto mining companies. \u201cWhen the demand for Bitcoin diminishes, their revenue can drop very fast.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Asli Kandemir, Ercan Ersoy and Constantine Courcoulas", "title": "Turkey makes it harder for banks to short lira in latest move to contain crisis", "description": "While the move helped raise the lira, the currency is still down 20 per cent in August, and investors are demanding higher interest rates before they return", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/turkey-makes-it-harder-for-banks-to-short-lira-in-latest-move-to-contain-crisis?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/turkey-lira.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 15, 2018 9:15 AM EDT", "content": "Turkey took its boldest steps yet to try to ward off a financial crisis by making it harder for traders to bet against the battered lira and easing rules on restructuring troubled loans that have already topped $20 billion.As President Recep Tayyip Erdogan intensified a diplomatic feud with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump with a spate of new import tariffs, the nation\u2019s banking regulator published new rules that have so far succeeded at lifting the lira off record lows. Investors continued to demand higher interest rates.The measures \u201care aimed at the symptoms of recent lira weakness and not the cause,\u201d said Nigel Rendell, an analyst at Medley Global Advisors LLC in London. \u201cThe cure for a persistently weak currency is not rocket science \u2014 nor is it liquidity measures and policy tweaks \u2014 it is higher interest rates.\u201dErdogan, who tightened his grip on power in June elections, is refusing to give in to pressure from Trump to release an evangelical pastor who he accuses of aiding a coup attempt against him two years ago. A court on Wednesday rejected an appeal for the release of Andrew Brunson from house arrest.The standoff between the two NATO allies has escalated quickly since Trump slapped sanctions on the interior and justice ministers on Aug. 1, following that move with tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports last week.In retaliation on Wednesday, Turkey said it was imposing taxes of ranging from 50 to 140 per cent on rice, alcohol and cars from the U.S. That comes after Erdogan called on Turks to boycott American electronics, like the iPhone, which have in any case become a lot more expensive as the lira lost almost 40 per cent of its value this year.The collapse, which intensified this month and triggered contagion that spread across emerging markets, is making it much more costly for businesses to refinance at least US$16 billion in bonds denominated in foreign currencies that are due by year-end, according to calculations by Bloomberg.Businesses that earn revenues in lira and have dollar loans are also struggling. While officially the bad debt ratio at Turkey\u2019s banks is just 3 per cent, lenders are in the process of renegotiating upwards of US$20 billion of loans to try to prevent them from going into default.Against this backdrop, the nation\u2019s banking regulator issued back-to-back statements starting late on Tuesday to try to ward off a crisis. The steps spurred a 3 per cent gain in the lira to 6.1648 per dollar by 1:56 p.m. in Istanbul, after an 8.4 per cent advance on Tuesday. The recovery also spilled into the bond market, with yields on 10-year local debt falling 28 basis points to 21.1 percent.The regulator gave banks more flexibility in dealing with Turkish companies and individuals who aren\u2019t able to make debt payments. Banks can extend the maturities, refinance loans, extend new debt to help troubled companies, and seek new collateral. They can also demand debtors sell assets to repay loans. Overdue loans can now be restructured within two years from the day a framework agreement is signed.In another unconventional step, the regulator said that until markets \u201cnormalize,\u201d it would temporarily stop applying the effect of day-to-day losses on the securities held by banks to their capital adequacy ratios.Then on Wednesday, it limited the amount of currency swap transactions banks can participate in by half to 25 per cent of shareholder equity, after imposing a 50 per cent limit on Monday from none earlier. What this does is prevent investors, like hedge funds, from accessing lira liquidity in the offshore swap market. This drives up short-term borrowing costs and makes it less appealing to borrow liras from local lenders to bet against, or short, it.The lira is still down 20 per cent in August and many investors will wait for steep interest-rate hikes from the central bank before they return, especially with inflation at a 15-year high of almost 16 per cent and climbing. On Tuesday, Turkish companies and banks joined the call for higher interest rates to stabilize the situation.\u201cThis is the usual smoke and mirrors. It can buy time, finger in the dike, but the longer term issues remain,\u201d said Tim Ash, a senior emerging-market strategist at Bluebay Asset Management LLC in London.While policy makers have hiked lending rates by 500 basis points this year to 17.75 per cent, they\u2019re under constant pressure from Erdogan to keep rates low because he thinks it\u2019s better for the economy. Before winning near-absolute power in June, he pledged to meddle more in monetary policy.With the diplomatic spat with the U.S. showing no signs of letting up, Erdogan will be speaking with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday and French President Emmanuel Macron Thursday, his spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said in Ankara.According to Bloomberg calculations, Turkey\u2019s new tariffs affect goods that accounted for US$1 billion of imports last year, similar to the value of the metals subjected to higher U.S. taxes. The decision shows Turkey giving a proportionate response to American \u201cattacks\u201d on the Turkish economy, Vice President Fuat Oktay said in a tweet.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ellen Milligan", "title": "Turkey currency crisis pulls oil down, sparks sell-off in emerging markets", "description": "And there are fears it's only going to get worse as U.S. sanctions push the country toward a full-blown financial meltdown", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/turkeys-currency-crisis-pulls-oil-down-sparks-sell-off-in-emerging-markets?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/turkey1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 13, 2018 2:57 PM EDT", "content": "Oil fell as Turkey\u2019s economic strife sparked an emerging-market sell-off, fuelling fears of broader market turmoil.Futures fell as much as 0.7 per cent in New York on Monday.

Debt coming due & we are raising rates \u2014 Really?\u201dIn the flurry of tweets, Trump smashed two pillars of U.S. economy policy over the past quarter century. Presidents have traditionally delegated the nation\u2019s stance on the dollar to the Treasury secretary, who usually hews to the position that a strong dollar is good for the economy. Past presidents have also steered clear of commenting on U.S. monetary policy out of respect for the Fed\u2019s independence so the path of borrowing costs doesn\u2019t move with the whims of politicians.The question is whether Trump\u2019s remarks mark the beginning of a new era of greater U.S. intervention, one in which the president and members of his cabinet feel free to weigh in on economic issues that were traditionally seen as outside the political domain.China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day \u2013 taking away our big competitive edge. As usual, not a level playing field\u2026\u2026.The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well. Tightening now hurts all that we have done. The U.S. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals. Debt coming due & we are raising rates \u2013 Really?In the meantime, currency traders may need to pay closer attention to the president\u2019s Twitter feed. The dollar, which has strengthened more than 5 per cent since the middle of April, fell after Trump\u2019s remarks. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid as much as 0.74 per cent, its biggest intraday decline since March, before paring its loss to about 0.6 per cent.\u201cIt breaks with the consistency in the dollar messaging that we\u2019ve had over the last 25 years, which has provided a strong backstop for market-determined exchange rates,\u201d said Shaun Osborne, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. \u201cAt the very least, it injects uncertainty into the markets. If we see a consistent drumbeat on this from the president, it probably is going to weigh on the dollar.\u201dTrump\u2019s dismissal of economic-policy tenets shifts attention during a week when he\u2019s facing growing pressure over his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his lukewarm support for the finding by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 election.In the short term, the president\u2019s jawboning could affect everything from his trade war with China to the Group of 20 consensus on currencies.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is heading to Buenos Aires on Friday for two days of talks with his G20 counterparts, where he will likely face questions about U.S. dollar policy. At their last meeting, G20 finance chiefs stuck to their commitment to avoid devaluing their currencies for competitive purposes. The Treasury didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on the president\u2019s remarks on the dollar.\u201cThe secretary will almost certainly hear complaints about these remarks at the G20, especially in his bilateral discussions,\u201d said Mark Sobel, a former senior Treasury official who left earlier this year, after serving as U.S. executive director at the International Monetary Fund.The Trump administration\u2019s own fiscal policy may be contributing to the strong dollar and the nation\u2019s growing trade deficit, said Sobel. The IMF projects the U.S. trade deficit will widen as tax cuts and spending increases enacted this year stoke demand for imports.The view that China and the euro area are manipulating their currencies contradicts the Treasury\u2019s own currency report, which found in April that no major U.S. trade partner is gaming its exchange rate.Trump has so far focused on using tariffs to force China to change its trade practices. His comments on the yuan indicate the president is willing to drag currencies into the conflict, which shows little sign of abating. The yuan tumbled this week to its lowest value in a year, raising questions about whether Beijing was letting the currency weaken to insulate itself from American trade measures.Trump\u2019s comments will make life difficult for both the Treasury and the Fed, said Tony Fratto, former White House deputy press secretary under George W. Bush and founder of Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington. \u201cNow any decision that the Fed makes, market participants are going to try to put it in the context of what they know are the president\u2019s and the administration\u2019s desires.\u201dThe Fed has raised interest rates five times since Trump took office in January 2017, with two of those coming this year under Chairman Jerome Powell, the president\u2019s pick to replace Janet Yellen. On Thursday, Trump said he\u2019s \u201cnot thrilled\u201d with the rise in borrowing rates.Trump has been on a mission to reduce the US$552-billion U.S. trade deficit and rebuild the nation\u2019s manufacturing sector.

In the interview, Trump called Powell a \u201cvery good man.\u201dPowell addressed Congress earlier this week and told lawmakers that \u201cfor now \u2014 the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate.\u201d Fed officials have penciled in two more hikes this year.Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith declined to comment. Powell last week told American Public Media\u2019s \u201cMarketplace\u201d program that the Fed has \u201ca long tradition here of conducting policy in a particular way, and that way is independent of all political concerns.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t the first time in history the Fed has faced pressure from a U.S. president. But the past three administrations under Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama have refrained from publicly commenting on policy decisions.Most developed-world central banks are given a degree of independence from governments so monetary policy doesn\u2019t succumb to the whims of politicians. In emerging markets such as Turkey, the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has felt no such restraint.It\u2019s long been speculated that the taboo of commenting on U.S. monetary policy could change under Trump, who slammed the Fed during his election campaign and has demonstrated repeatedly his willingness to flout the conventions and sensibilities of establishment Washington.While it\u2019s been many years, the White House has also been known to exert other forms of pressure. In December 1965, Lyndon Johnson famously summoned Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin to his ranch in Stonewall, Texas, to confront him over Martin\u2019s decision to lift rates. Martin held his ground.The same couldn\u2019t be said for Arthur Burns under Richard Nixon. Oval Office tapes later revealed that Nixon demanded Burns goose the economy with low rates ahead of the 1972 election. When Burns didn\u2019t immediately cooperate, the White House planted a false story in the press that Burns was seeking a big pay raise, according to a book by Nixon speech writer William Safire. Eventually Burns relented, aiding Nixon but also helping to feed runaway inflation that dogged the U.S. economy for nearly a decade.The last known example of U.S. presidential strong-arming came when George H. W. Bush was fighting for re-election. Bush\u2019s White House pushed Alan Greenspan behind the scenes on rates and openly called on the Fed to lower its benchmark in June 1992. Greenspan did lower rates 13 times over 1991-92, but slowed the pace of cuts in the latter year, much to the White House\u2019s annoyance.\u2013With assistance from Jeanna Smialek and Benjamin Purvis.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Maciej Onoszko", "title": "If there ever was a time for corporate Canada to be more adventurous in the bond market, it's now", "description": "Demand is there for the taking", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/funds/long-end-no-oasis-despite-flattest-canadian-curve-in-a-decade", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/toronto_finance.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 19, 2018 2:16 PM EDT", "content": "If there ever was a time for corporate Canada to be more adventurous in the bond market, it\u2019s now.Yields on 30-year government debt have plunged to more than a decade-low relative to the short end in the wake of the Bank of Canada\u2019s latest interest rate hike. That means there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for issuers to lock in low borrowing costs for longer, especially since demand for long-term debt is \u201cabsolutely huge,\u201d as central bank Governor Stephen Poloz said last week.Yet corporate issuance of long-term bonds is lower this year than in 2017, even though the spread between two-year and 30-year bonds was more than 75 basis points wider a year ago and bond sales across all maturities are heading for a record this year.\u201cThere is an old expression: \u2018Feed the ducks when they are quacking,\u201d\u2018 said Jeff Herold, who oversees $2 billion as chief executive officer of Toronto-based J. Zechner Associates.Two-year government bonds yielded about 1.93 per cent on Wednesday, while 30-years traded about 2.20 per cent, leaving the difference between the two at 27 basis points. The spread shrank to 23 basis points on July 11 after the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate to 1.5 per cent. That was the narrowest since before the financial crisis in 2007.At this time last year, when the central bank was only starting to tighten monetary policy, the spread was more than 100 basis points. While yields on Canada\u2019s 30-year bonds fell seven basis points in the past 12 months, two-year yields have risen 71 basis points, increasing the relative attractiveness of longer bonds from the issuer\u2019s perspective.\u201cIn spite of a flatter yield curve, we have not experienced an increase in corporate issuance at the longer end in Canada,\u201d said Marc St-Onge, managing director and global head of debt capital markets at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cWe expect to see more domestic corporate issuance in the long end as conditions remain favorable.\u201dCIBC was the sole lead on Canada\u2019s largest 30-year corporate bond this year, $800 million of securities issued by TransCanada Corp. in June. But issuance of bonds of 30 years or longer has totaled $4.6 billion this year, compared with $5.9 billion in the same period a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Total corporate bond issuance is at $66.7 billion year-to-date, the highest since at least 2007 when Bloomberg started tracking the data, and on course to beat last year\u2019s record of almost $110 billion for the full year.Speculation is brewing investors\u2019 obsession with corporate debt is reaching an end game after years of heavy issuance. The average spread between Canadian corporate debt and its government benchmark reached 115 basis points on Tuesday, the highest in more than a year, according to a Bloomberg Barclays index. Corporate bonds have returned just 0.8 per cent this year, on track for the worst return since 2008, though bonds maturing in 10 years and longer have almost doubled the return of the broader market.CIBC\u2019s St-Onge attributes the drop in long-term supply to more bond transactions from the automobile sector and banks, which traditionally finance themselves in the shorter parts of the curve.Yet demand is there for the taking. Pension funds and other asset managers are buying up long-term bonds in oversubscribed deals as trade tensions make equities more risky, Poloz said last week, after raising interest rates by 25 basis points for the fourth time in the past year.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rich Miller", "title": "The front-line fighters of the financial crisis are getting nervous about the next one", "description": "Bernanke, Geithner and Paulson worry emergency powers have faded and debt has doubled", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bernanke-geithner-paulson-voice-some-concern-about-next-crisis", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/fighters.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 18, 2018 2:05 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve policy makers appear confident that they have the weapons they\u2019ll need to fight the next financial crisis.

The trio also decried the nation\u2019s ballooning budget deficits in a joint briefing with reporters.Publicly-held federal debt now stands at 77% of GDP, double what it was in 2007\u201cWe\u2019ve got better defences against the more mild, typical sets of shocks that happen to economies and financial systems but in the extreme crisis probably less degree of freedom, more constraints than would be ideal,\u201d former Treasury Secretary and New York Federal Reserve Bank President Geithner said.The U.S. instituted a raft of reforms after the last crisis drove the economy into its worst recession since the Great Depression. Some were designed to fortify the country\u2019s biggest banks and make it easier to shut them down so they wouldn\u2019t have to be rescued by the government if they ran into trouble.Others though limited the discretionary power of the Fed, the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to provide financial institutions with support as lawmakers responded to a public backlash against bailouts and Wall Street.Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles acknowledged in April that the tools available to regulators in an emergency had changed. But he told a conference in Washington, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too negative about our ability to respond in the future.\u201dHis boss, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, has voiced confidence in the government\u2019s ability to shut down a failing financial institution in a crisis without having to sink money in it, telling lawmakers in November that no bank is too big to fail.Geithner, who is president of private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, argued that the emergency powers that proved so essential a decade ago are \u201csomewhat weaker\u201d today.Former Treasury Secretary Paulson agreed, pointing in particular to the limits that Congress placed on the FDIC and the Treasury\u2019s Exchange Stabilization Fund.\u201cThere is some concern there,\u201d said former Fed Chairman Bernanke, who is now a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, though he also noted that regulators are now more attuned to potential systemic risks.The former Fed chief, who was nominated by George W. Bush and given a second term by Barack Obama, criticized the deficit-ballooning tax cuts and spending increases agreed to by President Donald Trump and Congress as ill-timed. Bernanke noted that they come as the country is at or near full employment. He also voiced concern about the longer-term consequences of rapidly rising government debt.\u201cIf we don\u2019t act, that is the most certain fiscal or economic crisis we will have,\u201d said Paulson, who chairs his own institute in Chicago. \u201cIt will slowly strangle us.\u201dThe enlarged deficits and debt also mean that the government has less room to pump up demand than it did during the last crisis, when Obama pushed through a massive stimulus package, Geithner said.Publicly-held federal debt now stands at 77 per cent of gross domestic product, double what it was in 2007.The Fed, too, has less scope to act as interest rates are lower, Geithner said. The central bank\u2019s benchmark rate target is now 1.75 to 2 per cent. It was 5.25 per cent in July 2007.Bernanke though noted that the U.S. central bank is better positioned to respond than other advanced economies. The European Central Bank, for instance, has a benchmark interest rate of zero.The former Fed chairman said the U.S. had made \u201ca lot of progress\u201d toward being able to resolve failing financial institutions without having to bail them out.Paulson basically agreed, with one big proviso. In the midst of a crisis, policy makers may have to provide temporary support so that a collapsing institution can be liquidated over time \u2014 even if that proves politically difficult to do.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have this authority but somebody has got to be prepared to use it and use it in controversial ways,\u201d he said.Asked if policy makers and politicians would be able to set aside their differences to tackle any future turmoil given the toxic atmosphere in Washington, Paulson replied that the answer is \u201cunknowable.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cit\u2019s the right question to ask.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Toronto\u2019s 17% surge leads Canada\u2019s biggest gain in home sales this year", "description": "June data suggests real estate may be starting to turn the corner, says CREA", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/crea-reports-june-home-sales-down-10-7-from-year-ago-but-up-from-may?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/1115sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 16, 2018 12:20 PM EDT", "content": "Canadian home sales rose in June at the fastest pace this year, led by a 17 per cent surge in Toronto, a sign the market may be regaining strength.Transactions climbed 4.1 per cent from May after touching a five-year low, the Canadian Real Estate Association reported Monday from Ottawa.

Move to Vancouver.While policymakers from Seattle to Boston lament a growing urban affordability crisis, a new study of home prices and earnings across more than 100 major U.S. and Canadian metropolitan areas shows Vancouver in an ignominious class of its own.The median cost of a Vancouver home, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is US$672,000 \u2014 costly but still 15 per cent to 26 per cent below that of San Jose and San Francisco, the two most expensive housing markets, according to Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University\u2019s City Program, whose study accounted for the difference in buying power of a dollar across geographies and currencies.What pushes Vancouver to the top of the unaffordability rankings is paltry wages. In Canada\u2019s third-largest city, the median household earns the equivalent of US$61,036 a year \u2014 in line with Columbus and less than families in Omaha, Nebraska, Kansas City, Missouri and even Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a rural community of 59,000 known for cornfields.The Pacific Coast city\u2019s property market is entering a slowdown after policymakers intervened with a slew of measures to temper demand, including a foreign buyers tax and tighter mortgage rules, along with higher interest rates. Sales hit a five-year low last month, while the number of homes on the market swelled to the most in three years.But the figures show just how difficult it will be to close the affordability gap after a run up that\u2019s seen the price of a typical home triple since 2005.\u201cYou need one of two things: either Vancouver real estate prices need to halve to attain a certain level of affordability, or you need to double incomes,\u201d Yan said.As for Toronto, Canada\u2019s biggest city is the eighth most expensive housing market on the list. With a median household annual income of US$65,833 \u2014 about as unaffordable as San Francisco or San Jose but still better than Vancouver. Low wages aren\u2019t a Canadian problem either. Calgary, the oil-and-gas capital, ranks fourth on the continent in household earnings with US$83,650, while a well-paid government sector puts Ottawa above Dallas, Portland and Chicago with US$68,925 a year.An outright correction would be potentially devastating \u2014 real estate development is the province\u2019s largest industry and housing a key driver of the local economy.

Prices of so-called non-tradeables \u2014 hospital stays and college tuition, to name two \u2014 have surged.\u201cWe would have fewer choices, potentially less quality, less productivity and higher prices if we reverse globalization,\u201d said Timothy Adams, president of the Washington-based Institute of International Finance, who\u2019s discussed the chart and its implications with Fed policy makers.Just as globalization has been a headwind holding back inflation, its unraveling could end up being a tailwind in the years ahead, pushing costs higher as countries and companies retreat from the international marketplace. That would be on top of the one-time effect that Trump\u2019s tariffs will have on prices of selected imports, putting pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates at a faster pace than the gradual path it has currently mapped out.The president has already imposed import duties on a wide range of products, from steel and aluminum to washing machines and farm equipment. He\u2019s taken particular aim at shipments from China, levying $34 billion in tariffs on goods from that country last week. China, Canada and some of the other nations affected have responded in kind.Administration officials argue that Trump\u2019s tariffs are designed to convince other countries to dismantle trade barriers, not erect new ones. Yet experts are skeptical, pointing to the president\u2019s focus on getting rid of America\u2019s bilateral deficits and his repeated attacks on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which eliminated many tariffs among the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\u201cWe\u2019re not getting concessions from other countries,\u201d said Dartmouth College professor Douglas Irwin, author of the recently published \u201cClashing over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re getting other countries angry at us and they\u2019re retaliating.\u201dFor years, globalization has \u201cimparted a steady dis-inflationary bias\u201d on open economies such the U.K. and U.S. because of competition from lower-cost foreign producers and lower paid foreign workers, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said last September.Now there are small hints of what could happen if that goes into reverse.National Association of Home Builders Chairman Randy Noel said last month that record-high lumber prices have added nearly $9,000 to the price of a new single-family home since January 2017. The U.S. in November imposed average import duties of 21 percent on Canadian shipments of timber.Prices of washing machines sold in the U.S. have also surged after the administration acted to restrict imports earlier this year.Fed policy makers have signaled that they\u2019ll consider such direct price impacts as temporary and not necessarily indicative of a shift in underlying inflation trends.But distinguishing between the two might not be that easy, given that inflation is already on the rise and the economy is being juiced by fiscal stimulus late in an expansion, said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist for Morgan Stanley in New York.In a sign of the difficulties the central bank might face, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told reporters last month that some suppliers were using the threat of new tariffs as a reason to raise prices, even when new tariffs would not directly target their business.\u201cThe risk is the Fed could make a policy mistake\u201d by increasing interest rates more aggressively in response, Zentner said, though she doubts that will happen.Consumers, for their part, appear convinced that the Fed will be able to hold the line on inflation. The monthly reading on consumer prices for June will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday in Washington.We're getting other countries angry at us and they're retaliatingWhile inflation pressures have been building of late, May CPI showed a significant rollover of the three-month rate of change. This bears watching, as it could be an early indication that the recent pickup in inflation pressures could be losing some momentumWhile households see inflation ticking up over the next year due to tariffs and higher energy prices, they seem to believe that the rise will be temporary, Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer surveys, said.That\u2019s allowing policy makers to focus more of their attention on the potential impact of the tariff battles on growth than on inflation.At their meeting last month, most Fed officials voiced concern that trade uncertainty \u201ceventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending,\u201d according to the meeting\u2019s minutes released last week.The economic fallout would spread if multinational companies scale back their decades-long drive to build up global supply chains and instead concentrate on making more at home.\u201cThere would be long term effects on the efficiency of production in the global economy,\u201d said chart author Perry, who is an economics professor at the University of Michigan.And potentially on inflation.The increased use of global supply chains in recent years has tended to hold down prices, according to research by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Kristin Forbes.\u201cSo if this went into reverse, this could boost inflationary pressures,\u201d the former Bank of England policy maker said in an email.Bloomberg News"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Vancouver's pricey housing market weakens as affordability fears keep buyers on the sidelines", "description": "While prices remain robust, the slump in sales is fuelling a rise in unsold inventories that could act as a drag on home values down the line", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/vancouvers-pricey-housing-market-weakens-as-affordability-fears-keep-buyers-on-the-sidelines?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/vancouver_housing_market.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 4, 2018 3:46 PM EDT", "content": "Vancouver\u2019s housing market showed continued signs of weakness in June, as affordability worries curb demand from buyers.Sales were down 14 per cent compared with May, the first monthly decline since January when tougher federal mortgage rules took effect, according to a report Wednesday by the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.

The ratio of sales to active listings for detached homes declined to 11.7 per cent in June, and prices often come down when the ratio holds below 12 per cent for a sustained period, the realtor group said.\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier", "title": "Late payments set to rise on Canadians' $599-billion of credit card, non-mortgage debt, Equifax predicts", "description": "'We will start to see delinquency rates inching up a little bit, and debt probably slowing down,' as Bank of Canada starts raising interest rates, credit agency says", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/debt/equifax-says-canadian-delinquencies-will-probably-rise-this-year?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/credit_card_debt.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 3, 2018 10:11 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian delinquency rates, which have been declining since the last recession, will probably reverse and begin to climb by the end of 2018 as the central bank presses ahead with interest rate increases, according to the country\u2019s largest credit reporting firm.Regina Malina, senior director of analytics at Equifax Canada, predicts late payments on the country\u2019s $599 billion (US$455 billion) of credit card, auto and other non-mortgage consumer debt will begin to move \u201cmodestly higher\u201d by the end of this year.\u201cOur prediction is that we will start to see delinquency rates inching up a little bit, and debt probably slowing down,\u201d Malina said last week in an interview.The delinquency rate \u2014 which measures the number of payments on non-mortgage debt that were more than 90 days past due \u2014 was 1.08 per cent in the first quarter, up slightly from the fourth quarter but still close to the lowest level since the 2008-09 recession.The Toronto-based analyst declined to estimate how high delinquencies will climb, saying it depends on the pace of interest rate increases and what happens in the trade battle between the U.S. and Canada. She cited the experience in Alberta, where delinquency rates rose in some instances 20 per cent or 30 per cent on a year-over-year basis after the oil-price collapse. Such an extreme case, however, isn\u2019t what Equifax is predicting. \u201cIt will only happen if we start seeing deterioration in employment numbers,\u201d she said, adding delinquencies should remain \u201cstill very low,\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re just going to start inching up a little bit, probably not double digits.\u201dHousehold credit has ballooned to unprecedented levels in Canada, as in many other developed countries, amid historically low interest rates. That hasn\u2019t posed too many difficulties so far, because the economy and the labour market have generated solid growth, allowing people to handle servicing costs. But with the Bank of Canada intent on raising rates and the U.S. and Canada engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff fight, that could change.A red flag in the Equifax data was a decline in the share of people who completely pay off their credit cards each month. The 56 per cent who did so in the first quarter matched the fourth-quarter number and was down from as high as 59 per cent last year. It\u2019s a small but important detail, according to Malina.\u201cThe changes aren\u2019t big, but when they\u2019re consistent and we see it for two or three quarters, we start to believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven that less people are making their credit card payments in full, and those people are usually people with lower delinquency rates, we might be seeing overall delinquency rates deteriorating.\u201dConsumer debt including mortgages was $1.83 trillion in the first quarter, up 0.4 per cent from the end of 2017 and 5.7 per cent from the same quarter a year earlier, Equifax said.Excluding mortgages, Canadians carry an average of $22,800 each in debt. Some other highlights from the report include (all figures exclude mortgage debt):Those between the ages of 46 and 55 have the highest average debt loads, at $34,100.That age group is also seeing the largest increase in debt, year-over-year, at 4 per cent.Of nine cities listed, Fort McMurray, Alberta, had the highest average debt levels, at $37,800, as well as the highest delinquency rate, at 1.72 per cent.Vancouver and Toronto saw the highest rate of debt accumulation in the first quarter, with 5.2 per cent and 5 per cent growth from a year earlier Montreal is the least indebted city, with average debt loads at $17,300 Ontario and British Columbia have the lowest delinquency rates, at 0.95 per cent and 0.84 per cent. Nova Scotia, at 1.74 per cent, had the highest.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis and Greg Quinn", "title": "The odds of the Bank of Canada hiking rates in July just shot back up to 70%", "description": "Some hawkish remarks to reporters yesterday have turned the tide for the loonie", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/odds-of-bank-of-canada-rate-hike-climb-after-polozs-remarks", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/loonie.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 28, 2018 12:38 PM EDT", "content": "Investors are raising bets the Bank of Canada will move ahead with an interest rate hike next month, after Governor Stephen Poloz reiterated his outlook for higher borrowing costs.Odds of a hike at the July 11 rate decision jumped to more than 70 per cent Thursday, from just over 50 per cent a day earlier, after Poloz told reporters he expects to continue raising interest rates in spite of mounting trade tensions because inflation has already hit the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target.

Authorities should be ready to step in with full financial support if a major default roils markets, rather than taking piecemeal steps, NIFD said.Chinese stocks have entered a bear market, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index falling more than 20 per cent from its January high, while the yuan has slumped more than 3 per cent in the past two weeks. Investors have been spooked by the escalating trade tensions and fears that the government\u2019s deleveraging campaign will curb economic growth and trigger defaults.NIFD said China had failed to address the issue of leveraged stock purchases, a major contributor to the market collapse three years ago.

But that wasn\u2019t the case Wednesday. \u201cFolks you have to watch emerging markets and the Chinese yuan,\u201d he wrote.At one point Wednesday the yuan was down more than 0.5 per cent against the dollar for a third straight day, an unusually sharp move for the managed currency. Such a magnitude hadn\u2019t been seen in a short stretch since China\u2019s August 2015 devaluation, when the currency slid 2.8 per cent over two days. It was at 6.5954 as of 4:00 p.m. in Shanghai.\u201cI expect the yuan to head back toward 6.70 or 6.80,\u201d said McKenna, a former currency strategist with Australian banks who\u2019s now at AxiTrader in Sydney. \u201cI wonder if that will spook developed markets in a way the fall in Chinese stocks hasn\u2019t? I think it might.\u201dThe yuan has tumbled about 3 per cent in the past two weeks. While that\u2019s left it only at its weakest since December, the drop has coincided with an escalation in trade tensions with the U.S., spurring concern that China might embrace purposeful devaluation as a policy tool. Surging interest saw yuan options trading rise to the third-most traded globally on Tuesday. A more typical day would see it from seventh to tenth place; it was tops Wednesday in Asia.The following are some views on where the yuan is heading.\u201cInvestors are getting into a bit of a panic now,\u201d said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong. \u201cPolicy makers might be allowing the market to push the yuan weaker, without doing it themselves, as the trade tensions with the U.S. worsen,\u201d and will be wary of burning foreign-exchange reserves \u201cto little effect.\u201dEven so, \u201cin general, the authorities should still hope to stabilize the market to avoid outflows\u201d of capital he said. \u201cThe drops in the yuan could accelerate as the currency sinks past 6.6 per dollar.\u201d\u201cThe decline will have spillover effects on other yuan assets, such as stocks.\u201dStability seen in the gap between one-month and 12-month non-deliverable yuan forwards \u201csuggests that the market is not expecting a significant, sustained yuan depreciation to occur,\u201d Morgan Stanley currency strategists led by Hans Redeker wrote in a note Wednesday. By contrast, in past episodes of yuan depreciation, the differential climbed, they said.\u201cDurable RMB weakness is not our base case, but should any negotiations between China and the U.S. ahead of the imposition of import tariffs on 6th July fail to show positive results, then China may have to re-think its strategy,\u201d the strategists wrote. RMB refers to renminbi, the official name of China\u2019s currency.\u201cWorries over corporate bond defaults are arguably the most dominant factor at this point,\u201d said Tai Hui, JPMorgan Asset Management Inc.\u2019s chief market strategist for Asia Pacific in Hong Kong. \u201cThe prospects of higher dollar interest rates and subsequent dollar strength are raising concerns that companies who have been heavy dollar-debt issuers could face challenges to service their debt, repay or refinance.\u201dThere are reasons for Chinese authorities to prevent sustained weakening in the yuan \u2014 including promoting the currency as a rival to the dollar and its use in commerce with trading partners, said John Hardy, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Saxo Bank A/S.\u201cSo I would be surprised, in other words, if the recent pace of weakening is sustained for much longer.\u201d Asked why he thought the yuan was weakening, he said it \u201ccould be domestic economic risks, and sending a warning \u2014 or simply that the recent yuan appreciation (in basket terms) has proceeded far enough \u2014 or all three.\u201d\u201cThere is much focus and some expectation in the market of the currency trade tool\u201d being deployed, said Neil Jones, head of hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. \u201cBut there is also a strong regard to sovereign divergence in play here. The Fed is raising and the PBOC cutting. I would suggest very strongly that rate differentials are playing a big part.\u201dWith the Chinese stock market also diverging in its performance relative to the U.S., \u201cTo me a weaker yuan seems logical regardless of a trade tool or no trade tool,\u201d Jones said.Depreciating the yuan is one of the two most likely options for China to consider in response to any move by the U.S. to impose a 10 percent tariff hike on $200 billion or more of Chinese imports, said Alex Wolf, senior emerging markets economist in Hong Kong at Aberdeen Standard Investments.\u201cA 10 percent depreciation could offset the additional tariffs at a 10 percent rate, although not without significant risks, including exacerbating outflows,\u201d Wolf wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. \u201cThere are no costless options, but hopefully we don\u2019t reach that point.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg and Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Trump's trade threats are spooking Canadians, sending consumer confidence plunging", "description": "Many economists believe heightened uncertainty, if it prompts Canadians to scale back spending, may pose an even bigger threat to the economy than the tariffs", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trumps-trade-threats-are-spooking-canadians-sending-consumer-confidence-plunging?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/0625shopping.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 25, 2018 11:29 AM EDT", "content": "Escalating trade friction with the U.S. is spooking Canadian households and sending consumer confidence into a slide.Polling by Nanos Research for Bloomberg News shows a sharp deterioration in household sentiment gauges since Donald Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau squared off over trade issues after a Group of Seven summit two weeks ago, which included a threat by Trump that the dispute is \u201cgoing to cost a lot of money for the people of Canada.\u201d The decline has been most acute in Canadians\u2019 expectations for growth, which have fallen to the weakest levels in more than two years.\u201cWe rarely see an all out economic threat issued by anyone to Canada,\u201d said Nik Nanos, chairman of Nanos Research. \u201cIt\u2019s probably fair to say a certain proportion of Canadians think that Canada will pay and it won\u2019t be a pleasant experience.\u201dThe survey data highlight the extent to which the trade rift is fuelling anxiety in a Canadian economy that remains highly dependent on the U.S. for exports. And many economists believe heightened uncertainty \u2014 if it prompts consumers and businesses to scale back spending \u2014 may pose an even greater threat than the direct impact of any tariffs.The first surveys of business sentiment since the G7 summit are also expected this week, and should provide insight into how the trade dispute is affecting investment intentions. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business releases its monthly small business barometer on Thursday, while the Bank of Canada publishes its quarterly survey of executives on Friday.It's probably fair to say a certain proportion of Canadians think that Canada will pay and it won't be a pleasant experienceEvery week, Nanos Research asks 250 Canadians for their views on personal finances, job security, the outlook for the economy and where real estate prices are headed. Bloomberg publishes four-week rolling averages of the 1,000 telephone responses. A composite indicator \u2014 the Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index \u2014 is also calculated from the rolling averages of the four questions.The overall index plunged to 55.3 in the week ended ended June 22, which is the lowest weekly level since 2016, down from 57.1 a week earlier. The 1.8 point drop is the largest since Nanos began weekly polling in 2013.While all four questions have recorded a deterioration in sentiment over the past two weeks, the biggest drop has been in the outlook for the economy. The share of Canadians who say they expect the economy to get stronger over the next six months dropped to 14.7 per cent last week, the lowest since 2015 when Canada suffered a technical recession. The share of Canadians who see the economy weakening jumped to 38.2 per cent, the highest since 2016.The drop reflects the deterioration in U.S.-Canada relations, which have rarely been more strained. Trudeau\u2019s closing press conference at the G7 summit June 9 sparked outrage within the Trump administration after the prime minister said the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum on national security grounds was \u201cinsulting.\u201dThough Trudeau had made such comments many times before, Trump and his advisers quickly responded. The president tweeted from Air Force One that Trudeau was \u201cdishonest,\u201d and weak. His aides went further, with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro saying there was a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for leaders like Trudeau who negotiate with Trump in bad faith.

Disposable income increased 1.3 per cent. Meanwhile, a separate Statistics Canada report showed the country\u2019s new housing price index was flat in April, and Toronto prices posted the first 12-month decline since 2009.The figures suggest risks from the decade-long, debt-fueled housing boom are moderating, clearing the way for the Bank of Canada to continue increasing interest rates to more normal levels. Governor Stephen Poloz has already lifted rates three times since last summer and investors predict he\u2019ll hike again at the July 11 meeting.Moderating housing costs \u201cwill give the Bank of Canada breathing room to maintain a gradual pace of tightening,\u201d Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto Dominion Bank in Toronto, said in an email.Real estate executives and policy makers have said mortgage growth should slow this year after tougher federal rules took effect.

The number viewing three or fewer hikes as appropriate fell to seven from eight. The median estimate implied three increases in 2019 to put the rate above the level where officials see policy neither stimulating nor restraining the economy.The Federal Open Market Committee indicated that even though it\u2019s stepping up the pace of interest-rate hikes, economic growth should continue apace. \u201cThe committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee\u2019s symmetric 2 per cent objective over the medium term,\u201d according to its statement following a meeting in Washington.The statement omitted previous language saying that the main rate would remain \u201cfor some time\u201d below longer-run levels.

The Bloomberg dollar spot index, which tracks the performance of a basket of 10 global currencies against the greenback, climbed 0.1 per cent on the day.While the course of interest-rate hikes remains gradual, the slightly more aggressive pace shows officials see more urgency to tighten policy, as unemployment already fell in May to the level they had forecast for year-end. U.S. growth is also getting a boost from US$1.5 trillion in tax cuts and a US$300 billion increase in federal spending, with inflation at the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target for two months.The statement retained language in place since late 2015 saying \u201cpolicy remains accommodative.\u201d Fed officials repeated their assessment that \u201crisks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.\u201d\u201cEconomic activity has been rising at a solid rate,\u201d the FOMC said in its statement. \u201cRecent data suggest that growth of household spending has picked up, while business fixed investment has continued to grow strongly.\u201dWednesday\u2019s decision \u2014 the sixth quarter-point increase in 18 months, raising the benchmark federal funds target rate to a range of 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent \u2014 was a unanimous 8-0.Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m., his second since taking the helm from Janet Yellen in February.

U.S. payrolls expanded by more than 1 million workers in the first five months of 2018, reaching the milestone faster than in the previous two years.Fed policy makers now see U.S. unemployment at 3.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, followed by 3.5 per cent in 2019 and 2020, based on median projections. That compares with March\u2019s forecasts for 3.8 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent in the following two years. Estimates of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate were unchanged at 4.5 per cent.On inflation, policy makers forecast a slight overshoot of their target starting in 2018 at 2.1 per cent, and running through 2019 and 2020, compared with a 2020 overshoot in March\u2019s projections. The Fed\u2019s preferred price gauge \u2014 the Commerce Department\u2019s personal consumption expenditures index \u2014 rose 2 per cent from a year earlier in March and April, after spending most of the past six years below it.The core PCE index, which excludes food and energy and is seen by officials as a better gauge of underlying price pressures, is forecast to reach 2 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2019 and 2020.

Zechner Associates, who\u2019s passed on buying the securities.\u201cThe reduction in electricity charges is just a craven attempt to disguise the government\u2019s bumbling mismanagement of the energy sector,\u201d said Herold, who oversees $2 billion as chief executive officer of the Toronto-based fund manager. \u201cFair Hydro Trust is bad policy and buying it would encourage governments to do similar deals in the future.\u201dThe Fair Hydro Plan has become an unlikely flashpoint in a June 7 election in Canada\u2019s most populous province with critics labelling it a blatant attempt by Premier Kathleen Wynne\u2019s government to curry votes that will leave electricity users footing the bill. The government argues it\u2019s a fair way of sharing the cost of funding green power with future generations who will benefit from cleaner air.Cutting hydro bills was the easy part. Coming up with a framework that would cover the revenue shortfall for power-distribution companies without breaking the Liberal government\u2019s promise to climb out of deficit was a bit more complex. Enter Fair Hydro.Under the plan, a new Clean Energy Adjustment charge will be added to electricity bills in May 2021. Fair Hydro Trust, an entity managed by provincially owned Ontario Power Generation, will buy rights to these charges from Ontario\u2019s Independent Electricity System Operator, financed by debt that uses the charges as collateral.The trust has made two forays into the bond market so far, raising $900 million in February and April offerings lead by CIBC World Markets, Goldman Sachs and RBC Capital Markets. In its inaugural transaction it sold $500 million of 15-year bonds at 92 basis points above federal bonds, or around 21 basis points over Ontario\u2019s bonds. The deal attracted 36 buyers, according to people familiar with the matter, fewer than a typical investment-grade corporate bond that gets distributed among institutional investors in the same way.Both of Fair Hydro\u2019s bonds are doing well in the secondary market, trading above par and outperforming Ontario bonds. Ontario\u2019s bonds have dropped 0.1 per cent since the first Fair Hydro bond was sold in February, while the trust\u2019s bonds generated a 2.1 per cent return, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The program is expected to peak at almost $20 billion outstanding by 2029 and mature in 2047.The reality is our children have to cover this debtThe plan allowed Finance Minister Charles Sousa to announce that the government had balanced its books as promised in fiscal 2017-18 while still cutting hydro bills by 25 per cent. That was a significant reprieve for Ontario rate-payers who had seen residential bills rise about 70 per cent between 2008 and 2016 compared with an average 34 per cent across Canada, according to a Fraser Institute report.But the plan has drawn a rebuke from the Auditor General of Ontario who said in a report the government was \u201cmaking up its own accounting rules\u201d by creating \u201ca needlessly complex\u201d structure that would cost Ontarians as much as $4 billion more in interest expense. The government, the auditor said, didn\u2019t keep the office sufficiently informed about the plan as it was \u201cacutely aware\u201d the auditor would take issue with it.\u201cThere was a willingness to incur an additional cost in order to get the accounting solution that they wanted,\u201d Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk said in an interview in Bloomberg\u2019s office in Toronto. \u201cThey intentionally kept us out of the discussion.\u201dOther bond market investors are also skeptical.\u201cIt\u2019s typical government mismanagement and focusing on popularity today and not the long-term fundamental health of the province,\u201d said Mark Carpani, who helps manage $1.2 billion as head of fixed income at Toronto-based Ridgewood Capital Asset Management and is also staying clear of the debt.\u201cThe creativity entails a lot of fixed costs,\u201d added Randall Malcolm, managing director for total return fixed-income at Sun Life Investment Management in Toronto, which has $37 billion in money market and fixed income assets and doesn\u2019t hold Fair Hydro Trust bonds.For its part, the government said the plan meets Canadian public sector accounting standards and has been approved by top accounting firms including EY and Deloitte, the Office of the Provincial Controller, and numerous third-party advisers. \u201cIt is a fairer way to pay for our electricity investments, and it keeps the cost of borrowing within the rate-base, not the tax-base, because that\u2019s the logical thing to do, and that is how it has been done for decades,\u201d Drew Davidson, a spokesman for the Ontario Liberal Party, said in an email.Both the premier\u2019s office and the Ministry of Energy declined to comment saying they\u2019re in caretaker mode during the election period.If the government had hoped to garner votes with its electricity-price cut, the plan has badly misfired. A poll tracker from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has about an 85 per cent probability of the Progressive Conservatives, led by Doug Ford \u2014 brother of late Toronto Mayor Rob Ford \u2014 will win the election. The party is running neck-and-neck in the popular vote with Andrea Horwath\u2019s New Democratic Party. Wynne\u2019s Liberals are staring at an historic defeat.While the structure is new to Canada, it\u2019s relatively well-known in the U.S. where utilities have been issuing securities backed by cost-recovery charges since the 1990s. In 2013, New York State set up an agency that issued bonds backed by customer charges to help retire debt of the Long Island Power Authority after Hurricane Sandy left 90 per cent of the utility\u2019s customers, or 200,000 homes, without power.Those bonds got AAA ratings, while Fair Hydro Trust received a rating of AAA at DBRS and lesser Aa2 rating at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Both DBRS and Moody\u2019s listed a change in the program \u2014 perhaps by a new government \u2014 as the top challenge to the trust\u2019s ratings. While Ontario has agreed to guarantee the trust\u2019s debt-service payments upon legal changes, the pledge is not as robust as in U.S. programs, the rating company said.Both Ford and Horwath have both said they want to cut hydro rates further and whoever wins will have to deal with a bond-market legacy designed to offer short-term relief for long-term cost.\u201cThey basically kicked the can down the road,\u201d according to Andrew Scilipoti, chief executive officer of Veritas Investment Research which said in its report that Ontario used a flawed and misleading approach to Fair Hydro Plan\u2019s accounting. \u201cThe reality is our children have to cover this debt.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Poloz encouraged by strong business investment data amid NAFTA uncertainty", "description": "'Investment is lower than it otherwise would be, but it still is making a significant contribution to growth'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/poloz-encouraged-by-strong-business-investment-data-amid-nafta-uncertainty?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/0604poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 4, 2018 11:00 AM EDT", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said he\u2019s encouraged by strong business investment numbers despite all the uncertainty surrounding NAFTA talks.Poloz said recent data suggests companies are \u201cgetting on\u201d with the process of investing. Business spending has become a significant growth driver, and would be even higher were it not for the uncertainty around the North American Free Trade Agreement.\u201cInvestment is lower than it otherwise would be, but it still is making a significant contribution to growth,\u201d Poloz said in an interview with BNN Bloomberg Television on the sidelines of a Group of Seven meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors. \u201cSo it\u2019s encouraging that underneath that we still have the usual forces acting in a positive way.\u201dAs evidence, Poloz cited solid imports of machinery and equipment, \u201cpretty good\u201d sentiment indicators and a gross domestic product report Friday that showed non-residential investment was up an annualized 11 per cent in the first quarter.\u201cActually, the latest ones this week were quite good,\u201d Poloz said in the interview Friday from Whistler, British Columbia.Poloz chaired a separate central banker-only meeting at the ski resort that focused on monetary policy under uncertainty. Asked about those discussions, Poloz explained two key sources of uncertainty that are particularly topical are questions around what is the potential for economies to grow without fuelling inflation, and what is the level of the real neutral rate to achieve that balance.\u201cThose two assumptions alone and their intersection give you all kinds of scope for uncertainty and ranges around things that you\u2019re looking at,\u201d Poloz said.But since downside risks have become more important \u201cgiven what we\u2019ve been through,\u201d it means the analysis skews toward waiting \u201ca little bit longer before\u201d inflationary pressures show up.\u201cThat means that there\u2019s probably more room to grow before inflation pressures are actually evident, but you don\u2019t know that for sure,\u201d Poloz said.Another major issue for Poloz recently has been how record levels of household debt will impact Bank of Canada policy. On the one hand, the central bank is wary of raising interest rates too quickly on the assumption that the debt levels have made the economy more sensitive to interest rate increases. On the other hand, the Bank of Canada is aware that historically low interest rates only fuel borrowing and exacerbate financial system risks.Poloz said that recent efforts by the government to rein in risky borrowing seems to be working.\u201cIt was about improving the quality of indebtedness to make it more sustainable and by all counts that\u2019s looking like that that it\u2019s moving in the right direction.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Why Canada\u2019s big banks aren\u2019t too worried about household debt", "description": "Canadians easily have the highest debt in the G7, but don\u2019t worry, be happy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/debt/why-canadas-big-banks-arent-too-worried-about-household-debt?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/piggy-bank.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 30, 2018 6:00 AM EDT", "content": "Canada sets interest rates Wednesday, and there\u2019s widespread concern about what any further borrowing-cost increases might mean for consumers, their immense pile of debt and the housing market.It\u2019s one of the reasons to be bearish on Canada. Steve Eisman, who was featured in Michael Lewis\u2019s book \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d told Bloomberg TV this month investors should short Canadian financials, citing looming housing \u201cissues.\u201dThe country\u2019s largest lenders are warning against overplaying the concerns. While unprecedented debt levels pose risks, they say there won\u2019t be any major upset to the economy for a number of reasons, including the view Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz won\u2019t press ahead with higher rates if signs of stress begin to emerge.While the debt levels are a problem, \u201cwe don\u2019t expect it to derail the economy, just because we expect Poloz to go quite gradually, or more gradually than what might have warranted hikes in the past,\u201d Brittany Baumann, macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank said in a telephone interview.Other reasons not to panic \u2014 according to economists at the other five major commercial banks \u2014 include households\u2019 ability to keep monthly payments on mortgages in check, a manageable number of home-loan renewals, and the still-low cost of borrowing.That Canadians are heavily indebted is without question. Household debt \u2014 mortgages and consumer debt such as credit cards \u2014 has swollen to $2.1 trillion, and levels as a share of income are easily the highest in the Group of Seven. Two-thirds of that is mortgages. With the central bank raising rates three times since July and with more hikes to come, there\u2019s concern things could get messy.Yet, rate rises will be gradual and it will take a while for that to flow through to households, according to Nathan Janzen and Robert Hogue at Royal Bank of Canada. More than 40 per cent of outstanding residential mortgage debt issued by federally regulated financial institutions is five-year, fixed-rate, and for those resetting now, rates aren\u2019t much different than they were five years ago. The central bank\u2019s effective household interest rate \u2014 a weighted-average of various mortgage and consumer credit rates \u2014 was 3.64 per cent on May 11, compared with 3.54 per cent in May 2013.\u201cIt will take a while for the full impact of higher rates to hit household incomes,\u201d Janzen said by email. \u201cHousehold ability to pay is increasing along with interest rates. The economy looks strong, labour markets look tight, and wages have been increasing more quickly.\u201dFor variable-rate mortgages, depending on how the loan is structured, rising borrowing costs won\u2019t necessarily translate into higher monthly payments, but could mean instead a longer amortization period.Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce estimates only about 20 per cent of outstanding household debt \u2014 mortgage and non-mortgage \u2014 has so far been exposed to higher rates.\u201cIt\u2019s actually not a huge number, which kind of dampens the headline effect of \u2018Oh, there\u2019s such a huge amount of mortgages coming due,\u201d\u2018 Ian Pollick, head of North American rates strategy, said in a phone interview.Matthieu Arseneau at National Bank Financial says the \u201cpayment shock\u201d from elevated household debt and rising rates will equate to a mere 0.24 per cent off aggregate disposable income this year. Considering real disposable income has grown about 2.5 per cent annually over the past decade, the shock will turn out to be more of a \u201cslight touch on the brakes\u201d of consumer spending, he said in recent a research note.Poloz has been mindful of the risks of the debt overhang. The central bank estimates that due to elevated household debt, the reduction in consumer spending \u201cmight be as much as 50 per cent more in the two years following a persistent change in interest rates.\u201dSuch concerns have helped keep the central bank on hold since January. Poloz is expected to leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 1.25 percent this week.\u201cThe bank is at a slower rather than a faster mentality,\u201d Pollick said, with CIBC predicting just one more increase this year.Most economists anticipate debt worries won\u2019t be enough to keep Poloz on hold forever.Derivatives trading suggests two more hikes by the end of the year, to 1.75 per cent, and Poloz has been emphatic that rates will eventually go higher. The Bank of Canada estimates its \u201cneutral rate\u201d is about 3 per cent.The Bank of Montreal predicts two more rate increases this year, and three more next year. National Bank sees Poloz hiking twice more this year and twice next year. Royal Bank of Canada projects 100 basis points of increases between now and mid 2019. TD predicts one more hike this year and one in early 2019.But even as rates rise and consumers pare back spending, another mitigating factor is a relatively robust economy that can handle modest increases in rates.Sal Guatieri at Bank of Montreal thinks the only things that could really derail the economy are a recession or a sharp increase in borrowing costs, neither of which is likely.\u201cWe don\u2019t foresee a recession, we still place relatively moderate odds of one occurring over the next couple of years, and we certainly don\u2019t see a big spike in interest rates over the next couple of years,\u201d Guatieri said.In fact, the economy is so strong, there may be little reason for the central bank to remain cautious at all, according to Derek Holt at the Bank of Nova Scotia, particularly if it stops its rate hike cycle well below the neutral rate. He predicts the central bank will double its benchmark rate to 2.5 per cent by the end of 2019.The increased sensitivity of the economy to rate hikes doesn\u2019t mean Poloz \u201ccannot continue hiking along a fairly aggressive path,\u201d Holt said by email. \u201cIt just means there is a lower end point in this cycle and over the longer run.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Bank of Canada\u2019s holding pattern on rates can't last much longer", "description": "Markets are betting on hike in July and December", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/polozs-holding-pattern-on-canada-rates-cant-last-much-longer", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/stephen-poloz1.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 28, 2018 4:41 PM EDT", "content": "It\u2019s no longer an issue of if, but when the Bank of Canada raises interest rates.Governor Stephen Poloz heads into a rate decision Wednesday where he\u2019s expected to once again refrain from lifting borrowing costs, even as the economy shows signs of strength and is running up against capacity constraints. It\u2019s a cautious stance driven by a wait-and-see approach to a long list of uncertainties \u2014 everything from Nafta to the housing market \u2014 rather than any concerns about fundamental economic momentum.After the current pause, which came after three rate increases, most economists are expecting the Bank of Canada will return to a hiking path in July, followed by one more increase at the end of the year.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the timing,\u201d said Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto and a former central bank researcher. \u201cFrom our perspective rates are going up there\u2019s no question about it, but it\u2019s just when will they go up.\u201dAs of late Friday, 21 of 24 economists predict Poloz will hold rates steady, with the rest calling for a quarter-point increase. Investors agree chances of an increase are slim; implied odds of a May 30 rate hike fell to 25 per cent last week, from 35 per cent about a month ago. An increase by July and another one by December are almost fully priced in.The Bank of Canada\u2019s announcement will be a shorter one-page statement \u2014 as opposed to the one in July, which will be accompanied by fresh quarterly forecasts and a press conference \u2014 and any new language on trade tensions, the housing market and economic slack will be important clues for assessing a July increase.Trump\u2019s threats this month on the North American Free Trade Agreement and possible tariffs on auto imports from Canada are the latest uncertainties Poloz needs to balance. Another lingering headwind is household debt. Poloz devoted a May 1 speech entirely to how consumers are more sensitive to higher rates.Poloz has also been a big advocate of the idea Canada has moved to the \u201csweet spot\u201d of the business cycle, where companies expand to meet demand and keep the economy at full output without rapid inflation. The Governor has said he has an \u201cobligation\u201d to nurture this process with stimulative borrowing costs.The sweet spot theory is important, because it allows Poloz to reconcile the idea of a cautious policy stance with an economy growing above what is considered its typical non-inflationary speed limit. After a recent soft patch, consensus forecasts show the expansion will accelerate to an annualized pace of at least 2 per cent and that should eat further into Canada\u2019s dwindling spare capacity.But the law of economics will eventually prevail, with plenty of signs of a resilient economy that needs higher rates, economists said. Unemployment is at record lows and executives are telling Poloz they remain largely unscathed from policy uncertainty emanating from the Trump administration.Likewise, after five of years of below-target inflation, rising demand has consumer prices poised to meet or beat the bank\u2019s 2 percent goal through the next year.\u201cWith inflation at target and the labour market looking like it\u2019s at full health, one rate hike wouldn\u2019t be too much for the economy to handle, especially with growth rebounding,\u201d after the first quarter, said Royce Mendes, a CIBC Capital Markets senior economist in Toronto. He predicts a July increase.The big picture remains one of firm inflation and growth, said Silvana Dimino, an economist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in New York. Canada\u2019s housing is headed for a soft landing and the U.S. has an interest in a striking a Nafta deal, she said.\u201cThey feel like they have some room to let things ride out,\u201d Dimino said, adding the hiking cycle will resume. \u201cWhen inflation is stable at 2 per cent, that\u2019s when you expect to be raising interest rates, which is what they are doing.

Macquarie Capital Markets offers one simple answer: the housing market itself \u2014 highlighting that the share of employment tied to construction as well as finance, insurance and real estate is nearly two standard deviations above its long-term average.Tighter mortgage rules and higher interest rates have weighed on activity in formerly high-flying Canadian housing markets, with home sales in Toronto having their worst start to the year since 2009.\u201cFor downside risks to be realized, however, any potential housing-related weakness must spill over into the labour market,\u201d analyst David Doyle wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \u201cWhile rising rates put pressure on consumer finances, job losses trigger defaults and a tightening in credit conditions that can lead to more severe economic outcomes.\u201dRoughly half of all economic weakness during recessions since the Second World War is tied to fluctuations in residential investment, he calculates, and the extent to which Canadian output and employment are currently reliant on this is \u201cunprecedented.\u201dMacquaire\u2019s best-case scenario is that the fallout, starting in 2020, will be as bad for Canada as the 2008-09 financial crisis. Worst case: The unemployment rate will spike by more than any recession since the Great Depression.In terms of employment concentration in housing-linked industries, this dependency is particularly pronounced in Ontario and British Columbia but still prevalent across the rest of the country. Job growth in these sectors has come amid shrinking payrolls in other cyclical areas like manufacturing, making \u201chousing an all the more important driver of the Canadian business cycle,\u201d Doyle said.The strength in housing starts and consumer spending, however, suggests only a \u201cmodest\u201d risk of a housing-led recession in the nearer term, according to the analyst.Macquarie sees the U.S. dollar rising to $1.36 relative to its Canadian counterpart by the end of 2019.

The coming days aren\u2019t looking much calmer.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to visit China June 2-4 for more talks with Vice Premier Liu He, with a long list of topics that can ease tension with Beijing or ramp it up again \u2014 from narrowing the trade gap to the fate of China\u2019s telecommunications giant ZTE Corp.In his second year in office, Trump has been on a mission to deliver on his election promise to crack down on unfair trade practices by foreign countries and rebuild America\u2019s manufacturing base. The scope of the president\u2019s trade proposals has been sweeping, ranging from overhauling the North American Free Trade Agreement to proposing tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese imports. On Wednesday, the Trump administration opened a new front, launching a probe into whether auto imports imperil national security.Meanwhile, exclusions from metals tariffs for the European Union, Canada and Mexico expire June 1. If the U.S. imposes permanent levies, the EU has threatened to retaliate with duties on iconic American products such as Harley Davidson motorcycles and Kentucky bourbon.Still, Trump hasn\u2019t followed through on his worst threats. While his administration imposed duties on foreign steel and aluminum, it granted temporary exclusions to some allies. The U.S. hasn\u2019t levied any major tariffs on Chinese goods. Nafta remains intact, and it could take months before the Commerce Department finishes its auto industry review.The president\u2019s trade threats have led to market jitters, but the economic impact has been limited. With trouble simmering in emerging markets such as Argentina and Turkey, the broadest upswing in the global economy in years looks more vulnerable. Trade growth is outpacing economic growth in a throwback to the time before the financial crisis, but the International Monetary Fund is growing wary of protectionist threats.Other Asian economies would suffer more than China\u2019s if Trump does deliver on threats to slap US$150 billion of tariffs on shipments from the world\u2019s biggest trading nation, according to Bloomberg economists Fielding Chen and Tom Orlik. They estimate that for every 10 per cent drop in China\u2019s exports, the growth rate of Asian economies would fall 1.1 percentage points on average while China\u2019s would decrease by just 0.3 percentage point.\u201cTrump has an approach that hasn\u2019t shown much fruit yet, and that is to lead with these various tariff threats and hoping that tilts the negotiating playing field in favour of the United States,\u201d said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.The strategy\u2019s most notable outcome was an agreement-in-principle on an update to America\u2019s trade deal with South Korea. While Seoul increased market access for U.S. cars, trade experts called the changes incremental. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty modest harvest,\u201d Alden said. He also pulled the U.S. out of an Asia-Pacific trade deal, which Congress hadn\u2019t yet passed.Trump\u2019s approach may come down to the simple fact that he favours tariffs as a policy tool, said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and former senior economist for trade in President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.The administration doesn\u2019t appear to have fully anticipated the consequences of the tariffs, such as the eagerness of countries to retaliate and the complexity of America\u2019s economic relationship with China, Levy said. \u201cHe keeps ending up in blind alleys,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, China is considering encouraging state-owned carmakers to bring in private automakers as investors as it seeks to create an industrial champion to compete with global peers such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. A policy paper outlining the proposal is being studied by government departments, said the people, who asked not to be identified.To be sure, the risks of Trump\u2019s brinkmanship shouldn\u2019t be ignored. The threat of car tariffs piled on top of steel and aluminum duties adds to uncertainties that could impact the spending plans of Canadian businesses and potentially the Bank of Canada\u2019s decision on interest rates, CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld said in a research note.The European Central Bank on Thursday flagged protectionism as a key source of uncertainty for the euro-area economy, saying the risk of it had \u201cbecome more prominent and warranted monitoring.\u201dLonger term, America\u2019s relations with some of its closest allies may be at stake.

The implied odds of a hike this month are now 28 per cent, versus nearly 40 per cent Thursday.\u201cThe odds of a May rate hike were scaled back notably in the wake of the data \u2014 perhaps reflecting the fact that the previous pricing required a very strong set of figures today, and that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a note to investors.After a slowdown that began in the second half of last year, most economists are anticipating growth will return to an above 2-per cent pace in coming months and continue to put pressure on Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to raise interest rates. A slump in first-quarter growth is also turning out to be less severe than initially feared. The economy probably expanded at just under 2 per cent in the first three months of 2018, better than the 1.3 per cent predicted by the central bank last month.Statistics Canada will release first-quarter GDP data on May 31, the day after Poloz\u2019s rate decision.

That\u2019s bigger than the entire Canadian housing market.\u201dTricon is aiming to double its assets under management to US$10 billion by 2023, attracting capital from institutional investors and bringing corporate efficiency to the market. The Toronto-based company owns 15,500 rental homes in the U.S., with a value of about US$2.9 billion. That compares with more than 80,000 for Invitation Homes and about 52,000 for American Homes 4 Rent.The U.S. market for rentals has boomed as banks tightened credit standards for mortgages after the housing crash, Berman said. In today\u2019s sharing economy, there\u2019s also less stigma associated with renting, Berman said. Then there\u2019s technology, which has made it possible for businesses to buy homes and manage their properties at scale.\u201cI mean, we\u2019re buying 400 homes, and we could be buying 800 homes per quarter, one at a time,\u201d Berman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this without technology. This is a technology business.\u201dTricon is also building out its maintenance capabilities, with a fleet of trucks Berman calls a \u201cHome Depot store on wheels.\u201d That helped the company push repair and maintenance costs down to 9.7 per cent of revenues in the first quarter from 11 per cent a year earlier.Tricon targets workforce housing \u2014 for police officers, teachers and the like \u2014 that rents for an average US$1,300 per month. That compares with an average of about US$1,700 for Invitation Homes.Tricon\u2019s stock has risen about 140 per cent to a market value of $1.35 billion (US$1.05 billion) in Toronto since the company made its first foray into the U.S. six years ago. The shares have lagged Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite index over the past 12 months, with an 8.7 per cent drop amid rising interest rates. The 11 analysts who follow the company rate the stock a buy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Tricon could make more acquisitions following its US$1.4 billion purchase of Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. last year, Berman said. If the company could \u201ccombine or acquire a large portfolio that was complementary, we\u2019d obviously want to do that,\u201d he said.The firm is also trying to draw more institutional investment into its other businesses, which include apartment development, land acquisition and home building. It has a development pipeline of 2,500 apartment rental units in Toronto, which will cost about US$1.2 billion to construct.Still, land prices have soared in the city amid the condo boom, making it harder for apartment developers to compete.

While more expensive oil should reinforce expectations that borrowing costs are eventually going higher, most economists predict little impact on growth, and views are mixed on what it means for the Bank of Canada\u2019s projected rate-hike path in the near term.Bloomberg spoke to economists at the five largest Canadian banks on what higher oil prices will mean for the economy and interest rates.According to Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt, the mere fact oil prices are moving higher has hawkish implications for the central bank and could potentially move the dial on rate increases.The most immediate impact on the economy is a boost to national income. Even if Canada doesn\u2019t produce an extra barrel of oil beyond the roughly 4.9 million it churns out daily, higher prices mean more money in the oil industry\u2019s pockets and that will spillover into wages, jobs and tax revenue.Higher oil prices \u201cfit into a broader picture that suggests there should be no hesitation to continue along a hiking path in the near term,\u201d Holt said.While corporate profits will rise and some of that will eventually spill over into the rest of the economy, the pass-through effects aren\u2019t what they once were.Right now, pipeline constraints seem to be the primary determinant of investment. The industry is also being hampered by rail bottlenecks and a less favourable tax environment after President Donald Trump cut U.S. corporate taxes. So, it\u2019s less clear what impact higher prices will actually have on oil production and investment.The Bank of Canada\u2019s latest quarterly forecasts were based on the assumption of West Texas Intermediate oil prices at US$60 a barrel, which is about $10 dollars less than its current value. According to Royal Bank of Canada economist Mark Chandler, a $10 a barrel difference implies under normal conditions a reduction in slack by about 0.25 per cent of gross domestic product. But some of these channels between oil prices and investment have been \u201ccompromised,\u201d he said.\u201cIt helps incomes,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really help GDP directly.\u201dThere is also the issue of whether the recent jump in oil prices is sustainable. Slowing global growth and the possibility of a more favourable solution to the Iran situation than feared suggest the current mark-up in oil prices isn\u2019t justified, according to Bank of Montreal economist Michael Gregory, who sees fundamentals for oil closer to US$60 a barrel. Gregory said his hunch is the Bank of Canada probably sees it the same way.\u201cBottom line, they will look past it,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cOverall, this is neutral to slightly more encouraging for the Canadian economy but not to the point where it turns the dial on any risk or maybe gets the Bank of Canada to increase proclivity to do something.\u201dThe same argument goes for inflation. While higher oil prices will only fuel the pick-up expected this year, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said he\u2019s not worried about price gains above his 2 per cent target as long as they are temporary.It\u2019s \u201cunlikely to spur an aggressive reaction from central bank officials,\u201d said Royce Mendes, an economist at CIBC World Markets. \u201cThey are trying to look for evidence of an economy that is overheating. Higher oil prices are not really evidence of that.\u201dWhatever the benefits from the pick-up in oil prices, they still won\u2019t be enough to offset the list of concerns that have been troubling the Bank of Canada recently. Foremost among those are talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the large levels of debt some households are carrying.\u201cBroadly speaking this is a fairly positive development \u2014 particularly for the oil sector, the profitability story, the income story \u2014 but again they are balancing this out against very, very stretched household finances,\u201d said Brian DePratto, an economist at Toronto Dominion Bank. \u201cThe balance of things suggest continued caution.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "As middle class gets priced out of housing market, Canada takes drastic steps to make it affordable", "description": "Canada is offering free land and tax incentives to create more affordably priced options in Vancouver and Toronto", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/as-middle-class-gets-priced-out-of-housing-market-canada-takes-drastic-steps-to-make-it-affordable", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/0509toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 9, 2018 1:08 PM EDT", "content": "Jaxson Khan, 24, encountered the nightmare that is Toronto\u2019s rental market when he moved to the city to join a small tech startup. He ended up sharing a basement apartment almost an hour away from work.Fuelled by a booming tech industry, Toronto\u2019s economy has produced an all-too-familiar problem: soaring housing prices beyond the reach of the middle class. That\u2019s also plagued Vancouver where prices soared even higher than Toronto.Now, Canada is embarking on an ambitious plan to create more moderately priced rental units. With land handouts and tax incentives provided by the city and provinces, one group hopes to bring 50,000 affordable apartments to Toronto and Vancouver in just 10 years.The project, to cost at least $10 billion (US$7.8 billion), is at a scale never before seen in Canada, both in its size and speed. And it\u2019s raising questions about whether or not the country will be able to address its affordability problem before it\u2019s too late.At stake, proponents say, is the continued growth of Canada\u2019s biggest cities. Last year, Toronto ranked first in UBS Group AG\u2019s annual list of major cities worldwide with the greatest risks of a housing bust. That has made even property developers who have reaped big profits fretful that critical workers will be priced out of housing.\u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with this issue of housing, we\u2019ll hit a ceiling where we can\u2019t expand that sector of the economy that we desperately need,\u201d said Ian Gillespie, chief executive officer of Westbank Projects Corp., who spearheaded the project and recruited Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust to help.Building affordable housing can be fraught. Major cities, notably San Francisco and New York City, continue to grapple with a scarcity, even after spending billions of dollars to develop more. The median sale price of a house in San Francisco reached a new high of US$1.6 million in the first quarter, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.The Canadian plan, run by a new nonprofit called Creative Housing Society, proposes to build units aimed at people with median annual income between $40,000 to $100,000, who would spend less than 30 per cent of their household income before tax on housing costs.If we don't deal with this issue of housing, we'll hit a ceiling where we can't expand that sector of the economy that we desperately needThat\u2019s become increasingly difficult now. The average annual income needed to purchase an average-priced resale condo in the city is $100,000 up from $77,000 a year earlier, according to Urbanation Inc. On Jan. 1, the government attempted to tame housing prices with regulations that make it harder to get a mortgage. But that has driven people to the rental market, where average monthly rents surged about 11 per cent in the Toronto region in the first quarter, to $2,206 (US$1,751), Urbanation said.\u201cThese are teachers, nurses, journalists and web designers who live in the city and who in today\u2019s market, would never be able to afford a house, but are critical to the ecosystem of the economy,\u201d said Jennifer Keesmaat, chief executive officer of Creative Housing and former chief city planner for Toronto.For property developers, building affordable housing is typically a low-margin proposition, especially amid rising construction costs, land prices and interest rates. But the city and provinces are showering groups with incentives, including tax breaks, reduced fees and promises of quick approval time, as short as six months. That\u2019s spurred a host of other companies, including Canadian Real Estate Investment Trust, Greenwin Inc. and Tricon Capital Group Inc., to jump on the affordable bandwagon.Creative Housing takes it one step further. The group\u2019s proposed model includes a deal in which the city provides land free as long as affordable housing is built and maintained on it in perpetuity.It\u2019s also in talks with the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation to receive financing that freezes lending at today\u2019s interest rates for a 10-year period, Keesmaat said. Most of the equity will come from private institutional lenders. The nonprofit hopes to start building as early as next year. A spokeswoman for the Canadian housing agency declined to comment on the talks.\u201cYou need to add a significant amount of housing to even begin to respond to the demand and we\u2019re so far behind in this area that it\u2019s really hard to catch up,\u201d Keesmaat said. \u201cBut if our model works, there\u2019s almost an infinite amount of new affordable rental units that could be absorbed in the market.\u201dIt remains unclear if the Creative Housing proposal will have any more luck creating affordable units than previous plans, which have fallen short despite incentives.\u201cDevelopers are telling us they\u2019re still many years away from delivering new rental units,\u201d said Anne McMullin, CEO of Vancouver-based Urban Development Institute, referring to the prior efforts.To Neal Belovay, it\u2019s all a bit too late. He decided to move his tech startup out of Vancouver to Kitchener-Waterloo, about 4,023 kilometres (2,500 miles east), after tiring of searching in vain for people willing to live in so costly a city.\u201cYou have people fighting for their basic needs and that\u2019s finding a place to live,\u201d Belovay said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no real future for them in the city because they\u2019re not going to be able to buy a house and settle down.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier", "title": "For the 3.4 million Canadians with subprime loans, Poloz can't go slowly enough on rate hikes", "description": "Higher interest rates could be disastrous for subprime borrowers, piling costs onto already tight budgets", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/for-3-4-million-subprime-canadians-poloz-cant-go-slowly-enough?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/0509homes.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 9, 2018 11:03 AM EDT", "content": "For many Canadians, higher interest rates are reason to grumble. But for the country\u2019s 3.4 million subprime borrowers, they could spell disaster.Borrowers with impaired credit histories may have limited access to emergency funds compared with their prime counterparts, giving them less wiggle room when debt servicing costs rise. That puts them on the frontline of the Bank of Canada\u2019s recent interest rate increases.Jason Wang, vice president of risk analytics at Progressa, an alternative lender that services mostly subprime clients, hasn\u2019t yet seen evidence that higher borrowing costs are leading to more missed payments, but that could change, he says. Of 28.4 million \u201ccredit-active\u201d Canadian consumers, 11.9 per cent fall into the subprime category, according to estimates from TransUnion, one of the country\u2019s two credit-reporting agencies.Progressa\u2019s loss rate, which measures the number of clients 90 days past due on their payments, is a lagging indicator. \u201cI am curious to see if, in a few months, the Bank of Canada raises the rate again, if that would be trickling into our data,\u201d Wang said in a telephone interview.The next opportunity to gauge the impact of higher rates will come with the firm\u2019s next quarterly risk report in July, Wang said. Depending on the results, the lender would decide what action to take and that may include adjusting its risk profile for acquiring new clients, he said.After the Bank of Canada\u2019s three 25-basis-point hikes since July, Wang calculates, someone with a $60,000 (US$46,000) variable-rate loan would need to pay an extra $37.50 in interest every month.

Manitoba has posted budget deficits since 2010 and has been chipping away at the shortfall since Pallister, 63, was elected in 2016 with pledges that included trimming senior management positions within government and arms-lengths corporations.Manitoba Hydro accounts for 65 per cent of the province\u2019s $6.4 billion borrowing requirements for 2018-19, according to budget documents. Manitoba\u2019s credit rating was cut by S&P Ratings in 2016 and again last year as it carries one of the highest debt loads among Canadian provinces.Almost all of the utility\u2019s board members resigned in March, saying they had attempted to meet with the premier to resolve critical issues for more than a year. Pallister rebuffed a plan for the utility to pay an indigenous group $70 million to smooth negotiations over a transmission line.Utility regulators this week approved a 3.6 per cent increase in average electricity rates in June, or less than half of what the utility sought to help pay for its increasing spending on the 695-megawatt Keeyask hydroelectric plant and a transmission line to deliver its power. Construction delays have increased the cost to more than $8.7 billion and the project manager in January told provincial regulators that further delays could raise that to as much as $10 billion if there are additional delays.Previous decisions by Manitoba Hydro, a government-owned corporation that\u2019s one of the largest electricity and natural gas utilities in Canada, to build Bipole III while constructing Keeyask generating station is poised to double its debt in a relatively short time frame, according to the utility\u2019s 2016-17 annual report, the latest available. Bipole III is estimated to cost $5 billion, according to the report.Manitoba\u2019s bonds have declined 2.8 per cent this year, lagging other provincial and municipal bonds which lost 2.1 per cent, according to a Bloomberg Barclays index. The province\u2019s most recently sold bonds, a new 10-year benchmark, traded at a yield of 3.12 per cent on Tuesday. That\u2019s 78 basis points above similar-maturity federal government bonds and nine basis points above Ontario.Asked whether Manitoba might sell a stake the utility to raise cash, Pallister said it\u2019s not currently an an option. \u201cThere\u2019s no plan to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d Pallister came to New York City this week to sell banks on the province\u2019s fiscal turnaround and gauge interest in Manitoba debt.The premier said the province would be interested in pushing out the terms of more of its bonds to 10 years to lock in current low interest rates with limited additional cost.The decision to move Bipole III was a \u201cbizarre decision and it will go down in history as one of the biggest wastes of money,\u201d Pallister said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg and Natalie Wong", "title": "Toronto housing sales slump in weakest start since 2009 recession", "description": "Condo prices jump 10%, while detached home prices fall 10%", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-housing-sales-are-off-to-weakest-start-since-2009?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/house.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 3, 2018 10:25 AM EDT", "content": "Spring has finally sprung but Toronto\u2019s home sales remain gloomy as tougher mortgage qualifications and rising interest rates continue to push buyers out of the market.Realtors in Canada\u2019s biggest city had one of their worst months in the past 15 years in April, with sales down by almost one-third from a year earlier to 7,792 units, according to data released Thursday by the Toronto Real Estate Board.

In addition, the mortgage market looks set for a particularly heavy year of renewals in an environment where debt-servicing costs are already rising at the fastest pace in a decade.All we know is it's going to be painful, but how painful isn't quite clearHow well Canadian households can weather the squeeze has become one of the biggest questions for policy makers and will determine whether the economy is headed for a mild, or sharp, slowdown. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz will address the topic in a speech on Tuesday.\u201cThe economy has never been as levered as it currently is, and the economy is far more interest sensitive than it has been in the past, to a degree that we don\u2019t have certainty over how each interest rate hike is going to affect Canadian consumers,\u201d Frances Donald, senior economist at Manulife Asset Management, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cAll we know is it\u2019s going to be painful, but how painful isn\u2019t quite clear.\u201dThe heavy debt burden is one of the reasons the central bank has been reluctant to raise borrowing costs further, after hiking interest rates three times between July and January. Given the nation\u2019s debt load \u2014 as of February, households had a record $2.1 trillion of mortgage and non-mortgage debt \u2014 Poloz estimates the economy is 50 per cent more sensitive to rate hikes than in the past.Here\u2019s what households are up against:Canada is entering its busy season for real estate, with purchases concentrated in the April to July window. Some 47 per cent of existing mortgages need to be refinanced this year versus 25 per cent to 35 per cent typically, according to Ian Pollick, head of North American rates strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto.At the same time, the country\u2019s biggest banks are raising key mortgage rates. Toronto-Dominion kicked it off Thursday, hoisting its five-year fixed mortgage rate 45 basis points to 5.59 percent. Royal Bank followed with its own hikes Friday.New mortgage stress tests are pushing some borrowers from the big banks to alternative lenders charging higher rates.\u201cThat\u2019s an unfortunate outcome of the stress test,\u201d Will Dunning, an economic consultant who specializes in the housing market, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cIn that sense, the stress test is not reducing risk. It\u2019s increasing risk.\u201dThe vise is tightening. According to Statistics Canada, total payments on debt made by Canadian households rose 6.7 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, and the interest-paid component climbed 9.2 per cent. Those were the biggest gains since the financial crisis. A moving average of quarter-over-quarter changes shows a similar pattern, with the 1.62 per cent increase in the latest period the fastest since 2008.Debt payments now represent about 14 per cent of household disposable income, the highest share in three years. Donald expects the debt-service ratio to continue moving higher over the coming quarters.\u201cThe world spends a lot of time talking about the level of Canadian debt being extremely elevated, but what matters most is not the level of debt that Canadians hold, but the cost of carrying that debt,\u201d the Manulife economist said. \u201cCanadians are going to start to feel the pinch.\u201dThere are already signs of strain. The roll rate \u2014 the percentage of credit card users who \u201croll\u201d from early stage delinquencies to 60-89 day delinquencies \u2014 reached the highest since 2008 for one credit card program, while delinquencies for another were above the 10-year average, according to Royal Bank of Canada credit analyst Vivek Selot.While the level of mortgage arrears is still low by historical standards, a rising debt service ratio could signal that\u2019s about to change.Canada\u2019s economy led the Group of Seven in growth last year, mostly because of the willingness of the country\u2019s consumers to spend money. But growth is expected to slow this year. Gross domestic product unexpectedly shrank in January. Data for February is due Tuesday.The nation\u2019s retailers have already had a tough few months. Retail sales in February were still 1.8 per cent below 2017 peak levels. In volume terms, the input used to calculate gross domestic product data, first-quarter retail sales probably posted the biggest quarterly drop since the 2008-09 recession.The low unemployment rate and decent economic growth will help the economy withstand higher rates, though risks are increasing.\u201cYou have some capacity in the economy to absorb this, but the fact that rates are going up isn\u2019t positive for consumers, because it\u2019s making credit more expensive,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Paul Gulberg said Friday by phone. \u201cThat\u2019s the but.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Adam Tempkin and Brian Smith", "title": "A $3-trillion credit market has corporate bond investors on edge", "description": "A huge swath of the corporate bond market is looking increasingly vulnerable", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/funds/a-3-trillion-credit-market-has-corporate-bond-investors-on-edge", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/0426teva.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 26, 2018 12:25 PM EDT", "content": "A huge swath of the corporate bond market is looking increasingly vulnerable.Bonds with the lowest investment grade have been a market darling over the past decade, ballooning in size as low global interest rates drew fund managers seeking higher returns. But as borrowing costs climb to a four-year high just as investors begin to anticipate a downturn in the global economy, some analysts are starting to sound the alarm.\u201cWe\u2019re late in the credit cycle, and trying to figure out when everything turns,\u201d said Erin Lyons, a senior credit strategist at New York-based research firm CreditSights Inc. \u201cSome of these may eventually be downgraded.\u201dNotes in the lowest rungs above high-yield junk \u2014 in the BBB group from S&P Global Ratings or the Baa bucket from Moody\u2019s Investors Service \u2014 total about $3 trillion, almost the size of Germany\u2019s gross domestic product. The concern is that as rates rise it will cost companies more to roll over their obligations, and if earnings begin to slump as economic growth slows, that could blow out leverage ratios and lead to credit-rating cuts.The high-grade bond market in the U.S. already has the lowest credit quality mix since the 1980s, according to CreditSights, and there are signs investors are getting nervous. A Bloomberg Barclays gauge of average corporate bond spreads has surged to a six-month high since reaching an all-time low in early February.\u201cWe\u2019re wary of companies that have seen their debt-to-equity ratios deteriorate,\u201d said Tim Ng, the chief investment officer at New York-based Clearbrook Global Advisors, which advises on US$28 billion of assets. \u201cAs interest rates increase, if they go too high, the higher debt-to-equity ratios and leverage will have a negative effect on cash flows.\u201dThe big push into the bottom end of high-grade bonds was driven by the search for yield amid record-low rates following the 2008 financial crisis and unprecedented stimulus from central banks. Investors who were comfortable in A-rated bonds moved to BBBs, and those who were comfortable in BBBs dipped into high yield, according to Lyons of CreditSights.\u201cWhat happens when that all retraces?\u201d she said.A hint of the potential turmoil ahead came from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. earlier in the year. The drugmaker\u2019s bonds were cut to junk from investment grade by Moody\u2019s after its US$41-billion buyout of Allergan Plc\u2019s generics business in 2016 left the company with a debt load that outweighed its value in the stock market.So far, the jitters among investors haven\u2019t translated to dramatic price drops or much hesitation to take down new debt. Yield spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds are still less than half of what they were in early 2016, and a recent deal that relied on the BBB market for funding \u2014 Syngenta\u2019s US$43-billion takeover by ChemChina \u2014 was gobbled up by investors. And, according to Lyons, the tier also offers a healthy mix of players that helps counter any concerns.But for bond investors worried about higher interest rates and increasing leverage, the best bet might be to leave the lowest-rated investment-grade debt and move into the top-rated securities, according to Hozef Arif, a money manager at Pacific Management Investment Co., which oversaw US$1.77 trillion in assets as of March 31.\u201cIf you are indeed concerned about the late credit cycle,\u201d Arif said, \u201cyou probably want to be up in quality.

Demand for yield associated with less liquid debt will likely lift the market beyond $1 trillion in 2020, according to an estimate from the Alternative Investment Management Association, an influx of money that\u2019s sparked warnings of excess.\u201cWhen you think of some of the biggest private credit players in the U.S., I want to be in that zone,\u201d Peacher said in an interview. \u201cAt some point these markets are going to roll over, spreads are going to widen, there\u2019s going to be credit distress. I sure as heck want to have teams on board because that\u2019s where all the opportunity is.\u201dPrivate credit deals typically don\u2019t register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The loans are often more complex and can be made to firms who want to keep financial information confidential. While interest rates on the debt will generally be higher \u2014 and subsequently a lure for lenders \u2014 borrowers benefit because they don\u2019t pay SEC registration and ratings fees, and gain flexible terms, such as longer maturities.\u201cThe benefits are so compelling,\u201d said Tillinghast, who started in January. \u201cYou\u2019ll continue to see capital come into this space, with more strategic moves by independent private credit firms as well as insurance companies. There\u2019s no going back.\u201dMetLife Inc.\u2019s asset management unit is among the market participants, having struck US$11.2 billion in private placement deals last year, the most it\u2019s ever done. JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s asset management unit is raising US$250 million for distressed debt as part of its private credit expansion. Credit Suisse Asset Management\u2019s Private Fund Group set up a group for direct investments this month.Sun Life Investment Management\u2019s private credit group has more than $30 billion (US$23 billion) of assets, and did some 176 deals last year. Its transactions include lending to large, mostly investment-grade companies; project finance; private securitizations and middle-market deals.The middle market is an acquisition prospect for Peacher, who said ramping up that and the whole private credit business is a way to diversify its portfolio held mostly in investment-grade debt.\u201cThere are firms out there and that\u2019s exclusively what they do and maybe that\u2019s something we\u2019d be interested in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look at it as broad diversification. We expect to be invested in a prudent way across the risk spectrum.\u201dMiddle-market lending is also where lender protections have weakened, an affliction seen in the riskier loan market more broadly. In a survey earlier this year, lenders expressed concern about how the loans will fare when economic conditions sour and interest rates rise. Sun Life Investment Management is steering clear of weaker deals in private credit, Chief Investment Officer Randy Brown said.\u201cThere\u2019s so much money chasing these private debt markets and high-yield markets that they are willing to concede covenants for spreads. We\u2019re not,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at the front line negotiating covenants and my instructions to the team are very clear \u2014 we\u2019re not conceding. I would rather we walk away from a deal than concede on a covenant.\u201dBrown oversees Sun Life Investment Management\u2019s general account, a portfolio of more than $140 billion that\u2019s mostly investment-grade bonds. Lately the account\u2019s been shedding high-yield debt exposure and moving up in quality amid expectations the economic climate will turn and because investors aren\u2019t being compensated enough for risk, he said.Sun Life Investment Management is also looking at other acquisitions, including in infrastructure equity and real estate, according to Peacher. It bought three companies in 2015, Prime Advisors Inc., Bentall Kennedy and Ryan Labs Asset Management. In March Ryan Labs hired a five-strong team to manage senior loans and third-party managed collateralized loan obligation securities. The team is being led by Mark Pelletier.\u201cWe need to make more acquisitions and not just one,\u201d Peacher said. \u201cOur aspiration is to have a global firm that has a range of alternative investment capabilities. We\u2019re actively back on the hunt.\u201d\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Allison McNeely", "title": "Meet the alternative mortgage lender who\u2019s a last resort for desperate homebuyers bigger banks won't touch", "description": "'We tell the borrowers if you are dishonest to us, it's like pulling a loaded gun on yourself'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/meet-the-alternative-mortgage-lender-whos-become-a-last-resort-for-desperate-homebuyers-bigger-banks-wont-touch?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/0423forsale.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 23, 2018 9:44 AM EDT", "content": "When prospective borrowers sit down in the boardroom to negotiate a loan at one of Canada\u2019s largest alternative lenders, they\u2019re greeted by a sculpture of a gun with its barrel twisted back toward the shooter.\u201cWe tell the borrowers if you are dishonest to us, it\u2019s like pulling a loaded gun on yourself,\u201d says Eli Dadouch, 52, founder and chief executive officer of Toronto-based Firm Capital. The company lends to home buyers, builders, developers, and landlords that bigger banks can\u2019t or won\u2019t touch, charging more than twice as much for the risk.It\u2019s been a lucrative business. In addition to the gun sculpture, Dadouch\u2019s extensive contemporary art collection at the company\u2019s office in the city\u2019s north end includes pieces by U.S. pop artist Steve Kaufman and photographer Rodney Smith. With new mortgage rules pushing more homebuyers to alternative lenders like Firm Capital, business may be about to get even more lucrative.\u201cWe think there will be some opportunities because the credit unions will pick up the vast majority of the bank rejects. It goes down the food chain.\u201d said Dadouch, sitting in Firm Capital\u2019s boardroom, where espresso and cookies are served. \u201cWe\u2019ll get their business.\u201dAlternative lenders are playing a growing role in Canada\u2019s real estate market as the industry searches for new sources of financing, risk-averse banks become more picky, and investors look for yield.The march to the private market has been driven in part by a desire to reduce taxpayer exposure to housing, which has until recently, been on steroids. Federal and provincial governments have gradually been tightening the screws, reducing amortizations, instituting foreign-buyer taxes and making it tougher to get a mortgage.The moves have begun to bite. About 49 per cent of all outstanding mortgages were uninsured at the end of last year, up from 36 per cent five years ago. And the housing market in Toronto, Canada\u2019s biggest city, has abruptly slowed, with average prices plunging 14 per cent in March from a year earlier, the biggest drop since 1991.That doesn\u2019t worry Dadouch, who thinks any slump is temporary in Toronto due to the simple fact that more people want to own a home than there is land or homes available. He met Firm Capital\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan Mair, buying distressed debt from him in the early 1990s, when interest rates rates reached double-digits and several trust companies collapsed in the recession. Even at that time, portfolios of residential mortgages sold to investors at only a slight discount to face value, Dadouch said.\u201cI think single-family always does really well in this country,\u201d he said. Single-family mortgage lending currently makes up about 15 per cent of the company\u2019s business. The company has about $1.3 billion (US$1 billion) in mortgage assets, including $562 million in its publicly traded mortgage investment corporation at Dec. 31.MICs will likely grow to about 14 per cent of transaction volume in Canada under new the new mortgage rules from about 10 per cent now, according to research from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce last year.Firm Capital\u2019s specialty is lending for terms up to 24 months, after which the borrower will ideally refinance the loan at one of the country\u2019s big banks, or if things aren\u2019t going well, head to another private mortgage investment corporation. Its public mortgage portfolio has an average interest rate of 8.3 per cent, compared with about 3 per cent for home loans at the big banks.\u201cIn this liquid market, whenever there\u2019s a problem, somebody refinances us,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never want to be the last guy on the stick. Leave enough room to get taken out.\u201dDadouch got into real estate as a teenager managing properties for his parents before starting a mortgage business with his father in 1988. He kept growing Firm Capital after his father\u2019s death in 1990, and it currently employs 80 to 90 people, he said.Unlike the traditional bank lenders, Firm Capital doesn\u2019t focus on a prospective borrower\u2019s credit score when considering a residential mortgage deal, lending primarily on asset value, Dadouch said. They also rely on borrower integrity when dealing with builders and developers, making a decision within an hour about whether or not they\u2019ll be willing to extend credit, he said. They\u2019ll do one deal in 10 that they\u2019re shown, Dadouch said.\u201cWe have no pressure to lend money for the sake of lending money,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen your commodity is cash, they\u2019ll come to you wherever you are.\u201dFirm Capital has sold a handful of real estate projects in the last 10 years after borrowers couldn\u2019t pay. He can\u2019t remember the last time they had to sell a single-family home to recoup their investment, he said.\u201cWe honour every commitment we give,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will work with a good guy who runs into trouble.\u201dThe company provides first mortgages, secondary debt, mezzanine and equity financing in transactions anywhere from $1 million to $50 million for builders and developers, Dadouch said. But they\u2019re willing to go higher \u2014 the company provided a first mortgage for $147 million to finance the construction of Canada\u2019s tallest condo tower, The One, located in Toronto\u2019s upscale Yorkville neighborhood. They also have a small art finance business, a nod to Dadouch\u2019s passion.\u201cThey\u2019re very entrepreneurial, flexible, and creative in the types of deals they do,\u201d Michael McTaggart, a partner in PwC\u2019s corporate advisory and restructuring group, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cWhen I go up there, I do my homework.\u201dThe company counts former Finance Minister Joe Oliver and Frank Newbould, a retired judge who oversaw high-profile bankruptcies like Nortel Networks Corp., among its board of directors.There\u2019s no question Firm Capital would be considered a lender of last resort for a home buyer given the punitive fees that mortgage investment corporations can levy, sometimes around 20 per cent all-in, including other professional fees, said Shawn Stillman, a broker at Mortgage Outlet. Nevertheless, he\u2019s seeing greater demand for mortgage investment corporations from his clients that have been shut out of the housing market due to the new regulation, he said.\u201cWould they be the first lender I would go with? Absolutely not,\u201d Stillman said by phone from Toronto. \u201cBut if there wasn\u2019t this demand for the money, they wouldn\u2019t be in business.\u201dDadouch doesn\u2019t disagree: \u201cNobody deals with us, or any other MIC out there, because they like any of us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come to us because there\u2019s a story.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Builders scrapping pre-sold Toronto condo projects as costs escalate, leaving buyers in the lurch", "description": "Soaring construction costs and condo values have spurred developers to cancel projects they started when construction was cheaper and pre-sales were less lucrative", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/builders-scrap-pre-sold-toronto-condo-towers-as-costs-escalate?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/0419toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 19, 2018 2:06 PM EDT", "content": "Builders in Toronto\u2019s frenzied condo market are walking away from giant towers they have pre-sold, reflecting a rougher road to profits \u2014 and leaving buyers in the lurch.Soaring construction costs and condo values in Canada\u2019s largest city, where prices have surged amid a booming economy and strong immigration, have spurred developers to cancel projects they started when construction was cheaper and pre-sales were less lucrative. Condo prices have increased about 20 per cent since February of last year, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.\u201cMany projects launched for pre-sales prior to having their proper approvals in place,\u201d Shaun Hildebrand, a senior vice president at Urbanation Inc., said. \u201cBy rushing to bring units into a hot market, some projects jumped the gun and added risk to the development.\u201dAccording to Urbanation, which studies the Toronto condo market, there are 10,622 condo units in the greater Toronto area that were offered for pre-sale before 2017 and still await construction. Since the start of last year, 17 projects, with 3,627 units, have been cancelled in the region, according to real-estate-services firm Altus Group Ltd. That\u2019s up from seven projects, with 808 units, in 2016.This month alone, Liberty Development Corp. pulled the plug on a three-tower, sold-out condo development, citing problems with construction financing. Liberty didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.The threat of still more cancellations looms over Toronto, where housing is tight, and expensive, as it is. While the average price of a home was down 17 per cent in March from a year earlier, according to the Toronto Real Estate Board, the decline comes after a long run-up. To cool the market, the government added rules making it more expensive to borrow \u2014 pushing buyers into condos from even pricier single-family homes.Typically, developers need pre-sales of at least 70 per cent to get financing to move a project forward, said Phong Ngo, director of data solutions at Altus. That isn\u2019t their last hurdle. From there, the longer it takes to break ground, the higher the costs of materials and labour, especially as interest rates rise. Builders may face delays in getting government permits, finding contractors and workers amid the hot demand or parrying special-interest groups that oppose construction.As of February, 143 condo projects that are at least 70 per cent pre-sold hadn\u2019t started construction yet, according to data from Altus. Of these, 43 had hit the 70 per cent mark more than a year earlier.Construction costs in the Toronto area, which typically have risen in tandem with inflation, increased 6 to 8 per cent last year (compared with inflation of about 2 per cent), according to Altus. \u201cWe believe that going forward next year, it\u2019ll be at least that or more,\u201d David Schoonjans, senior director at the firm, said. At the same time, labour costs are rising, with hourly compensation up 2.4 per cent across Canada in 2017.\u201cAt some point the project stops making financial sense,\u201d Schoonjans said.It is in that environment that the Toronto region finds itself with 412 condo projects totalling 101,208 units in the works, Altus reports.In the end, \u201conly a small portion\u201d of condo buildings will be cancelled, said Lauren White, senior vice president of the Land Services Group at CBRE Group Inc. \u201cTherefore, the effect will be a minor tightening on supply as purchasers from cancelled projects move to active projects.\u201dHomebuyers who have had their projects scrapped will be back in the market again, increasing demand even further, said Mike Czestochowski, executive vice president of the group.That\u2019s good for builders but a problem for buyers. Many who get their deposits back from the developer of a nixed project probably will have lost equity, because the market is a lot hotter today, Czestochowski said.With the intense demand for housing in and around the city, many new projects are bound to rise and cancelled ones to be revived \u2014 at higher prices.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen an increase in supply yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be hard to imagine what else they do with the site.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Stephen Poloz's cautious approach to interest rates is about to be challenged", "description": "Markets see two hikes \u2014 in July and October", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/rising-inflation-poses-biggest-test-of-polozs-cautious-stance", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/stephen-poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 17, 2018 2:04 PM EDT", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz\u2019s cautious approach to interest rates is about to be challenged.While the central banker is expected to hold off from raising borrowing costs for a second straight policy decision on Wednesday, and retain a degree of prudence in his rhetoric, Poloz will probably face mounting pressure to return to the rate hike path soon, with inflation and growth beginning to pick up.Economists predict inflation will move well above the Bank of Canada\u2019s 2 per cent target in the coming months, while growth should also return to an above-2 per cent pace after a recent slump. It would mark the first time since 2014 that both exceed that level simultaneously.\u201cWhat makes the Bank of Canada uncomfortable is inflation that is north of target at a time where growth isn\u2019t necessarily that different from trend,\u201d Ian Pollick, head of rates strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cThat\u2019s an environment where they\u2019ll be forced to do something.\u201dPoloz has played the cautious card for months, an easy tack to take so long as the numbers backed him up, which they have. Inflation averaged just 1.6 per cent last year, and the economy entered a soft spot in the second half that spilled over into the early part of 2018.But the backdrop is changing. Economists surveyed last week predict inflation will average 2.3 per cent in the second quarter and 2.4 per cent in the third \u2014 the highest levels since 2011. And with oil prices marching higher, the risks are tilted to the upside.Royal Bank of Canada now projects inflation will average 2.9 per cent in the third quarter, at the upper end of the central bank\u2019s 1 per cent to 3 per cent target range.\u201cThere is some sort of sensitivity when you get to the outer edges of the band,\u201d said Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cIt sharpens the debate a little bit.\u201dGrowth, meanwhile, is expected to remain above potential over much of the next two years, starting with a strong rebound this quarter.When at full capacity, the theory goes, Canada\u2019s economy can\u2019t grow much beyond its potential \u2014 estimated by the central bank at 1.6 per cent \u2014 without fueling price pressures and prompting rate increases. And borrowing costs in Canada are still highly stimulative, almost two percentage points below what the Bank of Canada estimates is their \u201cneutral\u201d rate.But Poloz has indicated he\u2019s in no rush to get there \u2014 mainly because, he says, the economy isn\u2019t yet firing on all cylinders. Even with the unemployment rate at the lowest in four decades, Canada still has plenty of untapped potential, such as underemployment among youth and female workers, the governor says. There\u2019s more capacity that needs to be absorbed and the economy can continue to grow above potential, he contends.Because of this extra capacity, the inflation spike this year \u2014 largely the result of an inflation soft patch a year ago \u2014 will be temporary, eventually returning to the 2 per cent target, according to the central bank\u2019s assumptions.For the time being, Poloz can rest easy that economists and investors seem to have bought into his cautious narrative.Most investors have interpreted this as a preference on the central bank\u2019s part for waiting. Markets are assigning just a 20 per cent chance of an increase at the April 18 decision, and two hikes for 2018 \u2014 in July and October.If he becomes unsettled by the inflation and growth numbers, another option for Poloz would be to move more rapidly over the next 12 months, but stop before he gets to the neutral rate. This is what RBC\u2019s Chandler expects. Still cautious, but more active in the near term.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to make an argument that rates need to go higher,\u201d Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of the governor feeling confident enough to pull the trigger.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier", "title": "Canadians warned to climb out of debt before it's too late, as threat of cooling housing markets looms", "description": "Credit counselling expert says with debt loads at a record and little in the way of savings, Canadians may be 'caught off guard' if economic threats materialize", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/dr-debt-warns-canadians-to-get-financial-houses-in-order", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/0412debt.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 12, 2018 11:08 AM EDT", "content": "Scott Hannah says low borrowing costs and rising home prices have lured Canadians into a debt trap they may not escape if looming economic threats materialize.Hannah, president of the Credit Counselling Society, is seeing an influx of clients as higher financing costs begin to bite and people find it harder to manage.

He\u2019s sounding the alarm as rising interest rates and stricter borrowing rules threaten to squeeze households even further. The Bank of Canada is expected to raise its benchmark rate twice more this year and its next decision is April 18.Hannah\u2019s colleagues dubbed him \u201cDr. Debt\u201d after he received an honorary degree in 2012 from University Canada West, a private business school, for his \u201cdistinguished service in the field of credit counseling.\u201d Prior to establishing the non-profit, registered charity in 1996, he worked for 11 years at Equifax Canada, a credit reporting company, but decided \u201ca nice title and a good salary doesn\u2019t make you happy,\u201d so he left to find something that \u201cmade a difference.\u201dHe found it by helping people get relief from their creditors. As Hannah tells it, during the early 1990s, the provincial debtor assistance program in British Columbia was cutting back just as bankruptcy rates were rising. A group of banks, credit unions and department stores tried and failed to establish a complementary service. Hannah offered to raise the necessary funds, so long as he was allowed to run the organization.Twenty-one years later, the society \u2014 with offices from the provincial capital in Victoria to Ottawa \u2014 has assisted more than half a million people. The average client is 43 years old, has $31,000 in outstanding debt and seven creditors. More than half are female. Average gross monthly income is $5,200, and housing costs consume 42 per cent of their net income. The society\u2019s clients repaid $51 million last year, up about 6 per cent.It\u2019s still a drop in the bucket.Canadian household credit totalled a record $2.13 trillion at the end of February, roughly doubling since 2006, central bank data show. Residential mortgages account for 72 per cent of that. The rest includes credit cards, lines of credit and auto loans.People carrying large debt loads still feel ahead of the game because home prices keep rising, Hannah said. \u201cWhat happens when the economy has a downturn, like in Alberta. We know what happened. We\u2019re still seeing the impact of that,\u201d he said, adding people in the oil-rich province were \u201ccaught off guard, and because of a lack of savings, many people lost their homes, had to sell their assets and start over again.\u201dSome observers argue Canada\u2019s household debt isn\u2019t a problem because asset ratios and home equity levels are also high and the country\u2019s labor market is strong. A report from the Canadian Banker\u2019s Association this week showed the national mortgage arrears rate through January was 0.24 per cent, close to the lowest in three decades.Hannah doesn\u2019t buy it. Low arrears and delinquency rates \u201cdon\u2019t tell the whole story,\u201d because a robust housing market is masking financial strains, he said. \u201cIf a person\u2019s had difficulty keeping up with the mortgage payment, it\u2019s been relatively easy just to sell your home,\u201d said Hannah. \u201cWhat happens though when you have a tight market and it\u2019s not as easy to sell your home?

Even with the improved outlook, a \u201cstrong majority\u201d of Fed officials voiced concern that a trade war would harm the economy, and some policy makers said the recent turbulence in financial markets highlighted risks to growth, the minutes showed.\u201cParticipants did not see the steel and aluminum tariffs, by themselves, as likely to have a significant effect on the national economic outlook,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cBut a strong majority of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries\u201d as a downside risk.Investors saw about a 78 per cent chance that interest rates will be higher after the June meeting, according to federal funds futures prices at 12:40 p.m. New York time. The central bank\u2019s current target is a range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent, after the March hike.U.S. central bankers saw costs and benefits to an economy operating \u201cwell above potential,\u201d ranging from a faster return of inflation to target and an increase in labor force participation. \u201cOn the other hand, an overheated economy could result in significant inflation pressures or lead to financial instability,\u201d the minutes said.The minutes showed participants discussed the possibility of revising statement language \u201cat some point\u201d to acknowledge that monetary policy \u201cwould likely gradually move from an accommodative stance to being a neutral or restraining factor for economic activity.\u201dOfficials gathered to discuss policy with more powerful cross- currents than usual buffeting the U.S. economy.Tax cuts have lifted business sentiment and the outlook for growth, with the Fed seeing a \u201csignificant boost to output over the next few years\u201d from the tax law and a federal budget boost.

Equities have since recouped some of those losses amid signs of eased trade tensions.\u201cMany participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous month\u2019s turbulence in stride, although a few participants suggested that financial developments over the intermeeting period highlighted some downside risks associated with still-high valuations for equities or from market volatility more generally,\u201d the minutes said.At the meeting, central bankers raised their median estimates for U.S. growth to 2.7 per cent for 2018 from 2.5 per cent projected in December.They also saw the jobless rate falling to 3.6 per cent by the end of 2019, further below their 4.5 per cent estimate of unemployment\u2019s long-run sustainable rate.

He declined to comment further.Strong labour markets and historically low borrowing costs have allowed Canada\u2019s households to amass one of the highest debt-to-income ratios in the developed world. Now rising interest rates and a cooling real estate market are prompting speculation the debt burden poses a threat to the financial system.Roll rates in National Bank of Canada\u2019s Canadian Credit Card Trust program are at the highest since 2008, while for CIBC\u2019s CARDS II program, early stage delinquencies, 60-89 day delinquencies and roll rates are all above the 10-year average, Selot said.Heloc ProgramIn February, BMO\u2019s home equity line of credit securitization program Fortified Trust registered a loss rate of 12 basis points, the highest level since the program\u2019s inception in 2016, the analyst said.To be sure, Selot pointed out \u201cconsumer credit quality seems benign,\u201d with charge-offs \u2014 or recognized losses \u2014 remaining near cyclical lows.

It will advance 2.9 per cent to 80.64 U.S. cents by the end of this year and to 83.33 in 2019, according to Lloyds.The currency has been under pressure this year as the economy slowed and investors cut bets for interest-rate increases. Concerns that negotiations to overhaul NAFTA would fall apart have also weighed on the currency, though as of last week, Lloyds\u2019s optimism was looking well placed.Canada, the U.S. and Mexico are making progress in NAFTA talks, which have entered \u201ca new, more intensive stage of engagement,\u201d Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Friday after meeting with her U.S. and Mexican counterparts in Washington. Talks were expected to resume Monday.Lloyds is more bullish than other Canadian dollar watchers. The loonie will strengthen to 80 U.S. cents by the end of the year, according to a median of forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. And hedge funds and other speculators last month turned bearish on the currency for the first time since July, according to the data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Investors wager there\u2019s a 23 per cent chance of a rate increase at the central bank\u2019s policy meeting on April 18, swaps trading suggests, down from 40 per cent two weeks ago, while a hike in July isn\u2019t fully priced in. In his latest speech from March 13, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the central bank\u2019s latest decision to keep interest rates on hold reflected comfort with recent data.Yet inflation in February accelerated to an annual pace of 2.2 per cent, the highest in three years, even as the economy contracted in January. Data on Friday showed the economy created a higher-than-expected 32,300 jobs in March, keeping the unemployment rate at 5.8 per cent, the lowest in four decades.Global economic growth will remain robust this year, which should help drive crude oil prices higher and support the Canadian dollar, according to Isaah Mhlanga, a Johannesburg-based economist at Rand Merchant Bank, which came in second in the Bloomberg ranking of forecasters. The ranking is based on calls for the first quarter.Mhlanga sees long-term fair value of the Canadian dollar at around 85.47 U.S. cents and expects the currency to strengthen to 81.96 by the end of the year. He doesn\u2019t expect the Bank of Canada to hike as aggressively as the market anticipates, seeing just one more rate increase this year compared to the market pricing in two.\u201cIf you combine one rate hike and commodity prices picking up, that should be bullish for the Canadian dollar,\u201d he said.Bears say NAFTA could still unravel and come back to plague the loonie. The currency will probably weaken up to 76.33 U.S. cents over the next two quarters, according to Juan Perez, a Washington-based senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc. which came third in the ranking of forecasters.\u201cBecause of NAFTA being such a dark cloud and the U.S. economy being resilient and consistent, it weighs on the Canadian dollar in a negative way,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Canadian dollar has much that could improve its situation in the next six months.\u201dFor now though, things are looking up on the future of the North American trade bloc, according to Lloyds\u2019s Mahadevan.\u201cThere was a psychologically based drive to price in a huge degree of risk around NAFTA and after President Trump temporarily exempted Canada from the steel and aluminum tariffs, we\u2019ve seen some of that pullback,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jacqueline Thorpe", "title": "Toronto home prices see biggest drop in almost 30 years", "description": "March sales down 40% from a year ago, the lowest since 2009", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-luxury-home-sales-tank-from-last-years-record-pace", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/homeprices.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 4, 2018 12:07 PM EDT", "content": "The high-end of Toronto\u2019s housing market is bearing the brunt of declines from last year\u2019s dizzying growth, with prices falling and unit sales slumping by almost half.Sales of detached homes in and around Canada\u2019s biggest city fell 46 per cent in March from the same month a year ago, while the average price fell 17 per cent to $1.01 million, according to data released Wednesday by the Toronto Real Estate Board. That dragged down the average selling prices for all housing types by 14 per cent from a year earlier to $784,558, the biggest drop since 1991.\u201cDetached home sales, which generally represent the highest price points in a given area, declined much more than other home types,\u201d the board said in its monthly report. \u201cIn addition, the share of high-end detached homes selling for over $2 million in March 2018 was half of what was reported in March 2017, further impacting the average selling price.\u201dStill, prices continued their stabilization of the past few months as home owners get ready for the traditionally hectic spring season. Benchmark prices, which are weighed to account for differences in home type, rose 1.2 per cent in March from February, including 1.1 per cent gain for detached homes and a 1.8 per cent increase in condos.

Households in the rest of the country would see debt-service costs rise $800 or less.Canada\u2019s household debt levels, among the highest in the developed world, are taking centre stage after the central bank lifted borrowing costs and governments imposed restrictions on mortgage credit, making it more expensive to service existing liabilities and harder to refinance. Tighter conditions may crimp Canada\u2019s economy, which has relied on consumer spending and gains in real estate for growth over the past several years.The Bank of Canada will probably raise its benchmark rate to 1.75 per cent by the end of this year, from 1.25 per cent now, according to the median of 16 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The next decision is April 18 in Ottawa.A booming provincial economy and strong income gains before the oil price collapse that began in 2014 emboldened Albertans to amass significant debt, Hogue said. Average household liabilities in the province rose to $192,000 in 2016, from $164,000 in 2010, he said. That compares with $174,000 in British Columbia and $154,000 in Ontario. Other provinces are \u201cwell below\u201d the national average debt load of $141,000.In addition, Albertans may feel the impact of higher rates sooner, since 18 per cent of mortgage borrowers have terms of 2 years or less, by far the highest share in the country, according to Hogue. The average household in Alberta had $124,000 in mortgage debt, with other debt such as term loans, credit lines and leases amounting to $68,000, he said.Debt-service bills in Alberta, as well as in British Columbia and Ontario, will get larger as interest rates increase. That\u2019s \u201cbound to cause many households to spend more cautiously on other goods and services,\u201d Hogue wrote.Potential increases in debt-service costs \u201caren\u2019t pocket change,\u201d he said. For example, the $1,200 no longer available for spending on goods and services would exceed the $1,000 Alberta households spend on entertainment or the $800 they spend on furniture.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "How the CEO of an old-school credit union became Canada's go-to weed banker", "description": "Banking is a serious hang-up for an industry that's set to generate US$31.4 billion in annual sales by 2021", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/weed-banker-snags-600-million-in-business-as-rivals-just-say-no", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/0403paterson.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 3, 2018 10:04 AM EDT", "content": "In a down-and-out\u00a0Canadian town, Bruce Linton dreamed of transforming an abandoned Hershey Co. chocolate plant into the Next Big Thing, a medical marijuana factory. But the pot entrepreneur faced a crisis typical of his edgy industry: Banks shut their doors in his face.It began with Royal Bank of Canada. The 148-year-old blue-chip company dropped him as a customer when it discovered he ran with the cannabis crowd. \u201cWe must regretfully inform you,\u201d read the financial Dear John letter he was sent. Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal \u2014 they stiffed him, too. He queried Bank of Nova Scotia and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. No luck.Scouring Google, Linton lowered his sights, but the rejections kept piling up, like roaches at a Grateful Dead concert. No \u201crespectable\u201d bank wanted to take a chance on an untried business selling a product with the whiff of vice.Then Linton turned to an old-school credit union \u2014 that paragon of community, rectitude, and caution\u2013and found a middle-aged banker named Rob Paterson. The chief executive officer of Alterna Savings & Credit Union Ltd. seemed an unlikely mark. He barely drank and hadn\u2019t smoked a joint since his university days.Paterson was headed out to his car in the parking lot at Alterna\u2019s Toronto office when one of his lieutenants caught up to him and said, \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what\u2019s come to us \u2014 a weed company.\u201dInitially, Paterson dismissed the idea. But then, like any good banker, he hit the books. He and his crew spent several months studying Linton\u2019s business plan. They scoured the regulations on medical marijuana and even interviewed doctors. Paterson was impressed. He came back to his team and declared: \u201cLook, why would we not do this business?\u201d The marijuana company with the funky name, Tweed Inc., had found its bank.That was three years ago.\u00a0Since then, Paterson has become the go-to banker for the pot industry, and his first cannabis customer, Linton, the no-longer-desperate marijuana executive, is proud to show off his 650,000-square-foot pot facility in Smiths Falls, Ont. \u2014 a burg of 8,885 slowly rebounding from the shutdowns of the Hershey and Stanley Works tool plants a decade ago.\u201cChocolate Shoppe,\u201d proclaim the golden letters on an interior wall \u2014 put there as a tribute to past glory \u2014 but Linton\u2019s operation, now demurely christened Canopy Growth Corp., bristles with high-tech equipment; the production area requires a fingerprint scan for access. Inside, rows of lush marijuana plants will be harvested and dried and become fodder for joints and pipes as well as refined into oils for soft-gel capsules to treat chronic pain, nausea from cancer treatment, sleep disorders, and anxiety.Canopy Growth is the world\u2019s largest publicly traded marijuana producer, with a market value of more than $6 billion (US$4.6 billion). But its ticker, WEED, is true to its roots, and, similarly, Linton hasn\u2019t forgotten Paterson and the credit union that made it possible. \u201cI\u2019ve been a walking brochure for them,\u201d he says.The times may be\u00a0changing for the pot business as countries around the globe shift from locking up dealers to passing legislation for legalization. But banking remains a serious hang-up for an industry that\u2019s set to generate US$31.4 billion in annual sales by 2021, according to Brightfield Group, a Chicago-based research firm.In the U.S., marijuana dispensaries have been known to tote bags of cash around to banks to make deposits. That exposes couriers to robbery, gives the businesses a taint of the illicit, and spooks banks that remain wary of the nascent industry following U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s promise to enforce federal laws banning the plant. \u201cIf you\u2019re a major institution, life\u2019s too short to take a risk of being in violation of United States federal banking laws,\u201d says Christopher Barry, a Dorsey & Whitney LLP attorney who advises cannabis companies on cross-border financing and regulatory issues.In this uncertain environment, Canada may offer the sharpest glimpse of the future \u2014 and the business opportunities \u2014 for financial-services companies willing to take the risk. In 1999, Canada began to allow legal access to medical marijuana. Even so, the industry didn\u2019t take off until 2013, when the government changed regulations to make it simpler for companies to enter the market. At least 20 countries \u2014 Australia, Germany, and Mexico among them \u2014 and 29 U.S. states have followed suit.Now comes legalized recreational pot. Nine U.S. states and the District of Columbia have taken the step. This year, Canada will become the first country to do so since Uruguay in 2017. Already, Canada has the largest herd of \u201ccannabis \u00adunicorns\u201d \u2014 fledgling publicly traded companies worth US$1 billion or more \u2014 such as Canopy, Aurora Cannabis, and Aphria. Canadian stock exchanges host at least 85 pot companies, with a combined market value of $30 billion.As for Alterna, it now has about $750 million in pot-related loans and deposits. Paterson estimates he banks two-thirds of the almost 100 licensed producers in the business, and Linton isn\u2019t the only one spreading the word. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of referrals from accounting and law firms,\u201d Paterson says. \u201cThe call to me is always, \u2018Hey, hope this doesn\u2019t sound crazy, but I\u2019ve heard you guys are in this industry, and I have a client who\u2019s great but they\u2019re having trouble getting banking services.\u2019 \u201dIn 2016, when word of Alterna\u2019s involvement in the pot banking business started getting out, Paterson expected a backlash, but he encountered none.Still, Kevin Sabet, a former White House drug policy adviser under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, says banks should steer clear of an industry that remains illegal in much of the world and seeks to profit from a harmful drug. \u201cYou now have a financial system with all of its backing promoting an industry that is trying to get rich off of addiction,\u201d says Sabet, co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a nonprofit that opposes legalization. \u201cFrom a public health point of view, that\u2019s a very bad idea.\u201dOthers wonder whether Paterson\u2019s fortunes have peaked: The major banks are starting to circle. Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion have quietly been providing some banking services. Even Royal Bank and Scotiabank, which have been steadfast in not helping the industry, now say they\u2019re open to reviewing policies as the laws change.David Baskin, president of Toronto-based money manager Baskin Wealth Management Inc., which has long owned big-bank shares, says the established institutions have so much market power that credit unions such as Alterna can\u2019t hope to match them. \u201cThey\u2019ll get left in the dust,\u201d he says.When Paterson isn\u2019t\u00a0flying across Canada to meet pot executives, he sometimes works from Toronto out of Alterna\u2019s squat, 1970s brown-brick building in an office park near Canada\u2019s busiest airport. (Alterna is headquartered in Ottawa.) It\u2019s a far cry from Paris, where he was born in 1967, the youngest of three sons, to a Canadian mother and a Scottish father who was working there as an executive for International Business Machines Corp. Following a stint in Hong Kong, the family moved to Canada in the mid-1980s. At the University of Western Ontario in London, 110 miles southwest of Toronto, Paterson majored in philosophy and, like so many of his classmates, did a little weed. \u201cIt was something every one of us did, experimented in one of the residences, and passing to the left, you know,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was it.\u201dAfter university, Paterson spent 15 years at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce before working in Asia as a McKinsey & Co. consultant and returning to Canada to join JPMorgan Chase & Co. In 2013, when he was an executive vice president at risk manager Aon Plc in Toronto, a recruiter called with a lead: Would he like to try to turn around Alterna, an underperforming credit union? He took the CEO job in April, slashing 10 per cent of operating costs in his first 100 days. Paterson, who had a lifelong interest in tinkering with computers, also embraced digital banking.Alterna\u2019s assets have almost tripled since Paterson joined, climbing to $6.6 billion as of Dec. 31, and it\u2019s become one of Canada\u2019s 10 largest credit unions. In 2016, Paterson earned $985,000 from Alterna, making him one of the better-paid heads of Canadian credit unions (though his compensation was about a 12th of that of Royal Bank\u2019s David McKay, the highest-paid bank CEO in the country). That year, the latest period available, Alterna\u2019s annual profit almost tripled, to $16.3 million, compared with the year before.Paterson\u2019s sparsely furnished ground-floor corner office in Toronto overlooks the parking lot where it all began \u2014 or where at least the weed part did. Alterna has a team of six commercial bankers who specialize in the marijuana industry, with clients in British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario. Paterson has visited at least 20 of the country\u2019s largest cannabis complexes. He\u2019s got final say on the deals. \u201cWe can tell someone who\u2019s sophisticated and has the capability to survive and go through the whole process from those that aren\u2019t,\u201d he says.As a credit union, Alterna can\u2019t offer one-stop shopping. It can do chequing and savings accounts, cash management, and credit cards. As its client companies in the marijuana business grow, Paterson will make loans of $5 million to $25 million at interest rates 2.5 percentage points to 5.5 percentage points above five-year Canadian government benchmarks, which is about what he\u2019d charge a customer in the real estate business. But for mergers and stock sales, marijuana concerns must look to weed-oriented investment banks such as Canaccord Genuity Group, GMP Capital, and Eight Capital.Does the gap in business offerings mean that Alterna could, in fact, get left behind? In January, Bank of Montreal became the first major bank to arrange a stock sale for a company tied to pot. Its capital markets division helped lead a $200.7 million equity financing for none other than Canopy Growth, Paterson\u2019s first pot customer. CIBC, Paterson\u2019s old employer and Canada\u2019s fifth-largest lender, was part of a $20 million credit deal signed last year with producer MedReleaf Corp. Relatively small though it was, that deal was a milestone: It marked the first time a Big Five Canadian bank made a loan to the industry.Although they\u2019ve shied away from pot, U.S. lenders regularly call Paterson for advice on the market he pioneered in Canada. He\u2019s happy to help them plot their strategy south of the border. He\u2019s also heard from some of those Canadian banks that turned down his first client when it was desperate for help for the chocolate factory overhaul. When those calls come in, he gives the titans a taste of their own medicine. With characteristic Canadian understatement, Paterson says, \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to be so helpful.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Toronto morphs into new 'monster' as houses slump, condos soar", "description": "It's a tale of two housing markets as Canada's biggest city gears up for the crucial spring selling season", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-morphs-into-new-monster-as-houses-slump-condos-soar", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 29, 2018 11:50 AM EDT", "content": "It\u2019s a tale of two housing markets in the Toronto area as Canada\u2019s biggest city gears up for the crucial spring selling season: sales of big detached homes are slow, while condo deals are booming.On one side are people like Karen Berends, who put her $1,498,888 house back on the market in nearby Oakville this month after two failed attempts to sell in the past year. She reduced her asking price by about $51,000, but still there are no takers, and she\u2019s kicking herself for not cashing out last spring when the market was in a frenzy.\u201cWe could\u2019ve walked away with a really good amount of money in our bank account if we had taken the money last year, but our head wasn\u2019t in it at that point,\u201d Berends said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s been a complete 360 this time around \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely dead.\u201dThen there\u2019s Beth O\u2019Donoghue, a sales representative at Brad J. Lamb Realty Inc., who says the market is as hot as it\u2019s ever been. Her clients recently lost out in three separate condo bidding wars in a week, including one with 11 offers. That\u2019s convinced O\u2019Donoghue, who\u2019s invested in four new condos herself in the city in the past four years, to hold onto her assets for now.One she bought in pre-construction for $420,000 and figures she could sell for close to $700,000. \u201cIf you would have told me three years ago when I bought this place that I would\u2019ve made this much money on it already, I would have said you\u2019re crazy,\u201d she said.After a decade as one of the world\u2019s hottest housing markets, Toronto is moving in two directions. Transactions have certainly cooled since May as the government introduced new rules to tame runaway prices. But the impact has been largely on big, expensive detached homes, with sales plunging 41 per cent in February from a year earlier, and prices dropping 12 per cent since hitting a record last year. Condo prices, in contrast, soared about 20 per cent since last February.The deviation is largely as a result of mortgage regulations that went into effect on Jan. 1 as well as rising interest rates. The rule requires that even people with a 20 per cent down payment, who don\u2019t require mortgage insurance, prove they can make payments at least 2 percentage points above the rates under which they go into contract.That\u2019s pushing buyers out of the detached segment and right into the condo market.\u201cI\u2019ve been looking at the condo market for years and I\u2019ve been waiting for it to correct and it\u2019s just not happening,\u201d Patrick Rocca, a real estate agent at Bosley Real Estate Ltd., said by phone. \u201cHonestly, this scares me. When you have condos selling at $1,000 to $1,200 per square foot for resale, that\u2019s mind-boggling.\u201dReal estate agents and economists expect some stabilization in the detached market as the spring selling season swings into full gear, but the price spikes of last year are probably history. The condo market is likely to keep chugging, bolstered by millennials in high-paying technology and financial jobs, strong immigration and pinched supply, according to Bank of Montreal economists.\u201cSpring will probably take a little more time to get going than years past, but there\u2019s so much demand in the marketplace as Toronto continues to attract people around the country and the globe,\u201d said Christopher Alexander, regional director at real estate firm Re/Max Integra.Meanwhile, things are getting tough for tenants too. The combination of stress tests, urbanization and high home prices is creating the perfect formula for skyrocketing rents, said Simeon Papailias, co-founder of the Real Estate Center, a Toronto-based real estate management company. Many homebuyers who no longer qualify for a mortgage are turning to renting instead, which in turn attracts investors who want to become landlords.\u201cThis market is creating new monsters \u2014 it\u2019s taking a life of its own and it\u2019s creating a new marketplace,\u201d Papailias said by phone.Berends, the Oakville homeowner, has placed ads in several Chinese media outlets in hopes of attracting foreign shoppers. \u201cApparently there are still buyers in mainland China, but they\u2019re not really jumping,\u201d she said.She\u2019s hoping to retire to a home she\u2019s building north of the city in a few years, but she\u2019s waiting for the right price for her existing house.\u201cI\u2019m thinking we might have to take it off and wait till next year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so difficult to know.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sarah Ponczek and Jeremy Herron", "title": "Stocks drop the most in six weeks on trade war tension", "description": "The threat that a tit-for-tat trade spat with China will erupt and hamper global growth has investors on edge", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/us-stocks-wobble-as-investors-wait-for-fed-news-on-rates", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0322traders.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 22, 2018 4:33 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks tumbled the most in six weeks and Treasuries rallied as investors shifted focus from the Federal Reserve to the threat of an escalating trade war with China that has the potential to disrupt global growth.The benchmark S&P 500 Index slumped the most since early February and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 700 points after President Donald Trump ordered tariffs on about US$50 billion in Chinese goods.

Trump\u2019s first trade action directly aimed at China comes as policy makers including IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde warn of a global trade conflict that could undermine the broadest world recovery in years.Stocks were also hit earlier when John Dowd resigned as Trump\u2019s lead attorney countering Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe as the inquiry into possible collusion in the 2016 election intensifies.Facebook Inc. helped pace a decline in the tech sector, falling 2.7 per cent. This week\u2019s selloff in tech stocks is on pace to be the worst since early February. Other notable decliners Thursday included Accenture Plc and Micron Technology Inc.Elsewhere, West Texas oil fluctuated before falling and the Australian dollar slipped after the country\u2019s unemployment rate climbed. The British pound initially jumped after the country\u2019s central bank voted 7-2 to maintain interest rates, but pared as investors digested comments from policy makers that weren\u2019t overtly hawkish.Here are some key events on the schedule for the remainder of this week: The Bank of Russia\u2019s rate decision is on Friday. U.S. government funding is due to expire at the end of the day on Friday.And these are the main moves in markets:Stocks The S&P 500 Index fell 2.5 per cent as of 4:03 p.m. New York time, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.9 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 2.4 per cent.

It\u2019s broad based, with every sector on the S&P/TSX Composite Index expanding its net debt relative to sales over the past 10 years.\u201cCompanies in Canada are not dummies,\u201d Roberge said in a phone interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve been using this lever to finance their buybacks, dividend increases, and M&A.\u201dOn a forward price-to-earnings basis, Canada\u2019s stock benchmark is at the cheapest relative to the S&P 500 Index since the financial crisis. But Roberge suggests looking at the ratio of enterprise value, or market capitalization plus debt, to sales. By that metric, U.S. stocks are actually slightly cheaper than their Canadian counterparts, according to Bloomberg data \u2014 a fact that may help explain why the S&P/TSX has lagged the S&P 500 for much of the past decade.\u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve been piling on more debt on balance sheets than the U.S., you invert that line and it explains much of the underperformance of Canada versus the S&P 500,\u201d Roberge said.It\u2019s not just the U.S. \u2014 Canada\u2019s EV-to-sales multiples exceed those in developed markets outside North America and emerging markets as well, Roberge said.\u201cWhen you start screening, Canada looks very, very bad relative to other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cIf rates go up they will go up everywhere globally, so you want to be in a market that will be able to sustain a backup in rates and Canada will be way more vulnerable than other countries.\u201dRoberge also believes Canada isn\u2019t using that debt to its full advantage.\u201dThe problem is that not only do we have more debt but we\u2019re not even able to grow our earnings faster than the rest of world, so this leverage is not being used properly,\u201d he said.Still, he doesn\u2019t believe corporate Canada\u2019s debt loads are a concern as long as interest rates remain low, and the ratio of debt to sales appears to have stabilized, which he calls a \u201cray of light.\u201dBut if companies don\u2019t start deleveraging, he believes Canada\u2019s stocks could fall to the lowest level relative to the S&P 500 since before the tech bubble popped in 2001.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that if we keep on adding more debt than the U.S., it\u2019s hard to imagine that the relative performance will turn around and stage a sustainable bounce,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Maciej Onoszko, Kristine Owram and Matthew Winkler", "title": "Trump has made U.S. a much better bet than Canada: top fund managers", "description": "In Canada, a ticking consumer-debt bomb and declining competitiveness are dragging on asset prices, and fund managers are looking to the U.S. with envy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/trump-tax-cuts-are-making-canadas-best-fund-managers-envious", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0316trump2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 16, 2018 3:57 PM EDT", "content": "A reinvigorated U.S. economy under Donald Trump is a better bet than Canada, where a ticking consumer-debt bomb and declining competitiveness are dragging on asset prices, according to top-performing money managers north of the border.President Trump\u2019s tax cuts and pro-business agenda have revved up growth, stocks and corporate confidence, the managers said in a panel discussion at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto offices on Wednesday. Contrast that with Canada, where minimum wage hikes and carbon levies are ratcheting up business costs as a housing boom pushes consumer credit to a near-record 170 percent of disposable income.\u201cIt\u2019s not just one thing in isolation, it\u2019s many things,\u201d said Toronto-based Noah Blackstein, whose $1.5 billion (US$1.2 billion) Dynamic Power Global Growth Class fund has outperformed 554 global peers over the past 10 years. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s of benefit to Canada.\u201dCanadian stocks have trailed the U.S. for at least a decade but that gap has only widened since Trump\u2019s election. The loonie is the worst-performing major currency against the U.S. dollar this year while Canadian bonds are outperforming on expectations of slower growth. Investors expect the Bank of Canada to lag the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates as it tries to avoid pushing consumers over the edge.Consumer leverage is making Peter Kotsopoulos think twice about investing in Canadian bank debt. Kotsopoulos, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Toronto-based MFS Investment Management Canada Ltd., prefers U.S. financials such Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. that issue loonie debt, or Maple bonds.\u201cThere is a little bit of an overhang in Canada\u2019s financial market which started to pop up a couple of years ago during the real-estate bubble,\u201d said Kotsopoulos, whose MFS Canadian Long Term Fixed Income Fund beat its domestic peers, returning 15 per cent over three years to 2017. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz will seek to weaken the currency further in order to support the country\u2019s exports, Kotsopoulos said.Further adding to the country\u2019s debt concerns, Canada\u2019s most populous province, Ontario, plans to return to deficit financing after balancing its books for only the first time in a decade in 2017-18. The plan has already prompted a warning from Fitch Ratings that it could pressure the province\u2019s ratings.Part of the under-performance of Canadian stocks can be explained by the lack of innovative companies in the country\u2019s main S&P/TSX Composite index, which is dominated by the energy sector, commodities companies and banks, the fund managers said.\u201cThe lack of tech and health care has held back Canada,\u201d said Conrad Dabiet, who manages the $3.4 billion Manulife Dividend Income Fund that beat its peers in the three years ending in 2017 with a cumulative 33 per cent return. \u201cWe need to make sure we can compete globally because a lot of these businesses are global in scale and if you miss out, you don\u2019t participate in that profit gain.\u201dWhile Canada has long heralded its corporate tax advantage over the U.S., that\u2019s also disappeared. Including state taxes, the U.S. rate has tumbled to about 26 from about 39 per cent before Trump\u2019s cuts, according to Jack Mintz, an economist at the University of Calgary and one of Canada\u2019s top tax experts. That compares with about 27 per cent in Canada, including provincial levels.To be sure, Canada\u2019s federal budget deficit at less than 1 per cent of gross domestic product is in much better shape than the U.S. where the tax cuts will push it toward 5 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2019, according National Bank of Canada. The loss of key people including Gary Cohn and Rex Tillerson who had acted as stabilizing forces in the White House have injected more volatility into markets of late.But even Trump\u2019s tough line on trade doesn\u2019t unduly worry Blackstein at Dynamic Funds, a unit of Bank of Nova Scotia, who sees it as an opening gambit aimed at leveling the playing field for U.S. companies abroad.\u201cThis is a business-focused president; it\u2019s a business negotiation,\u201d said Blackstein, whose global fund has about 38 per cent of its assets in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of hyperbole, I know there\u2019s a lot of rhetoric, I know there\u2019s some 3 a.m. tweets, but it\u2019s not totally unhinged.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Untapped potential in labour market key to fuelling expansion without inflation: Poloz", "description": "Bank of Canada governor estimates there are currently about half a million Canadians who can be drawn into the labour force under stronger economic conditions", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/untapped-potential-in-labour-market-key-to-fuelling-expansion-without-inflation-poloz", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0313poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 13, 2018 1:23 PM EDT", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the nation\u2019s economy carries plenty of untapped potential that allows policy makers to prolong an expansion without fuelling inflation.Poloz, in a speech Tuesday that focused on labour market slack, said the nation is at the \u201csweet spot\u201d of the business cycle where growing demand is actually generating new capacity as companies invest to meet sales, a process he said the Bank of Canada has an \u201cobligation\u201d to nurture.The increased investment, meanwhile, will help bring more people into the work force \u2014 such as women, youth and the long-term unemployed. Poloz estimated there are currently about half a million Canadians who can be drawn into the labour force under stronger economic conditions, which could in turn increase potential output by as much as 1.5 per cent.\u201cThe bank has concluded there remains a degree of untapped supply potential in the economy,\u201d Poloz said, according to the prepared text of remarks delivered at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario. \u201cThis is important, for it means that Canada may be able to have more economic growth, a larger economy, and therefore more income per person, without generating higher inflation.\u201dHow quickly the economy expands without triggering inflation is one of the key questions the Bank of Canada is asking. The faster they believe it can run before overheating, the longer policy makers can afford to wait on raising interest rates. And Poloz\u2019s comments seem to be leaning toward faster for longer.The Bank of Canada has increased borrowing costs three times since July, but has taken a cautious stance on further rate adjustments. Investors are pricing in at least two more hikes by the end of this year.\u201cIt should be clear that there are likely to be significant economic benefits associated with allowing the economy to find its way to a higher, more productive economic equilibrium, if this can happen within our inflation-targeting regime,\u201d Poloz said.It\u2019s a controversial position. The economy is as close to full capacity as it\u2019s been in a decade and the central bank\u2019s conventional models are likely telling it to raise interest rates more quickly and aggressively. The Canadian dollar, which has been the worst performing major currency in the world this year as investors pared expectations for rate increases, fell another 0.7 per cent to $1.292 per U.S. dollar at 10:33 a.m. in Toronto trading.\u201cThe Governor\u2019s choice of topics is in line with our view that he\u2019s looking for reasons to take rate hikes slowly,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to investors. \u201cWe\u2019ll retain our call for only one more quarter point hike this year.\u201dTargeting growth isn\u2019t technically part of the central bank\u2019s mandate. The Bank of Canada\u2019s primary objective is to target inflation, and Poloz\u2019s strategy is based on the premise that the erosion of productive capacity in recent years can be in part repaired, which would help keep prices in check. The central bank is forecasting inflation will remain near the bank\u2019s 2 per cent target over the next couple of years.\u201cWe expect to see increased investment \u2014 both in existing and brand new companies \u2014 as well as labour market churn create more supply through higher productivity and employment,\u201d Poloz said.Questions around the true level of the economy\u2019s potential growth rate is one of a number of uncertainties the central bank is taking into account as it rejects a \u201cmechanical\u201d approach to policy and remains cautious on interest rates, he said.\u201cWe cannot know in advance how far the capacity-building process can go, but we have an obligation to allow it to occur,\u201d Poloz said.The central banker cited a number sources of untapped labour market slack, including youth participation rates that still seem low based for this stage of the cycle. There is also scope to increase participation rates among women, Poloz said, citing policy successes in Quebec that helped more women enter the labour force. \u201cThe recent federal budget introduced some new measures in this direction,\u201d he said.Poloz did warn there remain downside risks to higher demand if supply doesn\u2019t start rising. \u201cThese uncertain processes entail both upside and downside risks to inflation and our monetary policy remains particularly data-dependent as we balance those risks\u201d Poloz also made a plea not to worry too much about technological advances, adding that historically they lead to higher productivity and living standards \u201cThe Bank can certainly use its monetary policy to help bring about a stronger, better functioning economy while still pursuing our inflation-targeting goal. This is particularly important in the current phase of the economic cycle, with demand prompting investment that can pull more people into the workforce.\u201d Canada is seeing encouraging signs in data on new company formation \u2014 the most potent form of business investment.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Gavin Finch and Francine Lacqua", "title": "Stocks could fall 40% in \u2018deep correction\u2019 over next few years, JPMorgan warns", "description": "If Trump trade war escalates investors could react badly", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/market-moves-2/jpmorgans-pinto-sees-possible-40-equity-markets-correction-2", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/bear.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 9, 2018 3:15 PM EST", "content": "JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive Daniel Pinto warned equity markets could fall as much as 40 per cent in the next two to three years.His comments come as investors worry over the effect of central banks raising interest rates and rising inflation. \u201cIt could be a deep correction,\u201d said Pinto, the bank\u2019s co-president, in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Thursday. \u201cIt could be between 20 per cent to 40 per cent depending on the valuation.\u201dThe benchmark S&P 500 Index has gained about 47 per cent since February 2016.\u201cWe know there will be a correction at some point,\u201d said Pinto, who oversees the trading and investment-banking unit at one of the largest U.S. banks.

And if Greece\u2019s survival as part of the euro was crucial to the European project, Lebanon is key to keeping what\u2019s left of peace in the Middle East.\u201cI don\u2019t think the gravity of the situation is understood by everyone,\u201d deputy Prime Minister Ghassan Hasbani said in his office in Beirut. The time has come for an international aid package that will force Lebanon to reform, \u201cthe same way that Greece was salvaged, but before it\u2019s too late,\u201d he said.There\u2019s nothing new about a nation held together by a delicate sectarian power balance being on the brink. But what is new is that Lebanon has never had to face such a daunting set of challenges at the same time, and all while it can count less on traditional sources of money from abroad, whether the diaspora or erstwhile Saudi benefactors.The country is a political battleground between regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran, which back opposite sides in the seven-year war next door in Syria.That conflict has sent 1.5 million Syrians over the border, the most refugees per capita, blocked land exports and caused fights between Lebanese factions that stymied efforts to ease the strain on the country\u2019s finances. There\u2019s also a U.S.-led effort to curb the power of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.Lebanese bonds have tumbled and bank deposits are growing at their slowest pace since the end of the civil war almost 30 years ago. Government revenue can\u2019t keep up with spending as the economy splutters and politicians squabble before May elections. The budget deficit ballooned to more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product.Last month, the International Monetary Fund sounded the alarm bell. It said the economy is on an unsustainable path and required urgent action.The central bank needs to mitigate a slowdown in bank deposits, whose growth has helped support soaring public debt, the IMF said. It currently amounts to US$79 billion, or 150 per cent of gross domestic product, though the IMF said Lebanon will likely see it reach 180 per cent in five years.That would put it where Greece stands now after the country underwent the world\u2019s biggest debt restructuring in 2012. Japan is the only country with a bigger debt ratio, but it\u2019s not at the mercy of external forces because its currency trades freely unlike dollar-pegged Lebanon or euro-member Greece.Lebanon will seek to raise funds for a US$16 billion infrastructure program at a donor conference scheduled next month in Paris. In the markets, investors are selling, and the rise in bond yields will make servicing costs more burdensome and the level of debt even more unsustainable, Ziad Daoud, an economist at Bloomberg Economics, wrote last week.The yield on Lebanon\u2019s dollar-denominated bonds due 2037 jumped 59 basis points last month, the most since the debt was issued last year. The debt used to be a haven in times of market turbulence because of the backing of local banks, but the gain was almost triple the average increase for emerging-market bonds in February, according a Bloomberg Barclays index.\u201cThe reason why it\u2019s no longer a safe trade is due to liquidity because banks no longer provide liquidity,\u201d said Marwan Doumith, who manages about US$250 million invested in Lebanese Eurobonds at Blominvest Bank Sal in Beirut.Foreign investors hold about US$8 billion, or 30 per cent, of outstanding Eurobonds, he estimated. That\u2019s more than twice the proportion of a few years ago, Doumith said, \u201cwhich is now a risky situation.\u201d As for the donor conference, \u201cwe\u2019re not sure how much the government will be able to bring in,\u201d he said.The precarious financial position reflects the increasingly dire state of the economy and deteriorating governance, with Lebanon slipping down Transparency International\u2019s corruption ranking to 143rd of 180 countries.Parliament only managed to pass a budget in 2017 for the first time in 12 years. There\u2019s been a garbage collection crisis and efforts to open up the electricity and telecommunications industries to bring in vital foreign investment have floundered.More than 70 per cent of expenditure goes on government salaries and debt servicing while up to 10 per cent goes to subsidizing electricity, leaving the government very little room to cut spending.While Hasbani said Lebanon needs international help, there are questions where it might come from.Some Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, have balked at helping Lebanon financially like they did in the past because of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed group that wields so much influence in Lebanon.Relations with the Saudis appear to be thawing. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri received a statesman\u2019s welcome in Riyadh last week. It came after an episode in November when he flew to the Saudi capital and was pressured to announce his resignation only to return to Beirut and be reinstated.The Al Hayat newspaper reported Saudi Arabia will attend the three donor conferences that will be held in Europe this year to raise money for Lebanese infrastructure, the military and help with Syrian refugees.The Saudi-owned publication cited unnamed officials in Beirut.But Hariri\u2019s recent trip was more politically symbolic than about securing financial aid, according to Hani Sabra, founder of New York-based Alef Advisory.\u201cI don\u2019t believe Saudi Arabia is planning to provide Lebanon with a large assistance package,\u201d Sabra said. \u201cThe trend in Lebanon has been the empowerment of forces, like Hezbollah, that are in opposition to Saudi interests. An injection of money from Riyadh won\u2019t really reverse the trend or deliver on advancing Saudi interests in Lebanon or the broader region.\u201dLebanon relies on private-sector bank deposits, mainly from millions of Lebanese living abroad sending money back, to keep the banks stable and defend the dollar peg. As long as the money kept flowing, banks were happy to gobble up government debt.While deposit growth slowed to 3.8 per cent last year because of the Hariri incident in November, central bank Governor Riad Salameh said the financial system has demonstrated its resilience.Lebanon saw outflows of $2 billion after Hariri announced his surprise resignation. Some banks sent offers by text message and cold-called Lebanese living abroad with offers of higher interest rates. One bank is offering as much as 6 per cent on deposits of $1 million or above. The rate rises to 10.50 per cent for high local-currency deposits.The $2 billion has gradually returned, with inflows exceeding outflows since Dec. 10, Salameh said in an interview.\u201cFear was created and despite that we held,\u201d he said. Outflows in November were proportionally lower than during two other big crises \u2014 the 2005 assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and the 2006 Israeli war with Lebanon.Some agree that Lebanon has what it takes to hold up. Its bonds still offer a good yield and foreign reserves remain sizable compared to its external deficit, said Giuliano Palumbo, a senior portfolio manager at Euromobiliare who helps manage 20 billion euros (US$21 billion) of assets including Lebanese government bonds.A stroll through downtown Beirut, where the St. George Orthodox Cathedral sits among the mosques, gives a taste of decline.The streets that buzzed with Gulf tourists through the first couple of years of the Syrian war \u2014 they made up 30 per cent of consumption in Lebanon in the peak June-to-October period \u2014 only see a bit of life on the weekend. Vacant stores line the streets, their fronts collecting dust.Lawmaker Ibrahim Kanaan, head of the finance and budget parliamentary committee, said the government is studying measures to reduce debt servicing and end wasteful spending, such as on music festivals.\u201cThere is an awareness among the main parliamentary blocs that we can no longer continue like that,\u201d Kanaan said. \u201cYes, we\u2019re late, but it\u2019s better late than never.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Josh Wingrove, Theophilos Argitis and Maciej Onoszko", "title": "Canada can't kick stimulus habit as deficit set to balloon to $37 billion", "description": "In just over a week, three important economic policy makers have signalled they'll keep supporting an economy that's already close to running hot", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-cant-kick-its-stimulus-habit-as-trump-fuels-trade-risks?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0308morneau.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 8, 2018 12:52 PM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s in no hurry to end an era of stimulus.In just over a week, three of the nation\u2019s most important economic policy makers have signalled they\u2019ll keep supporting an economy that\u2019s already close to running hot. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz held interest rates steady; Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u2019s budget added new spending; and Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa, having already balanced his budget, is plunging back into the red.The risk is the spending, instead of boosting growth, fuels inflation that could ultimately undermine Canada\u2019s economy \u2014 while leaving governments with debt-heavy balance sheets whenever a recession strikes.\u201cWe are choosing to put our strengthened fiscal position to work,\u201d Sousa said Wednesday in Toronto, announcing he\u2019d deliver a budget on March 28 with a deficit of less than 1 per cent of gross domestic product, which would mean less than $8 billion (US$6.2 billion). This year\u2019s budget is balanced, he said. \u201cI see challenges ahead.\u201dCanadian provincial and federal governments are projected to run a cumulative deficit of $31.9 billion in 2017-18, fiscal tables published by Royal Bank of Canada show. That\u2019s about 1.4 per cent of GDP. Ontario\u2019s new deficit would push the 2018-19 total to as much as US$37.3 billion, or about 1.6 per cent of GDP.The reasons are varied. Governments, for instance, have introduced new program spending aimed at reducing poverty and income inequality. The economy also faces a number of economic headwinds and risks \u2014 Donald Trump among them. Canada\u2019s economy remains vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs while talks continue on a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement. Business investment also may be faltering in an era of uncertainty.Politics is a factor. Ontario\u2019s next election is in June, and Sousa used his speech Wednesday to attack his party\u2019s top rival. Morneau\u2019s budget included repeated elements of political posturing ahead of a federal vote in 2019.The Bank of Canada, which has lifted borrowing costs three times since July, indicated on Wednesday it\u2019s in no rush to pursue further hikes in any aggressive way, citing the growing global trade tensions and softer housing data.While global growth is \u201csolid and broad-based,\u201d recent developments in trade policy have become \u201can important and growing source of uncertainty\u201d for the Canadian economic outlook, the central bank said.Morneau, meanwhile, has regularly called current interest rates \u201caccommodative\u201d and said Wednesday that\u2019s \u201cproviding opportunities for businesses, for individuals, to be able to borrow money at favourable rates.\u201d\u00a0By the central bank\u2019s own measure, interest rates are still extremely stimulative, about 2 percentage points below what it would consider \u201cneutral\u201d even with the economy operating at close to capacity.Morneau defended his fiscal plan that includes deficits that are 0.8 per cent of GDP. Business groups such as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Business Council of Canada have called on him to rein in the deficit.\u201cThe same people who say you need to lower taxes are the same people who say you need to balance the budget,\u201d he said, adding the U.S. deficit on a per-capita basis is five times the size of Canada\u2019s.Given all the trade developments, one could argue \u201crisks are tilted to the downside, and maybe running a little bit looser for longer isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing,\u201d said Jean-Francois Perrault, senior vice-president and chief economist at Scotiabank. \u201cBut we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said, given the economy is still forecast to grow above its potential.On Ontario\u2019s plan, Perrault said it will depend on how the deficits are used and could be seen as a positive if they go toward boosting business competitiveness.Ontario has already funneled a windfall from strong growth and its cap-and-trade program into higher spending, Bank of Montreal Senior Economist Robert Kavcic said in a research note. \u201cWe are late in the cycle \u2014 perhaps very late. Significant fiscal capacity to combat the next downturn is being foregone.\u201dIt\u2019s not all deficits in Canada.\u00a0Quebec has a balanced budget while British Columbia projects a narrow surplus.\u00a0Alberta\u2019s budget gap, the largest among the provinces, is expected to shrink in coming years. Even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s deficits are smaller than what were projected only a year ago as the economy performed better than expected. The overall trend in Canada was supposed to be one of narrowing deficits, until Ontario chose to take up that fiscal space.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg and Luke Kawa", "title": "Three real-life signs that interest rate hikes are already starting to bite", "description": "The three interest rate increases since July are starting to have an impact on Canadian consumers", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/debt/these-charts-show-higher-canadian-rates-are-starting-to-bite", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/wallet.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 8, 2018 12:40 PM EST", "content": "As the Bank of Canada\u2019s recent interest rate hikes work their way through the economy, policy makers may have cause for concern.In its decision Wednesday to hold the benchmark rate steady at 1.25 per cent, the central bank reiterated its cautious stance and said policy makers will \u201ccontinue to monitor the economy\u2019s sensitivity to higher interest rates.\u201dThe following charts show the three rate increases since July are already starting to have an impact on Canadian consumers. \u201cThe Bank of Canada\u2019s tightening is starting to bite,\u201d George Pearkes, a macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group, said in an interview.Wednesday\u2019s statement pointed directly to decelerating growth in household credit, which has slowed for the past three months running.

The central bank said Wednesday it will take time to fully assess the impact of the changes, which also include provincial regulations on foreign buyers.Mortgage interest payments rose 3.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, the fastest pace since 2007, according to Statistics Canada data. That compares with 1.3 per cent growth in disposable income over the same period. \u201cWe don\u2019t think this is the end of the world but clearly it ate into fourth-quarter consumption, and is likely a headwind for now that may cause the BoC to pause,\u201d said Pearkes.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "The Bank of Canada just got one more reason to hold rates tomorrow", "description": "Trump\u2019s trade tweet storm has added a big dose of uncertainty that markets are now betting will keep rates on hold until July", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-trade-threats-will-likely-amplify-polozs-caution-on-rates", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 6, 2018 1:33 PM EST", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz\u2019s preoccupation with uncertainty probably means a longer pause on interest rates, in a world of fraying trade alliances and volatile markets.The central banker is expected to leave his benchmark borrowing cost unchanged at 1.25 per cent at a rate decision Wednesday at 10 a.m, according to all 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, with forward contracts pricing in just a 13 per cent chance of a hike.There are some rather compelling reasons to pause the hike cycleInvestors have been paring back the odds of rate hikes in recent weeks on the back of a run of soft economic data, global market turmoil and growing geopolitical concerns that are expected to heighten Poloz\u2019s already-elevated levels of caution with tightening monetary policy further.\u201cThis one is likely to be a maintenance statement with a more cautious spin that buys time to assess developments,\u201d Derek Holt, an economist with Bank of Nova Scotia, said in a report. \u201cThere are some rather compelling reasons to pause the hike cycle.\u201dThese include, according to Holt, uncertainty around trade policy that has worsened with President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, weaker growth numbers, and sluggish investment plans by businesses.Poloz\u2019s next interest rate increase \u2014 which would be the fourth in the rate-hike cycle \u2014 isn\u2019t being fully priced in until July, swaps trading suggests. A month ago, investors were pricing in at least one increase by May, with a good chance of an April hike.Investors are expecting the Federal Reserve to outpace the Bank of Canada on rate hikes over the next 12 months, with at least three hikes in the U.S. over that time versus two for Canada. The rate divergence has been a drag on the Canadian dollar, which has lost 4 per cent since Poloz\u2019s last rate hike on Jan. 17.Growing geopolitical concerns could be particularly meaningful to a central banker like Poloz, who has put uncertainty at the forefront of his economic analysis.That focus was on display last week when Poloz traveled to London to receive an award from Central Banking, a trade publication. In his acceptance speech, he chose to highlight the Bank of Canada\u2019s efforts to be \u201copen and honest\u201d about uncertainty in its policy making.Poloz\u2019s narrative boils down to something like this:There is more uncertainty in the world today. This heightened uncertainty is the sort you can\u2019t measure or estimate. Geopolitics is an important factor, but so is growing uncertainty about the reliability of models to prescribe policy. Because of this, policy makers are injecting more \u201crealism\u201d and judgment into the narrative and nudging the decision-making process toward something that looks less like a mechanical exercise akin to engineering and more like risk management. More art, less science, in Poloz\u2019s words.This is important since the Bank of Canada\u2019s \u201cmechanical\u201d models are probably telling it to raise interest rates faster than it has, as the country runs up against capacity.Gradualism is simply the inevitable outcome of a world view that puts a greater emphasis on uncertainty.\u201cWe have been working on the theme of uncertainty since the global financial crisis revealed the limits of our models and our knowledge,\u201d Poloz said in his speech. \u201cAnd we have learned that it is far better to be open and honest about the uncertainty we face, as well as how we deal with it, rather than to just assume the uncertainty away and project a false sense of confidence.\u201dNot everyone is fully bought into Poloz\u2019s focus on risk management. One critique is that the Bank of Canada\u2019s emphasis on uncertainty generates blurry economic analysis, gives officials too much discretion in setting policy and makes it difficult for market players to pin down intentions and form expectations. In other words, it could end up fueling \u201cpolicy uncertainty\u201d and result in unnecessary volatility.Poloz himself has acknowledged the economic literature that deals with uncertainty is undeveloped. But that hasn\u2019t necessarily made the governor any more difficult to read.For example, a cursory analysis of forward contracts suggests investors did a better job predicting Poloz\u2019s policy changes six months forward than had been the case with former Governor Mark Carney\u2019s three hikes in 2010 and a series of rate increases by former Governor David Dodge between 2005 and 2007.A gradual approach to policy, as a matter of course, means the scope of misreading him is smaller. Slow and steady is always a good bet when it comes to Poloz.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Foreign buyers using Canadian homes as piggy banks: RBC CEO", "description": "Foreign inflows are distorting Canada's already constrained housing market and aren't the kind of investment the country needs, RBC chief David McKay said", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/foreign-buyers-are-using-canadian-homes-as-piggy-banks-rbc-ceo-warns", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0306mckay.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 6, 2018 12:58 PM EST", "content": "Foreign inflows are distorting\u00a0Canada\u2019s already constrained housing market and aren\u2019t the kind of investment the country needs, the chief executive officer of Royal Bank of Canada said.\u201cWe do not need foreign capital using Canadian real estate as a piggy bank,\u201d David McKay, said Tuesday at a bank conference in New York hosted by the Toronto-based lender. \u201cIf capital is coming in to sit in a home, unproductively, and is distorting your marketplace and the livelihood of your residents \u2014 no thank you.\u201dMcKay, whose bank is Canada\u2019s largest mortgage lender, says he\u2019s supportive of government taxes and other measures targeting foreign buyers, as well as other regulatory efforts to cool the country\u2019s housing market.

Even then, he predicts one rate hike at most before the year is out. That would be a change of pace for a central bank that\u2019s tightened monetary policy at three of its past five meetings, spurred on by strong growth and a surge in employment.\u201cThe market is being too aggressive for what we\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d Basdeo said. \u201cThat market reaction is tied more toward what\u2019s likely to happen in the U.S. \u2014 that is, the fiscal impulse generates strong growth there and we benefit from that.\u201dA less hawkish BoC wouldn\u2019t bode well for a Canadian dollar that\u2019s already the worst performing Group-of-10 currency this year.

While that\u2019s more aggressive than what\u2019s being priced for the BOC, traders remain hesitant to bet on too much policy divergence.Participants in the market for Canadian bankers\u2019 acceptance contracts expect officials to tighten policy by another 56 basis point by year-end, from 1.25 per cent. The odds of a hike at the BoC\u2019s April 18 meeting stand at about 38 per cent, according to overnight index swap pricing. That\u2019s down from about 70 per cent after a string of recent economic data misses and the release of a federal budget that kept the fiscal deficit steady.Pacific Investment Management Co.\u2019s Ed Devlin said he also expects the Bank of Canada to take a cautious approach to policy tightening. While it\u2019s possible officials hike twice more by year-end, the prevailing risk is for the BoC to be less aggressive than expected, not more, he said.Without the support of a hawkish BoC, the loonie will struggle to gain traction, he added.Ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations, which are scheduled to conclude their seventh round Monday in Mexico City, remain a likely source of volatility for the loonie over the medium-term. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of duties on steel and aluminum March 1 helped fuel the loonie\u2019s worst week in a year, and come on the heels of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s suggestion that Ottawa is willing to walk away from NAFTA.And while Canada\u2019s economy is coming off a stellar 2017, the country shed a net 88,000 jobs in January, its largest monthly decrease since 2009, while retail sales figures released last month showed receipts fell 0.8 per cent month-over-month in December. Friday\u2019s gross domestic product figures did little to ease concerns of a slowdown, with data showing the economy growing at an annualized pace of just 1.7 per cent in the fourth quarter amid signs indebted households have begun paring spending.\u201cWe\u2019ve come off all this strength in the data,\u201d Brittany Baumann, a macro strategist at Toronto Dominion Bank, said before the GDP figures were released. \u201cWe\u2019re now getting in this more moderation stage.\u201d Baumann expects the BOC to remain on hold for at least the next two policy meetings.The loonie\u2019s 2.6 per cent drop year-to-date is starting to leave its mark on the options market. Realized daily volatility has risen to the highest since September,\u00a0and is nearly a full per cent above its implied counterpart as traders become increasingly concerned about the currency\u2019s direction.In a sign that they\u2019re starting to price in BoC policy risk, currency puts traded this week expiring around the March 7 meeting outnumbered currency calls by about 50 per cent, according to Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation volumes. The one month 25-delta risk reversal, a barometer of sentiment and directional risk, is at its highest level since May as strikes above $1.30 begin to accumulate. A move above this level would likely see volatility rise further.\u201cIf the data is flagging a slowdown, then we should see a different tone from the Bank of Canada,\u201d BlackRock\u2019s Basdeo said. \u201cThat\u2019ll cause the repricing of fixed income assets.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Josh Wingrove", "title": "Don\u2019t expect much from today\u2019s budget: Rising interest rates, debt leave little wiggle room", "description": "Trudeau, pinched for new cash and facing calls to tackle Canada's deteriorating competitiveness, is turning his focus to lower-cost political priorities", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/dont-expect-much-from-todays-budget-rising-interest-rates-mounting-debt-leave-little-wiggle-room-for-major-new-spending", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/0227flag.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 27, 2018 12:29 PM EST", "content": "Justin Trudeau, pinched for new cash and facing calls from businesses to tackle Canada\u2019s deteriorating competitiveness, is turning his focus to lower-cost political priorities such as gender equality and science in his government\u2019s third budget.Trudeau\u2019s finance chief Bill Morneau releases a finance plan Tuesday around 4 p.m. in Ottawa that is expected to hold off from major new funding initiatives and deal largely with gender policy, such as boosting women\u2019s workforce participation rates. Morneau has signed he\u2019ll keep to a plan of slow deficit reduction while lowering the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product.The plan comes amid calls\u00a0to cut corporate taxes as businesses worry about the risks posed by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s policies, at a time when the country\u2019s growth is slowing, pinched by the uncertainty associated with ongoing NAFTA talks and a wider discount for Alberta oil. Canada is losing a competitive edge, partly due to U.S. tax reform and the threat Trump could withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement,\u00a0business groups warn. Morneau is under pressure to act, but all signs are that he\u2019ll wait.\u201cFrom a macroeconomic perspective, I don\u2019t expect a whole lot,\u201d said Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto and a former top finance department official. He called on Morneau to keep his \u201cpowder dry\u201d to preserve leeway to respond to crises down the road, and to use this budget to signal \u201che\u2019s watching the situation carefully and is ready to respond if he needs to.\u201dThe most recent federal figures, released last fall, projected $86.5 billion (US$68 billion) in deficits over five years, beginning with the fiscal year that ends March 31, through 2021-22. Morneau projected the debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to 29.1 per cent from 30.5 per cent over that period.However, there are signs Morneau has less wiggle room than before. While his deficit is modest by international standards, it\u2019s seen as a political liability at home. His government has already hiked its forecast program expenses for the next three fiscal years.Next year\u2019s budget is more politically significant, with an election due that fall. Trudeau will also create a commission to study options for the creation of a national plan to cover pharmaceutical costs, according to reports by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., a potentially big-ticket item that would further strain federal spending.Meanwhile, rising interest rates and mounting debt have ended a run of windfalls from declining debt service costs, that Morneau and his predecessors have used to cut taxes and boost spending.Morneau is delivering his budget with the latest round of NAFTA talks underway in Mexico City. There have been widespread calls from the private sector for Canada to move to increase business competitiveness.\u201cI would like to see the competitiveness of Canada remain at the forefront,\u201d Royal Bank of Canada Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cI don\u2019t think tax reform is going to be in there,\u201d he said, adding the federal government should focus on creating a strong economy.The Business Council of Canada, representing chief executives of many of the country\u2019s biggest firms, warned \u201cCanada must respond now\u201d by, for example, cutting business taxes, allowing business investments to be more easily written off or punting planned changes to taxation of investments held in private corporations.The Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters industry group also called for a tax cut and a business investment tax credit. \u201cSimilar to the U.S., we believe that Canada and its provinces should be looking at a range of tax reforms to boost investment and growth,\u201d Dennis Darby, CME president and chief executive officer, said in a letter on behalf of several manufacturing groups.Tom Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Financial Ltd. and CEO of Urbana Corp., said he\u2019d rather see Morneau balance the budget than cut taxes to compete with the U.S. \u201cLess is more,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as governments go my expectations are always fairly low and I\u2019m rarely disappointed.\u201d Morneau said this month he\u2019d \u201ccarefully consider\u201d U.S. tax changes, while saying he thinks Canada\u2019s tax system is already competitive.The budget will be a key mile-marker for one of the Trudeau government\u2019s hallmark pledges to hike infrastructure spending in a bid to stoke growth, something Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said the economy can look forward to.In late 2016, Morneau announced $81 billion in new infrastructure funding, bringing the federal government total to $186.7 billion over 12 years, roughly doubling its spending rate on projects such as roads and transit. There are some signs the government is struggling to get all the money out the door, forcing it to be potentially bumped \u2014 or \u201creprofiled,\u201d in government slang \u2014 into different years.\u201cOttawa clearly has a kind of structural surplus of infrastructure dollars that will continue to go perpetually unspent,\u201d said Sean Speer, a senior fellow for fiscal policy at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and former economic adviser to Trudeau\u2019s predecessor, Stephen Harper. \u201cI honestly do think they\u2019re in a world of perpetual reprofile.\u201dA Morneau spokeswoman declined to comment on infrastructure spending. Brook Simpson, a spokesman for Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi, said federal money \u201cis a lagging indicator to project activity,\u201d as money is often only released after a project is done.\u00a0Any money that doesn\u2019t flow is reprofiled to another year and still available, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Dethroned as Canada's biggest REIT, RioCan races to get smaller in shift from retail to apartments", "description": "RioCan founder Ed Sonshine is trying to Amazon-proof his shopping-mall empire by turning them into hip urban oases", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/dethroned-as-canadas-biggest-reit-riocan-races-to-get-smaller", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/0226sonshine.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 26, 2018 10:28 AM EST", "content": "Never mind being No. 1.\u00a0Ed Sonshine is too busy trying to Amazon-proof his Canadian shopping-mall empire by turning them into hip urban oases.The chief executive officer of RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust has inked deals to sell 19 assets in the past four months, part of his drive to unload about $2 billion (US$1.6 billion) worth of properties. At the same time, he\u2019s tearing up some of his malls to develop apartments, trying to capitalize on the rental boom and insulate RioCan from the rise of e-commerce. By 2020 he wants more than 90 per cent of rental revenue to come from Canada\u2019s six major urban markets, up from about 75 per cent now.\u201cI learned a long time ago that having the title of Canada\u2019s biggest REIT is not something that is one of my prizes so I don\u2019t see this as a threat at all,\u201d\u00a0Sonshine, RioCan\u2019s founder, said\u00a0in an interview at the company\u2019s Toronto headquarters. \u201cI\u2019m busy trying to get smaller.\u201dEarlier this month, Choice Properties REIT, the real estate arm of Loblaw Cos., agreed to buy Canadian REIT for about US$3.1 billion \u2014 a deal that will\u00a0give it more access to industrial and office space and topple RioCan from its long-held title as Canada\u2019s biggest REIT by market value. Retail REITs have lagged Canada\u2019s S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index over the past two years amid a decline in mall traffic and companies are pushing into other sectors including apartments and offices.RioCan is moving quickly. It\u2019s already closed deals or is under firm agreements for about $512 million worth of properties with $200 million more under conditional contract, While most of the deals have been off-market, the company is planning to market up to $500 million worth of properties in the next two months, said Sonshine. RioCan is planning to sell about 100 of its 289 properties altogether.\u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable that we\u2019re going to hit our numbers,\u201d Sonshine, 71, said.A major migration to metropolitan areas is underway globally, Sonshine said. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we\u2019ve got to start focusing our assets because that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to get rent growth, more demand for space and that will be where you get population growth.\u201dPart of the revenue used from RioCan\u2019s sales will go toward the development of as many as 10,000 residential units in Canada\u2019s major markets, called \u201cRioCan Living.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s less demand for retail space but there\u2019s a lot of demand for great residential apartments,\u201d Sonshine said. \u201cSo I said, well, let\u2019s just rip down all, or part of, our shopping centres and replace it with medium-rise or, depending on location, even high-rise apartments and then just put new retail on the ground floors of those buildings because there still is retail demand, it\u2019s just very different.\u201dSonshine points to a 36-story building across from his office window in midtown Toronto as the best example of his vision: a new rental building located near the subway, a large shopping mall, offices and restaurants. RioCan has five buildings under construction in Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto so far, and is aiming to have at least three more by the end of 2018.New RioCan rentals will include \u2018tech packages\u2019 with automated concierges, lockers and cold-storage to appeal to the new trend of online grocery shopping, while common areas could include study or co-working spaces as previous amenities such as gyms, party rooms and swimming pools fall out of favour.Rising interest rates may soon counter profits from building rental housing, developers said. REITs, seen as income-producing investments, have come under pressure in general as the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates three times over the past past 12 months. RioCan units have lost 12 per cent over that time.\u201cThe window as far as viability in terms of the business side of rental development is closing,\u201d Jason Turcotte, vice president of development at Cressey Development Group, said in a phone interview, adding that at least half of the Vancouver-based company\u2019s portfolio is rental. \u201cRental development is super, super sensitive to interest rates.\u201dSonshine agreed rising rates could be a major barrier to creating affordable rental housing in markets like Toronto or Vancouver.\u201cI\u2019m a prisoner of the municipalities and it can take a year to get a building permit and that\u2019s after you spend two years getting zoning \u2014 it\u2019s a lengthy regulatory process, it\u2019s not an easy game,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big advantage to us is owning the land already and having some income coming in from it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Canadians can't stop using their homes as piggy banks with line of credit debt jumping to record $230 billion", "description": "Canadians are borrowing against their houses at the fastest pace in more than five years, raising red flags with policy makers", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadians-cant-stop-using-their-homes-as-piggy-banks?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/house-loan.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 16, 2018 11:46 AM EST", "content": "Canadians are borrowing against their houses at the fastest pace in more than five years, as home equity lines of credit emerge as a preferred means of accessing funds.Heloc balances jumped 7.2 per cent in December from a year earlier, the fastest annual growth since 2012, reaching a record $230 billion, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions reported Thursday. All other types of consumer debt such as personal loans, credit card balances, car loans and overdrafts climbed just 3.2 per cent over the same period, less than half the pace of heloc growth.Borrowers can tap helocs for up to 65 per cent of the value of their homes, and the funds are most commonly used for making renovations, investing and consolidating debt, according to a June 2017 report by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. \u201cHouses are becoming piggy banks,\u201d said Paul Gulberg, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.

About 40 per cent of heloc borrowers don\u2019t regularly pay down the principal.Of total loans secured to individuals for non-business purposes, those secured by residential property represent about 46 per cent, the OSFI data show.Compared to other loan types, such as auto loans and credit cards, rates on helocs are typically cheaper, making them more attractive to consumers.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau touts trade as a central tenet of prosperity, and his Liberal Party lawmakers are vocal champions of keeping the North American Free Trade Agreement, currently heading into the seventh round of negotiations, in place.But excluding oil, Canada\u2019s trade performance has been dismal. Its non-energy trade deficit widened to a record in December, $8.64 billion (US$6.9 billion), and also for the full year, $87 billion.Overall, including oil, growth in export volumes failed to keep up with imports, meaning the trade sector was actually a drag on the stellar 2017 performance, which was wholly reliant on domestic demand. That may give the Bank of Canada pause about raising interest rates further as it gauges the overall health of the economy.Weak non-energy trade also means Canada is increasingly depending on oil to keep its trade balance from deteriorating further, despite Trudeau\u2019s efforts to pivot away from commodities. Energy exports accounted for 17 per cent of the total in 2017, up from 14 per cent a year earlier.In volume terms, which strips out price changes, energy now accounts for more than one quarter of all exports \u2014 the most in records back to 1997.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Samuel Potter and Sarah Ponczek", "title": "Phew, the global stock selloff that saw the Dow shed the most points in a day since the financial crisis is slowing", "description": "But oil, the loonie and Bitcoin are still falling", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stock-selloff-slows-dollar-steady-copper-gains-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/trader2.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 5, 2018 11:04 AM EST", "content": "U.S. stocks regained some ground after an early plunge, while European and Asian equities slumped.

Less than one-fifth of stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 Index \u2014 the lowest number in two decades.\u201cThe easy answer is to look at the composition and say, well, the TSX doesn\u2019t have what\u2019s working and therefore we\u2019re going to underperform,\u201d said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cBut when you go below the surface, there\u2019s something more going on than just composition.\u201dComposition is certainly playing a part. The S&P/TSX\u00a0is heavily weighted toward financials, energy and materials, which together make up more than two-thirds of the benchmark. Energy in particular has been a chronic underperformer, as the gap between Canadian and U.S. crude prices is the widest since 2013.At the same time, the S&P/TSX is light on technology and health-care stocks, which have been huge drivers of the U.S. rally. Together, those sectors make up just 4.5 per cent of the Canadian market compared with 38 per cent of the S&P 500.\u201cThe composition component is one that\u2019s chronic for the domestic market, but is really showing its stripes in this environment,\u201d said Craig Fehr, Canadian investment strategist at Edward Jones & Co.The obvious culprit is U.S. tax reform, which has led to upward earnings revisions across most sectors and a broad repricing of shares south of the border, while having little to no impact in Canada.But the divergence goes beyond that. While the U.S. was cutting tax rates, three of Canada\u2019s biggest provinces hiked their minimum wage. While the U.S. dollar fell 3.4 per cent against major world currencies in January, making exports more competitive, the loonie rose to its highest level since September. And while Canada\u2019s economy was the hottest of the Group of Seven last year, it\u2019s expected to decelerate this year as U.S. growth picks up.\u00a0Add to this worries about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, high Canadian consumer debt levels and tighter mortgage-lending rules and it\u2019s not surprising that Canadian stocks can\u2019t keep up.Strategists expect Canada to close the performance gap eventually, but it won\u2019t be because stocks suddenly start to soar.\u201cRealistically you\u2019ll probably see equity markets in the U.S. settle down rather than Canada all of a sudden starting to run at a 20 per cent year-over-year pace and catching up,\u201d Kavcic said.That may have started on Friday when U.S. stocks plunged 2.1 per cent amid worries about rising interest rates, and Canadian stocks fell 1.6 per cent.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Torres and Christopher Condon", "title": "Fed holds rate as Yellen exits, but signals with one word that March hike coming", "description": "The magic word is 'further'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-leaves-rate-unchanged-as-yellen-departs-sets-up-march-hike", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/fed1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 31, 2018 2:26 PM EST", "content": "Federal Reserve officials, meeting for the last time under Chair Janet Yellen, left borrowing costs unchanged while adding emphasis to their plan for more hikes, setting the stage for an increase in March under her successor Jerome Powell.\u201cThe committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate,\u201d the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement Wednesday in Washington, adding the word \u201cfurther\u201d twice to previous language.The changes to the statement, collectively acknowledging stronger growth and more confidence that inflation will rise to the 2 per cent target, may spur speculation that the Fed will pick up the pace of interest-rate increases. Officials also said inflation \u201cis expected to move up this year and to stabilize\u201d around the goal, in phrasing that marked an upgrade from December.At the same time, the Fed repeated language saying that \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.\u201dWith her term ending later this week after President Donald Trump chose to replace her, Yellen is handing the reins to Powell, who has backed her gradual approach and is widely expected to raise interest rates at the FOMC\u2019s next meeting for the sixth time since late 2015. Fed officials are hoping to keep a tight labor market from overheating without raising borrowing costs so fast that it would stifle the economy.\u201cGains in employment, household spending and business fixed investment have been solid, and the unemployment rate has stayed low,\u201d the Fed said, removing previous references to disruptions from hurricanes. \u201cMarket-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low.\u201dWith a gradual pace of rate increases, policy makers want to nudge inflation back up to their 2 per cent target, a goal they have mostly missed for more than five years. Even with a brightening outlook for global growth and Fed tightening, financial conditions continue to ease.The vote by U.S. central bankers to keep the benchmark overnight lending rate in a 1.25 per cent to 1.5 per cent target range was unanimous. Fed officials also voted to continue with their program to reduce the central bank\u2019s balance sheet, which began in October.The FOMC said in a separate statement Wednesday that it elected Powell as its chairman, effective Feb. 3. He will be sworn in as chairman of the Board of Governors on Feb. 5.\u201cOn a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 per cent,\u201d the FOMC said, removing a previous reference to declines in inflation in 2017.Inflation has picked up slightly since the middle of 2017 while remaining short of the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent goal. The Fed\u2019s preferred price gauge, a Commerce Department index linked to consumer spending, rose 1.7 per cent in the 12 months through December. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, inflation was 1.5 per cent.Yellen isn\u2019t scheduled to hold a press conference after this meeting; her final such event was in December. Fed policy makers will update their economic projections in March, when Powell is also expected to hold his first press briefing as chairman.An annual rotation among the 12 regional Fed presidents who vote on the FOMC saw Loretta Mester of Cleveland, Thomas Barkin of Richmond, Raphael Bostic of Atlanta, and John Williams of San Francisco join as members at this meeting. Barkin and Bostic are voting for the first time since taking their posts.The committee also reviewed its long-run policy goals statement at the January meeting and reiterated its support for the 2 per cent inflation target, approving a statement that updated the long-run normal rate of unemployment to 4.6 per cent \u2014 the median in projections from December.Several Fed officials have called for a rethink of the central bank\u2019s policy framework, which could include aiming for a higher inflation target, or allowing prices to rise faster to make up for the time that they were too low.During Yellen\u2019s four years at the helm, U.S. unemployment has fallen to 4.1 per cent, the lowest since 2000, as she navigated the Fed away from its crisis-era emergency policies and inched interest rates away from zero. Yellen exploited low inflation to maintain low interest rates that helped pull millions of more Americans back into jobs, and the Fed under her leadership began to pay more attention to labor-market inequality.\u201cShe is going out on a high note,\u201d Diane Swonk, chief economist for Grant Thornton LLP in Chicago, said before Wednesday\u2019s decision.Powell takes over an economy that expanded at an annualized 2.6 per cent pace in the final three months of the year, helped by stronger business investment and consumer spending. Tax cuts signed into law by Trump in December are also likely to lift growth in 2018, though the Fed and most analysts see little long-term boost, if any, to the economy.The Fed statement didn\u2019t contain any reference to the tax legislation.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Only thing colder than Toronto right now is its housing market", "description": "Mid-winter is never a good time to sell a house in Toronto \u2014 this winter it\u2019s terrible", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/once-hot-toronto-housing-hits-deep-freeze-as-lending-rules-bite", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/house.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 30, 2018 5:19 PM EST", "content": "The only thing that might be colder than Toronto in January is the city\u2019s housing market.While the bleak mid-winter is never the best time to sell a home in Canada, a string of open houses in the country\u2019s largest city were chillingly empty on a recent Saturday afternoon. Tougher mortgage rules went into effect on Jan. 1 just as higher interest rates began to bite, and the market\u2019s on edge, waiting to see if a downturn that began last year will accelerate under the added pressure.\u201cLots of people are sitting on the sidelines waiting or hoping that prices would fall,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto-based Realosophy Realty Inc., said in a phone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to see a rapid increase in prices or a big turnaround this year.\u201dToronto\u2019s housing market has cooled for seven months, with prices falling and listings surging. The market has begun to buckle under a raft of measures to curb prices that were soaring at a 20 per cent clip a year ago and saddling Canadians with debt, part of a global real-estate boom that\u2019s swept cities from Hong Kong to New York.The latest move requires that even people with a 20 per cent down payment, who don\u2019t need mortgage insurance, prove that they can make payments at much higher rates. The so-called stress tests, which already exist for insured mortgages, will be calculated at a rate of at least 2 percentage points above the contracted rate.And those rates are going up. The country\u2019s central bank increased its overnight target rate three times in the past year, to 1.25 per cent. The country\u2019s big banks have followed suit, nudging mortgage rates to a four-year high.Reality is sinking in as buyers update their pre-approved mortgages at the higher rates, Dawna Borg, a sales representative at Remax Premier Inc., said in an email.\u201cThey seem to feel defeated,\u201d she said. \u201cThey feel they will fail the stress tests and they will be forced out of the market.\u201dAnalysts at Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. say the new stress tests and mortgage-rate hikes in Canada\u2019s environment of \u201chyper-leveraging\u201d will have a more severe impact than policymakers expect. The rules alone will reduce purchasing power by as much as 17 per cent, the bank said in a report. Add in the mortgage-rate increase and that number jumps to about 23 per cent.The Magnelli family is feeling the effects. Mom Loredana Magnelli has saved for a few years to help her two kids, age 30 and 26, put together down payments to purchase apartments in Toronto. Their price point of about $300,000 each seemed like a viable opportunity two years ago. Now, that seems impossible.\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at a $400,000 to $450,000 mortgage and your interest rate is going to be higher, that\u2019s huge money,\u201d Magnelli said. She considered adding another mortgage to her own house to help get her kids their dream homes, but ultimately decided against it. They\u2019ve put a stop to their search for now in hopes that home prices will fall to more affordable levels.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cMy son is 30. He\u2019d like to have a place of his own.\u201dAmid the crunch in single-family homes, Tim Syrianos, president of the Toronto Real Estate Board, has seen a \u201ctremendous spike\u201d in interest for more affordable housing types like condominiums, townhouses and semi-detached homes. While the city\u2019s detached-home segment tumbled in the second half of 2017, condominium prices rose at a double-digit pace.Activity is also seeping out into surrounding suburbs that are near public transit and far more affordable than the city core, real-estate agents say.And just when you think the Canadian housing market is down for the count it tends to find a second wind. Vancouver\u2019s housing market plunged for five months after policymakers introduced a foreign-buyers tax in 2016 but has been recovering steadily since last year. Toronto\u2019s economy meanwhile is booming with the unemployment rate falling to 4.3 per cent in December from 5.5 per cent a year ago even as the city remains a magnet for immigrants.Syrianos\u2019s big worry isn\u2019t a cooling market but the lack of supply. \u201cIf supply continues to be as tight as it is, we will see double-digit increase in values.\u201dTwo of his clients for example were looking to buy a new house after having a baby but no longer qualify for a bigger mortgage under the new stress tests. They\u2019re renovating instead.\u201cYou\u2019re creating a heated renovation segment of the market and you\u2019re stifling supply,\u201d Syrianos says. \u201cIt just leads to more values going up faster than they should and making it harder for the average Canadian to buy a home.\u201dUltimately, policymakers and brokers alike want steady, incremental home price gains. Double-digit price growth was volatile and dangerous, said Simeon Papailias, co-founder of the Real Estate Center, real-estate management company. The new stress test will help make sure \u201cthat we don\u2019t have unqualified people creating bidding wars,\u201d he said in a phone interview.The Toronto Real Estate Board will release an outlook for the market on Tuesday with January numbers due in the next several days. But the real test will likely come as the spring selling season gets underway.\u201cSellers are looking for the money they were getting in May, and that\u2019s not a reality, it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Papailias, at the Real Estate Center, said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jill Ward and Stephanie Flanders", "title": "Easy money will be around for \u2018some time yet,\u2019 says Bank of Canada chief Stephen Poloz", "description": "Central banks aren't going to aggressively tighten policy because there are still vulnerabilities in many economies", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-poloz-says-its-not-really-the-end-of-easy-money", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/stephen-poloz6.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 26, 2018 1:18 PM EST", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said central banks aren\u2019t going to aggressively tighten policy because there are still underlying vulnerabilities in many economies.Calling this the \u201c\u2018end of easy money\u2019 is a little too simple,\u201d he said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that money is going to remain easy for some time yet\u201d because \u201ceconomies are still working their way through a lot of underlying stresses.\u201dCentral banks are slowly moving away from the emergency stimulus put in place after the financial crisis, and leaders gathered for the World Economic Forum have combined optimism with caution in their assessment of the outlook. The IMF sees global growth accelerating to the fastest pace in seven years, but exuberance in markets, surging debt in China and elsewhere, and political flash points \u2014 from Brexit to North Korea \u2014 are all risks.In Canada, officials have raised interest rates three times since mid-2017, including a hike just last week, which took the benchmark to 1.25 per cent. Poloz has been trying to gradually bring rates back to more normal levels amid strong growth and a surge in employment, without triggering an unwanted slowdown. He said there\u2019s still \u201cconsiderable\u201d slack in the labour market.In the euro area, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Thursday that while the economy is improving, policy will remain accommodative for some time to come. Policy makers are considering when they need to end their bond-buying program and how to start signalling that a change is coming.Poloz said companies are in an expansion phase and policy makers don\u2019t want higher borrowing costs to crimp confidence or hiring plans. He added that concerns about the future of the Nafta trade agreement are weighing on investment decisions.\u201cWhat happens in this late stage in the cycle is that investment becomes the principle driver of growth, and that builds more capacity, pulling that capacity out of the labour market and raising potential output,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching those ingredients as they unfold, and we can see that it\u2019s underway.\u201dAsked about central banks\u2019 room for manoeuvre, Poloz pointed out that the neutral rate of interest is probably lower now than in the past due to the debt overhang.\u201cThe economy finds a new place where interest rates have much more effect than in the past,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things we have to learn by probing, by moving our way along and assessing how things are evolving.\u201dOne thing he wouldn\u2019t comment on, however, was the conflicting signals coming out of the U.S. on currencies. U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the dollar would get stronger, and that remarks welcoming its weakness made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d\u201cI prefer not to talk about currencies at all except perhaps to interpret their moves,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cExchange rates are what they are.

On Tuesday, he said he\u2019s weighing a possible breakup of GE after the company disclosed its latest disappointment: a $6.2 billion charge related to an old portfolio of long-term care insurance.Flannery pledged on a call with Wall Street analysts to consider changes such as separating GE\u2019s primary businesses of aviation, power generation and health care into publicly traded companies. That\u2019s a different tone than he had struck just two months ago, when he had emphasized to jittery investors that he\u2019d focus GE on those three areas instead of splitting it apart.\u201cWe are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,\u201d Flannery said on a conference call with analysts. A review \u201ccould result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets really in any one of our units, if that\u2019s what made sense.\u201dThe CEO suggested his openness to a breakup after disclosing a larger-than-expected $6.2 billion charge related to an old portfolio of long-term care insurance. That renewed concerns about the unexpected issues that can crop up in such a sprawling enterprise \u2014 and raised questions about whether GE can cut it in today\u2019s business environment.\u00a0\u201cThe viability of the conglomerate model is rapidly diminishing in relevance,\u201d said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co. While GE may hang onto several of its biggest businesses, it\u2019s becoming clear that \u201cyou have to simplify and narrow your focus.\u201dThe shares fell 3.4 per cent to US$18.13 at 3:41 p.m. in New York after dropping as much as 4.3 per cent for the biggest intraday decline in two months. GE had staged a modest rebound this year through Jan. 12, with a 7.5 per cent advance.Since taking over for\u00a0Jeffrey Immelt, Flannery has cut costs and overhauled management as part of a broader turnaround. His efforts failed to halt a slide in GE\u2019s shares, which posted last year\u2019s biggest drop on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.In November, he said the company would sell US$20 billion in other assets, taking the spotlight off the possibility of a more ambitious restructuring. Flannery said Tuesday he would update investors in the spring. The company reports fourth-quarter earnings Jan. 24.\u201cInvestors are looking at a wholesale breakup as the logical conclusion of this extended GE saga,\u201d Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Tuesday in a note. Whether GE follows through will depend on how successfully it can fix its power division, he said.The company may also favor smaller moves, including an initial public offering in its jet-leasing business, Jeff Sprague, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said in a report.Flannery\u2019s comments stole attention from the disclosure that GE will take a US$9.5 billion pretax charge related to GE Capital\u2019s North American Life & Health portfolio. The after-tax impact of US$6.2 billion will be US$7.5 billion when adjusted to the rate following the recent U.S. tax overhaul, according to a company statement. GE\u2019s finance unit will pay US$15 billion over seven years to fill a shortfall in reserves.The announcement came just two months after Flannery told investors that \u201csoon we\u2019re going to be proud of\u201d GE\u2019s performance. At that time, he said it would cut its quarterly dividend, shrink to a handful of businesses and essentially start anew.\u201cNeedless to say, at a time when we are moving forward as a company, I am deeply disappointed at the magnitude of the charge,\u201d Flannery said Tuesday on the call. \u201cIt\u2019s especially frustrating to have this type of development when we\u2019ve been making progress on many of our key objectives.\u201dThe Boston-based company hasn\u2019t done any new business in the long-term care market since 2006. Still, it was saddled with obligations on contracts written years ago. The liabilities can swell when claims costs are higher than expected or when investment income fails to meet projections \u2014 a problem exacerbated by low interest rates.GE said dividends from GE Capital to the parent company would remain suspended for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d after the payment was halted during the portfolio review.Investors have been bracing since GE warned last year about potential problems in its long-term care portfolio. At a shareholder meeting in November, chief financial officer Jamie Miller said the company was likely to take a charge in excess of $3 billion, which is the amount GE Capital would have paid in a second-half dividend.Long-term care insurance policies, which emerged in their modern form in the 1980s, cover health-related costs not paid by Medicare or standard health insurance. But the products were undermined by faulty assumptions such as how long people would live and how expensive their care would be. Low interest rates also hurt insurers\u2019 ability to offset certain costs.While an \u201coutsized charge\u201d had been anticipated, the financial impact is \u201cfar in excess\u201d of even the worst-case scenario expectations, Tom Gallagher, an analyst at Evercore, said in a note to clients.\u00a0"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Maciej Onoszko", "title": "There's money to be made in Canada's bond market as bets on rate hikes soar", "description": "Traders getting ahead of themselves in pricing in steadily rising interest rates this year, according to some fund managers", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/rate-hike-fever-has-canadian-bond-managers-eyeing-short-end", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/coins.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 16, 2018 11:38 AM EST", "content": "There\u2019s money to be made in Canada\u2019s short-term bond market with traders getting ahead of themselves in pricing in steadily rising interest rates this year, according to some fund managers.Potential potholes from a breakup of NAFTA, to a stronger loonie and growing household debt means the Bank of Canada won\u2019t raise rates too aggressively after a likely hike at its next announcement on Wednesday, according to managers at CIBC Asset Management Inc., Leith Wheeler Investment Counsel Ltd. and Manulife Asset Management Ltd.While this week\u2019s announcement is a \u201ccoin toss,\u201d what\u2019s more certain is that the front end of the Canadian yield curve has become \u201ca bit too bearish, providing an opportunity\u201d to pick up beaten down bond prices which have fattened yields, said Patrick O\u2019Toole, who helps manage $65 billion in fixed income at CIBC Asset Management.Canadian bond yields shot up earlier this year, with two-year rates reaching a six-year high of 1.79 per cent after gangbuster jobs growth sent the unemployment rate to a 40-year low of 5.7 per cent in December. A Bank of Canada report also showed building capacity constraints among businesses. The Canadian dollar strengthened to 80.93 US cents after the jobs data release on Jan. 5, the strongest level since September.Twenty-three of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Bank of Canada to increase its key rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent Wednesday with the market for overnight interest-rate swaps pricing in an 88 per cent certainty on Tuesday. In total, the swaps market is wagering rates will rise three times this year to 1.75 per cent.That\u2019s all a bit too optimistic for the money managers.\u201cAny number of risks could easily materialize to prevent the Bank of Canada from hiking more aggressively, including \u2014 ironically \u2014 that the bank tightens too quickly in the first half of 2018 and ends up straining a highly indebted household sector,\u201d said Ben Homsy, a Vancouver-based fixed income portfolio manager at Leith Wheeler, who helps oversee $20 billion. \u201cThe market is being too aggressive in terms of what is priced for the whole of 2018.\u201dJames Dutkiewicz, chief investment officer at Sentry Investments Inc. pointed to the market\u2019s reaction to reports of NAFTA ructions as an example of how quickly sentiment can turn. Yields tumbled along with the loonie on Jan. 10 after Canadian government officials were said to see an increasing likelihood the U.S. would give six months\u2019 notice to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement which governs $1 trillion in flows between the U.S., Canada and Mexico annually.\u201cThe NAFTA headlines strongly suggest any hike will be followed by long delay,\u201d said Dutkiewicz, who heads a team managing US$14 billion.The central bank is facing a tug of war between an economy that\u2019s currently overheating versus a cloudy outlook, said Frances Donald, senior economist at Manulife Asset Management. \u201cThe long end in Canada will likely continue to be supported by global hawkish central bank activity, but a more dovish than expected Bank of Canada, could lower the front end somewhat.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "The big question isn\u2019t whether the Bank of Canada will raise rates", "description": "It\u2019s where do rates go from here with household debt and the Fed front and centre for Stephen Poloz", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/household-debt-and-fed-rates-are-front-and-center-for-poloz", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/poloz1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 15, 2018 12:08 PM EST", "content": "The Bank of Canada is already well into the process of raising interest rates to more normal levels and another increase is expected on Wednesday, after the economy\u2019s stellar performance last year.The big questions are how quickly do they continue moving up from here, how closely will they follow U.S. increases and where will rates settle. Markets are pricing in at least three more increases this year, which would bring the benchmark rate to 1.75 per cent.\u00a0Canada\u2019s economy, swept up by a synchronized global expansion, a housing boom and recovering oil prices, had a banner 2017 that included a sharp drop in unemployment and output growth that beat expectations. Policy makers now worry the economy could soon overheat, triggering inflation. Which is why they raised borrowing costs twice last year.The only remaining obstacles to further aggressive rate hikes may be high household debt loads and uncertainty about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 only one of which Governor Stephen Poloz has any influence over.\u2022 The Bank of Canada\u2019s overnight lending rate \u2014 which benchmarks most commercial loan rates in the country \u2014 is at 1 per cent.\u2022 It was as low as 0.5 per cent before the Ottawa-based central bank raised interest rates twice last year, in July and September.\u2022 Even with the two hikes, rates are still historically low. The overnight rate has averaged 2.9 per cent over the past 25 years\u2022 Commercial bank prime rates are at just over 3 per cent. While low, they are also up about half a percentage point from last yearCanadian households are easily the most indebted in the Group of Seven, and debt ratios have increased sharply since the 2014 oil shock. That means rate hikes pack a big punch in Canada by having an immediate and direct impact on the finances of many Canadians.Just as debt servicing costs are rising, regulators are also pushing through measures to tighten mortgage eligibility, with the latest moves coming into force on Jan. 1. Canadian households are not only facing more expensive debt payments, but the new rules threaten to damp price gains for their main assets: homes.All this will give policy makers some pause.The debt issue is important for another reason. It weakens the argument for Canada to follow U.S. rates higher.Usually, over time, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect Canadian rates to converge with those in the U.S. On average, the two policy rates align and three hikes would allow Canadian rates to keep pace with the Fed, which began its normalization process sooner. Investors anticipate up to three more hikes in the U.S. this year.Over the past 25 years, Canada\u2019s policy rate has been about a rate hike on average higher than the U.S. rate. At the moment it\u2019s 0.375 percentage points below, so there could be some catching up to do. But the U.S. \u2014 with its less indebted households \u2014 may be in a better position to cope with rate increases. Unlike Canada, U.S. debt ratios have actually been on the decline.In addition, the difference in household debt loads not only could impact the pace of increases, but even affect where interest rates eventually terminate.The Bank of Canada estimates its so-called neutral rate \u2014 a sort of Goldilocks rate that keeps the economy neither too hot nor too cold \u2014 at about 3 per cent. The Federal Reserve sees its neutral rate at 2.75 per cent, according to the median estimate in their most recent projections in December.The neutral rate is key because it gives policy makers a measure for how stimulative their policy rate is. The bigger the gap between the actual rate and the neutral rate, the more stimulative the current policy.

The latest data show 57.2 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 24 years have a job, the highest share since January 2009. The past calendar year saw the largest improvement in the employment rate for this age bracket since 2002.\u201cLabour markets are healthy, with falling youth participation the result of increasing education levels \u2014 a positive long-term development,\u201d Brian DePratto, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a research note Tuesday on the issue.For Poloz, suboptimal outcomes among young Canadians would be a cause for concern. Their lack of participation limits the top speed at which the economy can grow, while impressionable youth who can\u2019t make their way into the labour market may end up grappling with \u201ca scar that could last a lifetime.\u201dIn his December speech, the governor bemoaned how the youth labour force participation rate had fallen nearly 5 percentage points over the past decade. His concern about youth employment is perceived as a dovish signal, an indication he sees continued slack in what is otherwise a red-hot labour market.DePratto thinks the concern is overplayed. \u201cThis is an area where we disagree that the signal is worrisome,\u201d according to the TD report. \u201cTo begin with, a decade ago was a pre-crisis cyclical high\u201d for youth participation rates \u201cand so perhaps should not be viewed as the best point of comparison.\u201dYoung Canadians not in school are just as likely to be in the labour force as they were a decade ago, DePratto notes, with the participation rate among non-students currently just off its post-crisis peak.Digging more deeply into the data, subdued youth participation is acutely attributable to Canadian teenagers: a group with a historically low rate of labour-force attachment.\u201cThe data suggest that any deviations in participation have been driven by high school kids changing their behaviour,\u201d said Randall Bartlett, chief economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t support the narrative that monetary policy should be formulated on the basis of any supposed weakness in these youth labour market metrics.\u201dIndeed, more than 90 per cent of young Canadians outside of the labour force say they don\u2019t want work.That means the room for cyclical improvement in youth underemployment seems fairly limited, no matter what the central bank does. The Bank of Canada\u2019s main tool \u2014 changes to short-term interest rates \u2014 is considered to be a particularly blunt means of influencing economic activity.Unemployed youth are more likely to look for a part-time job \u2014 a sign that a rising youth employment rate might not pack all that big of a punch for the growth of labour input. For example, less than one-fifth of young workers who have a part-time gig say they really want full-time employment, a share that has fallen for three consecutive years.\u201cFinding a negative story in the employ\u00adment data is something of a data-mining exercise,\u201d DePratto writes.That\u2019s reflected in the fact that all of the nation\u2019s six biggest commercial lenders are now predicting the Bank of Canada will raise its policy rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent next week, on the heels of an unemployment rate that\u2019s dropped to its lowest level in more than 40 years and signs that companies are reaching capacity constraints.\u201cThere\u2019s probably less slack in the labour market than there even is in the economy \u2014 for me, that\u2019s a big concern and it should be for the bank,\u201d Bartlett said.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Five reasons the Bank of Canada might NOT raise its rate next week", "description": "But with all six big banks calling for a rise, markets could get a jolt if Stephen Poloz actually holds", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/heres-why-case-for-bank-of-canada-rate-hike-isnt-airtight", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/stephen-poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2018 12:44 PM EST", "content": "A Bank of Canada rate increase next week isn\u2019t a sure thing.Even with all of Canada\u2019s biggest commercial banks now calling for a hike, if the central bank chooses to hold off, it could cite a range of factors from tepid inflation to Nafta uncertainties.There's a pretty good case for them going. I don't think it's airtightOn Monday, Bank of Montreal became the last major Canadian bank to change its forecast for next week to a rate hike.

Poloz could seek to stem that move by staying on the sidelines next Wednesday.Porter and Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, also cited risks the U.S. could abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement, a threat to three-quarters of Canada\u2019s exports.If we're wrong, we're all getting it wrongPoloz has repeatedly said the bank is watching to see how the two rate hikes last year will affect the nation\u2019s highly indebted borrowers. The governor said in a speech last month \u201chigh levels of debt will make the economy as a whole more sensitive to higher interest rates today than in the past.\u201dAn additional consideration is that new federal mortgage rules, which took effect this month, will make it tougher for some borrowers to afford a home and could weigh on prices, compounding the risks from higher rates.Any pause next week could give a bigger jolt to markets than the increase in September, when there was more of a split among economists, according to Holt. \u201cIf we\u2019re wrong, we\u2019re all getting it wrong,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis and Greg Quinn", "title": "Condos fuel the strongest year in a decade for Canadian builders", "description": "The boom has surprised policy makers and analysts, most of whom began the year predicting the industry would be a drag on the economy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/condos-fuel-strongest-year-in-a-decade-for-canadian-builders", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/condos.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2018 11:35 AM EST", "content": "Last year was a blockbuster for Canada\u2019s real estate developers after work began on the most homes in a decade amid soaring demand nationwide.Construction started on 219,675 units, according to 2017 data Tuesday from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.

Starts on multiple-unit projects such as condos hit a record in figures dating to 1955.The boom has surprised policy makers and analysts, most of whom began the year predicting the industry would be a drag on the economy. It reflects fundamental drivers such as a buoyant economy and rising population.Robert Kavcic, an economist at Bank of Montreal in Toronto, said the strong year for housing starts was \u201cbacked by underlying demographic support and strengthening labour markets in the country\u2019s largest provinces.\u201dThe 2017 surge was broad-based, with starts in Ontario at the highest level since 2004 and reaching records in British Columbia. They advanced in Alberta for the first time since the 2014 oil crash.The increased activity mostly sidestepped land-constrained Toronto and Vancouver, the country\u2019s two most expensive markets, but was robust in the suburbs and less pricey surrounding cities. Starts in Toronto fell 1 per cent to 38,738 in 2017, while declining 6 per cent in Vancouver to 26,204 units. In Montreal, Canada\u2019s second most populous city, starts jumped 39 per cent to 24,756.Builders began work on 142,840 multiple units in 2017, up 15 per cent from 2016. That was driven by new construction of 102,516 apartment-like homes, the highest since 1973, and 28,033 row-like homes, the highest for that category since 1976.Demand has remained strong nationally even with prices in the Toronto region coming off from records. The latest data from the Canadian Real Estate Association show national home prices are up 9.3 per cent over the past year, bringing five year gains to 48 per cent. Even in Toronto, prices are up 8.4 per cent over the past 12 months.At the start of 2017, economists had been forecasting housing starts would drop that year to the lowest since the 2009 recession. But the economy performed better than almost anyone expected, with Canada\u2019s employers creating more than 400,000 jobs.Perhaps the biggest influence has been an acceleration in population growth that few anticipated. Statistics Canada estimates the population has grown at an annual pace of more than 1.3 per cent over the past year, which is the fastest since the early 1990s.A slowdown may be in store for 2018 however, as the tighter mortgage qualifications kick in and the Bank of Canada raises interest rates.\u201cWith a record number units under construction to start the year, demand in some quarters tempered by policy changes, and interest rates on their way up again,\u201d Kavcic said, \u201cthis year will likely see activity moderate.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "'We will outperform': Canada's top preferred fund seeks value in turbo-charged market", "description": "The odds of a rate hike have more than doubled, but Canada's best-performing preferred share fund isn't rushing to adjust its strategy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/top-canada-preferred-fund-seeks-value-in-turbo-charged-market", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/01069boc.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2018 10:01 AM EST", "content": "The odds of a rate hike at the next Bank of Canada meeting more than doubled after a blockbuster December jobs report, but Canada\u2019s best-performing preferred share fund isn\u2019t rushing to adjust its strategy.\u201cWe put less of a focus on interest-rate anticipation and more of a focus on selecting undervalued securities,\u201d said Ryan Domsy, manager of the $167 million (US$134 million) preferred share fund at Foyston, Gordon & Payne Inc., a Toronto-based investment manager with $13.3 billion under management. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re floaters, perpetuals or rate resets \u2014 if we\u2019re constantly buying what\u2019s undervalued, we will outperform.\u201dPreferred shares have had a great run as Canada\u2019s economy picked up steam in 2017, culminating in a plunge in the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent in December \u2014 the lowest in more than 40 years. The Bank of Canada raised interest rates twice and investors expect it do so so at the next announcement on Jan. 17, holding out the prospect of fatter dividends as rates on preferred shares tied to government bond yields reset higher.The FGP Preferred Share Fund, which is also the sub-adviser for the Evolve Active Canadian Preferred Share ETF, returned 22 per cent in 2017. This makes it the best-performing preference fund in Canada, including mutual funds and ETFs. By comparison, the S&P/TSX Preferred Total Return Index gained 14 per cent last year.But Domsy said there are other factors besides interest rates that should go into investing decisions, including business risk, financial risk and structural risk. He believes this approach gives him an edge over other managers, who tend to measure value using more simplistic metrics like yield-to-reset or yield-to-call ratios.\u201cWhen you look at the financials, for example, people paint all banks with almost one brush, which is fairly ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s huge differences between the risk levels of a TD Bank and a National Bank, and when you look at the fixed-income securities that they issue, it\u2019s very rarely ever reflected in the pricing or the return characteristics.\u201dThe fund\u2019s small size gives it an advantage, Domsy said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a US$3 billion fund you literally have to hold everything, you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201dBy contrast, FGP\u2019s fund can be \u201ca lot more nimble than some of the big managers that have to buy every new issue that comes to market,\u201d said Raj Lala, chief executive officer of Evolve Funds Group Inc., whose pref ETF mirrors the FGP fund.\u201cThe nice thing is right now preferreds have actually for the most part lagged the recent changes in interest rates,\u201d Domsy said. \u201cSo even if the interest rate increases aren\u2019t as aggressive as some people are expecting, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a problem with preferreds.

The dropoff was largely due to a 25 per cent decline in energy deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trend in recent years of Canadian firms buying abroad abated in 2017, falling to about US$122.3 billion, from a record US$176 billion last year. That was still above the average of the previous five years of about US$72 billion.

At the same time, the domestic Canada market doesn\u2019t offer the same size of takeover targets as the U.S. and elsewhere, he added.JPMorgan was the top financial adviser for deals involving Canadian firms, participating in US$65.4 billion worth of transactions through Dec. 26. Barclays Plc was second, advising on US$46.7 billion, followed by Toronto-Dominion Bank, at US$43.1 billion. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. came fourth, working on US$39.9 billion worth of transactions and Royal Bank of Canada was next at US$38.6 billion.

He said he expects the activity to shift to more consolidation among the Canadian mid-sized oil and gas companies next year. Domestic energy deals hit their highest point on record at $38.3 billion, up from $13.7 billion a year ago.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a continuation of the less-than-favorable environment in the energy market in Canada right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s less foreign interest in the Canadian resource plays as evidenced by guys leaving.\u201dThe lack of foreign interest was largely driven by the perception that Canada has higher-cost basins to produce, environmental concerns around buying oil-sands assets, and a lack of transportation options for export, he said.Bruce Rothney, Barclays\u2019s chief executive officer in Canada, said a lot of the recent client discussions have focused on digital disruption and the impact on their businesses. Barclays expects this trend to accelerate, driving dealmaking across all sectors.Companies are reacting by either fortifying their traditional business models through greater scale or by partnering with new entrants, he said. Importantly, Silicon Valley players aren\u2019t the only ones driving this change.

While the jump was due to a surge in gasoline prices, the increases went beyond energy. A separate report showed retail sales surging in October, adding to evidence the expansion continues to steam ahead.The data, which beat expectations, added almost 0.78 US cents to the Canadian dollar, as market odds of a rate hike in January jumped to almost 50:50. By early afternoon the loonie was up 0.69 at 78.63 US cents.\u201cThese reports do increase the odds of more aggressive tightening from the Bank of Canada in 2018,\u201d said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.Bets in the markets of an increase in January rose to 52.8 per cent from 37.9 per cent ahead of the data, while a March hike was nearly fully priced in.If the inflation proves sustained, it will pose a challenge for the Bank of Canada. Policy makers have been keen to keep the expansion moving with low interest rates on the expectation price pressures will be muted.\u201cAll told, some upside beats on retail and inflation leave room for the Bank of Canada to tighten\u201d in the first quarter, Nick Exarhos, an economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to investors.BMO economist Douglas Porter said economists will be watching closely Gross Domestic Product data out Friday and jobs numbers early in the New Year.\u201cWhile we believe that the Bank of Canada is still more likely to wait for a spell before hiking again (penciling in the March meeting), that could change quickly if those two reports also read strong,\u201d said Porter in a note.Investors are anticipating the Bank of Canada will move ahead with three more interest rate increases by the end of next year, adding to two rate hikes this year. Inflation last hit 2 per cent in February, and last surpassed the central bank\u2019s target in January. The jump in the inflation rate was the biggest one-month increase since 2013.Persistently weak inflation had been one of the main arguments against further interest-rate increases. But inflation is coming in faster than the central bank had forecast in October, when it predicted it would average 1.4 per cent in the final three months of 2017. Policy makers don\u2019t expect a sustained return to 2 per cent inflation until the end of next year.At a rate decision this month, the central bank said the faster-than-expected inflation was due to temporary factors. Yet, today\u2019s figures suggest that shrinking excess capacity in the economy is beginning to lift inflation.The average of the Bank of Canada\u2019s three key core inflation measures \u2014 which exclude volatile items such as energy \u2014 rose to 1.7 per cent, the highest level in more than a year.And today\u2019s retail sales figures suggest growth in the final quarter of 2017 remains above the nation\u2019s non-inflationary growth rates.Retail sales increased 1.5 per cent in October, the largest gain since January, Statistics Canada said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 0.3 per cent gain. The jump represents a comeback for retailers after a recent slowdown in sales had raised worries about consumers paring back in the second half of this year.The retail sales figures bode well for October gross domestic product data, which will be released Friday by Statistics Canada. Economists forecast GDP growth of 0.2 per cent in October.With file from ReutersBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jen Skerritt", "title": "Why it's so difficult to bet against Canada's marijuana boom", "description": "Short-selling Canadian marijuana stocks is expensive as the values of companies continue to climb and few shares are available to borrow", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/why-its-so-difficult-to-bet-against-canadas-marijuana-boom", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/1214cannabis.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 14, 2017 3:03 PM EST", "content": "Pot\u2019s meteoric rise in Canada has spurred speculation of a bubble but betting against the boom isn\u2019t so easy.Short-selling Canadian marijuana stocks is expensive as the values of companies continue to climb and few shares are available to borrow, a key step in betting against a security. The brokerages of top Canadian banks don\u2019t trade those stocks, and smaller firms charge prohibitive interest rates to lend them.\u201cIt\u2019s harder to find that borrow, and that borrow is very expensive,\u201d said Matt Bottomley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard industry to short.\u201dCanadian marijuana stocks have ballooned as the nation marches toward legalization by July. The country\u2019s top four producers are now worth more than $10 billion after Canopy Growth Corp., the first marijuana unicorn, more than doubled this year, Aurora Cannabis Inc. more than tripled, Aphria Inc. gained more than 180 per cent and MedReleaf Corp. has climbed more than 60 per cent since its June debut.While investor optimism is being fuelled by estimates that there could be $6 billion in recreational sales by 2021, Canada and its provinces are still working out the details of how they will regulate, tax and distribute the products, and some publicly traded companies have yet to make a sale. Some analysts are skeptical about their demand projections.But an investor willing to bet those risks will eventually bring down the value of the stocks would have to pay a high price. The annual interest rate to short Aurora, Aphria or MedReleaf is upward of 20 per cent, said Chris Damas, editor of the BCMI Cannabis Report.The problem is most of the Canadian marijuana stocks are small to microcap companies held by small retail investors who don\u2019t have margin accounts for short trades, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3 Partners in New York. The higher loan fee means there\u2019s almost no stock left to short, and some investors who have taken short positions in the market have lost money, he said.In short-selling, investors sell stocks that they borrowed when prices are high, with a view to buying them cheap later when they have to return the shares to the lender. They profit from the price difference minus the cost of borrowing.The annual cost to borrow Aurora shares for a short position is 26 per cent, compared with less than 0.5 per cent for most stocks in the S&P 500 index, such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., Dusaniwsky said.\u201cThe higher the fee means there\u2019s almost no stock left to short,\u201d Dusaniwsky said in a telephone interview. \u201cNo one is making money shorting these stocks.\u201dMore than US$71 million is shorted in Canopy Growth, down 21 per cent from a month ago, while the short interest in Aurora Cannabis declined 5.9 per cent to US$144 million, according to S3 Partners data. This year to date, short sellers have lost US$112 million in Aurora and US$33 million in Canopy Growth, Dusaniwsky said.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have short sellers in the market, you have no ability for anyone to bet against a company plus you have no ability to hedge,\u201d Damas said by telephone. \u201cIt directly feeds into the massively euphoric bull market we\u2019ve had in these stocks.\u201dProvincial distribution plans, Constellation Brands Inc.\u2019s foray into the market and Aphria\u2019s deal with a national pharmacy chain have all brought more certainty to the nascent industry and helped spur more retail investment, Bottomley said.But the boom could \u201cend badly\u201d like previous manias that caused the tech and rare earth bubbles to burst given little short-selling and no bad news to slow down \u201cthe runaway train of Canadian cannabis,\u201d BCMI said in a report Wednesday.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Eric J.

They wanted to refinance but regulations imposed last year will disqualify them. In a few weeks, they won\u2019t even qualify for an uninsured loan at an alternative lender as more rules come into effect.They opted for a third route: adding a second mortgage with an interest rate of 10.5 per cent to pay off their debt. Their salvation came from a private unregulated lender, a move many other Canadians are making as the government tries to rein in a home-price surge that\u2019s driven household debt to a record. But like a giant game of Whac-A-Mole, the risk to the financial system from tapped out borrowers is merely shifting \u2014 this time to a market where there\u2019s no oversight from the country\u2019s national bank regulator and new stress-test rules don\u2019t apply.People need solutions, it could be temporary, but at least they have a home over their head\u201cWe\u2019re transferring risk from the regulated segment to the unregulated segment of the market,\u201d Benjamin Tal,\u00a0deputy chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cIf we have a significant correction, clearly the unregulated markets will suffer even more because that\u2019s where the first casualties would be. And then you will see it elsewhere.\u201dBrookes says more than 90 per cent of her business in the last two months has been lining up funding from non-bank and private sources, or shadow banks \u2014 versus a 50-50 mix previously.\u00a0\u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to stop buying, they\u2019ll just find different ways of doing it.\u201dFor the government, it may be a case of careful what you wish for. Anxious to prevent a repeat of the kind of taxpayer-funded bank bailouts that occurred in the U.S. after its housing crash a decade ago, the federal government has been moving to reduce its exposure to the mortgage-insurance market.Rules last year added a stress test for insured loans backed by the government. That sent more buyers to the uninsured space, where a 20 per cent down payment is required. As of Jan. 1, these borrowers will also need to qualify at a rate two percentage points higher than their offered rate, a move which could lower mortgage creation by as much as 15 per cent, Canada\u2019s bank regulator has said.Roughly 90 per cent of new mortgages in Toronto and Vancouver this year are now uninsuredEarlier changes have already had a dramatic effect. Uninsured mortgages made up about three-quarters of new loans at federally regulated banks this year,\u00a0up from two-thirds in 2014, according to the Bank of Canada. Roughly 90 per cent of new mortgages in Toronto and Vancouver this year are now uninsured, in part because government insurance is forbidden on homes priced over $1 million and prices have risen, the bank said.On the one hand, taxpayer risk has dropped as insured mortgage origination fell 17 per cent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, the bank said in its semi-annual financial system review. About 49 per cent of all outstanding mortgages are now uninsured, up from 36 per cent five years ago. The credit quality of some of the loans at the big banks have also improved as borrowers buy less expensive homes, the Bank of Canada said.The rules, along with other measures such as a foreign-purchase tax, have had an initial bite \u2014 with Toronto house prices falling 8.8 per cent from May to November and the average price of a home posting the first annual drop since 2009. Vancouver prices have reclaimed new heights after cooling earlier this year.But the risks to the financial system haven\u2019t gone away. In the uninsured space, mortgages are increasingly going to highly indebted households and for amortizations for longer than 25 years, the central bank said. And like Brookes\u2019s clients drowning in house debt, more borrowers are turning to lenders whose activities fall outside federal regulatory scope.These include credit unions and mortgage-investment corporations, pools of money from individual shareholders, which aren\u2019t subject to the new rules,\u00a0Tal said. Credit unions hold about 17 per cent of uninsured mortgages, according to the Bank of Canada.Canada\u2019s patchwork regulatory system also doesn\u2019t encourage comfort, Tal said. Banks are regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, but credit unions and brokerages are overseen provincially. Mortgage-finance companies are semi-regulated, and MICs and other private lenders are unregulated.MICs currently make up about 10 per cent of mortgage transaction volume, or 6 per cent of dollar volume, according to research from Tal at CIBC said. Transaction volume will likely grow to about 14 per cent under the new rules, and in the event of defaults in a housing correction, those MIC investors would be open to losses, he said.\u201cAnything over 10 per cent is sub-optimal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this market to be too big because you don\u2019t want to increase the blind spots.\u201dSound underwriting is an important element in maintaining a strong and stable Canadian financial system and OSFI will continue to monitor the country\u2019s housing and mortgage markets under the new rules, Annik Faucher, spokeswoman for Ottawa-based organization said in an email.Like her clients, Brookes\u00a0said borrowers will get creative to get around the new rules. Options include companies like Alta West Capital, Fisgard Asset Management Corp. and Brookstreet Mortgage Investment Corp. or just a wealthy individual willing to lend at interest rates starting around 12 per cent.Fisgard didn\u2019t respond to request for comment, Brookstreet declined to comment while Chuck McKitrick, chief executive officer at Calgary-based Alta West said MICs are regulated\u00a0by the country\u2019s securities commissions and various real estate bodies.\u201cWe\u2019re scrutinized a hundred different ways,\u201d said McKitrick. \u201cThere\u2019s very little difference between us and other regulated entities.\u201dDespite the expectation that MICs will see more business, McKitrick said the big financial institutions will adapt to new regulations to keep lending. Shawn Stillman, a mortgage broker at Mortgage Outlet Inc., said banks could lower their mortgage rates so homebuyers would still qualify under the new stress-test rules.\u201cThe bank doesn\u2019t care because they\u2019re still going to make their fees and get their money,\u201d Stillman said by phone from Toronto.Alta West predominantly lends to entrepreneurs and new Canadians, groups that typically have a harder time getting a mortgage at one of the big banks. Its rate of mortgages in arrears is about 2 per cent, he said. That compares with about 0.2 per cent at the big banks and about 0.4 per cent for the credit unions, according to data compiled by the Canadian Credit Union Association.\u201cPeople need solutions \u2014 it could be temporary, but at least they have a home over their head,\u201d Brookes said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "David Goodman", "title": "Brace yourselves: We're about to see steepest rate hikes since 2006", "description": "Wall Street economists are telling investors to prepare for the biggest tightening of monetary policy in more than a decade", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/investors-told-to-brace-for-steepest-rate-hikes-since-2006-1?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/1211powell.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 11, 2017 3:27 PM EST", "content": "Wall Street economists are telling investors to brace for the biggest tightening of monetary policy in more than a decade.With the world economy heading into its strongest period since 2011, Citigroup Inc.\u00a0and JPMorgan Chase & Co. predict average interest rates across advanced economies will climb to at least 1 per cent next year in what would be the largest increase since 2006.As for the quantitative easing that marks its 10th anniversary in the U.S. next year, Bloomberg Economics predicts net asset purchases by the main central banks will fall to a monthly US$18 billion at the end of 2018, from US$126 billion in September, and turn negative during the first half of 2019.That reflects an increasingly synchronized global expansion finally strong enough to spur inflation, albeit modestly. The test for policy makers, including incoming Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, will be whether they can continue pulling back without derailing demand or rocking asset markets.\u201c2018 is the year when we have true tightening,\u201d said Ebrahim Rahbari, director of global economics at Citigroup in New York. \u201cWe will continue on the current path where financial markets can deal quite well with monetary policy but perhaps later in the year, or in 2019, monetary policy will become one of the complicating factors.\u201dA clearer picture should form this week when the Norges Bank, Fed, Bank of England, European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank announce their final policy decisions of 2017. They collectively set borrowing costs for more than a third of the world economy. At least 10 other central banks also deliver decisions this week.The Fed will dominate the headlines on Wednesday amid predictions it will raise its benchmark by a quarter of a percentage point. Outgoing chair Janet Yellen is set to signal more increases to come in 2018. On Thursday, the SNB, BOE and ECB will make decisions in quick succession although each is forecast to keep rates on hold.There will likely be more activity next year as Citigroup estimates the advanced world\u2019s average rate will reach its highest since 2008, climbing 0.4 percentage point to 1 per cent. JPMorgan projects its gauge to rise to 1.2 per cent, a jump of more than half a percentage point from 0.68 per cent at the end of this year.Citigroup expects the Fed and its Canadian peer to move three times and the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Norway once. JPMorgan is forecasting the Fed will shift four times, the same as the median estimate of economists in the latest Bloomberg survey.Behind the shift are expectations that the world economy will expand around 4 per cent next year, the best since a post-recession bounce in 2011. Among the accelerators: falling unemployment, stronger trade and business spending, as well as a likely tax cut in the U.S.The International Monetary Fund predicts consumer prices in advanced economies will climb 1.7 per cent next year, the most since 2012, although it remains below the 2 per cent most central banks view as price stability.The global tightening will still leave rates low by historical standards and central banks may ultimately hold fire if inflation stays weak. Neither the ECB nor the BOJ are currently expected to lift their benchmarks next year.Past and ongoing bond buying will cushion the withdrawal of stimulus elsewhere, as will easing by some emerging market central banks. Russia and Colombia may this week follow Brazil in cutting their benchmarks.While BOE Governor Mark Carney and ECB President Mario Draghi pivoted away from easy money without roiling financial markets, the calm may not last. The Bank for International Settlements warned this month that policy makers risk lulling investors into a false sense of security that elevates the risk of a correction in bond yields.\u201cMany developed market central banks, led by the Fed, are entering 2018 taking a leap of faith that inflation will return as they move toward normalizing monetary policy.\u00a0Continued asset purchases by the BOJ and ECB\u00a0will buy sometime for policy makers to discover the unattended consequences of quantitative tightening without risking a severe market disruption. Nevertheless, too much normalization too fast, risks reversing a relatively upbeat global economic outlook in 2018, especially if central bankers\u2019 assumptions on the Phillips Curve prove to be false.\u201d \u2013Michael McDonough, Bloomberg EconomicsInvestors are already less bullish than most economists. In the U.S., where inflation has shown some signs of slowing, the market sees about two quarter-point hikes next year, according to federal funds futures contracts. There is also speculation the bond yield curve may even invert as long-term borrowing costs fall below short-term ones, a trade which sometimes foreshadows a recession.Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, is betting that \u201cquantitative tightening\u201d will hit markets in the second quarter. That\u2019s when he assumes U.S. inflation takes off and the ECB signals an end to bond buying.\u201cWe see 2018 as a pretty key year for normalization,\u201d said Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec in London. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite challenging for central banks to get the balance right on how much to do.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ranjeetha Pakiam", "title": "Gold gets beaten down in worst week since May on U.S. rate hike outlook", "description": "This week's drop deepens a slump for gold, which had touched a one-year high as recently as September", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/mining/golds-beaten-down-in-worst-week-since-may-on-u-s-rates-outlook", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/1208gold.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 8, 2017 11:24 AM EST", "content": "Gold is heading for the biggest weekly drop since May as investors anticipate higher U.S. interest rates and progress on tax reform buoys the dollar, deepening a slump for the metal that touched a one-year high\u00a0as recently as September.Bullion for immediate delivery has lost 2.6 per cent this week, the most since the period ended May 5.

Only four of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect Poloz to increase his 1 per cent benchmark rate, with all major Canadian banks expecting a pause.Central bank policy makers \u2014 who raised borrowing costs for the first time in seven years in July and September \u2014 are handling the normalization of policy very carefully. By their own measure, interest rates are still a full 2 percentage points below what they would consider \u201cneutral\u201d but the Bank of Canada is wary of raising borrowing costs too quickly for fear of inadvertently triggering another downturn.Investors anticipate as many as three more hikes by the end of 2018 with the first in March, swaps trading suggests.Rates will need to rise to account for an economy that has been one of the strongest in the developed world with a jobs market on a tear. Even with an anticipated second-half slowdown, Canada is headed for 3 per cent growth for all of 2017. That\u2019s almost a percentage point above U.S. growth and has prompted some to question whether historically low interest rates \u2014 currently at below the rate of inflation \u2014 are appropriate for an economy at near its full capacity.\u201cWe continue to think the central bank will be forced by strong data to deliver more interest rate hikes than what markets are currently expecting for 2018,\u201d National Bank of Canada economists Stefan Marion and Krishen Rangasamy said in a note to investors Monday.But there is also a case to be made for caution, and central bank policy makers have spent much of the past two months making it.\u201cWhether it\u2019s about how aggressive or how cautious policy should be \u2014 getting the dosage right demands sound judgment about complex trade-offs,\u201d Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said in a Nov. 15 speech, the last by a central bank governing council member before the decision.One argument against rate increases is weak inflation, which has undershot the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target for years. If the economy can continue expanding at a fast clip without overheating, policy makers can afford to wait longer before raising interest rates.The Bank of Canada has also been voicing a narrative that the economy is at the \u201csweet spot\u201d of the business cycle where growing demand is actually generating new capacity as companies invest to meet sales. The idea essentially is that demand can actually generate supply, at least temporarily, limiting price pressures.The central bank has cited a number of other reasons for its caution:Policy makers are worried about the impact of higher borrowing costs on the ability of Canadians to pay their bills \u2014 and the nation is carrying the heaviest household debt burden in the Group of Seven, by far. Growing risks associated with renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. A slowing housing market coupled with the impact of new regulatory measures to rein in lending. Continued evidence of slack in the labour market despite the unemployment rate being at a decade low.There is also the impact higher interest rates could have on the Canadian dollar. Policy makers were spooked earlier this year by a sharp gain in the currency following its two rate increases that spurred expectations the Bank of Canada would outpace the Federal Reserve\u2019s hiking path.Talk of caution has helped weaken the currency by almost 5 per cent since the September rate hike, and brought policy expectations more into sync with the Fed. Bank of Canada officials may be more comfortable with that.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Rogers is considering selling the Toronto Blue Jays, Cogeco stake, CFO says", "description": "Rogers still wants rights to sports programming but doesn't have to own a team to have that", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/rogers-evaluating-sale-of-blue-jays-cogeco-stake-cfo-says", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/blue-jays.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 6, 2017 6:54 AM EST", "content": "Rogers Communications Inc. is considering selling assets such as baseball\u2019s Toronto Blue Jays and a stake in media company Cogeco Inc. to free up capital for other investments, Chief Financial Officer Tony Staffieri said.The Toronto-based telecommunications giant wants to get more value for the assets, though no deal is imminent, Staffieri said at the UBS Global Media and Communications conference in New York.Rogers plans to increase investments in its wireless network as part of a plan to capture a surge in data use, chief executive officer Joe Natale told the Globe & Mail this week.

The increase in gross domestic product probably slowed to less than a 2 per cent annualized pace between July and September, economists predict, less than half the rate in the first six months of this year.The quarter also may mark the start of what analysts believe will be a gearing down in spending by the nation\u2019s highly indebted households that will act as a long-term drag. Future GDP growth is seen limited to no more than 2 per cent as consumer spending slows to some of the weakest levels on record outside of recession.The economy has been growing \u201con the backs of the consumer\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s clearly unsustainable,\u201d said David Stonehouse, a Toronto-based portfolio manager who helps oversee $6 billion in fixed-income assets at AGF Management Ltd.The GDP data is due at 8:30 a.m. Ottawa time, along with November jobs numbers. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast annualized growth of 1.6 per cent in the third quarter, down from 4.5 per cent in the second quarter. The big drag in the third quarter comes from a sharp drop in exports \u2014 plagued by temporary plant shutdowns \u2014 that should reverse by the end of the year.An expected slowdown in consumption however will be more lasting. Household spending growth is expected to slow to 2.8 per cent in the third quarter, the slowest pace in a year, from 4.6 per cent in the prior period.And consumption is expected to continue slowing in coming quarters, with economists forecasting quarterly annualized growth of 1.6 per cent by the start of 2019.Bank of Canada economists have come to similar conclusions. According to the central bank\u2019s latest projections, consumer spending\u2019s contribution to growth over the next two years will be near record lows outside of recession, adding 1.3 percentage points to total growth in 2018 and 1 percentage point in 2019. That would be down from 2.1 percentage points in 2017.By 2019, overall GDP growth is projected to slow to 1.5 per cent \u2014 half the 3 per cent rate projected for 2017 \u2014 as households pull down economic activity.Household spending has carried the country\u2019s economy for much of the decade since the 2008-2009 recession, particularly in the two years following the collapse of oil prices in 2014 when it accounted for just about all of Canada\u2019s economic growth.Consumers, benefiting from a buoyant jobs market and rising home values, accelerated their spending in the first half of this year, when household consumption rose at an annualized 4.6 per cent pace in the second quarter, following a 4.8 per cent gain in the first quarter. That\u2019s the best two-quarter gain since before the 2008 recession.But a mounting debt load \u2014 Canadian households are carrying more than $2 trillion of debt, driven in large part by soaring home prices in major cities \u2014 will take a toll, particularly as the Bank of Canada raises interest rates. In the long term, consumption will be subject to the same source of structural constraints hampering potential growth in the rest of the economy: low productivity and aging demographics.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the past three quarters isn\u2019t anywhere near a sustainable rate of growth,\u201d said James Marple, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.Of course, economists and policy makers have long underestimated the ability of the consumer to dominate the growth story. At the start of last year, the Bank of Canada was forecasting a contribution to growth for consumption in 2017 of half its latest estimates.But Canada\u2019s consumption-led growth model is approaching its limits. It may work when the economy has plenty of spare capacity, as has been the case for a decade. It works less well when the economy is running up against constraints, as it is now.Faster-than-expected growth in the first half of the year led the central bank to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade, with moves in July and September.Much will depend on other engines of growth, particularly business investment that not only bolsters the economy today but gives it more scope to grow in the future. And here the numbers are looking better. Investment is poised to be the strongest part of Friday\u2019s GDP report, with economists calling for a 4.6 per cent annualized expansion in gross fixed investment.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "BoC sees risks easing, but cure is higher rates and tougher rules", "description": "The central bank cautioned that the process to rein in risky borrowing will take time and the outcome is uncertain", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-sees-financial-system-vulnerabilities-easing-1", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 28, 2017 3:56 PM EST", "content": "The Bank of Canada is optimistic higher interest rates and regulatory efforts to rein in risky borrowing will make the country\u2019s financial system more resilient, though the process could take time to unfold and the outcome remains uncertain.In its semi-annual financial stability report, Canada\u2019s central bank painted a picture of a housing market where key steps have been taken to improve the quality of lending, particularly in the most expensive cities such as Toronto. At the same time, it warned risks remain elevated, particularly high household debt levels, and measures to rein in loans to the most highly indebted households will take time to work.\u201cOur financial system continues to be resilient, and is being bolstered by stronger growth and job creation, but we need to continue to watch financial vulnerabilities closely,\u201d Governor Stephen Poloz said in a statement.The language in the report parallels the main message in the central bank\u2019s last Financial System Review in June \u2014 that of strengthening resiliency of the financial system on the back of an improving economy \u2014 that provided the backdrop for two rate increases in July and September.The Canadian dollar pared some of its intraday losses after the report. The currency was down 0.2 per cent to C$1.2798 per U.S. dollar at 10:48 a.m. in Toronto trading.The central bank cited three main reasons why it expects risks to mitigate over time: income growth, new mortgage finance policy measures and higher mortgage rates.New regulations \u2014 the federal government\u2019s in 2016 and the banking regulator last month \u2014 limit the creation of new highly indebted households, and should reduce demand in cities like Toronto where speculative demand has been a factor, the central bank said.\u201cThe effects of tighter mortgage rules implemented last year have already improved the quality of new insured lending,\u201d the Bank of Canada said. \u201cIncome growth, new mortgage finance policy measures and higher mortgage rates are expected to mitigate this vulnerability over time.\u201dOne area that remains a major concern for the central bank is the growing share of uninsured mortgages, those with loan to value ratios at or below 80 per cent, which is being fuelled by higher Toronto and Vancouver home prices and tighter qualification rules for insured mortgages. The issue was a focus for a second consecutive report, with the central bank saying a portion of these loans are displaying riskier characteristics.The proportion of low ratio loans to highly indebted households is trending up, and the share of these mortgages amortized longer than 25 years is also increasing, it said. The issue has been particularly prominent in regions with the highest price growth, such as Toronto.The Bank of Canada analyzed the impact of October regulatory changes by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, which make it more difficult to qualify for insured mortgages. It concluded they are \u201cexpected to decrease the proportion of highly indebted households among new borrowers\u201d particularly in high price growth regions.But the end result is still uncertain, the central bank cautioned.\u201cAs borrowers and lenders adapt to the new OSFI guidelines, it will take some time to assess the extent to which this vulnerability is being alleviated,\u201d it said.Based on the impact of the federal government\u2019s 2016 measures to curb riskier insured mortgages, \u201ca material impact\u201d on new lending could take as long as six months, it said. And because of the largest stock of debt, it could take \u201cseveral years\u201d to have a significant impact on overall vulnerability.The central bank had a similar message for how higher borrowing costs and the new regulatory measures will impact housing markets like Toronto. It should reduce demand, \u201cbut the impact of these policy measures on the market is uncertain,\u201d it said.\u201cThere is uncertainty about how borrowers and lenders will react to the new OSFI measures,\u201d it said. \u201cThere is also uncertainty around the sensitivity of the housing market to higher interest rates.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "How dangerous is our household debt?

That\u2019s followed Friday by Statistics Canada\u2019s gross domestic product numbers for the third quarter and October jobs data that will show the extent to which the economy continues to eat into its spare capacity.The reports are widely seen reinforcing market expectations for continued interest rate increases, but only gradually as the Bank of Canada tiptoes its way to more normal levels.Poloz\u2019s main message at his last Financial System Review in June \u2014 which came just before his first rate increase in seven years \u2014 was that despite an unsustainable jump in Toronto home prices earlier this year and the consequent rise in debt levels, the financial system\u2019s resilience was actually strengthening on the back of an improving economy.And since then, Canada\u2019s economy has done even better than Poloz had thought at the time.While economists expect Statistics Canada to report a slowdown to 1.8 per cent annualized growth in the third quarter, growth in the second quarter turned out to be a much stronger 4.5 per cent and the economy is on pace for 3 per cent growth for all of 2017.Toronto\u2019s housing market, meanwhile, is cooling after Ontario imposed a foreign-buyer tax and the country\u2019s main financial regulator tightened mortgage-qualification rules.Stronger economic growth and cooler housing should mean \u2014 in the eyes of policy makers \u2014 the financial system has only become more resilient over the past six months.Of course, what has changed since June is that Poloz raised the central bank\u2019s key interest rate twice, and the Bank of Canada has said it\u2019s monitoring closely how the higher borrowing costs will impact the economy. It\u2019s one of the reasons the central bank claims it will remain cautious on future hikes.But the initial signs should be comforting.A soft landing seems to be playing out in Toronto\u2019s housing market and households are hardly slowing their credit growth.Year-over-year benchmark home price gains in Toronto averaged 27 per cent in the first six months of 2017, according to the city\u2019s realtor board. Since June, that average has halved to 13.6 per cent. Vancouver\u2019s housing market underwent a similar slowdown after a foreign-buyer tax was imposed in August 2016, and is now recovering.Stronger demand and tighter supply mean the Toronto and Vancouver markets are \u201cstill on an upward trajectory, but it\u2019s on a more stable upward trajectory,\u201d said Royce Mendes, an economist at CIBC World Markets. New regulations in places like Toronto and Vancouver \u201cwill be more like a bump in the road than a car driving into a sink hole.\u201dHousehold credit data \u2014 the latest were released Friday \u2014 show year-over-year growth still hovering at the 5.5 per cent range it\u2019s averaged over the past 18 months, with consumer credit gains offsetting slowing residential loan borrowing.One issue likely to remain an area of concern is the growing share of uninsured mortgages, which is being fuelled by higher Toronto and Vancouver home prices and tighter qualification rules for insured mortgages.Specifically, the central bank said in its June FSR that it worries some home buyers are finding new ways to finance larger deposits \u2014 so-called co-lending arrangements \u2014 to skirt the tougher qualification rules. Essentially, they are borrowing to finance larger down payments.The latest data suggest the uninsured market has only gotten larger since the June FSR. As of September the number of uninsured mortgages in Canada was $662.7 billion, up 17.5 per cent from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year increase since 2004. Uninsured mortgages now represent 48 per cent of outstanding mortgages, from 36 per cent just five years earlier.Last month, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions also stepped in to make it harder for home buyers to qualify for an uninsured mortgage. The issue is likely to be top-of-mind at the central bank, if tighter regulations of the federally regulated sector are only pushing borrowers to private lenders outside of the regulated space.\u201cYou\u2019re kind of back to these non-banks and these provincially-regulated institutions apparently just skating along,\u201d said Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management. \u201cThere could be some talk about the composition of the financial sector and just where the risk is accruing. It\u2019s still a fairly serious risk.\u201dThe Bank of Canada sometimes comes under criticism for its role in fuelling all this household debt, with some suggesting the central bank should stop worrying about the impact of raising interest rates and hike more aggressively in order to curb borrowing more quickly.This month, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development flagged Canada as leading the advanced and developed world in household borrowing, and how that poses a risk to growth. Canada currently has the second-highest gross debt to income ratio in the Group of 20, the International Monetary Fund reported in October.Canada\u2019s debt addiction is frequently the subject of such warnings, yet CIBC\u2019s Mendes says they\u2019re misleading. He says the overall economic backdrop in Canada is much better than in other countries with less debt.\u201cDespite the fact that we have a high level of household debt or high ratio of household debt to income, the quality of that debt is probably pretty high compared to other nations, and that\u2019s one reason to have some confidence in Canada,\u201d he said.For example, the risks are nowhere near where they were in the U.S. before the financial crisis, according to Mendes. He says the proportion of non-prime mortgage origination is about 10 per cent of the total, compared with 33 per cent in the U.S. before the crash.\u201cSome of these international organizations make too big a deal of this one metric,\u201d Mendes said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the be all and end all of economics. It also doesn\u2019t tell you the distribution of the debt. If all the debt is held by people with really well-paying jobs and lots of money in the bank, then that doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dThe Bank of Canada publishes its Financial Stability Report on Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. in Ottawa, and Statistics Canada\u2019s releases data on GDP and the labour market Friday at 8:30 a.m.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "GDP revisions show oil shock wasn't as bad for Canada's economy as initially feared", "description": "The revisions may suggest to Bank of Canada policy makers there's even less slack in the economy than assumed, which could have implications for interest rates", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/gdp-revisions-show-oil-shock-wasnt-as-bad-for-canadas-economy-as-initially-feared", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/1124oil.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 24, 2017 8:18 AM EST", "content": "It seems Canada weathered the oil collapse better than previously thought.Numbers recently published on Statistics Canada\u2019s online database show that between 2014 and 2016, the nation\u2019s economy generated $24 billion (US$19 billion) more output in nominal terms than first estimated, according to Bloomberg calculations.\u00a0The agency\u2019s fully revised data will be officially released on Dec. 1, along with\u00a0a report on third quarter 2017 gross domestic product.In real terms \u2014 which adjust the numbers for inflation and are the more conventional marker of economic activity \u2014 the\u00a0update shows Canada\u2019s growth rate over the three-year period averaged 1.8 per cent, compared with a previous estimate of 1.7 per cent.The revisions may suggest to\u00a0Bank of Canada policy makers there\u2019s even less slack in the economy than currently assumed, which could have implications for interest rates. They also reveal an economy with a better mix of economic activity, since the changes were driven by greater-than-expected business investment, mainly construction-related.\u201cThe hit to the economy from the oil price shock was not as severe as initially estimated,\u201d Philip Cross, a research analyst with the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and former official at Statistics Canada.The update is part of annual revisions of GDP figures, and the changes aren\u2019t very large by historical standards,\u00a0particularly given the shock to the economy, Cross said. \u201cThe potential was there for a much bigger revision.\u201dEven with the upward revisions, the data still illustrate an economy that went through tough times as oil prices plunged.

Investments are seen reaching 144 billion kroner (US$18 billion) next year, up from an August estimate of 142 billion kroner, it said in a statement on Thursday. Spending this year is seen at 151 billion kroner, down from 156 billion kroner in the previous survey.While the survey now indicates a decline into 2018, that could change as companies are expected to submit final investment decisions for eight projects before the end of February, the statistics office said. The biggest are Statoil ASA\u2019s Johan Castberg and Snorre Expansion, which alone represent investments of more than 70 billion kroner over several years. The second phase of the giant Johan Sverdrup field is also expected to go forward later in 2018.\u201cIf the schedules for these plans are realized, the accumulated investment costs in 2018 from these projects will increase the investments significantly in field development, compared to the present estimate,\u201d the agency said in the statement.The revision of the 2018 spending forecast \u2014 and the potential for more \u2014 is consistent with the government\u2019s view that a three-year slump following the crude-price collapse in 2014 will bottom out this year. It also illustrates how Norway intends to profit from its position as western Europe\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer regardless of whether its sovereign wealth fund is allowed to drop fossil-fuel equities.The proposal from the central bank, which runs the fund, resonated across the world last week as an acknowledgment from one of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers of the uncertainty that weighs on that industry\u2019s future. The bank said the plan was meant as a measure to reduce risk exposure, and didn\u2019t imply any particular view of future oil prices. The heads of both Norway\u2019s oil-industry lobby and its biggest energy union said last week it was entirely possible for the country to both cut the fund\u2019s exposure to oil and bet on its own offshore industry\u2019s future.\u00a0Investments offshore Norway, western Europe\u2019s biggest producer of oil and gas, have dropped continuously from 220 billion kroner in 2014, the peak of a decade-long boom. The backlash has been rougher on oil-dependent Norway than the 2008-2009 financial crisis, with about 50,000 jobs lost in the offshore industry and unemployment reaching 20-year highs. The central bank has cut rates to record lows, while the government made its first ever withdrawals from its huge sovereign wealth fund to compensate for lower oil income and to stimulate the economy.The central bank has now signaled that it may raise interest rates again at the end of next year as the economy recovers. The government said in October when it presented its budget for next year that it expects oil investments to rise to 157 billion kroner in 2018 from 150 billion kroner in 2017.The revision of the 2018 spending forecast \u201cimplies some upside\u201d to Norges Bank\u2019s projections, Svenska Handelsbanken AB said in a note to clients on Thursday. Still, as the oil industry\u2019s share of the economy has shrunk over the past years, that\u2019s unlikely to change the central bank\u2019s outlook for gross domestic product growth enough to have a \u201cmaterial impact\u201d on the interest-rate path, it said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Mark Chediak", "title": "One of gold\u2019s biggest bulls say it will top $5,000 in five years as \u2019tsunami\u2019 of money flees risk", "description": "Canadian mining magnate Rob McEwen says the price of gold has bottomed out at $1,280 an ounce", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/mining/money-tsunami-may-spur-quadrupling-of-gold-prices-mcewen-says", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gold-bars.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 22, 2017 2:13 PM EST", "content": "Gold has bottomed out, according to one of the industry\u2019s biggest bulls.Prices could surpass US$5,000 an ounce in five years, from about US$1,280 now, as investors seek returns amid a prolonged period of cheap money and use the metal as a haven from geopolitical and financial risk, McEwen Mining Inc.

That matched the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The average of the Bank of Canada\u2019s three key core inflation measures was unchanged at 1.6 per cent, remaining at the highest since January.Persistently weak inflation has been one of the main arguments against further interest-rate increases by the Bank of Canada, after it hiked to 1 per cent this year.

She also said it\u2019s unclear just how much the increased sensitivity of indebted consumers to higher interest rates will affect spending.\u201cDuring periods of uncertainty like today, a cautious approach may be prudent,\u201d Wilkins said, adding \u201ccaution has its limits, because there are complex trade-offs involved, including those related to financial stability.\u201d\u201cOne of the motivations for caution is that inflation has been in the lower end of the inflation target bands of 1 to 3 per cent for quite some time,\u201d she said, referring to last month\u2019s decision to hold a 1 per cent policy rate.Economic literature also suggests that a central bank \u201cputs a greater weight on the downside risks when inflation is low to begin with.\u201cThere\u2019s uncertainty about the interaction between interest rate increases with recent tightening measures in the residential mortgage market,\u201d she said.\u201cWhile higher household debt has likely heightened the sensitivity of spending to interest rate increases, it is difficult at this juncture to know by how much,\u201d she said.\u201cAnother reason for caution \u2014 in this case more of a wait-and-see approach \u2014 is related to a desire to avoid having to reverse policy direction abruptly in the future.\u201dThe Bank of Canada is focused on tracking wages and potential output, the effect of two rate increases earlier this year and on trade talks, Wilkins said.Wilkins and her colleagues including Governor Stephen Poloz have said they will be cautious in further tightening after rate increases in July and September, the first in about a decade. Growth is set to slow after a burst in the first half of this year as an oil shock eased, while a stronger Canadian dollar and some one-time pressures are holding inflation below the Ottawa-based bank\u2019s 2 per cent target for longer than expected.The bank has factored in uncertainty around business investment and exports related to NAFTA negotiations, and is monitoring developments on that file closely , Wilkins said\u201cThere are also times when uncertainty can lead to caution or patience,\u201d she said. \u201cJust three weeks ago, the Bank decided to leave the policy rate unchanged.

Some 36 per cent rate his performance as poor or very poor, and another 36 per cent mark it as average.\u00a0It\u2019s a disappointing result for Trudeau given the country is on pace to lead the Group of Seven in growth with its strongest expansion since 2011. Canadians instead seem focused on rising interest rates and the deficit, which is a modest 0.9 per cent of gross domestic product.\u201cWhat this survey shows is that there is fundamental disconnect between the macroeconomic reality and micro opinion of Canadians,\u201d pollster Nik Nanos said in an interview. \u201cFor all intents and purposes, there\u2019s quite a small minority of Canadians not concerned about housing and interest rates. It\u2019s a large, dark cloud that looms over the psychology of Canadians.\u201dThe results could reflect a deeper malaise for which Trudeau\u2019s government may find no easy solutions: anxiety over housing affordability and growing piles of debt at a time when borrowing costs are rising.\u00a0Concern over debt loads could turn any interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada into a political headache for the Liberals.Other highlights of the survey include:* 40 per cent of respondents say reducing the deficit should be Trudeau\u2019s top priority with a windfall generated by strong growth. Another 21 per cent call for spending on social programs, 19 per cent prioritize infrastructure spending, 18 per cent want tax cuts for individuals and 1 per cent want tax cuts for business. * 88 per cent of Canadians are at least somewhat concerned about the price of housing. * 84 per cent are at least somewhat concerned about the gap between Canada\u2019s rich and poor, a key Trudeau economic theme. * 81 per cent are at least somewhat concerned about the ability of Canadians to pay their mortgages and debts as interest rates rise.Trudeau\u2019s team swept to power in 2015 with lofty pledges on issues such as middle-class anxiety, the environment and progress for indigenous Canadians. The poll results raise a question of whether the Liberals have set expectations too high, Nanos said.\u201cThe Liberals were quite clever before they were in government in managing expectations\u201d but have since created high expectations, the pollster said. \u201cIf they are not able to make headway after creating all those high expectations, that\u2019s when they are going to run into political turbulence. The Liberals are saying all the right things but Canadians want them to do stuff.\u201dThis year is shaping up to be the strongest for new housing starts in a decade. Excluding inflation, Canada\u2019s economy grew by 4.2 per cent in the second quarter from a year earlier, a pace not seen since 2000. Employers added 312,700 jobs over that time.The Liberals are saying all the right things but Canadians want them to do stuffEven with an anticipated second-half slowdown, Canada is headed for 3 per cent growth for all of 2017. That would end a five-year stretch of sub-3 per cent readings that\u2019s already tied as the longest on record in data back to 1926.A synchronized global recovery and rising global trade volumes are backstopping the growth, along with the bottoming out of the oil shock in western Canada and soaring home prices in Toronto and Vancouver. But there are some aspects of growth the government can take credit for. Federal deficit spending, particularly the enhanced child benefit system, has supercharged consumption \u2014 and, as such, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said the child benefit is helping spur the hot economy.The parts of Canada that have been hit hardest by the oil-price collapse \u2014 the prairies and Atlantic Canada \u2014 are the most likely to rank Trudeau as a poor economic manager. The prime minister is doing better in the regions that have prospered since he took power. The only part of the country where a plurality think the Liberals are doing a good job is Quebec, which holds the second-highest number of electoral districts in Canada.Ironically, it was Trudeau who won the economic argument in Canada\u2019s last federal election. Other polling by Nanos Research for Bloomberg ahead of the 2015 election showed 39 per cent of Canadians ranked Trudeau as the leader with the best economic platform \u2014 he was the only one that pledged deficits \u2014 compared with 33 per cent for former Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives and 16 percent for the New Democratic Party under Tom Mulcair.With Harper and Trudeau neck-and-neck in voting intentions, that Nanos survey showed how the Liberal leader had managed to erode the incumbent Conservative\u2019s long-held advantage on economic matters with a pledge to raise taxes on high-income earners and run deficits. And the difference reflected a large lead for Trudeau among women \u2014 43 per cent to 27 per cent.This month\u2019s Nanos poll shows the gender divide remains. Women are more likely than men to rate Trudeau\u2019s economic performance as very good, good or average. Women are also substantially more likely to be worried about rising interest rates \u2014 85.6 per cent are at least somewhat concerned, compared to 76.8 per cent of men.In addition, women are more likely to be concerned about the affordability of housing, and the gap between rich and poor. Reducing the deficit is still the top priority for women, though by a smaller margin than for men \u2014 33.5 per cent of women want a smaller deficit, while 24.9 per cent want more social spending, compared to 46.4 per cent and 16.4 per cent for men, respectively.The Nanos survey was compiled with responses from 1,000 Canadians polled between Nov. 4 and Nov. 7, and is considered accurate within 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.\u2013With assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Why is Canada\u2019s job market so hot when the economy is leaving us cold?", "description": "Canada is a jobs machine lately, with the longest streak of gains in more than 10 years and biggest full-time gains ever", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/largest-ever-gain-in-full-time-is-making-canada-a-jobs-machine", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/jobs.jpeg", "publishedAt": "November 3, 2017 2:04 PM EDT", "content": "Canada produced another stellar month of job gains in October, with signs of tightening that include stronger wage increases and a surge in full-time employment.\u2022 Employment increased by 35,300 (est. 15,000) \u2022 Full-time jobs were up 88,700 versus a 53,400 decline in part-time jobs \u2022 Average hourly pay gains hit 2.4 per cent, the fastest since April 2016The data reveal the expected slowing of Canada\u2019s labour market has yet to materialize, with the biggest increase in full-time employment over the past two months on record \u2014 potentially casting doubt on the Bank of Canada\u2019s contention there remains enough employment slack to keep producing non-inflationary growth.\u201cGrowth indicators for Canada have been decelerating, but you wouldn\u2019t know it looking at the labour market, where employers are still beefing up their workforce,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a note to investors.The country has now produced job gains for 11 consecutive months \u2014 the longest streak in more than a decade.

Now policy makers believe their economies are strong enough to thrive with less stimulus.The U.S. Federal Reserve made the first move in October when it started allowing a portion of bonds on its US$4.5 trillion balance sheet to mature without replacing them.

The Bank of Japan will probably keep printing money, but that won\u2019t be enough to offset a global decline in central bank stimulus, which economists see starting sometime in mid-to-late 2018.\u201cIt will worry a lot of investors, because no one\u2019s really prepared for it,\u201d says Nader Naeimi, a fund manager at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney who\u2019s boosted his cash allocation to 30 per cent in anticipation of pain in bonds and stocks. \u201cIt will hurt \u2014 you want it to hurt, otherwise financial conditions will be too loose.\u201dIn surveys, global investors identify a shift to monetary tightening as the single most likely cause of the next recession. History shows such transitions are fraught with risk. When the Fed started boosting rates in 1994, it set off the worst corporate bond slide in two decades. It also helped trigger a sudden devaluation of the Mexican peso and the ensuing Tequila Crisis.Adding to the uncertainty: Three of the world\u2019s four most important central bank chiefs are nearing the end of their terms and may be replaced. The same factors are likely to propel their successors toward reducing monetary stimulus. Most economies are posting solid growth. Job markets have returned to what policy makers deem full employment. American household incomes are at a record high. Crisis-wracked European countries such as Spain have recouped economic losses. China has shaken off fears of a debt crisis. Even Japan has pulled out of a long cycle of mini-recessions.True, central bankers haven\u2019t been hitting their inflation targets; the failure of prices to rise is one sign that growth is still subpar. But policy makers are setting that concern aside as they increasingly focus on curbing the financial excesses that could set the stage for another crash.European Central Bank: \u2018Whatever it takes\u2019European Central Bank President Mario Draghi vowed five years ago he\u2019d do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. So far it\u2019s taken more than 2 trillion euros (US$2.3 trillion). That\u2019s the amount by which he\u2019s expanded the balance sheet. On Oct. 26 the ECB announced that its bond buying will continue through September 2018, albeit at 30 billion euros a month starting in January, or half the current pace. The institution also stressed that it will reinvest proceeds from maturing debt for an extended period.European policy makers have been among the most forceful in their campaign to push down borrowing costs. They championed negative interest rates, which leave investors who choose to stash their money in government bonds with less than they started with. And unlike the Fed, which has confined its purchases to government and mortgage bonds, the ECB has also been buying corporate debt. In doing so, it\u2019s extended a lifeline to European businesses that might have otherwise been forced to retrench.That aggressiveness has never sat well with German officials, who\u2019ve traditionally favored tighter controls to keep inflation down. Draghi\u2019s term runs through October 2019. Any German candidate could have an inside track for the job, given that Europe\u2019s largest economy has never had one of its own at the helm of the region\u2019s central bank.Federal Reserve: It\u2019s Powell\u2019s Fed now The Fed pumped about US$3.6 trillion into the U.S. economy from 2008 to 2014. The link between monetary stimulus and markets was remarkably tight: More than half the gains in the S&P 500 from 2008 until the Fed started raising interest rates at the end of 2015 came on days the Fed announced policy decisions. That\u2019s why, despite Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s assurances that reducing the balance sheet will be a non-event \u2014 \u201clike watching paint dry,\u201d she said \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to rule out a sharp reaction in the markets.The Fed stopped replacing some maturing bonds in October and has effectively put the process of shrinking its balance sheet on autopilot, with the rundown in assets accelerating in stages; US$50 billion a month will be taken out of the nation\u2019s bond markets by October of next year.Yellen\u2019s four-year term as chair is up in February, and she\u2019s set to be replaced by Jerome Powell, who was nominated as her successor by President Donald Trump Thursday. Powell, a former private-equity executive who\u2019s been a Fed governor since 2012, has voted in lockstep with Yellen in gradually removing stimulus and is expected to maintain continuity in monetary policy. A Republican appointed by President Barack Obama, he\u2019s earned a reputation as non-ideological and pragmatic. He sympathizes with White House calls to ease financial regulations.Adding to the uncertainty: Three of the world's four most important central bank chiefs are nearing the end of their terms and may be replacedKuroda\u2019s five-year term ends in April. When he was nominated in 2013, his three-decade-plus tenure at the staid Finance Ministry and his optimistic, almost avuncular personality helped ensure his confirmation. Since then, he\u2019s shaken up an institution that had long been criticized for doing too little to lift Japan out of stagnation.Now it\u2019s fiscal conservatives who are peeved: They say Kuroda\u2019s easy money policies have allowed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s government to avoid wrestling down the largest public debt load in the world.Their calls for a more centrist policy are likely to go unheeded in the wake of Oct. 22 legislative elections that solidified the ruling party\u2019s hold on power. Market watchers believe that Abe, who\u2019s said he has \u201ccomplete trust\u201d in Kuroda\u2019s abilities, will reward him with an unprecedented second full term.People\u2019s Bank of China China\u2019s central bank is more opaque than its peers. Still, there\u2019s a clear consensus among China watchers that officials in 2018 are likely to intensify efforts to whittle down a record buildup of debt in the financial system since the global crisis.At the October gathering of the Communist Party leadership, President Xi Jinping reiterated that defusing financial risks is one of his top priorities. A sign of that commitment was the promotion of Liu He to the 25-member Politburo. A longtime Xi adviser on economic matters, he\u2019s been an advocate of debt reduction.Despite layers of capital controls, the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s actions can still roil markets around the globe. A surprise move in August 2015 to devalue the Chinese currency proved so unsettling that the Fed shelved a widely anticipated rate hike the following month.Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has held the job for almost 15 years. The question of who will replace him became more urgent after he hinted at the recent party congress that he\u2019s ready to retire. Even though the central bank takes instructions directly from the government, the pick for the top job still matters. Zhou\u2019s successor will have to craft a monetary policy that balances concern about the nation\u2019s debt load with support for an economy that\u2019s shifted into a slower growth track.Bloomberg News"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Bank of Canada caution on rates a mistake as debt swells, Dodge warns", "description": "Former bank governor says keeping rates low only encourages Canadians to pile on more debt, putting financial stability at risk", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/former-governor-says-poloz-caution-a-mistake-canada-eco-watch", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/bankers.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 1, 2017 9:46 AM EDT", "content": "One of Governor Stephen Poloz\u2019s predecessors says the Bank of Canada\u2019s current approach to increasing interest rates is too cautious.David Dodge, who led the Canadian central bank\u00a0between 2001 and 2008, thinks Poloz should focus more on the long-neglected issue of financial stability and take the opportunity to raise rates now that the economy is running more or less at potential. Poloz kept his benchmark rate at 1 per cent last week and indicated\u00a0he\u2019s in no rush to tighten, given that he still sees signs of wage and inflation slack.Keeping borrowing costs low will only encourage households and businesses to keep adding debt, risks that should factor in more to the central bank\u2019s decision making, Dodge said in a telephone interview.\u201cWhile I understand why they want to be cautious, and I think that\u2019s quite correct, the fact that they are not moving to deal with what is a problem in financial markets arising from this very long period of very low interest rates I think is a mistake,\u201d Dodge said.Interest rates could rise by a full percentage point and still remain well below the 3 per cent the Bank of Canada estimates is \u201cneutral\u201d for the economy \u2014 neither stimulative or contractionary.\u201cIt\u2019s not like the bank is being unreasonable,\u201d\u00a0said Dodge. \u201cTheir\u2019s would be more or less the mainstream view, whereas I put a little bit more emphasis\u201d on financial system distortions. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through earlier periods,\u201d he said, in reference to the financial crisis.While government debt levels are low, Canada has by far the most private sector debt relative to GDP in the Group of Seven.\u201cIf we think we are actually growing at about the capacity of the economy and are pretty much balanced, then indeed we should have rates that are higher than they currently are,\u201d Dodge said.In his twice-annual testimony to lawmakers Tuesday, Poloz reiterated that the central bank will be cautious in making future changes to interest rates.With growth expected to slow next year after what is shaping up to be a strong 2017, Poloz highlighted the main sources of uncertainty for the central bank, including soft inflation and wage growth, as well as high household debt. \u201cWe are at a crucial spot in the economic cycle, and significant uncertainties are clouding the way forward,\u201d he told a parliamentary committee.The fact new government spending measures, outlined last week by Finance Minister Bill Morneau, could pressure the central bank to move rates higher is already drawing opposition attention to the matter.\u201cI want to highlight the potential risks that Canada faces as interest rates inevitably begin to rise,\u201d Pierre Poilievre, the opposition Conservative Party lawmaker responsible for finance issues, said in a phone interview.\u201cWe have both growing household debt and growing government debt,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to know more about the burden that these higher rates will mean for Canadian taxpayers and families over the next decade.\u201dPoloz has cited the increased sensitivity of the economy to higher interest rates as one reason to remain cautious, but at a press conference last week he wouldn\u2019t be drawn on whether the new spending measures were stimulative.The\u00a0Bank of Canada\u2019s latest credit data show growth in debt financing is slowing from elevated levels earlier this year. Still, 2017 is on pace for the strongest year since the 2008-2009 recession.Total business and household credit in the economy reached $4.08 trillion in September, 7.2 per cent above year ago levels.The increase is mostly due to a surge in borrowing by businesses, which have increased credit by 9.1 per cent from a year ago, accounting for 60 per cent of all credit taken out in the economy over that time.That could be a good thing if it means companies are financing investments.\u00a0Since corporate borrowing is rising faster than investment, however, it may suggest instead that companies are taking on debt to fund share buybacks or higher dividends, Dodge said. The debt baton is simply being passed from one sector to another.\u201cThe bank talks about the household sector, which is worrisome,\u201d Dodge said. \u201cBut we also have a number of corporations which are overextended, which is also quite worrisome from the perspective of future macro financial stability.\u201dThe rising level of business credit may reflect a number of other things as well. According to\u00a0Doug Porter, Bank of Montreal chief economist, economic data show companies have also been ramping up inventories this year, which needs to be financed.They are also in the process of repairing income statements, after a tough couple of years of profits, and may need some debt to get investments going.\u201cWe might be at the stage of the cycle where businesses do need a bit of financing to support modest increases in capital spending,\u201d Porter said. \u201cBut perhaps a year from now as earnings grow they won\u2019t need as much external financing.\u201dSince the Oct. 25 decision and Poloz\u2019s talk of being cautious, investors have pared bets on a rate increase at the Dec. 6 meeting to a one-in-four chance, from about 50-50 early last week. Language in the statement accompanying the rate decision may have something to do with that.The Bank of Canada\u2019s rate statements often have language to describe the appropriateness of monetary policy or stimulus. Reappearing in last week\u2019s statement after a two-month absence was this phrase: the \u201ccurrent stance of monetary policy is appropriate.\u201dA variation of that phrase has appeared 21 times in Poloz\u2019s statements dating back to 2014, but only once immediately preceding a rate change \u2014 the surprise rate cut in January 2015.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Canada\u2019s economy just came back to earth  \u2014 with a bump", "description": "Everybody knew the growth spurt would end, but nobody expected it would end so sharply", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/mini-boom-ends-as-canadian-economic-growth-falls-back-to-earth", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/economy1.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 31, 2017 2:57 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s growth spurt is over.The nation\u2019s gross domestic product unexpectedly contracted in August, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday, after a flat reading in July.

The Bank of Canada projects growth of 1.8 per cent in the third quarter. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast an average 2.1 per cent expansion in the second half.The nation\u2019s currency dropped as much as 0.6 per cent to 77.42 US cents after Tuesday\u2019s report, which may fuel concern the Bank of Canada\u2019s caution about raising interest rates will only deepen.It\u2019s been quite a ride, much of it unexpected. Excluding inflation, Canada\u2019s economy grew by 4.2 per cent in the second quarter from a year earlier, a pace not seen since 2000. Employers added 312,700 jobs over that time.Even with an anticipated second-half slowdown, Canada is headed for more than 3 per cent growth for all of 2017. That would end a five-year stretch of sub-3 per cent readings that\u2019s already tied as the longest on record in data back to 1926.Most forecasters, including the Bank of Canada, expect growth to slow to below 2 per cent by 2019.A synchronized global recovery and rising global trade volumes are backstopping the growth, along with the bottoming out of the oil shock in western Canada and soaring home prices in Toronto and Vancouver. Government policy has also helped. Federal deficit spending, particularly the enhanced child benefit system, has supercharged consumption.In the process, the boom has allowed the economy to soak up all its unused resources. According to Bank of Canada estimates, the economy had been awash in excess capacity since the recession before the recent pick-up in growth.Policy makers will welcome a second-half slowdown as a preventative to overheating and rapid borrowing-cost increases. The Bank of Canada is already moving to bring borrowing costs to more normal levels, with two rate increases since July.The trick is to prevent the slowdown from gaining momentum in the other direction, especially with a number of potential headwinds on the horizon such as a possible collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement. That\u2019s why Governor Stephen Poloz indicated last week he\u2019s in no rush to tighten further.\u201cIn the wake of today\u2019s data there is the increasing probability of the next hike being delayed until 2018,\u201d Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist, said in a note to investors.Canada\u2019s dollar is down almost 6 per cent since touching 2017-highs in early September. Analysts meanwhile have been increasingly disappointed with their forecasts. The Citi surprise index for Canada, a measure of a statistic\u2019s actual result relative to its forecast, just moved into negative territory for the first time this year.Weakness is particularly evident in the trade sector.

It was the first monthly decline since October 2016 and follows a flat reading in July.The drop was led by across-the-board weakness in goods-producing industries, including a 1 per cent fall in manufacturing and a 1.4 per cent decline in oil and gas.Statistics Canada cites maintenance shutdowns in manufacturing and conventional oil for decline.The Canadian dollar weakened against its U.S. counterpart after the disappointing data further dampened prospects of another Bank of Canada interest rate hike this year.Most analysts are anticipating a slowdown in the second half of this year after growth was running at a 4 per cent clip in the first six months of 2017. Tuesday\u2019s numbers suggest there could be a more pronounced drop than expected.If the economy fails to post gains in September, third quarter annualized growth would be on pace for a sub-2 per cent increase.

But while there is no debate that today\u2019s soft reading is a surprise and a disappointment, there were some special factors involved, including a monster mash of maintenance shutdowns. And, keep in mind that even with a two-month dip, the economy has still managed to grow 3.5% in the past year, and at that same strong pace over the past six months. We continue to expect something closer to 2% over the next year. Today\u2019s soft reading will reinforce the Bank of Canada\u2019s new-found caution, keeping them on hold well into 2018 (we are still calling for March for the next hike).\u201dThere were positives in the data, with 12 out of 20 sub-sectors posting gains. Services-producing industries posted a 0.1 per cent increase.Non-durable manufacturing fell 2 per cent, with chemical producers posting a 7.3 per cent drop, the largest in the last 20 years. Statistics Canada cited \u201cplant maintenance shutdowns and lower demand from export markets\u201d for the drop.Shutdowns in Newfoundland impacted conventional oil and gas production, which was down 5.2 per cent in August.The real estate broker industry posted its first gain in five months, up 0.3 per cent.

Whether it\u2019s NAFTA, real estate, consumer debt \u2014 all those things are negatives to Canada\u2019s economy.\u201dAfter wallowing in the red for a good chunk of the year, the S&P/TSX has gained 6.5 per cent since its September low. That strength is the result of improving oil prices, rising interest rates which have fattened banks\u2019 lending margins and, perhaps most important, a market that had simply become too cheap to ignore.The S&P/TSX\u2019s gains since\u00a0Sept. 8 surpass a 4.9 per cent increase in the S&P 500 Index and a 3.6 per cent gain in the MSCI World Index. This is a reversal from the first eight months of the year, when the Canadian benchmark fell 0.5 per cent compared with a 10 per cent gain for the S&P 500 and a 12 per cent increase for the MSCI World Index.Even with its recent gains, the Canadian index is way behind its U.S. counterparts, which have hit a series of record highs this year. The year-to-date gain for the S&P/TSX is just 4.4 per cent versus 15 per cent for the S&P 500.

Belski\u2019s year-end target for the S&P/TSX is 16,000, a gain of just 0.3 per cent from here, although he says that may be conservative.\u201cI think people are genuinely negative Canadian stocks and it\u2019s a classic game of catch up,\u201d he said in an interview, adding that investors need to ditch their obsession with commodities. \u201cAll they really care about is gold and oil, gold and oil, and if those two things are going up we feel better. We\u2019ve got great companies in Canada but we consider ourselves a failure unless gold and oil are going up.\u201dBelski recommends an overweight position in Canadian financials, industrials and materials. He likes the big banks, insurers, railways and individual stocks including West Fraser Timber Co., Waste Connections Inc., Canadian Tire Corp., Dollarama Inc. and Loblaw Cos.Belski\u2019s view is supported by technical analysis. The $1.7 billion Horizon S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF recently formed a golden cross, meaning the short-term moving average has broken above the long-term moving average \u2014 a buy signal.\u00a0Others are more reticent. Javed Mirza, technical analyst at Canaccord Genuity Corp., said the S&P/TSX seems overbought and predicted a near-term pause or pullback. The index \u201cmay hit an air pocket sooner rather than later\u201d if investors don\u2019t embrace commodity stocks, because financials can\u2019t carry the rally forever, added Martin Roberge, portfolio strategist at Canaccord.TD Asset Management, meanwhile, is underweight Canadian equities on the expectation that the economy will underperform the U.S. due to high household debt, modest oil prices and low productivity.\u201cAll that says to me that the Canadian economy should slow a little bit, while the U.S. economy looks like it\u2019s in pretty good shape,\u201d Bruce Cooper, who manages $344 billion as chief investment officer of TD Asset Management, said in an interview this week. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a preference for global equities over Canadian this year, and that continues to be the case.\u201dSun Life\u2019s Adatia is also worried about tapped-out consumers, a deflating housing market and the risk that NAFTA renegotiations could fall apart.

Trump, who\u2019d be bucking conservatives in his own party if he opts to reappoint Yellen, has said he\u2019ll decide by Nov. 3 who to nominate as Fed chair when her term ends in February.The president, in a lunch meeting with Senate Republicans on Tuesday, asked for a show of hands in support of Yellen and other contenders for the job \u2014 Stanford University economist John Taylor and Fed governor Jerome Powell. He didn\u2019t announce a winner and most of the senators didn\u2019t raise their hands. But of those who did, \u201cI think Taylor won,\u201d said Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.Confidence in the central bank is critical for continued economic growth and job creation, something Trump frequently claims as an accomplishment. The president also often touts the stock market\u2019s boom since his election, a run that could be threatened should financial markets perceive him to be seeking a change in direction at the Fed.Under Yellen, unemployment was at 4.2 per cent in September, a 16-year low, and the economy is in its ninth year of expansion.

Trump, who\u2019d be bucking conservatives in his own party if he opts to reappoint Yellen, has said he\u2019ll decide by Nov. 3 who to nominate as Fed chair when her term ends in February.The president, in a lunch meeting with Senate Republicans on Tuesday, asked for a show of hands in support of Taylor, Powell and Yellen.

In commodity-rich Latin America, the 90-day correlation between currencies and oil turned negative last month for the first time since 2014.Commodity currencies are typically more correlated with oil when it is falling because a decline in prices often indicates a drop in demand, which is disproportionately damaging to energy-dependent economies. The link rose during the 2015-16 oil price slump, but now that foreign exchange traders have adapted to the new normal of oil below US$60 a barrel, monetary policy and idiosyncratic factors have taken precedence for exchange-rate moves.\u201cBig movements in the commodity are associated with big movements in the terms of trade, which then should have currency consequences,\u201d said Colin Harte, a London-based fund manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management. \u201cThough people get excited about commodities being the dominant driver of the currency, the commodity only plays a part at certain times when there are big movements.\u201dRussian Ruble Inflows from investors lured by one of the highest real yields among developing nations have trumped oil as the most important driver of the ruble this year.\u00a0An expected 25 basis-point rate cut this week to 8.25 percent is unlikely to dent its carry-trade appeal, according to Anders Svendsen, an analyst at Nordea Bank A/S in Copenhagen, who thinks it will take significant rate cuts for the oil correlation to rise.\u201cOil is still an important driving factor for the ruble given that Russia is one of the biggest commodity exporters,\u201d said Piotr Matys, a London-based strategist at Rabobank. \u201cHowever, there will be periods when its influence on the ruble varies. The ruble is less responsive when oil is going up, but if prices fall sharply, it will have a stronger impact.\u201dCanadian DollarThe Canadian dollar\u2019s link with crude has been falling sharply since the end of June, spurred by the central bank raising interest rates for the first time since 2010. The currency\u2019s 90-day correlation with WTI crude is now at the lowest level in almost three years.The break is a reflection of the increased importance of central bank policy and Canadian dollar volatility rather than the declining importance of the oil sector in the domestic economy, according to Shaun Osborne, a currency strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto. The link will come back into force if oil breaks out of the range of about US$40-US$60 a barrel it has been trading in all year, he said.The Canadian dollar steadied against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday as oil prices rose, with the currency holding near a two-month low touched earlier in the day as investors braced for a Bank of Canada interest rate decision on Wednesday. The Canadian dollar was nearly unchanged at $1.2643 to the greenback, or 79.10 U.S. cents in early morning trading.Meanwhile, Brent crude, the global benchmark, was up 73 cents or 1.3 per cent to US$58.10 a barrel by noon, while U.S. crude gained 52 cents or 1 per cent to US$52.42.Norwegian KroneStronger-than-expected growth in the economy of western Europe\u2019s biggest oil producer has boosted the appeal of the krone in recent months, helping to diminish its vulnerability to oil moves. Still, the currency is unlikely to go much higher from here unless the central bank announces a long-awaited interest rate increase, according to Kristoffer Kjaer Lomholt, an analyst at Danske Bank AS. That means the krone is now more sensitive to oil price declines than rises, he said.Latin AmericaLatin America is where the break between currencies and the oil price is at the most extreme, so much so that they are now moving in a different direction.\u00a0Instead, geopolitics and U.S. monetary policy have dominated this year, according to You-Na Park, a Frankfurt-based currency strategist at Commerzbank AG.Nafta talks have whipsawed the Mexican peso and corruption allegations have dented demand for the Brazilian real. Venezuela is on the brink of default, and high real interest rates in some countries in the region have kept the currencies cushioned with capital inflows.Bloomberg NewsWith a file from @ Thomson Reuters 2017"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Justin Trudeau and Stephen Poloz are on a collision course", "description": "What stimulus should be removed first \u2014 monetary or fiscal?", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/justin-trudeau-and-stephen-poloz-are-on-a-collision-course", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/trudeau1.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 24, 2017 12:28 PM EDT", "content": "Canadians only get six major economic \u201creport cards\u201d from federal policy makers every year \u2014 four quarterly monetary policy reports from the Bank of Canada, a federal budget typically early in the new year and a fiscal update some time in fall.So, it\u2019s rare when these releases juxtapose as they will this week with Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u2019s update Tuesday, and Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz\u2019s MPR Wednesday. It\u2019s fitting too, given fiscal and monetary policy in Canada are potentially on a collision course.The two reports will essentially tell the same story about the economy \u2014 that it\u2019s on the strongest footing in years. Policy makers will get the opportunity to crow: both fiscal and monetary policy have clearly played key roles in the economy\u2019s recent success. The federal government is expected to spend some of the additional revenue on programs, including its marquee Canada Child Benefit.Yet the economic strength also poses new challenges. For one, it makes the case for deficits less compelling, since the spending threatens to crowd out other parts of the economy. In fact, any additional federal stimulus could trigger further interest rate increases.\u201cWith the economy near full capacity, any fiscal stimulus is likely to be inflationary \u2014 prompting an offsetting response from the Bank of Canada,\u201d Josh Nye, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada, wrote in a preview of the update. \u201cWe think the government\u2019s improved fiscal position would be put to better use by returning to a balanced budget.\u201dGovernment AssistanceOver the past year, Canada\u2019s economy has been running at a pace rarely seen in the past couple of decades, rapidly eliminating spare capacity and prompting the central bank to raise interest rates twice since July. Economists are projecting 3.1 per cent growth in 2017, easily the best in the Group of Seven.A synchronized global recovery and rising trade volumes are backstopping the growth. The bottoming of the oil shock in western Canada is also helping, along with rising industrial production in developed economies and soaring home prices in Toronto and Vancouver. Government policy has also helped. Federal deficit spending, particularly the enhanced child benefit system, has undeniably been fueling consumption.The bottom line, documents Tuesday will probably show, could be $50 billion less in cumulative deficits over the next five years, absent any new spending measures from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals. Essentially, the economy is telling policy makers it doesn\u2019t need as much stimulus as it did only six months ago.Who First?That poses a problem for an administration that has put government at the forefront of its economic agenda. The Bank of Canada meanwhile is going through a similar exercise, and taking advantage of growth to bring interest rates back to something approaching normal. Investors are betting another rate increase is in the cards by January, though not this week, after two hikes since July.The dilemma becomes what stimulus should be removed first \u2014 monetary or fiscal?A case can be made for bigger government combined with more higher borrowing costs. There\u2019s an economic case for redistributing income more fairly and financing productivity-enhancing infrastructure, if the government could figure out how to get money out the door for those projects.Tuesday\u2019s update will contain new measures including the expansion of child benefits, according to a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Last week Trudeau unveiled a cut to the small-business tax rate that will lower revenue by about $2.9 billion over five years, beginning in 2017-18.More \u2018Firepower\u2019Larger government deficits, coupled with less private debt and tighter monetary policy could even be seen as a stabilizing force for an economy with record household leverage.Trudeau\u2019s Liberals have already taken the political lumps for deficits. They might as well enjoy the spoils.\u201cTo the extent that fiscal policy undertakes actions that provide a little bit more firepower to the economy, it gives the bank greater flexibility in terms of raising interest rates and trying to impact household spending and borrowing behavior,\u201d Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia and a former finance department official, said by phone from Toronto.But such a scenario \u2014 even if it was desirable or politically feasible \u2014 isn\u2019t in the cards partly because it requires a level of coordination between the government and the central bank that currently doesn\u2019t exist.Instead, expect a heavy dose of caution, centered on looming risks. These could range from the collapse of Nafta to the slowdown of Toronto and Vancouver housing markets or even another U.S. recession.For Morneau and the governing Liberals, heightened uncertainty can be used to argue against rushing to balance or taking up fiscal leeway.The Bank of Canada is likely to use some of the same arguments for remaining circumspect on rates.Bloomberg"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Toronto\u2019s housing market is \u2018puzzling\u2019 the experts \u2014 and that\u2019s worrying", "description": "A CMHC study commissioned by Ottawa finds 75% of Vancouver's price gains are tied to fundamentals, versus 40% in Toronto, suggesting the Ontario city is an isolated trouble spot", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/why-trudeaus-fight-to-cool-toronto-housing-is-an-uphill-battle?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/housing.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 6, 2017 11:16 AM EDT", "content": "Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government has been under pressure to rein in runaway home prices, but a study by the national housing agency suggests the prime minister will struggle to exert control over the real estate market in Canada\u2019s largest city.Conventional economic factors including population, incomes and borrowing costs accounted for less than half of the 40 per cent surge in Toronto home prices between 2010 and 2016, according to a Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. study obtained by Bloomberg through a freedom of information request. Supply constraints, and to a lesser extent speculation and investment, accounted for most of the rest of the gains, although a lack of high-quality data about the availability of land made firm conclusions hard to draw.The report details the \u201cpuzzling\u201d dynamics of the Toronto market and suggests factors other than demand are driving prices higher, leaving Trudeau few options to ease the affordability crisis. It may also mean more needs to be done to promote supply and curb speculation, issues more readily dealt with at the municipal level.\u201cWhile price increases in Vancouver have largely been supported by economic fundamentals, a more puzzling result points to the state of the Toronto market, where fundamentals haven\u2019t been as strong,\u201d CMHC analysts said in the 134-page study prepared for Families Minister Jean-Yves Duclos.Duclos commissioned the review in June 2016 and has sought further updates for a final version expected soon that will help shape a new national housing strategy, his spokesman Mathieu Filion said by email. \u201cThis is an important report as Minister Duclos has said on many occasions that we are missing important data on housing and all good policies need to be developed with valid data,\u201d Filion said.Trudeau, who has repeatedly pointed to an affordability crisis in Toronto and Vancouver, gave Duclos marching orders to look into how to fix the problem. The minister\u2019s role will include \u201cundertaking a review of escalating home prices in high-priced housing markets and considering all policy tools that could keep home ownership within reach for more Canadians,\u201d according to Duclos\u2019 mandate letter from the prime minister.The report backs up Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz\u2019s view that interest rates aren\u2019t the best tool for dealing with potential housing bubbles. CMHC found about three-quarters of Vancouver\u2019s price gains were tied to fundamentals, versus 40 per cent in Toronto, suggesting the latter city is an isolated trouble spot, another argument against using monetary policy, which has widespread effects, to bring prices down.Wealth and income inequality are likely important drivers for the large price moves in higher-priced detached homes, the report said, because industries that cluster in big cities and offer high-paying jobs can feed the prices for the more expensive properties.The supply side also offered important clues. The stock of housing in Toronto and Vancouver was much less responsive, or what economists call elastic, to rising prices, the report said. \u201cSupply challenges including land supply and zoning regulation emerge as factors that contribute particularly to high priced markets.\u201dThere are also few signs that builders are in a genuine struggle to keep pace with rising demand, which would typically lead to a surge in provincial construction wage rates.Another possible driver of rising single-family home prices may be that geographical constraints have driven up land prices, encouraging builders to switch development to higher-density options such as condominiums.CMHC cautioned against making firm conclusions in some of these areas because of a lack of reliable data around trends such as foreign ownership. Most of the report\u2019s conclusions and recommendations were redacted under provisions in the access to information law that exempts advice to ministers. However, the end result is that governments are left with uncomfortable choices, the agency found.The early draft sent to Duclos in December was released for an academic peer review that\u2019s still underway, CMHC spokesman Jonathan Rotondo said by phone. The Ottawa-based agency insured $496 billion of residential loans as of June 30.Toronto home prices are already declining by the most since 2000 after the provincial government introduced a foreign buyer tax in April. Benchmark prices are down 8 per cent since May. Even with that slide, they\u2019ve doubled since 2009.The International Monetary Fund and UBS Group AG, among others, have warned about the risks posed by Toronto\u2019s overvalued real estate market and the dangers of speculation.\u201cNo one simple measure emerges as an obvious candidate for addressing the challenges posed by high-priced markets,\u201d CMHC said in the report.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Steve Matthews", "title": "Trump's short list for Fed chair features these hawks and doves", "description": "Fed Chair Janet Yellen, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell and former Governor Kevin Warsh are among the possibilities", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trumps-short-list-for-fed-chair-features-these-hawks-and-doves", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/federal-reserve.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 5, 2017 1:39 PM EDT", "content": "Here\u2019s a look at the candidates President Donald Trump is considering over the next few weeks\u00a0to nominate as chairman of the Federal Reserve and where they stand on monetary policy.Trump has met with Fed Chair Janet Yellen, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell and\u00a0former Governor Kevin Warsh as he considers his choice to head the U.S. central bank, three people familiar with the discussions said last week.\u00a0Stanford University economist John Taylor is also on the list of recommendations put together by Trump\u2019s advisers. There\u2019s no clear front-runner and outlier candidates haven\u2019t been ruled out.Trump has said he expects to make a decision on the Fed-chair search this month. That\u2019ll kick off a months-long process of Senate confirmation before Yellen\u2019s current term expires in February.\u00a0Hawk or Dove?\u00a0Yellen, 71, has had a track record of keeping rates low over her four-year term. She has consistently supported gradually tightening policy and gradually unwinding the balance sheet. Yellen has been a \u201csuper-dove,\u201d though \u201csprouting a few hawk feathers,\u201d Amherst Pierpont Securities Chief Economist Stephen Stanley said.Last month, Yellen said it\u2019s uncertain exactly why inflation has been running below the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target \u2014 which it has mostly missed for the past five years. Weak inflation \u201cstrengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments\u201d in rates.Regulatory Views: Yellen has defended stricter banking rules introduced after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. \u201cAny adjustments to the regulatory framework should be modest,\u201d she said in August.Pros: Trump told the Wall Street Journal in July that he favors low rates, adding: Yellen has\u00a0\u201chistorically been a low-interest-rate person.\u201dCons: Yellen is a Democrat appointed by Barack Obama who\u2019s led the regulatory policies the Trump administration is seeking to change. She\u2019s an academic, while the administration has preferred installing business people into top positions.Hawk or Dove? From the little we know, Cohn would likely be at least as dovish as Yellen. In 2015 when Cohn was still president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., he questioned Yellen\u2019s plan to hike rates, saying she had \u201cno legitimate argument to raise rates without inflation being close to \u2014 or having some inkling that it\u2019s approaching \u2014 2 per cent.\u201d Cohn, 57, has criticized the Fed\u2019s move toward transparency, arguing in a March 2016 speech that the central banks\u2019 \u201cvery definitive forward guidance has gotten the markets very confused.\u201dRegulatory Views: In February, Cohn said rolling back regulations is a central priority\u00a0for the White House. \u201cWe need to deregulate and cut down the regulatory process to grow jobs in this country.\u201dPros: Cohn, who has helped lead the president\u2019s drive on a tax overhaul, would seem to meet Trump\u2019s twin goals of wanting low interest rates and pushing deregulation. Most Republican policy makers are more hawkish, by contrast.Cons: Cohn\u2019s prospects have dimmed after he publicly criticized remarks the president made in the wake of racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Cohn was at Goldman when the firm engaged in some of the era\u2019s most controversial trades, and he helped manage the firm\u2019s pre-crisis bet against the housing market. That background would be sure to be scrutinized in any congressional hearings.Hawk or Dove?\u00a0The Fed governor was rated as neutral on monetary policy by the Bloomberg Intelligence Fed Spectrometer. He\u2019s never dissented on the Federal Open Market Committee since taking office in 2012. A survey of 30 economists in March found he was slightly more dovish than average Fed central bankers.Powell, 64, in August presaged comments by Yellen that the softness in inflation this year was a \u201cmystery\u201d and said the low price readings allowed the Fed to be patient in raising interest rates. He also privately voiced skepticism of the third round of asset purchases \u2013 known as quantitative easing \u2013\u00a0launched in 2012, but ended up voting for the initiative championed by then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.Regulatory Views: Powell this month said he wants to preserve gains from post-crisis reforms, though \u201cwe can do it more efficiently. That\u2019s the process we are actively engaged in right now.\u201dPros: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin favors Powell, according to Politico. \u201cPowell has Republican credentials, knows the board and FOMC well\u201d and \u201chas impressed with his grasp of monetary economics,\u201d Deutsche Bank Chief Economist Peter Hooper wrote in a report.Cons: Powell\u2019s continuity might not be as appealing as a bigger Fed overhaul for the Trump administration. Powell \u201cappears to largely support\u201d the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that increased regulations in the financial industry, which conflicts with plans by this administration on scaling back rules, Capital Economics Chief U.S. Economist Paul Ashworth wrote in a report.Hawk or Dove?\u00a0The former Fed governor is among the most hawkish of the contenders. In January, Warsh said the Fed was close to achieving its goals of maximum employment and price stability. \u201cTell me again why interest rates seem to be so far away\u201d from the historical target,\u00a0Warsh\u00a0said.Warsh, 47, has said central bankers should be concerned about elevated asset prices. \u201cI see way too much complacency,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I see volatility measures in the stock market and bond market at historic lows, if I were a central banker, I wouldn\u2019t take comfort from that.\u201d As a Fed governor, he opposed the second round of quantitative easing, then voted to support the stimulus to provide a greater consensus behind Bernanke.Regulatory Views: He co-wrote a commentary in July supporting the Trump administration\u2019s plans for higher growth in part by reducing regulations. He has said Fed regulation \u201cnow micromanages big banks and effectively caps their rate of return.\u201dPros: His regulatory views fit closely to Trump\u2019s so he would be more likely to overhaul rules as opposed to fine-tuning them. While less dovish than Yellen, \u201cWarsh has never seemed doctrinaire on rates,\u201d said\u00a0Amherst Pierpont\u2019s Stanley. Warsh\u00a0also has a personal connection. He\u2019s married to Jane Lauder, daughter of Trump friend Ronald Lauder and a global brand president at the cosmetic company founded by her grandmother, Estee Lauder.Cons: He\u2019s the youngest and least experienced of the contenders. His concerns about inflation as a Fed governor have proven to be misplaced, as\u00a0inflation has undershot the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent goal. His candidacy has attracted opposition from left-leaning activists, particularly for his cheerleading prior to the financial crisis of Wall Street innovations.Hawk or Dove?\u00a0He\u2019s likely among the most hawkish of the contenders. Taylor created a widely cited rule for setting interest rates that\u2019s named after him. The 70-year-old has called for rules-based policies and argued the Fed has engaged in too much discretion. He\u2019s also argued the Fed\u2019s unconventional policies, including asset purchases, haven\u2019t work. \u201cThe Federal Reserve is a little behind the curve\u201d in raising rates, Taylor said in January.A strict adherence to the so-called Taylor Rule would have required the Fed to hold interest rates higher during most of Yellen\u2019s four-year term, though its policy prescription varies a lot depending on what assumptions are made about the economy\u2019s potential rate of growth.Regulatory Views: Taylor has argued less regulation is key to pro-growth policies. \u201cTo turn the economy around we need to take the muzzle off, and that means regulatory reform, tax reform, budget reform, and monetary reform,\u201d he wrote in his blog.Pros: Taylor has served in four presidential administrations. He was part of the Council of Economic Advisers under Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush. George W. Bush named him undersecretary for international affairs at the Treasury. His Taylor Rule has been widely quoted by leading central bankers including those at the Fed.Cons: \u201cThe various iterations of the Taylor policy rule almost certainly would mean higher rates,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence economists wrote in report. \u201cIf Trump wants to push for 3 per cent GDP growth, Taylor will almost certainly make the task all the more challenging.\u201dBloomberg"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Canada's public pension funds are piling on leverage \u2014 and risk, warns Moody\u2019s", "description": "Canada\u2019s public pension funds, among the biggest in the world, are piling on risk with leveraged bets in a chase for higher returns, Moody\u2019s Investors Service warns.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/canadas-pension-funds-are-piling-on-leverage-moodys-warns-2", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/0921pension2.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 4, 2017 3:23 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s public pension funds, among the biggest in the world, are piling on risk with leveraged bets in a chase for higher returns, Moody\u2019s Investors Service warns.The nation\u2019s six biggest pension funds have increased their average leverage to 24 per cent, from 19 per cent in 2009, in an effort to offset the impact of declining pension member contributions and low interest rates on their cash flow and investment returns, Moody\u2019s said in an Oct. 3 report written by analyst Jason Mercer. That\u2019s leaving the funds exposed to volatility in the returns they\u2019re counting on to fund future pension payouts.\u201cThey are definitely taking on more risk, and the question I ask them is, \u2018Why take on more risk if you don\u2019t need to?\u2019\u201d Mercer said by phone from Toronto. \u2018Why not just invest in very low-risk securities and not worry about volatility?\u201dLong-term interest rates in developed countries are currently about half the 4 per cent real return pension plans need to remain sustainable. Canada\u2019s biggest pension funds have been targeting returns in the double-digits with their use of leverage and investments in illiquid assets such as real estate, infrastructure, and private equity, to compensate for a lower ratio of active members to retirees drawing benefits, Mercer said.These strategies leave pension funds more exposed to potential macroeconomic shocks such as a weaker Canadian dollar or drops in equity or credit markets, Mercer said.To be sure, Canadian pension plans have the financial strength and ability to take on risk, and Moody\u2019s doesn\u2019t see a credit-rating impact from the increased leverage anytime soon, Mercer said. If a pension fund\u2019s leverage ratio were to increase above 50 per cent, Moody\u2019s would no longer rate the fund higher than its government sponsor, he said.Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan has the highest leverage, 33 per cent, due to their large constituency of teachers retiring early and living longer, according to Moody\u2019s.\u201cAs a pension plan, we focus by necessity on our asset-liability balance,\u201d OTPP spokeswoman Deborah Allan said in an email. \u201cLeverage is key in our portfolio construction as we manage our asset mix and reduce our liability risk.\u201dMany Canadian pension funds, which were among the first to establish private equity arms to take active stakes in businesses in 1990s, have set up in-house hedge funds to invest in more complex derivatives like forwards, swaps and options while also employing debt strategies.The combined assets of Canada\u2019s six largest pension funds nearly doubled to almost $1.4 trillion between 2011 and 2016, according to Moody\u2019s. Investment income was the largest contributor to growth, with combined earnings contributing more than C$400 billion over the past five years.Allocation to illiquid, non-public assets increased to 34 per cent in 2016 from about 31 per cent in 2010, according to Moody\u2019s. A risk with these assets is that they rely on assumptions about their value, which can only be determined once the asset is sold and adds uncertainty to portfolio performance, Mercer said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Canada\u2019s GDP stall shows housing is becoming drag on the economy", "description": "Canada's surging economy took a pause in July, data showed today, ending an eight-month stretch of gains", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-gdp-unchanged-in-july-on-oil-slump-key-takeaways", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/house22.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 29, 2017 10:09 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s surging economy took a pause in July, amid slumping oil and automobile production, and as a slowing housing market curbed construction and banking.GDP was little changed, ending an eight-month stretch of gains for Canada\u2019s economy.

The above potential growth is soaking up all the remaining excess capacity in the economy, prompting the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates twice since July.Even with very little growth in August and September, Canada\u2019s economy would still probably be poised to grow at a rate of 2 per cent or more in the third quarter.Monthly growth has averaged 0.4 per cent in the previous eight months, the best stretch of growth since at least 2010.The figures seem to show the slump in housing has become a drag.

Instead, he hailed the merits of transfers to families, a tax cut to middle-income earners and infrastructure spending.\u201cI would say we\u2019re very much on track,\u201d Morneau said in a televised interview with Erik Schatzker from Bloomberg\u2019s Ottawa office. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a really positive trajectory, what we\u2019ve said to people is we\u2019re going to remain fiscally prudent, we\u2019re going to continue to lower the amount of debt as a function of our GDP.\u201dThe government\u2019s main fiscal objective will be to lower the debt-to-output ratio, he said. Deficits coming in less than initially projected are a testament to his administration\u2019s fiscal \u201cprudence,\u201d he added.Last fiscal year\u2019s deficit came in at about $18 billion \u2014 or more than $11 billion less than initially budgeted \u2014 and this year\u2019s $28.5 billion projected gap is poised to be below target by a similar magnitude. Canada\u2019s spending gap is less than 1 per cent of GDP, the lowest among the Group of Seven nations after Germany, Morneau said.The pick-up in economic growth poses a challenge for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals, who have put government spending at the forefront of their economic agenda. While a strong economy that has returned to full capacity is good news, it makes the case for deficits less compelling, since the spending threatens to crowd out other parts of the economy. The growth is already fueling a stronger dollar and higher interest rates.Morneau was bullish on the economy\u2019s ability to withstand the currency surge. Canada\u2019s dollar, known as the loonie, is up 8.9 per cent against the U.S. dollar this year, among the best performers for major currencies.\u201cThe current state of the dollar is a reflection of our positive economy, and that\u2019s something that we expect as a ramification of doing well,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cBut we think that we can continue to be successful with that level of the dollar. It will clearly mean that we\u2019ll have to continue to invest in productivity so that businesses are successful.\u201dMorneau signaled the nation\u2019s growth rate \u2014 which came in at 4.5 per cent annualized in the second quarter \u2014 can continue to be strong, despite some one-time factors that have contributed to the economy. He said a tax cut for those earning between roughly $45,000 to $90,000, and increased child-benefit payments, have injected money into the economy.\u201cWhile we can\u2019t argue exactly what the rate will be on a sustained basis, we\u2019ve done some things that have changed the trajectory,\u201d he said.One example of how the government is trying to improve the economy\u2019s long-term performance, while making the system more fair, is through proposed tax reforms aimed at high-income earners who incorporate to lower their tax bills, Morneau said. The measures have stirred outcry since being proposed in July.\u201cWe\u2019ve got some advantages that go only to a small subset of wealthy Canadians,\u201d he said, adding the government also wants to be sure the tax system creates incentives for \u201cpeople to invest in their active business.\u201dBank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has twice tightened monetary policy this year. Morneau said the rate hikes are \u201can expected outcome\u201d of a strong economy, with the two increases \u201cjust really taking off the reduction that was put in place by our central bank governor when we had really a significant decrease in oil prices.\u201d Nonetheless, he said rates remain at \u201cpretty historically low\u201d levels.\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be some headwinds, but things, as I say, they\u2019re positive right now and the increase in rates is a reflection of that positive economic situation,\u201d the finance minister said.Risks remain for the Canadian economy. At the same conference, economists warned record high consumer debt could undermine the nation\u2019s ability to recover. There are the negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement that could end badly. Trade tensions heightened late Tuesday after the U.S. Commerce Department imposed duties on Bombardier Inc. Rival Boeing Co. accused the Canadian company of selling jets at less than fair value.Aubrey Basdeo, head of Canadian fixed income at BlackRock, said at the conference that Canada is essentially running twin deficits \u2014 current account and budget \u2014 that could undermine investor confidence. He\u2019s disillusioned that the money is being spent on things that spur \u201cconspicuous\u201d consumption rather than long-term growth.Morneau acknowledged there\u2019s uncertainty in the outlook, but signaled it was all the more reason to spend rather than push to return to surplus.\u201cI\u2019m always going to worry and think about what risks might be around the corner,\u201d the minister said. \u201cBut the other part of the job is is to make sure we\u2019re doing the things that can enhance our long-term growth.\u201dThe country has a low total debt load relative to other countries, he said. \u201cHaving that great balance sheet is an advantage.\u201dMorneau will have a chance to pitch his economic vision \u2014 cash transfers to lower earners, higher taxes on higher earners and a focus on infrastructure spending \u2014 to his G-7 colleagues next year when Canada chairs the group of nations. He said his G-7 agenda will be \u201cvery aligned\u201d with his domestic one, including a focus on next-generation jobs.\u201cWe\u2019re going to think about how do we build an ability for countries to think about education and training and retraining,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cWhat are the approaches that we need to take to make sure that citizens feel engaged, and part of the work force, and part of the economy for the long-term? That\u2019s a key theme.\u201dBloomberg "}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Fed seen staying on track for December rate increase: Survey", "description": "Economists widely expect Fed officials to begin winding down their US$4.5 trillion balance sheet in October", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-seen-staying-on-track-for-december-rate-increase-survey", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/nybz101-ap1.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 19, 2017 1:03 PM EDT", "content": "By Christopher Condon and Catarina SaraivaThe Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting this week while staying on track to lift its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point in December, according to a Bloomberg survey of 42 economists.Results of the survey, conducted September 12-14, showed economists also widely expect Fed officials to begin winding down their US$4.5 trillion balance sheet in October, and will announce that timing at 2 p.m. Wednesday after their two-day meeting in Washington.\u201cWhile transitory factors may stay the Fed\u2019s hand in the short-term, the path to normalization of the fed funds target range should continue in December,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West, in San Francisco.Concern the Fed might delay a third rate hike this year following a spate of weak inflation readings eased after the consumer price index rose 1.9 per cent in the 12 months through August. Just 20 per cent of survey respondents said the risks for growth and inflation lie mainly to the downside, the lowest in a Bloomberg survey since March.In line with that, 75 per cent of respondents said the Fed wouldn\u2019t change its post-meeting statement to reflect growing concerns over inflation, up from 67 per cent in a July survey.\u201cThe recent CPI number may have provided some confirmation that things aren\u2019t as bad as people feared,\u201d said James Orlando, a senior economist at TD Bank in Toronto.Respondents say the Fed will slightly shift the projected path of rates when they release an updated set of quarterly economic projections following the FOMC meeting. Economists said the Fed will still pencil in three hikes for 2018, but with the first of those not projected until June, versus March in the Fed\u2019s previous set of forecasts.Economists also lowered the level at which they expect rates to crest in this tightening cycle to 2.75 per cent from 3 per cent, with that peak seen coming in the fourth quarter of 2019. They also expect Fed officials to trim their estimate for the long-run rate of unemployment to a median 4.5 per cent from 4.6 per cent.The long-run rate represents the level below which officials believe unemployment becomes inflationary. A lower estimate of long-run unemployment could explain why low unemployment hasn\u2019t yet triggered higher inflation, and justify the Fed keeping rates low to run the economy a little hotter.Unemployment has dropped near to a 16-year low of 4.4 per cent, while the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge of 12-month inflation has remained under its 2 per cent target for most of the last five years. During that same period, the Fed\u2019s estimate of long-run unemployment has dropped almost a full percentage point.Bloomberg "}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "World's biggest wealth fund hits US$1 trillion as dollar sinks", "description": "The fund says it doesn't make sense to have more diversification in a world in which prices and rates are converging", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/worlds-biggest-wealth-fund-hits-1-trillion-as-dollar-sinks-1", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/0603_biz_wire_norwaya.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 19, 2017 12:19 PM EDT", "content": "By Mikael Holter in Oslo and Sveinung SleireOSLO \u2014 Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund hit US$1 trillion for the first time on Tuesday, driven higher by climbing stock markets and a weaker U.S. dollar.The milestone valuation was reached for the first time on Sept. 19 at 2:01 a.m. in Oslo, Norges Bank Investment Management said in a statement on Tuesday.\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone expected the fund to ever reach US$1 trillion when the first transfer of oil revenue was made in May 1996,\u201d Yngve Slyngstad, chief executive officer of the fund, said in the statement. \u201cReaching US$1 trillion is a milestone, and the growth in the fund\u2019s market value has been stunning.\u201dBut the extreme wealth,\u00a0about equal to the gross domestic product of Mexico, isn\u2019t unalloyed good news.\u00a0The fund\u2019s sheer size has made it a challenge to find markets big enough to invest in. Meanwhile, Norway\u2019s politicians are finding it hard to resist the temptation to raid the world\u2019s biggest state piggy bank, with the petro-dollar addiction threatening to overheat the US$400 billion economy.It has few rivals in terms of size. Japan\u2019s Government Pension Investment Fund was valued at 144.9 trillion yen (US$1.3 trillion at the current exchange rate) at the end of March. China, of course, has about US$3 trillion in currency reserves. There are also big cash-piles at money management firms such as BlackRock Inc.\u2019s US$5.7 trillion and Vanguard Group\u2019s US$4.4 trillion.Slyngstad recently suggested it\u2019s now largely fruitless for it to enter new asset classes such as infrastructure because that would be costly and only deliver a blip on overall returns.\u00a0The investor is also retrenching its global bond portfolio, cutting 23 currencies down to just three \u2014 the dollar, the euro and the pound. The fund says it doesn\u2019t make sense to have more diversification in a world in which prices and rates are converging.Its huge size has also driven the fund to respond to problems with trading by devising elaborate strategies to hide its selling and buying from anyone seeking to front-run its activities.\u00a0But being big has its advantages, especially for a lean organization like Norges Bank Investment Management. The fund only employs about 550 people in offices across the entire globe (Oslo, New York, London, Shanghai and Singapore). Management costs were equal to just 0.02 per cent of assets in the most recent quarter, down from 0.07 per cent five years ago.The decline in costs comes despite the fund\u2019s expansion into real estate. It\u2019s snapped up prime properties in Times Square, the Champs Elysees and London\u2019s Regent Street, among other locations. It owned 200 billion kroner (US$26 billion) in real estate at the end of June.For now, there\u2019s been little discussion about breaking the fund up into smaller, more nimble entities, though the government is pondering a proposal to shift it out of the central bank and strengthen oversight.So what lies ahead? Norway expects the fund to keep growing through 2025, when it\u2019s predicted to hit 10.5 trillion kroner (or US$1.3 trillion at today\u2019s exchange rate). But such estimates are notoriously unreliable. Its current size already exceeds the milestone it wasn\u2019t expected to reach until 2018.With interest rates at record lows and returns hard to come by, the fund\u2019s management is growing less optimistic. Central Bank Governor Oystein Olsen has warned the decline in oil prices means the fund may already have passed its peak.Norway\u2019s government last year made direct withdrawals from the fund for the first time in its history and is expected to take out about 70 billion kroner this year. Meanwhile, Norway has lowered the fund\u2019s expected return to 3 per cent from 4 per cent. \u00a0The fund has been given permission to raise its stock holdings to 70 per cent from 60 per cent, with an equivalent cut in bonds. That could help it eke out higher returns, or at least maintain the 8 per cent annualized real return it\u2019s had over the past five years.But Slyngstad also recently said he sees fundamental issues with the global economic system and trade, which is being buffeted by increasing global political risk. And that\u2019s not good for a fund that owns 1.3 per cent of global stocks.\u2013With assistance from Lukanyo MnyandaBloomberg "}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Bank of Canada deputy\u2019s message may signal \u2018gradualist\u2019 approach to more rate hikes", "description": "Timothy Lane\u2019s speech gives glimpse of Bank\u2019s current thinking on the economy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-deputy-governor-says-exports-and-business-investment-broadening?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/timothy-lane.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 18, 2017 3:07 PM EDT", "content": "The Bank of Canada\u00a0will be closely monitoring the recent surge in the Canadian dollar, given that its recent rate hikes were influenced by strength in exports and business investment, according to an official at the country\u2019s central bank.Deputy Governor\u00a0Timothy Lane\u00a0said the central bank has been raising interest rates in the \u201ccontext\u201d of stronger exports and business investment and policy makers will be \u201cpaying close attention\u201d to how the economy responds to higher borrowing costs and a stronger Canadian dollar following rate increases in July and earlier this month.\u201cWe will be paying close attention to how the economy responds to both higher interest rates and the stronger Canadian dollar,\u201d Lane said in the text of a speech he\u2019s giving Monday in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.Nick Exarhos of CIBC Economics says Lane\u2019s speech may signal \u201ca gradualist approach to further tightening from here, with the loonie\u2019s recent strength likely garnering more attention from the BoC.\u201dExarhos points out in a note that the deputy governor stresses how a strong Canadian dollar had \u201cbattered\u201d export industries over the past decade and commented specifically that manufacturing and service oriented industries need to \u201cgrow faster and export more.\u201dGovernor Stephen Poloz is trying to strike a balance between bringing interest rates back to more normal levels amid the strongest growth spurt in more than a decade, without harming an economy that is only now beginning to fully recover from an almost decade-long downturn.The Canadian dollar, which fell on Lane\u2019s comments, has surged more than 10 per cent over the past four months on expectations the central bank will continue raising interest rates, potentially acting as a drag on exports and business spending.\u201cGrowth in Canada is becoming more broadly based and self-sustaining\u201d including exports, business investment and rising imports of machinery and equipment, Lane said. \u201cIt was in this context that the Bank of Canada decided, in July and again earlier this month, to raise our policy rate.\u201dLane\u2019s speech on international trade also said the outcome of North American Free Trade Agreement talks could have \u201cimportant implications for the Canadian economy\u201d that monetary policy may need to consider. A protectionism shift during the Nafta talks could lead to lower potential growth for the nation\u2019s economy, he said.The first speech since the central bank\u2019s Sept. 6 interest-rate increase comes as investors and economists are split on whether the central bank will tighten for a third straight meeting in October. Canada\u2019s currency weakened by 1 per cent after Lane\u2019s remarks to $1.2318 per U.S. dollar at 2:23 p.m. Toronto time.Most of the speech touted the benefits of free trade for Canada, and suggested the risks around rising global protectionism that could tighten the movement of goods. \u201cThe possibility of a material protectionist shift \u2014 particularly regarding the outcome of negotiations on possible changes to Nafta \u2014 is a key source of uncertainty for Canada\u2019s economic outlook,\u201d Lane said.Over the long run, free trade has created jobs, Lane said, and new barriers could curb Canada\u2019s exports and potential economic growth.

Monetary policy makers hadn\u2019t spoken publicly since July 12, when they delivered their first increase in almost seven years, nor was the latest decision followed by a press conference.The data \u2014 which showed the Canadian economy expanded at a torrid pace of 4.5 per cent in the second quarter, with core inflation measures beginning to edge higher \u2014spoke loudly enough.It\u2019s a throwback to the way central bankers used to operate in the 1980s and 1990s, when policy shifts could be made on any business day, without warning. The Bank of Canada didn\u2019t adopt fixed announcement dates until the new millennium.\u201cIt\u2019s bringing monetary policy back to what it was 20 years ago \u2014 no bells and whistles, just a decision and a statement,\u201d said Christopher Ragan, associate professor of economics at McGill University and former special adviser at the bank.Nicholas Rowe, associate professor of economics at Carleton University, agrees. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that interest rates are quite a bit lower than they were 15 years ago, everything about this does look quite normal,\u201d said Rowe, who\u2019s also a member of the C.D. Howe Monetary Policy Shadow Council.A Bloomberg survey of economists says Canada\u2019s central bank will raise its benchmark interest rate for a third consecutive meeting in October.The Bank of Canada\u2019s overnight target rate will rise a quarter percentage point to 1.25 per cent at the Oct. 25 meeting, which would be the highest level since 2008, the median of seven estimates in the monthly poll showed. The August survey had rates reaching that level in April 2018.Gluskin Sheff + Associates chief economist David Rosenberg points out in his morning note Monday that it wouldn\u2019t be the first time the Bank of Canada had hiked three times in a row.The last time was 2010, when the Bank of Canada hiked rates from 0.25 per cent to 1.0 per cent in three meetings from June to September (there was no meeting in August).In 2005, rates were increased from 2.5 per cent to 3.25 per cent at three consecutive meetings in September, October and December, he said. Rates then rose to 3.5 per cent in January, 3.75 per cent in March, 4 per cent in April and finally 4.25 per cent in May.In 2002, rates went from 2 per cent to 2.75 per cent in three consecutive meetings.In 1999, the Bank hiked to 4.75 per cent in November, went to 5 per cent in February (no meetings in between), hiked to 5.25 per cent in March and then 5.75 per cent in May.\u201cI don\u2019t want to alarm anyone, but the past, when constraints were binding this tight in both the labour and product markets at the same time, the overnight rate averaged out to be 4.25 per cent,\u201d wrote Rosenberg.\u201cThat is not to say we are going anywhere close this level on the policy rate, but it is worthwhile to put the current 1% setting into its proper perspective.Even as central bankers across advanced economies tiptoe toward tightening policy, only Governor Stephen Poloz, who joined the Bank of Canada in 1981 before moving to the private sector 14 years later, seems to be willing to let the data speak for itself. By way of contrast, ahead of its Thursday meeting, the European Central Bank chose to pre-announce a decision not to clarify plans for the future path of its quantitative easing program until its following decision in October.\u201cThis is a reminder that Stephen Poloz is not Mark Carney, and this is not the financial crisis,\u201d said Brian DePratto, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, referring to Poloz\u2019s predecessor and now Bank of England governor. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that the absence of a forward guidance, hand-holding type of approach stands out relative to its peers in other advanced economies.\u201dDuring the last Canadian tightening cycle in 2010, a combination of communications and data prompted the majority of economists to anticipate each of the three rate hikes delivered that year by the Carney-led central bank. By contrast, only six of 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected Wednesday\u2019s move.Poloz\u2019s preference to avoid steering market participants to predetermined outcomes ahead of meetings has been evident throughout his tenure atop the central bank.\u201cHe genuinely prefers central banks to not provide forward guidance and for markets not to expect moves only at Monetary Policy Reports,\u201d said Frances Donald, senior economist at Manulife Asset Management Ltd.In a 2014 discussion paper announcing the end of formal forward guidance by the Bank, Poloz outlined the benefits of moving away from such an approach \u201cin normal times,\u201d echoing a 2010 argument advanced by former Deputy Governor David Longworth.\u201cOffering instead full transparency on the risks that the central bank is weighing causes the market to assess new information more or less as the central bank does; and because every data point can give rise to a debate between economists, the market remains two-way and less vulnerable to unusual leveraging and volatile shifts in sentiment,\u201d he wrote.The jury\u2019s still out on whether the era of enhanced transparency and increased communication on the part of central bankers since the financial crisis has sufficiently improved economic outcomes or reduced uncertainty.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that telegraphing everything to the nth degree is appropriate when the data\u2019s changing all the time,\u201d said James Price, director of capital markets products at Richardson GMP Ltd., who recalls cutting his teeth in the industry during the late 1990s when the Bank of Canada delivered a surprise 100 basis point hike amid the Russian financial crisis.In stark contrast to Canadian monetary officials \u2014 who speak with one voice \u2014 members of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee often chart courses that do more to confound than inform market-watchers.\u201cIn one day, Bill Dudley and Esther George are telling us they\u2019re happy to raise rates again, then Lael Brainard\u2019s out the next saying no \u2014 and you\u2019re telling me that the Fed communication strategy should be a model for everyone else?\u201d said Rosenberg. \u201cGive me a break!\u201dIn any case, too much certainty about the future of monetary policy may sow the seeds for financial instability. Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin, in a paper presented at the 2008 Jackson Hole Symposium, made the case forward guidance could prove counterproductive for a central bank that\u2019s looking to smooth the business cycle.\u201cIf central bank communication compresses the uncertainty around the path of future short rates, the risk of taking on long-lived assets financed by short-term debt is compressed,\u201d they wrote, warning that this could potentially increase the odds of a \u201cdisorderly unwinding\u201d at the end of the cycle.To be sure, Poloz\u2019s team simply doesn\u2019t have as much to talk about as their counterparts in the U.S. or Europe, who made extensive use of asset purchases as well as rate cuts to provide monetary stimulus in the wake of the financial and sovereign debt crises. And in this case, the complete lack of communication between hikes may have been a product of the fact that the central bank was in a blackout period when the blockbuster growth numbers landed.\u201cAll central bankers would like to get back to a time when monetary policy was normal,\u201d said Ragan. \u201cAnd monetary policy is normal when it\u2019s boring.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Equifax's historic hack may have exposed almost half of Americans and some Canadians to threat of identity theft", "description": "Stock in the credit monitoring company is tumbling after it was revealed that Social Security numbers and other sensitive information had been stolen", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/equifax-breach-exposes-143-million-people-to-identity-theft?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gams101-ap.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 7, 2017 7:36 PM EDT", "content": "By Brian WomackEquifax Inc., one of the three biggest credit-reporting companies, was struck by a cyberattack that left almost half the U.S. population at risk, placing it among the most intrusive security breaches in history. The stock fell the most in almost two decades.Hackers exploited a website application to access names, addresses, Social Security numbers and some driver\u2019s licence numbers of potentially 143 million consumers, Equifax said Thursday in a statement.Some U.K. and Canadian residents were also affected in the incident reported Thursday. Equifax said it\u2019s working with regulators in both countries. It uncovered the breach on July 29. While the company\u2019s investigation is substantially complete, it remains open and is expected to be completed in coming weeks, Equifax said.\u201cThis is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do. I apologize to consumers and our business customers for the concern and frustration this causes,\u201d CEO Richard Smith said.Equifax shares fell 18 per cent, the most since December 1998, to $117.25. TransUnion fell 4.4 per cent, the biggest drop on an intraday basis since November.A proposed class action lawsuit was filed against Equifax late Thursday evening, shortly after the company reported the unprecedented hack.The incident is a stark reminder of the risk of consumers\u2019 personal data being exposed online, security experts said. It\u2019s particularly worrisome for the millions of people who trust credit-reporting agencies like Equifax to handle and protect their financial information. That kind of data is critical and could be used in multiple ways to harm consumers.\u201cThis is massive,\u201d said Paul Martini, chief executive officer of Iboss, a cybersecurity firm. \u201cThis overshadows any other breach that we\u2019ve seen to date \u2014 not just the volume, the size, but the type of data that was in that database.\u201dConsumer InformationThe company set up a website, www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, that consumers can use to determine whether their information was compromised. It\u2019s also offering free credit-file monitoring and identify-theft protection.Criminals took advantage of a \u201cU.S. website application vulnerability to gain access to certain files\u201d from mid-May through July of this year, Atlanta-based Equifax said. The intruders also accessed dispute documents with personal identifying information for about 182,000 consumers. Credit card numbers for about 209,000 consumers were also accessed, the company said.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge deal,\u201d said Tim Crosby, senior consultant with security-assessment firm Spohn. \u201cYou would expect these guys to have compartmentalized this data far enough away from a web server \u2014 that there would not be any way to directly access it.\u201dThe Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that it was aware of the hacking incident and was \u201ctracking the situation as appropriate.\u201dEquifax and the other large credit-data brokers \u2014 U.K.-based Experian Plc\u00a0and Chicago-based TransUnion \u2014 have fought a public-relations and regulatory battle for years to present themselves as responsible stewards of the personal information for hundreds of millions of Americans. Critics including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, have taken aim at errors that affect people\u2019s ability to secure home loans, credit cards and reasonable interest rates.U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said the attack should spur renewed interest in stronger data-breach notification standards as well as policies to improve the protection of consumers\u2019 data. \u201cIt is no exaggeration to suggest that a breach such as this \u2014 exposing highly sensitive personal and financial information central for identity management and access to credit \u2014 represents a real threat to the economic security of Americans,\u201d Warner said in a statement.Previous AttacksConcerns about their digital security have periodically come into focus, in high-profile breaches including an incident in 2013 in which all three companies said they uncovered cases where hackers used personal information on famous people from Michelle Obama to Paris Hilton to access their credit reports and post the documents online. That year, cybersecurity reporter and blogger Brian Krebs published an account of how an identity thief in Vietnam ran a service that helped others access millions of Americans\u2019 credit reports from Experian, via a subsidiary company.When breaches have occurred, they often aren\u2019t widely known. Some of the credit companies have disclosed security breaches in the quietest way possible \u2014 by alerting affected consumers directly, by mail \u2014 as required under state breach-disclosure laws, but not issuing wider public statements to consumers or investors. Bloomberg News reported in 2012 that Experian was breached 86 times via accounts at clients such as banks or auto dealers, with hackers downloading in some cases hundreds of credit reports while the businesses were closed.The attack reported Thursday is the most high-profile cybersecurity breach since online portal Yahoo announced two separate incidents. Last year, Yahoo, whose web assets were acquired by Verizon Communications Inc. earlier this year, disclosed a 2014 breach that affected at least 500 million customer accounts. A few months later, the company said a 2013 hack siphoned email addresses, scrambled account passwords and dates of birth of as many as 1 billion users.Financial Industry ImpactEquifax\u2019s breach will test measures the financial industry has rolled out to prevent thieves from abusing troves of stolen credit-card numbers. A few years ago, banks in the U.S. began embedding computer chips on cards to prevent\u00a0criminals from forging their own with much simpler magnetic stripes.\u00a0The underlying technology \u2014 called EMV for founders Europay, MasterCard and Visa \u2014 generates new codes for each transaction. The codes on stripes are static, making them susceptible to duplication. Still, stolen card numbers can be useful at cash registers that don\u2019t accept chips or for shopping online.The Equifax breach also may open the way for another type of fraud called synthetic identity theft. Typically, fraudsters mix stolen Social Security numbers, and potentially other information from the owners, with a borrowed mailing address and apply for new credit cards that they control. Some patient con artists even use the new personas to seek additional credit cards or loans, then max them all out at once, potentially making off with tens of thousands of dollars.Banks typically pick up the cost when thieves abuse stolen card numbers, assuming it\u2019s caught promptly. The expenses can add up fast.Rising Costs of HacksOver the past four years, financial firms spent an average of $222 per affected customer after suffering breaches, according to a study published by the Ponemon Institute this year for\u00a0International Business Machines Corp. The tally includes a variety of expenses, covering everything from forensic investigations to customer support hotlines.The number has been climbing. When releasing the report in June, the authors projected it would reach $245 per customer this year.Some U.K. and Canadian residents were also affected in the incident reported Thursday. Equifax said it\u2019s working with regulators in both countries. It uncovered the breach on July 29. While the company\u2019s investigation is substantially complete, it remains open and is expected to be completed in coming weeks, Equifax said.\u201cThis is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do.

The country\u2019s economy has turned out to be much stronger than anyone was predicting only a few months ago, giving policy makers scope to bring rates back up to more normal levels.The only debate is whether Governor Stephen Poloz will move at Wednesday\u2019s meeting or wait until October, and whether current projections for as many as three more rate increases by the end of 2018 are too conservative.Economists are primarily in the wait-a-month camp \u2014 only five of 26 surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the central bank to hike its 0.75 per cent benchmark rate this week.Investors are hedging, with traders assigning a 57 per cent chance of an increase.The main benefit of waiting until the October decision, which coincides with new quarterly forecasts and a press conference, is that it gives Poloz time to provide more direction to investors about how he sees the data, presumably to limit unnecessary market volatility. At Wednesday\u2019s decision, all investors get is a press release of about 300 words.\u201cWe expect to see a bit more of a hawkish tone in the September statement setting up October but from a communications perspective it favors an October move,\u201d said Brian DePratto, an economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.At the same time, Poloz already laid the groundwork for any future hikes at the July 12 rate decision, which was also accompanied by new forecasts and a press conference, by saying the next move would be \u201cguided by incoming data.\u201dWhich has been almost universally strong, including a GDP report last week that confirms the country is in the middle of its strongest growth spurt in more than a decade and eating into slack much more quickly than the Bank of Canada had anticipated only two months ago.Nor is it uncommon for the central bank to move at rate decisions that aren\u2019t accompanied by its so-called Monetary Policy Reports. Since the current format was instituted in 2002, 16 of the 37 rate moves have occurred in non-MPR rate decisions.Hawkish TurnIn a span of a few months, Poloz has gone from being seen as overly dovish, to one of the world\u2019s more hawkish central bankers.The Bank of Canada is now expected to move faster on interest rates than even the Federal Reserve. While futures trading implies the Bank of Canada will hike rates almost three times by the end of 2018, they are barely pricing in a full hike for its U.S. counterpart over the same stretch. Which explains why yields on two-year government bonds in Canada have surged in recent weeks and are now at about parity with the U.S.Canada is seen catching up with the U.S. on short-term rates by the end of 2018.Then again, there isn\u2019t much Poloz can do about the data. Few developed economies are growing as quickly as Canada. Quarterly growth has averaged 3.7 per cent over the past four quarters, compared to 2.2 per cent in the U.S. Economists are now projecting growth of above 3 per cent in Canada for all of 2017, a full percentage point above the U.S.Beating the U.S. by a full percentage point or more has happened only five times since 1980.Smoking GunWhile there are plenty of reasons to conclude rate hikes are in store for Canada, it\u2019s tougher to see the country\u2019s central banks getting far ahead of the Federal Reserve.Canada has made up much of the ground it lost to the U.S. recovery after oil price collapsed in 2014, but there\u2019s still some way to go. Since the end of 2013, U.S. growth has averaged about 2.2 per cent versus 1.9 per cent in Canada. That plays into the idea that the U.S. cycle is more advanced than Canada\u2019s \u2014 as Poloz had been known to emphasize until recently.Further, there\u2019s no sign of significant inflation pressure, and the Bank of Canada is an inflation targeting central bank.\u201cThey have the luxury of waiting until October simply because they don\u2019t have the smoking gun of inflation,\u201d said Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada.Plus, policy makers will want to limit any further gains in the Canadian dollar, which is up almost 9 per cent since early June when the central bank first adopted a tightening bias.That ties in closely with concern about the sustainability of the recovery, which has relied heavily on consumers and housing. Since the start of 2014, consumption and residential investment has accounted for 90 per cent of all growth.Over the last four quarters, that\u2019s come down to about 62 per cent, close to the historical average, on the back of business spending on investment and inventories that\u2019s already much stronger than usual and will probably slow. The last thing businesses need is an even stronger Canadian dollar.Longer RecordAlong with the GDP data last week, Statistics Canada released a methodically consistent revision of national accounts that allowed it to provide comparable data going back an additional 20 years, to 1961 instead of 1981.The revisions showed that in the first half of 2017, household consumption and residential investment combined totalled 64.3 per cent as the share of the total economy, a record. The average since 1961 has been 59 per cent.This provides possibly the strongest argument for why policy makers should be cautious when it comes to raising rates: it\u2019s not exactly clear how the Canadian economy will react, since it\u2019s all unprecedented. Borrowing costs have never been this low, Canadians have never been as indebted and the nation\u2019s economy has never been so reliant on consumption and housing.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Best-in-class Canada growth erases yield gap to U.S. bonds", "description": "Yields on two-year Canadian government bonds recently pushed above those of the U.S. for the first time on a closing basis since May 2015", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/best-in-class-canada-growth-erases-yield-gap-to-u-s-bonds-1", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/0624stocks.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 5, 2017 1:02 PM EDT", "content": "By Maciej OnoszkoFor two years, bond investors have been betting the U.S. would raise interest rates more aggressively than Canada. That bet has now faded.Yields on two-year Canadian government bonds pushed above those of the U.S. after data last week highlighted strength north of the border and weakening to the south. The last time the yield gap was negative on a closing basis was in May 2015.The market shift followed surprisingly strong Canadian second-quarter growth data on Aug. 31, which bolstered the view the central bank will increase rates for the second time this year \u2014 possibly as early as its announcement on Wednesday. At the same time, a slowdown in U.S. job creation and a continued tepid inflation outlook have prompted traders to pare back wagers the Federal Reserve will raise rates a third time by year-end.The Canadian \u201ceconomy has surpassed everyone\u2019s expectations by leaps and bounds,\u201d Derek Holt, Toronto-based head of capital markets economics at Bank of Nova Scotia, said in a note. \u201cThe central bank remains on the path toward raising its policy rate by about one full percentage point by the end of next year in a more front-loaded set of moves.\u201dThe yield on Canada\u2019s two-year federal government bonds rose one basis point to 1.35 per cent, while the rate on similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries was down three basis points to 1.31 per cent on Monday. The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.3 per cent to $1.2375 per greenback Tuesday morning in Toronto.Investors see a 48 per cent probability of a Canadian interest-rate increase on Wednesday, according to overnight index swaps data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s up from just 27 per cent before the growth data, with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Bank of Nova Scotia among banks pulling forward forecasts for a hike to September. The odds that policy rates will be higher before the end of the year now stand at 82 per cent compared with 34 per cent for the U.S.To be sure, the U.S. Federal Reserve is well ahead of the Bank of Canada on the tightening curve. It boosted rates in December 2015 after laying dormant for seven-years after the financial crisis. Three more increases later and the federal funds target rate stands at 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent. Canada first moved in July, surprising the markets at that. Its overnight lending rate is at 0.75 per cent.But Canada\u2019s economy strengthened dramatically over the first half. Gross domestic product expanded at an annualized rate of 4.5 per cent in the second quarter, the strongest pace in almost six years and top among its Group of Seven peers. \u201cMost impressively,\u201d output has been well balanced, with consumers, capital spending and exports all making big contributions,\u00a0economists at Bank of Montreal note.Until last week, \u201cSeptember was kind of dead and now all of a sudden people are saying, \u2018hold on a second,\u2019\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, a Toronto-based rates and macro strategist at Bank of Montreal, said on Friday.

The better-than-expected result was due to stronger consumption growth than economists had predicted.The surge in growth should help cement the chances the Bank of Canada will continue raising interest rates in coming months as the nation\u2019s economy nears full capacity. The central bank forecast in July spare capacity would be eliminated by the end of this year, and that was with second quarter growth forecasts of 3 per cent.Canada\u2019s economy also grew at a more-than-expected 0.3 per cent pace in June, on the back of higher construction.\u2022 Canada\u2019s consumers, benefiting from a buoyant jobs market and rising home values, are on a tear. Household consumption rose at an annualized 4.6 per cent pace in the second quarter, following a 4.8 per cent gain in the second quarter. That\u2019s the best two-quarter gain since before the 2008 recession.\u2022 It\u2019s a tale of two industries for Canada\u2019s housing market. Residential construction was little changed with repair and renovation work posting stronger gains but overall residential investment figures were hurt by slumping activity in the resale market. Total investment in residential structures fell at an annualized 4.7 per cent pace due to a sharp decline in the so-called ownership transfer costs associated with real estate transactions(down an annualized 24.1 per cent)\u2022 The broad-based nature of the expansion \u2014 which the Bank of Canada has been highlighting in recent months as a justification for higher rates \u2014 continued in the second quarter. All major components of growth except for residential investment increases \u2022 Another positive was the big jump in inventories in the second quarter wasn\u2019t reversed in the second quarter. Inventories were up, adding 0.1 percentage points to growth in the quarter. Business investment grew for a second straight quarter, something that hasn\u2019t happened since 2014. The back- to-back annualized gains were 7.1 per cent in the second quarter and 13.7 per cent in the first quarter. That\u2019s the strongest two-month gain since 2012\u2022 More positives: The pick-up in consumption was financed by gains in disposable income, not a lower savings rate. In fact, the household savings rate increased to 4.6 per cent in the second quarter from 4.3 per cent. The national savings rate fell to 3.4 per cent from 4 per cent on less saving by corporations and borrowing from governments \u2022 Exports delivered. A surge in oil production helped fuel an annualized 9.6 per cent gain in exports of goods and services, the fastest gain since the first half of 2014, outpacing the 7.4 per cent gain in imports \u2022 The second quarter gain is the strongest since 2011. Canada\u2019s economic growth over the past two quarters was the best first half for the economy since 2002.Avery Shenfeld, CIBC chief economistCanada\u2019s second quarter let the good times roll, so much so that the country\u2019s national humility has almost everyone assuming that this can\u2019t last. The 4.5% pace for real GDP in the quarter handily topped consensus, as did the 0.3% monthly advance for June. That has the economy up 4.3% from a year ago, a result flattered a bit by the depressing impact of Alberta wildfire\u2019s in the prior year. Other than housing and a return to a more typical inventory pace just about every source of demand did well, with final domestic demand up 3.5% and a nice contribution from net exports. A big gain in construction was the surprise within in the June data, although that was helped by the end of a Quebec strike. A rise in the savings rate and good compensation will leave more room for consumer spending in Q3. Look for estimates for that quarter to move up. Odds of a September rate hike by the Bank of Canada are certainly enhanced by this report.Douglas Porter, BMO chief economist Bottom Line: Even the naysayers will struggle mightily to find fault in this rock-solid report. Growth was very well balanced in the quarter, easily riding over the start of a cooldown in housing, and the sturdy June figure suggests some of the momentum was maintained heading into Q3. In what has become almost a seemingly monthly ritual in 2017, we are nudging up our call on Canadian GDP growth yet again to 3.1% for the year and 2.5% for Q3 \u2014 and would readily allow that there is some upside risk. While still-low core inflation and a stronger Canadian dollar give the BoC room to be patient and deliberate (i.e. unlikely to move next week), we do believe that this suite of robust numbers all but locks in another rate hike this year \u2014 and we suspect that is the message they will send quite clearly at next week\u2019s decision.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "TD ends Canada's 'Big Six' earnings season with the biggest beat yet", "description": "All six Canadian big banks exceeded expectations, but TD rose above the rest on its strong retail performance", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/canadas-td-bank-reports-quarterly-earnings-ahead-of-forecasts", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/tdbanknew.jpeg", "publishedAt": "August 31, 2017 9:28 AM EDT", "content": "By Doug AlexanderToronto-Dominion Bank got its groove back.Canada\u2019s largest lender by assets posted a 13 per cent increase in profit from domestic personal and commercial banking in the fiscal third quarter, its best performance since the second quarter of 2015. That\u2019s welcome relief for investors who\u2019ve seen the Toronto-based lender stumble on its home turf for most of the past year. Those contributions also helped the bank top analysts\u2019 expectations in the quarter.\u201cTD showed the strongest beat of the \u2018Big 6\u2019 this earnings season,\u201d Barclays Plc analyst John Aiken said Thursday in a note to clients. \u201cDomestic retail operations saw a step up in profitability after being mired in lower growth over the past few quarters.\u201dThe results extend a profit turnaround that began in the second quarter, when a 7.1 per cent jump in domestic earnings exceeded that of its rivals. Before that, Toronto-Dominion\u2019s main business trailed or was near the bottom of Canada\u2019s six largest lenders for the pace of growth in the three prior quarters. Canadian personal and commercial banking represents about half of the bank\u2019s annual earnings.Even Toronto-Dominion\u2019s own equity analyst a year ago questioned why the bank was becoming a straggler in Canadian banking. Teri Currie, head of domestic banking, blamed lower interest rates, competitive pricing and cost of funds for mortgages at the time \u2014 factors all the country\u2019s lenders have faced. More recently, the bank cited higher costs tied to modernizing branches with Wi-Fi and iPads, and adding mobile mortgage advisers and customer support.\u201cEarnings in our Canadian retail segment have been accelerating, reflecting a better than expected Canadian economic environment,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said in an interview Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a number of investments on the customer and operational side of the business that continue to allow us to provide for a better customer experience.\u201dEarnings from Canadian banking surged to $1.3 billion in the quarter ended July 31, the Toronto-based bank said in a statement, with profit growth that outperformed Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce for the period.Toronto-Dominion\u2019s pace of growth in mortgages still lags behind rivals, rising 1.3 per cent from a year earlier, even as Canada\u2019s real estate market has boomed. The bank has said it\u2019s focusing more on selling home-equity credit lines, unsecured personal loans and\u00a0other higher profit products.Margins in Canadian banking rose 4 basis points to 2.75 per cent from the second quarter, the highest since 2015. It has also seen an increase in deposits and business lending.Canadian personal-and-commercial banking helped lift Canadian retail earnings 14 per cent to $1.73 billion, while U.S. retail rose 14 per cent to $901 million. Wholesale banking slid 3 per cent to $293 million.Firmwide net income rose 17 per cent to $2.77 billion, or $1.46 a share, from $2.36 billion, or $1.24, a year earlier, Toronto-Dominion said in its statement. Adjusted profit, which excludes some items, was $1.51 a share, beating the $1.37 average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank also said it plans to repurchase for cancellation as many as 20 million additional shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory approval.Toronto-Dominion was the last of Canada\u2019s largest lenders to report quarterly results. All posted profit that exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations, with earnings growth driven mainly by domestic banking and wealth management.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Canada this week could break its longest streak of low growth since 1926", "description": "We find out this week whether the Canadian economy has entered rarefied territory", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/record-span-of-sub-3-growth-nearing-an-end-canada-eco-watch", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/0501manufacturing.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 29, 2017 12:02 PM EDT", "content": "Statistics Canada reports growth data on Thursday that will confirm the nation\u2019s economy has entered rarefied territory.Economists are forecasting an expansion in second-quarter gross domestic product at about the same 3.7 per cent pace recorded in the first three months of this year. Even with an anticipated second-half slowdown, that should leave Canada flirting with 3 per cent growth for all of 2017.If that happens, it would end a five-year stretch of sub-3 per cent growth that\u2019s already tied as the longest on record in data going back to 1926. The nation is benefiting from a confluence of developments that include a synchronized global recovery and rising trade volumes, the bottoming of the oil shock in western Canada, federal deficit spending, rising industrial production in developed economies and soaring home prices in Toronto and Vancouver.The surprise surge in activity over the past year is having one lasting impact: it will eliminate fully Canada\u2019s existing economic slack in coming months, if it hasn\u2019t already. That would be quite a milestone. According to Bank of Canada estimates, the economy has been in a state of excess capacity for 35 straight quarters.The mix of no slack with low potential growth means interest-rate increases are almost certainly in the cards even at very low growth rates since it won\u2019t take much to push the economy into excess demand, according to Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia.The Bank of Canada estimates the nation\u2019s economy can\u2019t grow much beyond 1.4 per cent before fuelling inflation. In other words, Canada may be entering an era of slow growth and rising interest rates, which is not exactly a dream scenario for policy makers.\u201cThere is no way around it,\u201d said Perrault, \u201cTwo per cent is not high compared to history, but it is compared to trend.\u201dIn addition, fiscal stimulus may no longer be needed in an economy with no slack and low potential growth as it can accelerate rate increases and crowd out private players.That doesn\u2019t mean arguments can\u2019t be made for bigger government. There could be an argument for financing productivity-enhancing infrastructure or redistributing income more fairly. More government debt and less private debt is also probably more stable in a world with record household debt and relatively low government borrowings.But the tradeoffs to deficits are becoming more stark.\u201cThe fact that you are running expansionary fiscal policy at a time when growth is as strong as it is, clearly you will have higher interest rates than you would otherwise have,\u201d Perrault said.In some ways, the latest growth spurt merely serves to highlight how sluggish Canada\u2019s economy has become in recent years.No one predicted the bump up in growth, in large part because no one expected Canada\u2019s highly indebted consumers would have the capacity to continue to press on the accelerator. But they did.Growth in consumption \u2014 which accounts for about 57 per cent of real GDP \u2014 is forecast to surpass 3 per cent in 2017, the first time that\u2019s happened since 2010. In a January survey of economists, the highest estimate for consumption growth was 2.2 per cent, with a median forecast of 1.9 per cent.There are two main reasons for the better-than-expected numbers.One, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s fiscal policy has clearly had an impact, particularly tax cuts and enhanced child benefits that came into effect last year. More significant may be a surge in home prices and housing wealth in Toronto and Vancouver that\u2019s prompting households to ramp up spending. The value of residential real estate in Canada jumped by $384 billion in the year through March, Statistics Canada reported earlier this year.Neither factor is seen as a sustainable source of growth, and a payback effect is expected in coming years. Economists estimate household spending growth will fall back below 2 per cent by 2018, which is a slower pace than the overall economy \u2014 a rare occurrence. Consumption has only lagged the economy once in the past 15 years.That will likely mean the Canadian economy\u2019s moment in the sun will be brief. Economists are already forecasting a sharp decline is already under way this quarter and the central bank expects growth will fall back quickly to about 2 per cent levels next year, bringing it closer in line with longer-term fundamentals that are hobbled by an aging labor force and falling productivity.Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said that residential investment and the wealth impact of housing have been accounting for about half a percentage point of growth.\u201cA good chunk of it has been tied to house prices,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cOur best guess that starts to roll off in the second half of this year.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "2 million ounces of gold trades in one minute, shocking the market \u2014 and no one knows why", "description": "So much for a quiet day in late August", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/mining/gold-shaken-out-of-slumber-by-a-mysterious-2-million-ounce-trade", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gold.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 28, 2017 2:44 PM EDT", "content": "So much for a quiet Friday in late August.After weeks of relative slumber, gold traders were rudely awoken to a surge in volume and volatility.

The report also showed a second straight gain in core inflation.Canadian inflation data is being closely monitored by investors as they try to gauge the likelihood of another rate increase this year. The Bank of Canada is expected to continue on a rate hike path, but only as long price pressures hold up.The clearest sign that the recent weakness in prices has at least bottomed out are the rising key core inflation readings. The average of the Bank of Canada\u2019s three core inflation measures was 1.5 per cent, rising from a 1.4 per cent pace in June and a 1.3 per cent reading in May that was the slowest since 1999 Higher gasoline prices \u2014 which were up 4.6 per cent over the 12-month period \u2014 were the major factor behind the rise in overall inflation.

Canada\u2019s electricity index fell 9.1 per cent in July from a year earlier, which was the biggest decrease since April 2003.

El-ErianRisk assets across the globe, despite already high valuations, have recovered impressively from a sell-off triggered by concerns about a North Korean nuclear attack. In doing so, they have again highlighted the extent to which traders and investors \u2014 highly confident about the environment they operate in (be it economic, financial or institutional) \u2014 have developed endogenous stabilizers. And while there is a limit to the effectiveness of these stabilizers over time, disrupting them in the short run would require deeper and more sustained adverse shocks, be they internal or external. Over the longer term, however, they cannot obviate the need for a handoff to more sustainable engines of value creation.Having been sold off last week in the midst of a spike in the widely followed Volatility Index (VIX) and lots of talk about a long-anticipated price correction, risk assets have recovered yet again as many stock indices resume their march toward another set of records. While helped by North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un\u2019s temporary pullback on firing nuclear weapons toward Guam, the recovery started before such a signal. And it persists despite yet another intensification of political noise in the U.S. that inevitably drowns out and delays any legislative progress on pro-growth policies.The recovery in risk assets has a lot to do with a \u201cbuy the dips\u201d mentality that is now deeply ingrained in markets and that, repeatedly, has proven highly remunerative. It is underpinned by four related beliefs held by a very wide set of traders and investors and supported by high-frequency data and other recent signals.A Goldilocks global economy in which prospects for relatively stable nominal gross domestic product have been enhanced by a fall of the threat of material slowdown that has occurred without materially increasing the risk of an inflationary outbreak. Supportive central banks that continue to show considerable caution when it comes to both raising interest rates (recent examples come from the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve) and tapering large-scale balance sheet purchases (see: European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan). Continued migration to passive vehicles, including exchange-traded funds, which dull stock differentiation and provide consistent overall support to markets. Strong performance of corporate profits, which also helps to bolster companies\u2019 cash holdings and expands prospects for dividend payouts, stock buybacks and mergers-and-acquisitions activities.Because of this multifaceted configuration, it will take a big and sustained external shock to shake investors out of what has become a comforting, self-reinforcing \u201cbuy the dips\u201d conditioning. The same is true when it comes to possible internal disruptions, be they indications of a less robust global economy or a policy slippage.Over the longer term, however, there is a limit to how far this conditioning can decouple asset prices from fundamentals. But, as already illustrated, it is a limit that extends beyond what many traditional valuation approaches and models suggest, especially historically based ones. It is an elongated, enjoyable journey for traders and investors. But like all journeys, it needs to give way to a sustainable destination. And a necessary condition for this involves a greater policy effort to promote higher and more inclusive economic growth.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mohamed A.

That outpaces 26 similar mutual funds that have assets of more than C$500 million as well as the S&P/TSX Preferred Total Return Index which has gained 8 percent.The Bank of Canada will likely raise rates once more before the end of the year after tightening policy in July, while big issuers such as banks, insurance and pipelines companies look stable, the fund\u2019s manager said.\u201cWith that kind of background, it\u2019s hard to see anything bad happening to the asset class before the end of the year,\u201d\u00a0Roger Rouleau, who is one of the managers of the fund which has C$784 million of assets, said in an interview.Preferreds, many of whose dividends reset with higher interest rates, have outperformed Canada\u2019s main equity gauge as well as corporate bonds amid the central bank\u2019s hawkish turn. They\u2019ve rebounded from a slump in early 2016 after the shares reset with lower dividends to reflect Bank of Canada rate cuts. Some issuers responded by adding a yield guarantee to protect investors from further erosion.Dynamic invests about 78 percent of its fund in rate-reset preferred shares that offer a fixed dividend for 5 years until the next reset date. The fund began allocating more of its investments into Canada during 2015 when the central bank was cutting rates and the market was cheap compared with the U.S. Now it has about 85 percent invested north of the border compared with as little as 50 percent in Canada before December 2015.It\u2019s a bit trickier to find value now as some preferreds are no longer cheap and trading above par but a good chunk of the market still trades at a substantial discount compared with the U.S., Rouleau said.

Energy stocks account for 20 per cent of the benchmark\u2019s weight.However, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Canadian investors. Of the 143 index members that have reported second-quarter earnings, 64 per cent have beat analyst estimates and 30 per cent have missed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This is a significant improvement from the first quarter, when 49 per cent beat and 43 per cent missed, and an indication that corporate fundamentals are improving.\u201cInvestors are finally going to come to grips with Canadian growth and earnings growth is a little bit better than everybody thought so that\u2019s where you can get more upside,\u201d Belski said.An upbeat earnings season hasn\u2019t had much impact on valuations yet. The gap in forward price-to-earnings between the S&P/TSX and the S&P 500 Index is the biggest it\u2019s been since 2008. Several strategists and investors say a gap this big can\u2019t last and will either be narrowed by declines in the U.S. or gains in Canada.\u201cThere\u2019s a good case to be made for the bout of serious underperformance in Canada to subside,\u201d Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.Any recovery in the S&P/TSX will need energy stocks behind it, given their importance to the benchmark. Although there are plenty of unknowns for oil prices \u2014 including OPEC\u2019s commitment to production cuts and U.S. shale producers\u2019 ability to fill the gap \u2014 there are also signals that investors are getting more bullish on energy.Traders invested $42 million in the iShares S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF in July, the biggest exchange traded fund tracking Canada\u2019s energy index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That inflow was the largest since September 2016, a month when oil prices rose 7.9 per cent and energy stocks gained 3.5 per cent.Canadian oil producers are also more resilient than they were before the downturn following significant cost-cutting efforts. Meanwhile, the price discount between Western Canada Select and WTI has narrowed to about $10, the smallest in more than two years and down from a high of more than $40 a barrel in 2013 \u2014 another positive sign for the Canadian oil patch.\u00a0A rebound in Canadian stocks also won\u2019t get far without the help of financials, which account for 34 per cent of the S&P/TSX. Financials have lost 0.5 per cent this year as concern about overheated housing markets weighed on shares of the big banks.Belski said that will change as investors look for dividend growth as an alternative to bonds in a rising-rate environment.

We are experiencing a bubble, not in stock prices but in bond prices. This is not discounted in the marketplace.\u201dGreenspan first warned about a bond bubble back in 2010. Although some will say he was early and others would say he was wrong, it makes sense to put things into perspective when discussing bonds in the context of a bubble. As an investment vehicle, bonds are very different from stocks in the way they\u2019re structured \u2014 higher up the capital structure, set payment dates, set maturity dates, etc.Stocks are much more unpredictable than bonds, which is why they tend to see much wider swings in prices, especially in the short-to-intermediate term. Over the long term, bond returns are governed by math more than anything. The beginning interest rate is a good estimate of what long-term performance will be in high-quality bonds.There have only been a few different interest rate regimes, so it\u2019s difficult to use history as a foolproof guide, but we can see how bonds reacted to rising rates in the past to get a sense for the risk profile of these assets. First of all, there\u2019s nothing that says rates can\u2019t or won\u2019t stay low for a very long time. That\u2019s exactly what happened from the mid-1920s to the late 1950s.Interest rates on long-term government bonds were range-bound between 2 percent and 4 percent for more than three decades in the aftermath of the Great Depression and well after World War II. It wasn\u2019t until the tail end of the 1950s that rates finally broke through 4 percent and stayed there for some time. After that, it was almost an uninterrupted rise in rates for the next 20 or so years.While rates rose somewhat in the 1960s, the 1970s and first few years of the 1980s saw an unprecedented rise in rates from a combination of sky-high inflation and a Fed chairman \u2014 Paul Volcker \u2014 who was dead set on beating inflation by raising the benchmark rates well into double-digit territory.Investors can\u2019t expect this same exact scenario to play out in the future, but seeing long-term rates rising from under 2 percent in the early 1940s to nearly 15 percent in the early 1980s would constitute a good example of how bonds could perform during a rising rate environment. Here are the performance statistics from both periods:The biggest drawdown for the 1926-to-1959 period came at the tail end in 1959 as rates slowly began to rise. Before that, there wasn\u2019t a single double-digit decline in long-term bonds in this time. And the largest drawdown during the 1960-to-1982 period came when the Fed raised short-term rates to almost 20 percent.Long-term yields started 1980 at around 10 percent and went up to almost 15 percent by September 1981. So even with close to a 5 percentage point rise in yields in under two years, bonds still only fell by as much as a run-of-the-mill bear market in stocks. The worst bear market for long-term government bonds is a loss that is less than the worst one-day loss in the stock market on Black Monday in 1987.Volatility was much higher during a rising rate environment, but returns were slightly better than the stable rate environment. This makes sense considering that eventually you begin earning a higher yield to offset some of the principal losses from the higher rates. These returns are in nominal terms while the biggest risk to bond investors over the long haul is inflation.On a real, or inflation-adjusted, basis, long-term government bonds actually lost close to 38 percent in total from 1960 to 1982, taking the annual real returns down to a loss of greater than 2 percent per year.While anything is possible in markets, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see a crash in high-quality sovereign bonds in the same way that we would in stocks. Bond losses are more like a death by a thousand cuts. Rising yields could impact the multiple investors are willing to pay for stocks as well.So Greenspan\u2019s bond bubble comments show that investors shouldn\u2019t be worried so much about a bubble in bonds as an unexpected rise in inflation.Ben Carlson is director of institutional asset management at Ritholtz Wealth Management.

That bodes well for a continuation of the household spending that has been fueling the nation\u2019s expansion.\u201cWhile the normalization of interest rates is likely to have a negative impact on household balance sheets, a stronger Canadian dollar could be perceived as another sign of a healthier economy,\u201d said Robert Lawrie,\u00a0a Bloomberg economist based in New York.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz hiked rates for the first time in seven years on July 12 and signaled more may be coming. That helped Canada\u2019s dollar break through the 80 U.S. cent mark last month for the first time in two years.Consumer confidence has tended recently to move in the same direction as the central bank\u2019s rate decisions. In the few weeks after the January 2015 cut, for example, the Nanos index dropped steadily before rebounding. It declined again after the July 2015 reduction to a two-year low.Every week, Nanos Research asks Canadians for their views on personal finances, job security, the outlook for the economy and where real estate prices are headed. The responses are compiled into the Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index.The polling showed sentiment gains were broad-based, and have completely offset\u00a0housing-sector worries. The share of people who believe the economy will strengthen is the highest in seven years at 32.3 percent, according to the polling. The figure climbed from 28.1 percent in the prior edition and from 22.1 percent a month ago.The polling figures showed only 8.7 percent of people are insecure about their jobs, which the lowest on record. Canadians also feel better about personal finances, with 20.2 percent saying their balance sheets are stronger than a year ago. That\u2019s the highest reading for this measure since September 2016.Housing was the only weak point in the data. Sentiment about home prices dropped to the lowest since January.Confidence also climbed across different regions. Quebec\u2019s index hit a record high 61.9, a reflection of the French-speaking province\u2019s job market, which is among the nation\u2019s strongest.The Prairie region including Alberta improved in line with a gain in oil prices that has kick-started a rebound in drilling and investment after a two-year crash. The confidence index for the Prairies reached the highest since March.Canada is in the midst of one of its strongest growth spurts since the 2008-2009 recession, with the expansion accelerating to an above-3 percent pace over the past four quarters. That\u2019s the fastest among G-7 countries and double what the central bank considers is Canada\u2019s capacity to grow without fueling inflation.The pick-up in growth includes an increase in jobs of 387,600 over the past year, the biggest 12-month gain since 2007.\u201cWhatever happens over the remainder of the year, 2017 will go down as a very good year for the Canadian economy,\u201d Toronto-Dominion Bank senior economist James Marple wrote Friday in a research note.The Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index is based on telephone polling with a four-week rolling average of 1,000 respondents, and is considered accurate within 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.Bloomberg News\u00a0"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Don't fear REITs when interest rates rise \u2014 unless you are in Canada", "description": "Canadian REITs tend to have longer-term leases and less tenant turnover, meaning fewer opportunities for landlords to raise rents.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/dont-fear-reits-when-interest-rates-rise-unless-you-are-in-canada", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/condos.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 8, 2017 8:44 AM EDT", "content": "Real estate investment trusts aren\u2019t to be avoided as interest rates rise \u2014 except in Canada, where lower cash-flow growth and higher leverage make them riskier bets, according to the head of securities at a $6.5-billion real estate fund.\u201cIf you look at the empirical evidence, REITs\u00a0actually outperform in a rising-rate environment,\u201d Corrado Russo, global head of securities at Timbercreek Asset Management Inc., said in a phone interview. \u201cThey tend to do better both on a relative and on an absolute basis.\u201dToronto-based Timbercreek analyzed the performance of U.S. REITs over the past nine rate-hike cycles by the Federal Reserve and found that they rose in eight of those nine periods.\u201cIt\u2019s counter to perception, but real estate is much more correlated to a strong economy than it is inversely correlated to interest rates,\u201d said Russo, who manages $1.2 billion of public securities.This is less true in Canada, where REITs tend to have longer-term leases and less tenant turnover, meaning fewer opportunities for landlords to raise rents.

Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s Binky Chadha says real Treasury yields sit far below where actual growth levels suggest they should be. Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, says it\u2019s only a matter of time before inflationary pressures hit the bond market.\u201cThe real problem is that when the bond-market bubble collapses, long-term interest rates will rise,\u201d Greenspan said. \u201cWe are moving into a different phase of the economy \u2014 to a stagflation not seen since the 1970s. That is not good for asset prices.\u201dStocks, in particular, will suffer with bonds, as surging real interest rates will challenge one of the few remaining valuation cases that looks more gently upon U.S. equity prices, Greenspan argues. While hardly universally accepted, the theory underpinning his view, known as the Fed Model, holds that as long as bonds are rallying faster than stocks, investors are justified in sticking with the less-inflated asset.Right now, the model shows U.S. stocks at one of the most compelling levels ever relative to bonds. Using Greenspan\u2019s reference of 10-year inflation-adjusted bond yields, currently around 0.47 percent, the gap with the S&P 500\u2019s earnings yield at around 4.7 percent, is 21 percent higher than the 20-year average. That justifies records in major equity benchmarks and P/E ratios near the highest since the financial crisis.The real problem is that when the bond-market bubble collapses, long-term interest rates will riseIf rates start rising quickly, investors would be advised to abandon stocks apace, Greenspan\u2019s argument holds. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Economist David Kostin names the threat of rising inflation as one reason he isn\u2019t joining Wall Street bulls in upping year-end estimates for the S&P 500.\u00a0While persistently low inflation would imply a fair value of 2,650 on the benchmark gauge, the more likely case is a narrowing of the gap between earnings and bond yields, Kostin says. He is sticking to his estimate that the index will finish the year at 2,400, implying a drop of about 3 percent from current levels.That\u2019s no slam dunk, as stocks have proven resilient to bond routs so far in the eight-year bull market. While the 10-year Treasury yield has peaked above 3 percent only a few times in the past six years, sudden spikes in yields in 2013 and after the 2016 election didn\u2019t slow stocks from their grind higher.Those shocks to the bond market proved short-lived, though,\u00a0as tepid U.S. growth combined with low inflation to keep real and nominal long-term yields historically low.That era could end soon, with the Fed widely expected to announce plans for unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet and central banks around the world talking about scaling back stimulus.\u201cThe biggest mispricing in our view across asset classes is government bonds,\u201d Deutsche Bank\u2019s Chadha said in an interview. \u201cWe should start to see inflation move up in the second half of the year.\u201d\u00a0"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Bond giant Pimco thinks the Bank of Canada is about to turn cautious", "description": "The No 2 fixed-income manager is hugging the short-end of the Canadian bond market, betting the central bank isn\u2019t as hawkish as some think", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/pimco-sees-bank-of-canada-turning-cautious-bets-on-short-end", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/polox.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 31, 2017 3:22 PM EDT", "content": "By Natalie WongPacific Investment Management Co. is hugging the short-end of the Canadian bond market, betting the country\u2019s central bank will turn cautious after raising interest rates this month.Ed Devlin, head of the Canadian portfolio at Pimco, the second-biggest U.S. fixed-income manager, said two-year government bond yields are likely anchored around current levels after soaring since the Bank of Canada unexpectedly turned hawkish in mid-June and raised rates July 12.

Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party under a former leader swept to power in 1993 and won three subsequent elections \u2014 all of them while interest rates were stable or falling and the economy was relatively strong. \u201cThe working assumption of every central bank is more governments would favor more growth and looser policy,\u201d said Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal.Rates are now projected to rise heading into Canada\u2019s 2019 election, while growth is forecast to fall. The last time a Liberal government entered an election in the middle of a monetary policy tightening cycle was in 2006; that year, the Conservatives defeated them.Output growth will peak this year at 2.6 percent and slow in each of the next two years to 1.9 percent in 2019, according to a Bloomberg consensus survey. While still respectable \u2014 it\u2019d be behind only the U.S. in the G-7 \u2014 it\u2019s nowhere near the level of growth being seen today. Sustaining the current pace would be a tall order.\u201cTo me, that\u2019s virtually impossible,\u201d said Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto and a former finance department official. It would be \u201cfantastical\u201d to have growth anything close to 3 percent in 2019, he said. \u201cYou\u2019re in a world when growth is at least twice potential. That can\u2019t be sustained.\u201dTrudeau came to power in 2015, a year\u00a0when growth sagged to 0.9 percent, partly by pledging new deficit spending on infrastructure and family tax cuts to prop up the economy.The strong growth will likely cut Trudeau\u2019s deficit figures and, as such, borrowing requirement. \u201cThey could choose to spend a part of that, and still have a lower deficit than we have in the budget, financed in part through higher revenues,\u201d Perrault said.Rate TensionTrudeau and Morneau have stayed quiet since the report that some of the prime minister\u2019s officials are worried Poloz will stunt growth by moving too quickly on rates. Poloz nonetheless has backing from economists for hiking. \u201cI think the Bank of Canada\u2019s exactly right in doing what it\u2019s doing,\u201d said Randall Bartlett, chief economist of the University of Ottawa\u2019s Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy.Because of how the Bank of Canada has incorporated federal fiscal projections in its forecasts, there\u2019s a risk markets might over-read any tension over rates and interpret the government \u201cas having more influence on the governor than it would past Bank of Canada governors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk is still small and likely won\u2019t influence market decisions unless the prime minister or finance minister say something publicly.\u201dPoloz, meanwhile, may not move all that quickly. \u201cBeyond the near-term, a return to a more cautious communication strategy and pace of interest rate increases is expected in light of the headwinds facing Canada,\u201d\u00a0including slow inflation growth, Toronto-Dominion Bank Senior Economist Brian DePratto said in a research note.MLI leading indicator (Monday, 7 a.m.) Industrial product price index and raw material price index (Monday, 8:30 a.m.) Bloomberg Nanos consumer confidence index (Monday, 10 a.m.) Markit Canada Manufacturing PMI (Tuesday, 8:30 a.m.) Jobs report (Friday, 8:30 a.m.) Trade report (Friday, 8:30 a.m.) Toronto home sales (time unconfirmed) Vancouver home sales (time unconfirmed) Desrosiers auto sales (time unconfirmed)Canada\u2019s currency, trading near the highest in two years, may also be reaching a peak.The spread between\u00a0the Canadian and U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Indices \u2014 which track when an indicator beats or misses expectations \u2014 widened to 130 points this week, the most since 2011.

The share of those who say their finances have worsened in the last year fell to 22.1 percent, the lowest in a year.An Abacus Data poll released this month found 62 percent of Canadians think Trudeau is doing at least \u201can acceptable job\u201d on the economy, including 49 percent of those who voted in the last election for the Conservatives. The party governed from 2006 to 2015 and is Trudeau\u2019s chief rival, particularly on the economy.The same firm, in its last survey during the election, found 37 percent of respondents said the election was about the economy, more than any other subject, with 55 percent of Conservative voters listing it as their top issue. \u201cThe shift in perceptions about the economy is something the government can trumpet,\u201d Abacus Chief Executive Officer David Coletto said.Trudeau will hope they remain as high as rates rise \u2014 and with growth and the dollar poised to cool."}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Fears grow in Ottawa that Bank of Canada hiked rates too soon", "description": "Though Ottawa has steadfastly declined to comment, officials within Trudeau's government fear higher borrowing costs could inadvertently trigger a downturn", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trudeau-officials-are-said-to-fear-impact-of-speedy-poloz-hikes", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/bankofcanada.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 27, 2017 12:02 PM EDT", "content": "Officials within Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government are concerned the Bank of Canada is moving too quickly to raise interest rates, fearing higher borrowing costs could inadvertently trigger a downturn.Governor Stephen Poloz raised the central bank\u2019s key overnight rate this month for the first time since 2010, and another increase is expected by the end of the year. The officials, speaking anonymously because they\u2019re not authorized to comment, are concerned a series of rate hikes would lead consumers to claw back spending, stunting a recovery from a two-year oil shock.While Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau have steadfastly declined to comment on monetary policy, as is customary, some officials privately think Poloz hiked too soon. The concern comes amid global warnings that an era of rock-bottom interest rates has left consumers and countries alike over-leveraged and more vulnerable than ever to hikes.There\u2019s no sign the government will intervene publicly in any way. The discontent, however, signals Trudeau and Morneau also don\u2019t plan to rein in a spending program, focused on infrastructure and payments to families, that\u2019s projected to result in deficits totalling $102 billion over the Liberal government\u2019s first four fiscal years.\u201cI do not comment on the Bank\u2019s independent decision,\u201d Morneau said in a statement this week. The government has \u201cmore work to do,\u201d he said, hinting at unease with the current recovery. \u201cAs we look at our next steps, it\u2019s clear we will move forward by continuing with an approach that\u2019s working, always with a strong middle class and long-term economic growth as our goals.\u201dRebecca Ryall, a spokeswoman for the Bank of Canada, declined to comment.Household debt is at unprecedented levels in an economy that has relied mostly on consumer spending for growth since the 2008-09 recession. The central bank decided July 12 to raise borrowing costs against a backdrop of broadening disinflation that seemed to argue against such a move.Household spending contributed 2.4 percentage points of the 3.7 per cent gross domestic product growth in the first quarter. That\u2019s the largest contribution made by households since 2010.In announcing the rate increase, policy makers said an acceleration in growth, and its broadening to more sectors and regions, has increased \u201cconfidence\u201d the economy will continue to absorb excess capacity. The central bank estimates the economy will return to full capacity by the end of this year.Red InkEconomists expect the deficit to shrink as the economy kicks into high gear, and one official said the government also expects higher revenues to narrow the gap. However, calls have surfaced for Trudeau to begin balancing the books now that Canada leads the Group of Seven in GDP growth.While Morneau has avoided commenting on the rate hike, he praises the growth that made it possible, which can be partly attributed to the government\u2019s fiscal measures. \u201cThe fact that the economy is going well is a positive,\u201d Morneau said at a July 18 press conference, where he acknowledged rising interest rates could slow consumer spending. \u201cThe changes in behavior would largely be around new purchases. That would be the most significant impact I would expect.\u201dA spokesman for Trudeau declined to comment on monetary policy.Trudeau faces potential political fallout from any hike. Canada\u2019s most indebted households overlap demographically with his base of support \u2014 higher debt servicing costs spell trouble for the poster-family of Trudeau\u2019s first budget \u2014and polling has shown Canadians aren\u2019t immediately feeling the boom.Indebted FamiliesThat all underpins the officials\u2019 concern. Canadians are uncharacteristically vulnerable to increases in rates because of high levels of debt, the officials said. Complicating forecasts is that an entire generation of young adults has grown up with the belief that money is essentially free to borrow and won\u2019t adjust quickly enough, they said.The scale of concern varies among the officials, who acknowledge Poloz may yet be proven right. If Canada is entering a sustained expansion, then growth will more than account for rising rates.However, if Poloz\u2019s timing is wrong and the hike triggers a pullback in consumer spending, Canada\u2019s economy will be in trouble, the officials said. Low inflation and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar further indicate Poloz might have started a policy action that wasn\u2019t needed, one official said.Another wrinkle is the outlook for Alberta, the hub of Canada\u2019s energy sector, where a recovery was seen as the final domino that led to a rate hike. However, persistently low crude prices and a rising currency \u2014driven in part by Poloz\u2019s rate increase \u2014are a recipe for another slowdown in an oil sector whose revenues are largely derived in U.S. dollars, the officials said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Fed holds rate, could start unwinding balance-sheet in September", "description": "Fed watchers say \u2018relatively soon\u2019 signals the central bank could announce the timing of their balance-sheet reduction as early as September", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-says-balance-sheet-unwind-to-start-relatively-soon", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/janet-yellen.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 26, 2017 3:34 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve officials said they would begin running off their US$4.5 trillion balance sheet \u201crelatively soon\u201d and left their benchmark policy rate unchanged as they assess progress toward their inflation goal.The start of balance-sheet normalization \u2014 possibly as soon as September \u2014 is another policy milestone in an economic recovery now in its ninth year.

The central bank will raise borrowing costs in October, and then twice in 2018 to bring its benchmark interest rate to 1.5 per cent, according to the median forecast of 16 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Ten respondents said inflation risks for monetary policy are now tilted to the \u201cdownside,\u201d and the next chance to see whether the data bear that out will be Friday, when the federal statistics agency reports June inflation numbers.Governor Stephen Poloz flagged the risk of higher inflation as one reason the central bank hiked for the first time in seven years last week. Yet rapid inflation is among the least of Poloz\u2019s concerns, according to the survey. Asked to rank five risks to monetary policy in order of importance, economists put \u201cinflation overshoots\u201d last.Instead the biggest risk is the opposite one, they said: that inflation remains below target. They flagged a housing correction and U.S. policies that hurt Canada\u2019s economic growth as the second-biggest.Peak RateThat means Canada\u2019s policy interest rate will rise more gradually over a longer period, and won\u2019t hit the peak rate \u2014 the level needed to keep supply and demand in balance \u2014 until the fourth quarter of 2019, according to the median forecast, which also pegged the peak rate at 2.5 per cent. That would mean the current cycle lasts up to 30 months, compared to an average of less than a year since 1994.\u201cThe Bank of Canada is at risk of raising interest rates too fast due to faith in its models. Inflation has yet to bottom and housing is a big risk,\u201d James Orlando, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in an email responding to the survey.Poloz raised his policy rate to 0.75 per cent on July 12, the first Group of Seven policy maker to follow the tightening of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Poloz said he needs to start moving with inflation set to approach his 2 per cent target by the middle of next year as output returns to normal after an energy shock, and future moves will be guided by economic data.Inflation ScorecardPoloz will get his first scorecard on inflation trends since the rate increase on Friday at 8:30 a.m. when Statistics Canada reports the consumer price index for June. Pricing information will likely be under heavier scrutiny, and here\u2019s what you need to know:The average of the trimmed mean, common, and median core inflation measures \u2014 used by policy makers to analyze underlying trends of inflationary pressures \u2014 was sitting around 1.3 per cent as of May, the lowest since 1999.  The central bank\u2019s former core measure, abandoned in late 2016 and which excludes eight volatile components and the effects of indirect taxes, is at 0.9 per cent, matching the lowest level in the history of the data.Economists expect June inflation to rise 1.1 per cent from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a separate Bloomberg survey, down from 1.3 per cent last month, which was the lowest reading of 2017.  Downside surprises are becoming normal for this indicator. Readings for the annual rate of total inflation have missed median forecasts in 9 of the last 12 releases.In last week\u2019s Monetary Policy Report, the Bank of Canada explained part of the current softness in overall inflation to be temporarily caused by declines in electricity prices. Prices for electric power have certainly been deflationary in Ontario \u2014 down more than 16 per cent from a year earlier after the government introduced rebates. Elsewhere in Canada it\u2019s a different story, where prices are returning to historical averages and have been above headline CPI for the last two months.Whether inflation gets back to target in about a year as the Bank projects may also depend on its judgment that the big shocks are a thing of the past. Since the global banking crisis struck in 2008 and oil prices slumped in 2014, there have been two periods where it\u2019s taken about two years for the inflation rate to move back above 2 per cent after receding below that mark.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "How the Bank of Canada's rate hike could spell trouble for Trudeau\u2019s middle-class dream", "description": "The rate hike announced last week by the Bank of Canada comes as Canadians grapple with record debt levels, and sets up potential friction with the government", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/polozs-rate-hike-spells-trouble-for-trudeaus-david-and-neera", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/poloz-trudeau.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 19, 2017 8:02 AM EDT", "content": "For one view of Canada\u2019s rate hike, consider the case of David and Neera. He can\u2019t get a raise, is worried about retirement and they borrowed money a couple years ago to fix the roof. Interest costs will jump now, with vacations and kids\u2019 clothes already out of reach.Justin Trudeau\u2019s entire economic agenda is aimed at David and Neera \u2014 we know, because he invented them. Their story anchored the Liberal government\u2019s debut budget, tying together the impact of all the prime minister\u2019s measures. Now they\u2019re a cautionary tale.\u201cCanadian families are also taking on more debt to make ends meet,\u201d the 2016 budget said. \u201cFor David and Neera, this debt is a constant source of worry.\u201dThe rate hike announced last week by Governor Stephen Poloz comes as Canadians grapple with record debt levels, and sets up potential friction with the government. Trudeau may not welcome Bank of Canada rate increases, given the pressure they place on the finances of middle class households, yet the prime minister\u2019s own expansionist fiscal measures could force the central bank to hike more quickly to contain inflation that results from stronger growth.Economists expect another rate increase by the end of the year, which would likely boost borrowing costs on everything from home and car loans to credit lines. A 2015 report from the Bank of Canada pinpointed those most exposed to higher rates: mainly younger, lower- and middle-income homeowners in some of the country\u2019s most populous centers, not unlike the fictional David and Neera. Those regions also largely form the base of Trudeau\u2019s political support.The bank review focused on what it called \u201chighly indebted households,\u201d or those with a debt-to-income ratio of at least 350 per cent. It found they made up 7.9 per cent of all indebted households in 2012-14, up from 4.1 per cent seven years earlier.The share of total household debt held by the most highly leveraged Canadians rose to 21 per cent from 13 per cent, and mortgages now make up 87 per cent of their debt, up from 80 per cent. \u201cSince real estate assets account for about 90 per cent of these indebted households\u2019 total assets, their net worth could be particularly affected by a house price correction,\u201d the bank found. The situation of the highly indebted could also \u201cchange materially in an environment of rising interest rates.\u201dThe Bank of Canada reported last month that, for insured mortgages, the proportion of highly indebted borrowers \u2014 defined in this case as those with loan-to-income ratios greater than 450 per cent \u2014 rose to 17 per cent nationally in the first quarter 2016 before declining to 10 per cent a year later. The central bank pointed to tightened mortgage eligibility rules as the cause of the decline. However, the changes probably contributed to the growth of uninsured mortgages, which the bank flagged as a potential risk to financial stability.Electoral MathHighly indebted households are on the front line of any rate-hike impact. The growth in such cases skews younger, less-educated and to the middle of five income quintiles \u2014 decidedly the middle class on which Trudeau stakes his brand. They tend to live in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, the latter two of which include vote-rich Vancouver and Toronto, whose hot housing markets have been targeted by policy makers hoping to avoid a crash. Indeed, values have slumped of late, though mortgage delinquency isn\u2019t yet a problem.Trudeau\u2019s electoral base overlaps largely with these at-risk borrowers. Compared to his national result, he drew disproportionately high support in Toronto and Vancouver, and in Ontario overall, but lower-than-average support in Alberta and British Columbia, polling conducted by Abacus Data after the 2015 election shows.The Liberal leader was popular among younger voters \u2014 beating the rival Conservatives in every age group under age 65. However, the Conservatives outperformed their own national result among those with high-school education or less, a group over-represented in the new crop of highly indebted households. Abacus found the Liberals and Conservatives tied among that cohort.Trudeau\u2019s support has shifted somewhat since. His Liberals now have support of 31 per cent of voters with a high school education or less, compared with 40 per cent for Conservatives, according to a poll conducted in June by the Angus Reid Institute. Trudeau continues to hold a commanding lead among younger voters, the survey found.\u2018Amplified\u2019 ImpactTrudeau and Poloz won\u2019t clash immediately. Stephen Gordon, an economist at Laval University in Quebec City, said any tension would be twofold: Poloz might have to tighten more quickly because Trudeau\u2019s deficit agenda is adding more money into the economy, and a faster pace of rate hikes could also magnify costs for the heavily indebted.\u201cThis could mean that the consequences for highly-leveraged households would be amplified,\u201d Gordon said in an email. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere close to a narrative in which middle-class households are going bankrupt because Justin Trudeau\u2019s government is spending too much. But it\u2019s something to keep in mind over the next couple of years.\u201dThe middle class, and its spending power, is core to Trudeau\u2019s agenda. Among his first moves was a tax cut for middle-income earners and a hike for high earners. Speaking this month at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, the prime minister said that wasn\u2019t \u201cout of class warfare or envy or anger,\u201d but rather because when the spending power of the middle class jumps, \u201cbusinesses have more customers, society is more stable.\u201dMorneau\u2019s MessageTrudeau\u2019s finance minister, Bill Morneau, has sidestepped questions about rate increases and focused instead on economic growth, saying Canada leads the Group of Seven partly because of the government\u2019s measures. He dodged a rate question again Tuesday during an announcement of tougher tax rules for the rich.\u201cCanadians as a whole are more resilient than they were a year ago because of the improvements in the economy,\u201d he said, conceding that interest rates will change borrowing behaviors. \u201cIt is playing out largely the way we thought it might.\u201dAnd yet, early last year, David and Neera\u2019s tale in his debut budget document hinted at a forthcoming tension with the country\u2019s central bank.\u201cThe more that families owe, the harder it is for them to save and plan for their future.

The Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate last week as the economy picked up.The country\u2019s regulators and various levels of government have tried to cool the housing market in the last few years, with several mortgage, bank, and insurance rules announced in the past 10 months alone. The regulations have already contributed to a slide in sales and in some cases prices in the country\u2019s largest city and financial capital, Toronto.The mortgage delinquency rate remained below 1 per cent in the fourth quarter, \u201csuggesting the mortgage market is not under additional stress,\u201d according to the report. The arrears rate was highest among borrowers who were at least 65 years old, while those aged 45 to 64 saw a slide in arrears. Mortgage holders with a recent bankruptcy comprised less than a quarter of all bankruptcies, and the number of home-loan borrowers who\u2019ve had a recent bankruptcy has decreased since 2014.The agency still issued a warning about the level of household debt to disposable income\u2013 which reached a peak of 167.2 in the fourth quarter.\u201cHigh levels of household indebtedness remain a key concern of the financial system,\u201d the agency said in the report that used data from credit ratings-agency Equifax, which has information representing about 85 per cent of all mortgages in the country. \u201cWhile the credit situation of Canadians has generally improved, those with a mortgage have performed better.\u201dOne area of concern CMHC flagged is the auto sector, with loans rising 8.4 per cent in the fourth quarter to $68.8 billion. They only comprise about 4 per cent of total outstanding credit, but delinquency rates \u2014 or loans that are at least 90 days past due\u2013 increased to about 1.8 per cent in the quarter from 1.4 per cent in the year-ago period.Bloomberg\u00a0"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Good news, gold will hit $1,400.

The central bank estimates the economy will return to full capacity by the end of 2017. In April, it had predicted the closing of the output gap in the first half of 2018. The bank estimates the degree of excess capacity in the second quarter of this year is between zero and 1 per cent of GDP \u2014 The central bank downplayed recent weakness in inflation, judging the sluggishness as \u201cmostly temporary.\u201d It predicted inflation will return \u201cclose to\u201d its target of 2 per cent by the middle of 2018 \u2014 which is later than it had predicted in April.

One of the big questions investors had ahead of the rate decision was whether the central bank\u2019s focus was the 50 basis points of cuts implemented in 2015.

Markets are pricing in another quarter point hike by the end of the year.Any increase \u2014 the first by the Bank of Canada since 2010 \u2014 would reflect the recent acceleration in Canadian growth, but investors are looking at the decision as a possible harbinger of things to come globally and are monitoring it for clues on the central bank\u2019s resolve for withdrawing stimulus.\u201cWhile we usually do not care about Canadian monetary policy, if the BOC goes through with its first rate hike since the crisis on Wednesday, then the yield pressure may mount even further,\u201d John Cairns, a currency strategist at Johannesburg-based RMB, said in a client note.The prospect of central bank tightening has triggered a selloff in government bond markets over the last two weeks, with yields on 10-year Treasury notes jumping to as high as 2.39 per cent, from as low as 2.10 per cent in mid-June. In Canada, two-year yields have surged 26 basis points over the past two weeks, the most for that maturity among developed-market countries tracked by Bloomberg.Here\u2019s a quick guide to Wednesday\u2019s rate decision.Canada is in the midst of one of its strongest growth spurts since the 2008-2009 recession, with the expansion accelerating to an above-3 per cent pace over the past four quarters. That\u2019s the fastest among Group of Seven countries and double what the central bank considers Canada\u2019s capacity to grow without fuelling inflation.Like the U.S., the country\u2019s labour market has also been running hot, with the jobless rate at the lowest since before the recession.The improving outlook is giving Canadian policy makers confidence the economy has gathered enough steam to start weaning itself from the cheap credit that has left the country vulnerable to a financial crisis. Household debt is hovering at record levels and low borrowing costs are fuelling housing prices.That Canada would be the first country to follow the U.S. higher isn\u2019t a major surprise: the neighbours are among the world\u2019s largest two-way trading partners, and the U.S. accounts for 75 per cent of Canada\u2019s exports. No other G-7 nation\u2019s monetary policy is more closely aligned to the Fed.The main thing that prevented the Bank of Canada from following the Fed higher since 2015 was a collapse of oil prices that shaved $60 billion annually off national income.Canada \u2014 the classic small, open economy \u2014 has been a harbinger of major changes in the global monetary system in the past. In 2015, its rate cuts helped kick off a global trend that saw nations accounting for almost half of global output \u2014 including China, Denmark, Sweden, Indonesia and Australia \u2014 follow suit.Bank of Canada officials are indicating they plan to raise interest rates by at least 50 basis points \u2014 the amount of additional stimulus the central bank provided in 2015 to counter the oil collapse. Or as Governor Stephen Poloz put it in an interview with CBC Radio last month, the recovery \u201csuggests to us is that the interest rate cuts that we put in place in 2015 have largely done their work.\u201dThat will only leave the country back at 2014\u2019s still low levels, and one of the big questions from Wednesday\u2019s rate decision \u2014 and the true test of whether the country is entering a full tightening cycle \u2014 will be what Poloz indicates about hikes beyond 1 per cent.\u201cAs to whether the full report will be deemed hawkish or dovish will arguably come down to two factors \u2014 to what degree the Bank emphasizes the need for quick removal of the 50 basis point of oil-related insurance cuts in 2015 and how much future, upside inflation risks are emphasized requiring a more aggressive and traditional hiking program,\u201d Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a note last week.While the Bank of Canada has suddenly adopted a tightening bias over the past month, there is nothing specific in their comments that indicates an interest rate hike is coming Wednesday. Some economists still expect the central bank will wait a few months.Investors\u2019 rate hike expectations are in part based on conjecture. Why did the central bank choose to change its messaging last month? If he wasn\u2019t in a rush, and intended on raising rates later this year, Poloz could have set the stage at today\u2019s rate decision, which also coincides with new quarterly forecasts and a press conference.But the same questions around sluggish inflation apply in Canada as they do elsewhere. While the Bank of Canada is assuming inflation will inevitably rise as the job market tightens \u2014 indeed, Poloz said in a recent interview he expects inflation to be well into an uptrend in the first half of 2018 \u2014 there\u2019s little sign of pressure right now, something that usually signals a weaker-than-desired economy.Other developments that could give the Bank of Canada reason to pause are the Canadian dollar\u2019s surge over the past month, plus the continued slump in oil prices. And with a hawkish tone priced into the Bank of Canada\u2019s decision, the more likely direction of any surprise would be markets pricing in too much of a change in policy direction.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Canadian home buyers are losing steam \u2014  and cash, as rate hike looms", "description": "One of the country's hottest real estate markets in Toronto is slowing due to recent measures and in anticipation of an interest rate rise", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/mortgages-real-estate/canadian-home-buyers-losing-steam-and-cash-as-rate-hike-looms", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/0517_biz_gm_a.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 11, 2017 3:11 PM EDT", "content": "By Katia DmitrievaBroker John Pasalis knew Canada\u2019s hottest housing market was cooling but an email from desperate sellers showed him just how bad it was.A young couple had been looking to cash in on their three-bedroom home in a Toronto suburb after prices rose 25 per cent in April from the prior year. They soon found first-time buyers who agreed to pay $900,000 and, assured of the deal, the couple bought another larger home further away from the city. But the market began to turn just before the closing date in June, and the buyers reneged on the deal, forfeiting their $40,000 deposit.Plunging sales, a surge in listings, and eroding prices that spooked these buyers may worsen if the Bank of Canada raises borrowing costs as expected this week. The move would be the latest blow for a market that\u2019s become unhinged in just three months, with\u00a0the near-collapse of mortgage lender Home Capital Group Inc. and as policy makers look to rein in runaway prices and risk.\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a domino effect, it\u2019s all sort of happening right now and we don\u2019t know the extent of it,\u201d said Pasalis, president of brokerage Realosophy Realty Inc. in Toronto. \u201cPeople are digesting rules, the amount of inventory on the market with lower prices \u2014 and there\u2019s even more to come.\u201dThe chain of events began in October when the federal government tightened mortgage insurance requirements, and continued into April when the province imposed a 15 per cent tax on foreign purchasers. Home sales fell 37 per cent in June from a year earlier and prices rose the least since January 2015. Then last week the regulator said it\u2019s considering requiring lenders to stress test uninsured mortgages, which is expected to cool things further.On top of all this, Governor Stephen Poloz will lift the benchmark overnight rate on Wednesday to 0.75 per cent from 0.5 per cent, according to 22 of 31 economists in a Bloomberg survey while the rest see no change. The rate could rise to or past 1 per cent in a year, a separate survey shows. In anticipation, Canada\u2019s biggest banks are also tightening. Royal Bank of Canada raised its fixed rates for 2-,3-, and 5-year term mortgages by 20 basis points.An increase of 75 basis points to 100 basis points in the Bank of Canada\u2019s key rate by the end of 2018 would remove 6 per cent to 8 per cent of buyers from the country\u2019s real estate market if banks fully price it into their loans, according to\u00a0Will Dunning, chief economist at industry group Mortgage Professionals Canada. A slowdown in property deals may pose a risk to Canada\u2019s growth \u2014 the fastest among G7 countries \u2014 just as the economy seems to be overcoming a slump triggered by a drop in global oil prices.\u201cRight now people are staying away from buying,\u201d Dunning said by phone. \u201cIf they stay away over a longer period of time, that could become dangerous, that could become deflationary.\u201dThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions announced Thursday it is considering three measures targeting over-leveraged borrowers in the uninsured mortgage market, which\u00a0comprises about half the $1.5 trillion mortgages outstanding in the country. They include asking lenders to stress test uninsured mortgages, or those borrowers who put at least a 20 per cent downpayment, and matching the loan-to-value ratios, or the loan amount compared to how much the house is appraised at, with local market conditions.If finalized, the OSFI requirements would hit the alternative lending market harder than Canada\u2019s six big banks. In such a scenario, residential mortgage debt growth would slow to as little as 2 per cent each year from 6.3 per cent now, Royal Bank of Canada analysts including Geoffrey Kwan and Darko Mihelic wrote in a\u00a0July 9 note titled \u201cCruel Summer.\u201d Laurentian Bank Securities analyst Marc Charbin downgraded Home Capital to a hold from buy rating, forecasting a slowdown in loan growth. He also lowered the target price for the alternative lender and its rival Equity Financial Holdings Inc.A rate increase from the central bank may price people out of the property market but it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, said Craig Wright, chief economist at RBC Capital Markets. A debt-to-income ratio hovering near a record \u201csuggests the economy and consumer sector is more sensitive to smaller increases in interest rates than we\u2019ve seen in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will have an impact \u2014 it\u2019s exactly what rates are supposed to do. But it\u2019ll be a cooling in the market, not a collapsing.\u201dJames Laird, president of brokerage CanWise Financial, is seeing an increasing number of clients refinancing and renewing to lock in the low rates. That\u2019s why he said a single rate hike won\u2019t have much of an impact, and he\u2019d only be worried if tightening is stepped up to about 300 basis points. Laird also welcomes the return of rationality.\u201cIt was one of the craziest real estate markets I\u2019ve experienced in the last 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bidding wars were wild. That pivoted fairly quickly this spring.\u201dBloomberg "}]
