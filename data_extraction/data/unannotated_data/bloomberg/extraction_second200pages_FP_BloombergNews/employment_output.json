Together with other measures, that could save $2 billion this year, according to report from Toronto-Dominion Bank last week. Allowing other programs to lapse could save another $1 billion while freezing a minimum wage hike may support employment and boost revenues, the bank said.But the Progressive Conservative government, which swept to power in June, also made some costly campaign pledges which could push the budget shortfall to as high as $18.7 billion in 2019-20, according to TD. Those promises included a cut to corporate and personal income taxes and reduction in the gas tax.\u201cHow this is going to line up with the campaign promise to balance is going to be interesting,\u201d said Joey Mack, Toronto-based director of fixed income at GMP Securities LP. \u201cBut given all the announcements pointing to huge deficits, I don\u2019t think we will get too much reaction\u201d if the deficit stays below $18 billion, he said.Ontario is expected to grow at about 2 per cent this year and 1.9 per cent next year according economists\u2019 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.Ontario bonds have declined 1.5 per cent this year, trailing the 1.3 per cent drop for Quebec and 1.1 per cent for the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch bond index of provincial borrowers. Investors in Ontario\u2019s 2.9 per cent bonds due 20128 demand about 67 basis points over similar duration federal Canada debt, according to bid prices in Bloomberg.While risk premiums aren\u2019t a source of big concern, the absolute yields are rising as the Bank of Canada and other central banks around the world increase interest rates to cool inflationary pressures. Since the end of June, when Ford took office, the yield investors demand to hold province\u2019s debt maturing between three months and five years have increased between 40 and 50 basis points, Bloomberg data show.\u201cAn interest rate increase of 25 basis points will cost Ontario taxpayers an additional $100 million a year in interest payments,\u201d Fedeli wrote in a Nov. 1 opinion column for the Toronto Sun. \u201cFor the government of Ontario, interest rate increases pose a significant challenge.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Torres", "title": "Federal Reserve stands pat on interest rates ahead of expected December hike", "description": "By keeping the door open to a fourth 2018 hike in December, officials are sticking to their gradual upward path", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-stands-pat-on-interest-rates-ahead-of-expected-december-hike", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/jerome-powell.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 8, 2018 2:12 PM EST", "content": "The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and stayed on course to hike in December as strong economic growth, higher tariffs and rising wages look set to spur inflation.The central bank said \u201ceconomic activity has been rising at a strong rate\u201d and job gains \u201chave been strong,\u201d acknowledging a drop in the unemployment rate, while repeating its outlook for \u201cfurther gradual\u201d rate increases in its statement Thursday following a two-day meeting in Washington.Risks to the outlook appear \u201croughly balanced,\u201d the Federal Open Market Committee said, leaving that language unchanged from the prior meeting in late September. Inflation expectations, which have slipped slightly in recent weeks according to some measures, were described as \u201clittle changed, on balance,\u201d the same as in the last statement.By keeping the door open to a fourth 2018 hike in December, officials are sticking to their gradual upward path, trying to prolong the second-longest U.S. expansion on record without making an error. Leaving monetary policy too loose risks stoking excess inflation and asset bubbles, while tightening too fast could cause a recession.The unanimous 9-0 decision left the benchmark federal funds rate in a target range of 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent, following eight quarter-point hikes since late 2015. The interest rate the Fed pays banks on excess reserves \u2014 a tool for keeping the effective funds rate within the Fed\u2019s target range \u2014 was left unchanged at 2.2 per cent, as expected.In one of the only other tweaks to the statement, the FOMC said growth in business fixed investment has \u201cmoderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year,\u201d compared with the previous assessment that it has \u201cgrown strongly.\u201d Third-quarter data showed non-residential investment increased at the slowest pace in almost two years.Meanwhile, household spending \u201chas continued to grow strongly,\u201d the Fed said, echoing its previous assessment of consumption, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the economy.Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are feeling their way toward a more normal policy setting after years of extraordinary stimulus.The tightening cycle may be crimping some segments of the economy. U.S. stocks suffered their steepest losses last month since 2011 in part because of concern the Fed could slow the economy too much. Sales of previously-owned homes were down 4.1 per cent in September from a year earlier, and the cost of a 30-year fixed mortgage hit an eight-year high last week.The task of getting policy right is also complicated by harsher political scrutiny. President Donald Trump criticized past rate shifts and blamed the Fed for the market meltdown in advance of this week\u2019s midterm elections, which delivered control of the House of Representatives to Democrats.A year since being nominated by Trump to helm the Fed, Powell is overseeing an economy in a sweet spot: It grew 3 per cent over the past four quarters, and for the first time since the Fed introduced its 2 per cent inflation objective in 2012, both the headline and core measures of year-on-year price changes hit the goal in September.Unemployment is at 3.7 per cent, the lowest in 48 years, while rising wages and demand for labour are pulling more people into the workforce, helping offset retirements by baby boomers.Fed officials will update their forecasts in December having previously penciled in three increases in 2019, which would put the main rate roughly at levels that policy makers see as neither boosting nor restraining the economy.Thursday\u2019s Fed decision will be the last one without a press conference by the chairman. Powell\u2019s final regularly scheduled quarterly briefing will occur after December\u2019s gathering, and in 2019 he will begin speaking to reporters after every FOMC meeting.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Frederic Tomesco", "title": "Bombardier plummets most in three years as hopes dim for turnaround", "description": "Plan to slash 5,000 jobs and sell two businesses for $900 million", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/airlines/bombardier-sinks-as-weaker-cash-flow-view-fuels-turnaround-doubt", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/bombardier1.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 8, 2018 12:07 PM EST", "content": "Bombardier Inc. tumbled the most in more than three years as a weakened cash-flow forecast sowed doubts about Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare\u2019s progress in turning around the debt-laden maker of trains and aircraft.The company will only be able to attain its target of breaking even on a cash-flow basis this year by including the proceeds from a US$635 million land sale in Toronto. The previous forecast excluded those funds. Bellemare cited capital needs at the company\u2019s rail business for spoiling the cash-flow goal, which includes leeway of plus or minus US$150 million.\u201cInvestors won\u2019t like the big chop to cash-flow guide, which raises questions regarding management credibility and ability to complete a successful turnaround,\u201d Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen & Co., said Thursday in a note to clients.The Canadian manufacturer is working off US$9.5 billion in adjusted debt, which was largely incurred as it poured money into two aircraft-development programs plagued with delays and cost overruns. The Global 7500 private jet is set to debut next month, marking the end of the company\u2019s heavy investment cycle. Bombardier ceded control of the CSeries passenger plane in July to Airbus SE, which renamed it the A220.Bombardier\u2019s widely traded Class B shares plunged 13 per cent to $2.76 at 11:12 a.m. after sinking as much as 27 per cent for the biggest intraday decline since January 2015. The drop threatened most of the stock gains since the deal with Airbus was announced last year.Bellemare also accelerated his push to streamline Bombardier by announcing 5,000 job cuts and the sale of the company\u2019s Q400 turboprop operation and a training business.The company will reap about US$900 million from the asset sales and save about US$250 million a year by 2021 from the employment reduction, which is the CEO\u2019s third since taking the reins in 2015. The cut represents more than 7 per cent of the company\u2019s workforce.Half the lost jobs will be in Bombardier\u2019s home province of Quebec. The provincial government gave the company a lifeline about three years ago by agreeing to invest US$1 billion in the CSeries program. The Canadian government provided Bombardier with $372.5 million in reimbursable funding for the CSeries and Global 7500 programs last year, stopping short of directly investing in the company.\u201cThis is very bad news, it sends a worrisome message about the future of the industry,\u201d Renaud Gagne, head of the Unifor labour union\u2019s Quebec branch, said in a statement. \u201cWe are in the dark as far as what comes next.\u201dBombardier will sell its Q Series turboprop program and de Havilland trademark to a subsidiary of Canada\u2019s Longview Aviation Capital Corp., the parent company of Viking Air Ltd., which makes the Twin Otter propeller plane. CAE Inc. will buy Bombardier\u2019s business-jet flight and technical training activities.Bellemare probably isn\u2019t done remaking Bombardier. The company said it will \u201cexplore strategic options\u201d for its CRJ regional-jet program. The focus for now is on reducing cost and increasing volumes while optimizing aftermarket revenue for about 1,500 CRJs in service.The moves hasten a future in which growth will revolve around private jets and trains.Together, those two businesses accounted for about 88 per cent of third-quarter sales.Bombardier\u2019s liquidity boost from the asset sales should bring the company closer to reacquiring a minority stake in its rail business from the Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, RBC Capital Markets analyst Walter Spracklin said. The company is assessing buyback options for the stake, Bombardier chief financial officer John Di Bert said on a conference call with analysts.With the aerospace investment effort complete, key engineering team members will be redeployed. The largest group will move to the private-plane operation \u201cto ensure they have all the necessary capabilities for future business jet development programs,\u201d Bombardier said.The Montreal-based manufacturer is counting on a 2019 sales boost after next month\u2019s expected debut of the Global 7500, its largest business aircraft. Bombardier expects to deliver 15 to 20 of the planes next year, and twice as many in 2020, Di Bert said.Revenue will increase about 10 per cent to US$18 billion in 2018, with earnings before interest, taxes and special items targeted to climb about 20 per cent to as much as US$1.25 billion, the company said. The job cuts are expected to result in a restructuring charge of about US$250 million.In the third quarter, adjusted earnings rose to 4 cents a share, topping the 2 cent average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 5.1 per cent to US$3.64 billion, compared with the average estimate of US$3.87 billion. The company burned through US$370 million of cash in the period, an improvement from the US$495 million it used a year earlier.Results in Bombardier\u2019s regional aircraft business, which includes the Q400 turboprops and the CRJs, have traditionally lagged those of trains and business jets.In the third quarter, the commercial aircraft business recorded a loss of US$9 million before interest, taxes and special items.

The unemployment rate fell back to 5.8 per cent in October, matching a four-decade low. That was due in part to an 11,200 increase in employment, but also a falling labour force, which was down 18,200 for the month.While the labour force numbers suggest the jobs market may be tightening, wage pressure isn\u2019t yet evident \u2014 which should ease the Bank of Canada\u2019s concern about an overheating economy.In addition, Canada\u2019s labour force has increased by just 62,500 so far in 2018, one of the smallest 10-month gains in recent history. The participation rate fell to 65.2 per cent last month, the lowest in two decades.Wage gains slowed for a fifth straight month, and were up 2.2 per cent from a year ago, the slowest since September 2017 and down from as high as 3.9 per cent earlier this year.

Yet analysts continue to predict gains for the loonie, with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey showing it appreciating to 80 US cents by the end of next year from current levels around 76.90.\u201cGood economic conditions in Canada are leading toward ongoing tightening by the Bank of Canada,\u201d said Greg Anderson, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Bank of Montreal, who expects the Canadian dollar to strengthen to about 78.74 US cents over the next three months.While the price of WCS is trading close to its widest discount to WTI on record, the world\u2019s 11th largest economy is running near its potential and the unemployment rate has fallen to around 5.9 per cent as other sectors such as technology boom. Businesses see their sales outlook improving, according to Bank of Canada\u2019s survey conducted last month. And that was even before the country cemented a deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which had been a source of considerable uncertainty.The fixed-income market is currently pricing in about four increases over the coming year for the BOC\u2019s benchmark, which currently stands at 1.5 per cent. The odds of an increase at next week\u2019s meeting have climbed to around 84 per cent and economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict it will rise to 1.75 per cent, the highest in a decade.Oil prices are no longer a good proxy for Canadian currency trends, in part because the local energy sector isn\u2019t receiving the kinds of foreign investment it used to, according to Bank of Montreal\u2019s Anderson. Government data show that oil and gas accounts for around 15 per cent of the foreign stock of investments in Canada. That\u2019s down from about 17 per cent in 2014, before a decline in oil prices triggered a swath of restructuring across the industry.The correlation between the loonie and WCS was strong as recently as 2016, before falling off, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The correlation was strong even for most of 2015 as well, when a sharp decline of oil prices triggered an outflow of investment in Canadian energy industry.That said, energy products \u2014 including oil \u2014 do still account for a significant chunk of the nation\u2019s exports, so it certainly can\u2019t be ignored by the nation\u2019s central bankers. It\u2019s something that the Bank of Canada may point as a reason to insist on pursuing a gradual tightening path, according to Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at TD Securities.There is also potential for energy to recover some of its influence on the currency further down the track with the development of a $40 billion liquified natural gas project on the coast of British Columbia. But cash is unlikely to flow from that for quite some time and it\u2019s largely irrelevant for the loonie at the moment, according to Darcy Briggs, a Calgary-based portfolio manager at Franklin Bissett Investment Management, which has around $6 billion in fixed-income assets.With the new North American free trade agreement pending ratification, and the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate hike path priced-in, some strategists are watching Canada\u2019s terms of trade.

The electric-car maker seems to be \u201cbetween a rock and a hard place\u201d because it needs to raise money through an equity or debt offering, and \u201ceither will be difficult,\u201d she said in an interview. Her fund, which has raised about US$30 million to date, is focused on identifying frauds or accounting vulnerabilities that could cause a stock to lose more than 60 per cent of its market value.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more apparent that Tesla is having difficulties paying their bills,\u201d Quadir said. \u201cI saw a lot of the same with Valeant.\u201dTesla shares fell 3.5 per cent to US$253.75 at 9:51 a.m. in New York.Tesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. While it\u2019s been burning cash and losing money for much of its time as a public company, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said the carmaker is on the verge of earning money and generating cash as it ramps up production of its Model 3 sedan. He told employees in an internal email last week that they were \u201cvery close to achieving profitability and proving the naysayers wrong.\u201dQuadir launched her fund in January to much fanfare after her research was publicly praised by storied short seller Marc Cohodes, the former head of hedge fund Copper River Management. She was formerly an equity analyst for Krensavage Asset Management, a New York-based firm that makes long and short wagers on stocks, with a focus on health care.With Tesla, Quadir is betting against a company that ended June with just US$2.2 billion in cash, and accounts payable \u2014 a measure of short-term debts to creditors or suppliers \u2014 of more than US$3 billion. In a memo to suppliers in July, the company asked some suppliers to refund some payments to help it turn a profit. This week, Tesla resolved a dispute with Nevada a day after the state went to court to try to collect an allegedly unpaid US$655,000 unemployment tax bill.Tesla is one of the most bet-against stocks in the U.S., with short interest hovering around 26 per cent of free float, according to data compiled by financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Musk, who is also the company\u2019s largest shareholder, has long been consumed with investors wagering against the electric-car maker and has trolled them on Twitter. In May of this year, he warned that the \u201cshort burn of the century\u201d was coming soon.Shares of Tesla rebounded on Tuesday after closing a day earlier at the lowest in 18 months. Musk has agreed to settle a fraud lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over tweets he sent in August in which he claimed to have the funding to take the company private.But a tweet storm last week in which he mocked the agency as the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission,\u201d plus billionaire David Einhorn\u2019s investor letter comparing the carmaker\u2019s woes with the failed bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., weighed on the stock. Einhorn, the president of hedge fund Greenlight Capital LLC, has been vocal about his Tesla short for years.While Tesla is a \u201clow-conviction\u201d call for Quadir, her \u201chigh-conviction\u201d pick is MiMedx Group Inc., whose shares are down about 70 per cent from their peak in January. The biotech firm is under investigation by the Justice Department and the SEC for its accounting and business practices. MiMedx didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment.Safkhet Capital\u2019s short positions range from 3 per cent to 25 per cent of the fund\u2019s gross exposure.Quadir remains short Valeant, which has renamed itself Bausch Health Companies Inc, though her fund now has a much smaller position. While the stock has risen 24 per cent this year, it\u2019s still trading down about 90 per cent from an August 2015 peak. Quadir started shorting the shares in June of that year.The fundamentals of Bausch Health \u201cdeteriorate everyday,\u201d Quadir said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a melting ice cube.\u201dBausch spokeswoman Lainie Keller declined to comment in an email.Quadir starred opposite Pershing Square Capital Management CEO Bill Ackman in the Netflix documentary series \u201cDirty Money.\u201d The episode \u201cDrug Short\u201d recounted how Valeant used a bewildering pace of acquisitions to cover up a questionable business model and shoddy accounting.Short sellers including Quadir and Citron Research founder Andrew Left prevailed over Ackman, who lost more than US$4 billion on his Valeant long bet, according to Bloomberg calculations based on public filings.

This illustrates the depth of the \u201creturner mom\u201d issue in Japan, a country that can ill afford to turn them away as it fights a persistent labour shortage and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pushes women-friendly workforce policies.\u201cThere is more daycare in Japan, for sure, but it\u2019s a cat-and-mouse game and the waiting lists are getting long,\u201d said Tsukiko Tsukahara, president of Kaleidist K.K., a Tokyo-based research and consulting firm.Yukie Watabe, 38, is one of the moms who left her job. She, like many Japanese women, had an education and early working life equal to that of men of her generation. She graduated from prestigious Waseda University in 2002 and worked at a string of impressive financial institutions \u2014 Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., Nikkei Shimbun Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities \u2014 before taking a job at a fund management firm in Tokyo.Then she discovered she was pregnant. That effectively ended Watabe\u2019s corporate career, a path she had been pursuing for a decade. And once her son was born in August 2013, she encountered the next hurdle facing many mothers in Japan \u2014 the notoriously long lines for child care in many neighbourhoods. She switched fields and, in 2015, started an online fashion company, Ayuwa Inc.\u201cTo this day, I don\u2019t understand why I had to leave the corporate world after years of hard work just because I got pregnant,\u201d Watabe said.Little ImmigrationWorking mothers are held back in Tokyo in ways they aren\u2019t in other financial hubs such as Hong Kong and Singapore. In addition to societal pressure on women to care for children themselves, Japan\u2019s long-standing opposition to immigration means that families don\u2019t have affordable options for in-home child care.So after taking advantage of Japan\u2019s liberal maternity leave, many mothers face the reality that they have nowhere to leave their baby so they can go back to work. Parents are allowed to request a leave \u2014 it\u2019s mostly mothers who do \u2014 until a child is a year old and can extend it to 24 months if they can\u2019t find child care, at about 67 per cent of base salary or more. Many end up extending without pay after 24 months because of a lack of child care.As mothers delay returning to their jobs, men continue to significantly outnumber women in Japan\u2019s workforce. While women\u2019s participation increased to a record 67 per cent last year, according to the government, that includes part-time workers. In a 2014 report, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated that closing the gender employment gap in Japan could lift the gross domestic product by almost 13 per cent.If women have more than one child and are out of work for several years, their skills often atrophy \u2014 especially in a fast-paced digital environment \u2014 and they\u2019re viewed as being on \u201cthe mommy track,\u201d that is, less serious about their careers. Hence, the job may not be there when they\u2019re ready to return.What Is Womenomics, and Is It Working for Japan?: QuickTake\u201cThe challenge that is unique in Japan is that domestic help is not as available as it is in Hong Kong and Singapore,\u201d said Yumiko Murakami, head of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Tokyo Centre. \u201cThat is a very big factor in terms of how easy it is for women to work and have kids. We don\u2019t have that in Japan. That\u2019s a problem.\u201dHiring a nanny is not an easily accessible option for most working mothers, said Kumi Sato, president and chief executive officer of Cosmo, a Tokyo-based public relations firm. She is the American Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Japan chairman emeritus and vice chair of a task force that\u2019s been lobbying for changes to immigration laws to help working mothers.In Singapore and Hong Kong, the cost to hire foreign nannies is about US$500 to US$700 a month for working six days a week. In Japan, it costs three times as much: 200,000 yen to 250,000 yen (US$1,770 to US$2,215).\u201cRight now in Japan, hiring a nanny is considered a luxury,\u201d Sato said.The OECD\u2019s Murakami discovered this firsthand several years ago. She worked in New York for Goldman Sachs and was being transferred to Tokyo. A colleague was in the same situation \u2014 the only difference, she said, is that she\u2019s a Japanese passport holder and he\u2019s an American. So he could bring in a foreign nanny but she couldn\u2019t.\u201cI had a problem; I had three kids under the age of five,\u201d she said. She found a Japanese woman who agreed to live in and take care of her children. \u201cIt was sheer luck,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was expensive, yet I was lucky I could find her and afford a live-in nanny. That\u2019s not an option for 99 per cent of Japanese families.\u201dJapan's workforce shrinks by 200,000 people every year as women quit their jobs to have childrenWaiting ListsSo daycare centres become the focal point for child care in Japan. The government said it spent 1.32 trillion yen in fiscal 2018, an increase of 14 per cent from the previous year, to build and staff more centres. That was an addition of about 11,000 slots in the past year. Murakami, whose children ended up going to daycare centres, said the quality is very high.\u201cThey are unbelievable \u2014 inexpensive and amazingly fantastic,\u201d she said.That\u2019s if you can find a space. As fast as the centres are being built, they are filling up. The most recent data from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare show 19,895 children were on the waiting list as of April 1. Yet this represents progress \u2014 it\u2019s the first time in 10 years the number has fallen below 20,000 children. The biggest demand for care is for babies up to one year old.Major ContradictionHideo Kumano, chief economist for the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, calls it a major contradiction that so many women are dropping out of work amid Japan\u2019s deepening labour shortage. Production capacity and revenue take a significant hit when women don\u2019t return to their previous jobs, exerting an opportunity cost on the economy, Kumano said.Japan\u2019s workforce shrinks by 200,000 people every year as women quit their jobs to have children, the Dai-ichi institute said. Their absence works out to 636 billion yen in lost wages, and the drop in productivity costs Japanese companies 1.17 trillion yen a year, the Tokyo-based institute said.Abe has said his administration will tap underutilized parts of the workforce, including women and older people, to boost productivity and counteract the country\u2019s population decline without turning to immigration reform.\u201cThe problem is that (Abe) has wavered on those policies,\u201d Kumano said."}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada posts strongest jobs gain this year \u2014 led by part-timers", "description": "All the gains were part-time and wage growth slowed", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-posts-strongest-jobs-gain-this-year-led-by-part-timers", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/hiring.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 5, 2018 8:58 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy recorded its best monthly job numbers this year, but the gains were all part-time and wage growth slowed.Employment increased by 63,300 in September, on a more than 80,000 gain in part-time work, Statistics Canada said Friday from Ottawa. Full-time employment was down by 16,900. Economists were anticipating a 25,000 increase on the month.While this particular data series tends to be volatile, the overall picture of Canada\u2019s jobs market so far this year has been one of decent employment gains that are neither too hot nor too cold.Canada has produced employment gains in three of the last four months and the economy added 65,800 jobs in the third quarter, all part-time.

At this time last year, the economy had added 273,300 jobs \u2014 a pace that was largely seen as unsustainable.Canada\u2019s unemployment rate dropped to 5.9 per cent in September from 6 per cent a month earlier, near the lowest in four decades.Wage gains slowed sharply in September to 2.4 per cent from 2.9 per cent in August.

The increase was even greater \u2014 34 per cent \u2014 for a subset of transactions priced above $4 million.Deals went the opposite way in Vancouver, a pricier market that\u2019s still adjusting to new regulations, including a provincial foreign buyers tax and speculation tax, on top of the rising interest rates that affect the whole country. Sales for $1 million or more dropped 24 per cent, while in the $4 million-plus range, the decline was 33 per cent.Toronto\u2019s top-tier market will \u201crun at full throttle\u201d this fall after holding its own in the face of rapid policy changes, higher borrowing costs and stricter lending guidelines, according to Brad Henderson, the brokerage\u2019s president and chief executive officer. By contrast, buyers will hold the upper hand in Vancouver, with high-end sales and prices softening.Vancouver\u2019s slowdown is \u201ca reflection of the concern that people have about the current and continued government intervention in the marketplace,\u201d Henderson said by phone. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the primary difference\u201d between the cities.Luxury sales in both cities plunged in the first half of the year largely in response to the federal government\u2019s tighter mortgage rules, put in place on Jan. 1 to tame speculative purchases across Canada. Condos in Vancouver, however, were bucking the trend, with sales rising as buyers shifted away from the city\u2019s costlier detached homes.That growth was short-lived.

In the Toronto region, meanwhile, luxury-condo purchases had their strongest gains of the year, jumping 28 per cent.In Montreal, where July and August\u2019s $1 million-plus sales jumped 19 per cent, sustained demand will continue to fuel growth this fall, according to Sotheby\u2019s.

A NAFTA collapse coupled with a trade fight would curb growth by 0.6 percentage points next year and then another 0.7 points in 2020, the group estimates. President Donald Trump has threatened to leave Canada out of an agreement the U.S. struck with Mexico and impose auto tariffs on his northern neighbour.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development Thursday also trimmed its forecast for Canada\u2019s economic growth next year.The OECD now sees Canada\u2019s economy expanding 2 per cent in 2019, rather than the 2.2 per cent it forecast earlier.The lack of clarity on the future of the trade agreement is creating an \u201cuncertain operating environment,\u201d and only 34 per cent of business leaders believe now is a good time to invest, the lowest level since 2008, Matthew Stewart, the conference board\u2019s national forecast director, said in the report.

Nationally, the economy lost 92,000 part-time workers, though a 40,400 gain in full-time employment is one sign the labour market is firmer than the headline number suggests.The data released Friday by Statistics Canada in Ottawa reversed strong employment gains made earlier this summer, including sharp increases in Ontario. But the overall picture is one of a labour market gearing down markedly from last year and an economy not at risk of overheating. That reinforces expectations the Bank of Canada will take a cautious approach to increasing borrowing costs.The jobs numbers are \u201cconsistent with a gradual rate hike path and really not a whole lot of urgency,\u201d said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.The Canadian dollar slipped after the jobs report, down as much as 0.3 per cent to 75.8 US cents. The currency rose as much as 0.4 per cent Thursday after Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said the central bank\u2019s top officials debated this week whether to accelerate the pace of potential interest rate hikes, before finally choosing to stick to their current \u201cgradual\u201d path.The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since mid-2017 to keep inflation from moving permanently beyond its 2 per cent target, and indicated it will need to make additional hikes to keep price gains from accelerating because the economy is roughly at capacity.So far in 2018, the economy has shed 14,600 jobs, but the number masks a 97,300 gain in full-time jobs. Part-time employment is down by 111,900 this year.The net loss in August \u2014 which was the second largest monthly decline since the last recession \u2014 drove the unemployment rate to 6 per cent, from 5.8 per cent a month earlier, while wage gains decelerated to their slowest this year. However, the jobless rate still remains near four-decade lows.Economists had expected a gain of 5,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.Other highlights:\u2022 Wage gains for all workers slowed in August, with average hourly pay up 2.9 per cent from a year ago. That\u2019s the slowest pace since December. Wage gains for permanent employees were down to 2.6 per cent, the slowest since October.\u2022 Actual hours worked were up 1.6 per cent from a year ago, after an increase of 1.3 per cent in July, reflecting the increase in full-time workers.\u2022 By industry, the decline was broad-based and included a loss of 16,400 jobs in construction and 22,100 in the professional services sector.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Bank of Canada set to hold interest rates \u2014 for now", "description": "The possibility of a trade shock is just one of a long list of uncertainties that has kept the central bank spreading out rate hikes", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-set-to-hold-interest-rates-for-now", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 4, 2018 2:50 PM EDT", "content": "The Bank of Canada is expected to hold borrowing costs steady Wednesday in what will probably be just a pause on its hiking path.After four increases since mid-2017, including at their last meeting in July, investors and economists anticipate policy makers will take a breather this week and leave the benchmark overnight interest rate at 1.5 per cent, before raising again as early as October.After a prolonged period of sluggish growth, the economy is finally doing well enough that it no longer needs abnormally low interest rates \u2014 even in the face of all the uncertainty around trade. Governor Stephen Poloz\u2019s job is to wean Canada off of easy money in a way that doesn\u2019t inadvertently damage the expansion and to do that, he needs to decide on two things: How high do interest rates need to go, and how quickly should policy makers raise borrowing costs to get there?As many as three more increases are priced in over the next year. In all, the market is expecting a string of hikes that will bring official borrowing rates back up to 2 per cent for the first time in a decade. Canada has the second highest central bank rate in the Group of Seven after the U.S.This is considered a gradual path for rate hikes. The central bank\u2019s models are already telling policy makers they\u2019re behind the curve on normalizing borrowing costs but last week\u2019s developments on the North American Free Trade Agreement highlight why Poloz will avoid rushing. Canada is still on the outside looking in on a NAFTA deal, has already been hit by U.S. metals tariffs and is facing Donald Trump\u2019s repeated threats of auto tariffs. None of this will be resolved by Wednesday and may be enough in itself to keep policy makers on hold.With the possibility of a trade shock to the economy still real, the Bank of Canada is wary of the consequences of having to reverse policy in midstream. And trade is just one of a long list of uncertainties \u2014 the list includes questions over whether the economy truly is at capacity \u2014 that has kept the central bank spreading out rate hikes.Another major unknown for policy makers is how high rates should go. The central bank\u2019s economists estimate the economy\u2019s \u201cneutral\u201d rate \u2014 a level that is neither stimulative or contractionary \u2014 is somewhere around 3 per cent, but Poloz has been explicit that there is plenty of uncertainty around that figure.It\u2019s possible that given high debt levels and other factors, such as the inability of the nation\u2019s businesses to capitalize on strong global demand, the economy can\u2019t really cope with an official rate of interest much above 2 per cent. Lending rates offered by commercial banks to their best customers are typically another 2 percentage higher than the overnight rate.Which is why markets are anticipating Poloz won\u2019t raise his benchmark rate much beyond 2 per cent by next year, and that he\u2019ll leave it there indefinitely until the question of what is \u201cnormal\u201d can be answered with more certainty.While normal remains a puzzle, there is more certainty about what is abnormal. For Poloz, it\u2019s a situation where the policy rate is below the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent inflation target. And, he has claimed, there is nothing in the economy now that would justify rates below that level.Canada is experiencing broad-based growth and absorbing much of the remaining slack in the economy. Evidence of tightening is mounting: the unemployment rate is hovering at four-decade lows, workers are getting bigger pay raises, and companies are reporting record job vacancies. Inflation is at a G7 leading 3 per cent.Which is why the central bank\u2019s hiking path still has at least a bit to go.\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "With all this talk about trade, we\u2019re missing the real problem with Canada\u2019s economy", "description": "The biggest threat to Canada's economic expansion lies within its own borders", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-isnt-the-biggest-problem-facing-canadas-packed-economy", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/al-hstfiles-02.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 29, 2018 1:39 PM EDT", "content": "The biggest threat to Canada\u2019s economic expansion lies within its own borders, even as President Donald Trump pushes protectionism from abroad.The home-grown news is that the Canadian economy is closer to overheating than faltering on the back of the trade uncertainty, forcing the Bank of Canada to respond with higher interest rates.Statistics Canada is expected to report Thursday that growth accelerated to an annualized 3 per cent in the second-quarter, the fastest pace in a year. That should offset a weaker start to 2018 and puts the expansion on track for a gain of more than 2 per cent for the whole year after 2017\u2019s strong 3.1 per cent advance.Such robust demand is exposing how little spare capacity the economy has. Companies are running up against production constraints and labour shortages, while an inflation rate of 3 per cent is the highest in the Group of Seven.\u201cTrade uncertainty is on everyone\u2019s mind but demand is strong and so for a number of our clients labour is a bigger issue, and it includes both finding qualified skilled labour as well as upward pressure on labour rates,\u201d Royal Bank of Canada Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said in a telephone interview last week.The evidence of tightening is everywhere: the unemployment rate is sitting at four-decade lows; pay raises are picking up; and companies are reporting increasing number of job vacancies. Job listings show businesses giving thousands of dollars in signing bonuses to hairstylists and mechanics.At the same time, Canada now relies entirely on immigrants to grow its workforce as the population ages. According to Statistics Canada, the number of landed immigrants in the labor force in July was up by 164,000 over the previous 12 months, and down 72,000 for people born in Canada.Economists including those at the Bank of Canada estimate the nation\u2019s economy can\u2019t grow more than 2 per cent before inflation kicks in. Which is why the big question for financial markets right now is not how fast the expansion runs, but how quickly rates rise and by how much.\u201cJust about every firm I talk to is talking about labour shortages,\u201d said Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia. \u201cThe labour issue is a dominant issue facing businesses right now.\u201dTo be sure a breakthrough on trade would help ease some of those capacity constraints. While companies can\u2019t do much about demographics, they can find ways around labour shortages by buying more equipment and adopting new technologies. More certainty on trade should bolster their confidence and willingness to invest, and make them willing to offer higher wages to draw more people into the labour force.No one though is expecting another investment renaissance in Canada that could change the overall growth trend, partly because companies are wary of overextending themselves in an economy that\u2019s slowing down.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s willingness to increase immigration will help, but this too is increasingly becoming a politically contentious issue. More immigrants are also no panacea, since evidence suggests they may be less productive than the workers they replace.All this may leave companies struggling to keep up with demand in the future, potentially fuelling inflationary pressures.Investors see near-certain odds that by October, the Bank of Canada will raise borrowing costs for a fifth time since the hiking cycle began in July 2017, with as many as two additional increases by mid-2019.The central bank\u2019s own models say it\u2019s behind the curve on normalizing borrowing costs from historically low levels, but Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has stuck to a gradual path in the belief there\u2019s still some slack in the labour force, particularly among youth and women, that could be drawn in with lower rates.Economists also don\u2019t unanimously agree that supply is the major bottleneck in advanced economies like Canada. It may be that companies aren\u2019t investing in capacity because demand is being weighed down by other things like unequal distribution of wealth or a debt overhang. If demand is the problem, rate hikes may not be the solution.But the Bank of Canada\u2019s options are limited, given its prime mandate is to tackle inflation, not structural problems such as income inequality or production constraints. And with inflation already a full percentage point above the 2 per cent target, Poloz\u2019s patience is being tested.With assistance from Doug AlexanderBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Lu Wang and Sarah Ponczek", "title": "Trump says the stock market would crash if he were impeached.

Because without this thinking you would see numbers that you wouldn\u2019t believe, in reverse.\u201dHow seriously should people take Trump\u2019s claim that stocks would crash if he were kicked out of office? As you mull over an answer, consider what someone in the other party would say.Maybe there\u2019s a less subjective way to judge \u2014 with earnings estimates, perhaps, which have changed a lot during his presidency. Or maybe valuation. Neither is perfect, but nor is any quest for science in the stock market.Before digging in, acknowledge that stocks have enjoyed unusually strong gains since Election Day, with the S&P 500 rising at an annualized rate of 20 per cent, crushing the historical return of 9.4 per cent since 1927. At the same time, note the Trump return is only about 1 percentage point higher than the yearly gain since March 2009, an era mostly overseen by Barack Obama.Changes in earnings forecasts under Trump have been stark, compared with history. Last December, analysts were predicting S&P 500 earnings of about US$146 a share for 2018, forecasts that, thanks largely to the president\u2019s tax cuts, soared over the next two months, rising four times as fast as any period Bloomberg tracks. And companies made good: S&P 500 operating income jumped 24 per cent in each of the last two quarters and analysts see combined EPS of US$159 a share for all of this year.Predictions for 2019 profits also soared, going from US$163 a share at the start of the year to US$177 a share now, an upward revision that dwarfs any since at least 2012. Add to that a small bump in valuations: the S&P 500 fetched 20.07 times annual earnings on Election Day 2016 and 20.7 times now.So say what you will about intangibles, if you believe corporate earnings and valuation call the stock market\u2019s tune, it\u2019s hard to say the equity market doesn\u2019t owe at least some of its altitude to the president.Still, looking at earnings in isolation ignores a dozen other factors in speculating on how impeachment would affect stocks, from policy to sentiment to potentially catastrophic consequences for the country\u2019s social fabric. Any one of those could easily eclipse anything having to do with corporate profits. But without an obvious framework for gauging those outcomes, the income lens is what\u2019s left.In examining Trump\u2019s claim about a crash, investors might reasonably ask how much of the policy benefit would be rolled back if his presidency were threatened. Analysts were mostly skeptical the president is in any real danger and not sure there\u2019d be any major impact should he be.Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd.:\u201cFirst of all, it is very unlikely that President Trump would be impeached. If an impeachment did happen, we\u2019d experience volatility and perhaps a significant selloff, but I believe any such market moves would be short-term in nature. There are two reasons why: 1) We have already gotten the best of his agenda \u2014 tax reform and deregulation. Other elements of his agenda which he is currently pursuing, particularly his trade policies, are not supportive of growth and actually worry many business leaders. 2) Tax reform is the gift that keeps on giving. It will add to GDP growth for years to come \u2014 in fact, the CBO projects it will have an increasingly positive impact on GDP growth in the next several years. Also, if he were to be impeached, Mike Pence would assume the mantle and he has a strong track record of stimulating growth in Indiana. We can\u2019t forget that the stock market is surprisingly resilient when monetary policy is accommodative, and it arguably is still accommodative.\u201dCraig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. in London:\u201cThe market isn\u2019t hinging on anything substantial that hasn\u2019t already been carried through. The markets have largely rallied on tax reform and we\u2019ve seen that reflected in company earnings. But if there\u2019s political instability and the U.S. economic growth slowed significantly, that would have global implications.\u201dGreg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments LLC:\u201cThe economy, amped up on stimulus, is growing by close to 4 per cent, and unemployment is below 4 per cent. If the trade wars cool off a little this fall, we still think stocks can grind higher. It\u2019s not a pretty picture here in Washington, but as long as Trump doesn\u2019t go totally off the rails, investors can compartmentalize. With two more Trump associates now facing jail time, chances have improved that the House will flip back to the Democrats, who in private concede that an impeachment debate probably will begin by late winter. But we\u2019re sticking with our call \u2014 while the House might indict Trump, Senate conviction still looks unlikely, unless there\u2019s a major change in the second point.\u201dPast instances of presidential turmoil showed contrasting stock returns. In February 1974, when Congress initiated impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon, the market was in the midst of a 1973-1974 bear market that was punctuated by an oil crisis and an implosion of the world\u2019s foreign change rate system. The S&P 500 tumbled more than 30 per cent through October that year.In December 1998, when the House launched impeachment on Bill Clinton, stocks kept rising during the last stage of the Internet boom. The S&P 500 climbed for five straight months till Clinton\u2019s acquittal in February 1999.S&P 500 futures were flat as of 9:20 a.m. in New York and the index barely budged Wednesday in the aftermath of convictions of the Trump associates that sparked renewed discussion of a potential impeachment.\u201cEquity markets don\u2019t seem to care, and we think they are right,\u201d Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note. \u201cRates are low, the dollar is strong and corporate earnings remain robust. Those are the only things stock prices can (and should) actually discount.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Dani Burger.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rebecca Greenfield and Riley Griffin", "title": "Artificial intelligence is coming for hiring, and it might not be that bad", "description": "'Identifying high-potential candidates is very subjective.

Employee referrals, a process that tends to leave underrepresented groups out,\u00a0still make up a\u00a0bulk of companies\u2019 hires. Recruiters and hiring managers also bring their own\u00a0biases to the process, studies have found, often choosing people with the \u201cright-sounding\u201d names and educational background.Across the pipeline, companies lack racial and gender diversity, with the ranks of underrepresented people thinning at the highest levels of the corporate ladder.\u00a0Fewer than five per cent of\u00a0chief executive officers at Fortune 500 companies are women, and that number will shrink further in October when Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi steps down.\u00a0Racial diversity among Fortune 500 boards is almost as dismal, as four of the five new appointees to boards in 2016 were white.\u00a0There are only three black CEOs in the same group.\u201cIdentifying high-potential candidates\u00a0is very subjective,\u201d said Alan Todd, CEO of CorpU, a technology platform for leadership development. \u201cPeople pick who they like based on unconscious biases.\u201dAI advocates argue the technology can eliminate\u00a0some of these biases. Instead of relying on people\u2019s feelings to make hiring decisions, companies such as Entelo and Stella.ai\u00a0use machine learning to detect the skills needed for certain jobs. The AI then\u00a0matches candidates who have\u00a0those skills with\u00a0open positions. The companies claim not only to find better candidates, but also to\u00a0pinpoint\u00a0those who may have previously gone unrecognized in the traditional\u00a0process.Stella\u2019s algorithm only assesses candidates based\u00a0on skills, for example, said founder Rich Joffe. \u201cThe algorithm is only allowed to match based on the data we tell it to look at.\u00a0It\u2019s only allowed to look at skills, it\u2019s only allowed to look at industries, it\u2019s only allowed to look at tiers of companies.\u201d That limits bias, he said.Last week, Entelo released Unbiased Sourcing Mode, a tool that\u00a0further anonymizes\u00a0hiring. The software allows recruiters to\u00a0hide\u00a0names, photos, school, employment gaps and\u00a0markers of someone\u2019s age, as well as to replace gender-specific pronouns \u2014 all in the service of reducing various forms of discrimination.AI is also being used to help develop\u00a0internal talent.\u00a0CorpU has formed a\u00a0partnership\u00a0with the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business to build a 20-week online course that uses machine learning to identify high-potential employees. Those\u00a0ranked highest aren\u2019t usually the individuals who were already on the promotion track, Todd said, and\u00a0often exhibit qualities\u00a0such as introversion that are overlooked during the recruitment process.\u201cHuman decision-making is pretty\u00a0awful,\u201d said Solon Borocas, an assistant professor in Cornell\u2019s\u00a0Information Science\u00a0department who studies fairness in machine learning. But we shouldn\u2019t overestimate the neutrality of technology,\u00a0either, he cautioned.Borocas\u2019s\u00a0research has found that machine learning in hiring, much like its use in facial recognition, can result in unintentional discrimination. Algorithms can carry the implicit biases of those who programmed them. Or they can be skewed to favour certain qualities and skills that are overwhelmingly exhibited among a given data set. \u201cIf the examples you\u2019re using to train the system fail\u00a0to include certain types of people, then the model you develop might be really bad at assessing those people,\u201d Borocas explained.'Supervised' algorithms can be directed to scan for individuals who, for example, went to Ivy League universities. 'Unsupervised' ones determine on their own which data to prioritizeNot all algorithms are created equal \u2014 and there\u2019s disagreement among the AI community about which algorithms have the potential to make the hiring process more fair.One type of machine learning relies on programmers to decide which qualities should be prioritized when looking at candidates. These \u201csupervised\u201d algorithms can be directed to scan for individuals who went to Ivy League universities or who exhibit certain qualities, such as extroversion.\u201cUnsupervised\u201d algorithms\u00a0determine on their own which\u00a0data to prioritize. The machine makes its own inferences based on\u00a0existing employees\u2019 qualities and skills\u00a0to determine those needed by future\u00a0employees. If that sample\u00a0only includes a homogeneous group of people,\u00a0it won\u2019t learn how to hire different types of individuals, even if they might do well in the job.Companies\u00a0can take measures to mitigate these forms of programmed\u00a0bias. Pymetrics, an AI hiring startup, has programmers audit its algorithm to see if its giving preference to any gender or ethnic group.

Much of their discussion during the meeting involved upside and downside risks.Some participants raised the concern \u201cthat a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could eventually trigger an economic downturn,\u201d the minutes said.Fed district banks reported that firms had \u201cgreater scope than in the recent past to raise prices\u201d in response to strong demand or rising input costs.They debated the impact of the fiscal stimulus with some noting \u201clarger or more persistent positive effects\u201d as a potential upside risk.\u201cAll participants pointed to ongoing trade disagreements and proposed trade measures as an important source of uncertainty and risks,\u201d the minutes said.The staff gave a presentation on the lower boundary on interest rates and alternative policy tools.

Gen Zers have never known a non-digital world and have grown up amid events such as the \u201cwar on terror\u201d and Global Recession.\u201cThe key factor that differentiated these two groups, other than their age, was an element of self-awareness versus self-centeredness,\u201d according to \u201cRise of Gen Z: New Challenge for Retailers,\u201d a report by Marcie Merriman, an executive director at Ernst & Young LLP. Millennials were \u201cmore focused on what was in it for them.

The combined population just shy of 2 billion in those four countries will have a ratio of 100 millennials for every 73 in Gen Z next year.India, which has about 1.3 billion people versus China\u2019s 1.4 billion, will see its Gen Z population rise to 472 million next year, 51 percent more than China\u2019s projected 312 million.According to an annual survey of young people by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd., \u201cGen Z respondents anticipate being slightly happier than their millennial counterparts,\u201d with those in emerging markets in both groups more optimistic about economics and social progress than counterparts in developed nations.\u201cIn China and India, 70 per cent of the younger group expects to be happier than their parents,\u201d according to the report, which surveyed about 10,000 millennials and 2,000 Gen Zers. \u201cHowever, across Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States (39 percent), the outlook is much less optimistic.\u201dIn Sub-Saharan Africa, where Gen Z already outnumbers millennials in all but two of about 50 nations thanks to reductions in early-childhood mortality or higher birthrates, growth comes with challenges.

The president nominates the Fed\u2019s chairman and other governors in Washington, but the agency is independent and has historically frustrated presidents by raising interest rates without regard for politics.Trump has publicly lamented the central bank\u2019s recent rate increases, but his private remarks to donors are the most personal criticism of Powell\u2019s performance to emerge so far. The people who described the comments asked not to be identified because the fundraiser was closed to the public.His jabs built on an attack he leveled at Powell\u2019s Fed in July, when he pronounced himself \u201cnot thrilled\u201d with the rate increases. That broadside, in an interview with CNBC, broke with a more than two-decade-old norm of presidents avoiding comments on monetary policy out of respect for the Fed\u2019s independence.The dollar, as measured by the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, reached its weakest level of the day following the report on Trump\u2019s comments at the fundraiser.Even as Trump complains, the Fed is moving more slowly to raise interest rates than it has in previous economic expansions. Interest rates are low by historical standards given an unemployment rate below 4 percent and, in recent months, accelerating economic growth.Powell and his colleagues have justified a cautious approach toward increasing rates by pointing to sluggish inflation, which has shown no sign of jumping significantly past the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target.The Fed last raised rates in June, to a target range of 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent. That\u2019s seen by most economists as below the so-called neutral rate of interest by about 1 percentage point, meaning the Fed is still adding fuel to U.S. growth rather than restraining the economy.The Fed has penciled in two more interest rate increases this year, according to projections it updated in June. Investors see a 90 per cent chance that the Fed will raise rates at its September meeting.White House spokesman Hogan Gidley and Federal Reserve spokesman David Skidmore declined to comment.About 60 people attended Trump\u2019s fundraiser at the Southampton home of Howard Lorber, the chairman of hot dog company Nathan\u2019s Famous.

It was a humid night and Trump joked that Lorber could have afforded better air conditioning, according to one of the people.An RNC spokeswoman said the event raised about US$3 million for the Trump Victory Committee, which benefits both the president\u2019s campaign and the party.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jeff Kearns", "title": "Tariffs hurting U.S. economy, economists warn, with more pain to come if Trump withdraws from NAFTA", "description": "In a survey, 91% said current tariffs and threats of more to come were having 'unfavourable consequential impacts' on the U.S. economy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/tariffs-hurting-u-s-economy-economists-warn-with-more-pain-to-come-if-trump-withdraws-from-nafta?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/donald_trump3.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 20, 2018 9:58 AM EDT", "content": "Business economists are sounding some sour notes about Trump administration policies, from trade to immigration to the budget, while expecting the short-term boost to growth from Republican tax cuts to lessen over time.The National Association for Business Economics survey showed 91 per cent of respondents said current tariffs and threats of more to come were having \u201cunfavourable consequential impacts\u201d on the U.S. economy, according to a report released Monday.

Other companies\u00a0are seeking a more balanced workforce. Uber Technologies Inc.\u2019s listings\u00a0show a\u00a050-50 split of technical to nontechnical roles.\u201cAs tech companies grow, so do the types of workers they need to help round out their business,\u201d wrote Amanda Stansell, the Glassdoor research analyst who conducted the study, in an email. \u201cThese companies not only need software engineers and data scientists but also sales managers to sell the product, project managers to oversee project workflows and HR to oversee the day-to-day well-being of company employees.\u201dWalmart eCommerce, Microsoft, Intel and Amazon are seeking the highest percentage of prospective employees with coding skills, according to Glassdoor.

They aren\u2019t entitled to stock and can\u2019t enter certain offices. Many don\u2019t have health insurance.Before each weekly Google all-hands meeting, trays of hors d\u2019oeuvres and, sometimes, kegs of beer are carted into an auditorium and satellite offices around the globe for employees, who wear white badges. Those without white badges are asked to return to their desks.Google\u2019s Alphabet Inc. employs hordes of these red-badged contract workers in addition to its full-fledged staff. They serve meals and clean offices. They write code, handle sales calls, recruit staff, screen YouTube videos, test self-driving cars and even manage entire teams \u2014 a sea of skilled labourers that fuel the US$795 billion company but reap few of the benefits and opportunities available to direct employees.\u00a0Earlier this year, those contractors outnumbered direct employees\u00a0for the first time in the company\u2019s twenty-year history, according to a person who viewed the numbers on an internal\u00a0company database. It\u2019s unclear if that is still the case. Alphabet reported 89,058 direct employees at the end of the second quarter. The company declined to comment on the number of contract workers.Other companies, such as Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc., some of the most cash-rich public companies, also rely on a steady influx of contractors. Investors watch employee headcount closely at these tech powerhouses, expecting that they keep posting impressive gains by maintaining skinnier workforces than older corporate titans. Hiring contractors keeps the official headcount low, and frees up millions of dollars to retain superstars in fields like artificial intelligence.The result is an invisible workforce, off the company payrolls, that does the grunt work for the Silicon Valley giants with few of the rewards. \u201cMany of these workers don\u2019t have a voice on the job. They don\u2019t necessarily get the benefits that many of us think about when working at a big, glitzy tech company,\u201d said Maria Noel Fernandez, campaign director for Silicon Valley Rising, a union-backed group based in San Jose, California that advocates on labor and housing issues.\u00a0\u201cAnd they\u2019re not really part of this wealth.\u201dContractors are on the rise at Google as the company spreads into new markets, such as devices and corporate services, which demand a larger salesforce. Conversations with more than 10 former contractors for Google and other Alphabet units paint a portrait of a permanent underclass. Google has a name for them: TVCs, or \u201ctemps, vendors and contractors.\u201d They are employed by several outside agencies, including Adecco Group AG, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. and Randstad NV. Google declined to say how many agencies the company uses.\u00a0Many current and former contract workers and full employees\u00a0declined to speak on the record because they didn\u2019t want to jeopardize their employment.Some direct employees took unusual steps this year to go to senior leadership with objections about the company\u2019s work with the military, its gender pay gap and its nagging issues with online harassment. Another issue Google employees are discussing bringing to management is the state of the contract workforce, according to four people familiar with the conversations. Yana Calou, an organizer with advocacy group Coworker.org who speaks with Google employees\u00a0and contractors, said that both groups are concerned about the workers who aren\u2019t full Google employees. \u201cThey feel isolated, precarious and like second-class citizens,\u201d Calou said. \u201cIt\u2019s a microcosm of what\u2019s happening in the economy as a whole.\u201dMany of these workers don't have a voice on the job. They don't necessarily get the benefits that many of us think about when working at a big, glitzy tech companyIn an emailed statement, a Google spokeswoman said the company hires TVCs for two primary purposes. One is when the company doesn\u2019t have a particular expertise in-house, such as shuttle bus drivers, quality assurance testers and doctors. Another is for filling temporary positions to cover for parental leave or spikes in work.Some contract workers viewed Google as a generous workplace that boosted their careers. Still, despite their ubiquity there, many felt peripheral. Several\u00a0noted the subtle slights apparent from their arrival. The first thing people eye at work, one former TVC recalled, is the colour of someone\u2019s badge.\u00a0TVCs aren\u2019t trusted with tasks outside their limited purview. Four different contractors described the sinking feeling of clocking in at 9:00 a.m. only to see full-timers trickle in an hour or two later. The same staff would leave the office around 3:00 p.m., often after a midday gym break.\u201cPeople look down on you even though you\u2019re doing the same work,\u201d said one contractor who spent two years at Google managing multiple other employees.\u00a0Said another ex-TVC: \u201cYou\u2019re there, but you\u2019re not there.\u201dGoogle\u2019s initial flood of contractors came with its first \u201cmoonshot.\u201d Dozens of temporary workers were hired, more than a decade ago, to photocopy dog-eared pages for the company\u2019s free digital library, Google Books. Like the company itself, the number of temporary workers has grown wildly.People look down on you even though you're doing the same workLike other firms, Google relies on outsourcing operations in Southeast Asia \u2014 rows of office workers in India and other countries that label mapping data and handle other relatively simple computing work. But Google also hires highly educated contractors\u00a0in its backyard. Some TVCs arrive with advanced technical degrees and years of experience, working on niche efforts like renewable energy and sensor design.The line between TVCs and full-timers is clear. One 2016 TVC employment contract from Zenith Talent Corp., a recruiting agency, states that TVCs \u201cwill not\u00a0be entitled to any compensation, options, stock, insurance or other rights or benefits accorded to employees of Google.\u201d The terms hold even if a court later determines the worker was legally a Google employee. Zenith did not respond to requests for comment.Another clause hints at the type of work Google contracts out. The TVC agreement includes a release for any \u201cadult content\u201d contractors may encounter at work. In signing, contractors relieve Google of any liability related to the material. In 2017, the company pledged to hire up to 10,000 content moderators in 2018 after mounting criticism of offensive videos on YouTube. Some of these moderators are full-fledged staff, but Google declined to say how many or provide an update.Several former contractors noted that Google does offer benefits for contractors that other large companies don\u2019t. TVCs can eat at cafeterias for free and use some company facilities like its bowling alleys and gyms. For many, a TVC position offers a foothold for a permanent role at Google or elsewhere.\u00a0Some highlights, however, come with an asterisk. To ride Google shuttles, which ferry staff to campus for free, TVCs must pay for each\u00a0ride. In an emailed statement, a Google spokeswoman\u00a0said that it charges TVCs less than US$2 per ride, and\u00a0if it provided TVCs with free shuttle service, that would be considered a taxable benefit.\u00a0Several former TVCs said they did not receive pay for sick days.The largest burden for many contractors is health care. All the contractors Bloomberg News spoke with said the contracting agencies, which are responsible for health insurance, offered either inadequate plans or none. One former TVC, who worked for Adecco, said he paid roughly US$600 out of pocket a month for coverage to treat diabetes. \u201cAdecco\u2019s only around for (human resources) and crappy benefits,\u201d this person said.Google referred inquiries about benefits for contractor employees to the companies that directly employ them, but said\u00a0its company culture requires that everyone is treated with care and respect. Adecco spokeswoman Mary Beth Waddill said the contractor does not disclose the terms of its contracts with clients, but that \u201cwe take great pride in being an industry leader who continually works to create meaningful career opportunities for all of our employees.\u201d Some TVCs are paid well. Contract software designers and other specialists were offered as much as US$150 an hour before taxes, above rival giants, according to two people familiar with the plans.\u00a0Vendors doing less technical work made less; one 2017 hiring contract in Europe, viewed by Bloomberg News, listed an annual salary of 28,000 Euros (US$32,767)\u00a0Google\u2019s sub-contracted janitors, who today number around 400, have been unionized since the year 2000. According to the Service Employees International Union, which represents them, they earn around US$26.39 in total hourly compensation, including the cost of benefits as well as their income.\u00a0In Google\u2019s home county of Santa Clara, a family of four with an income of as much asUS $94,450 a year is considered by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development to be \u201clow income\u201d; total annual compensation for a full-time Google janitor \u2014 including\u00a0benefits as well as wages \u2014 is a bit over half that amount.Google distances itself from responsibility if contractors encounter problems. In both hiring contracts Bloomberg News viewed,\u00a0the hiring agency is responsible for handling pay, benefits and any grievances contracted employees may have. However, Google asserts authority on key legal matters. Contractors must agree to assist Google in securing the company\u2019s intellectual property, and if Google is unable to get the worker\u2019s signature,\u00a0the search giant becomes the worker\u2019s de facto attorney. Contractors waive their rights to participate in class action lawsuits against Google.One person recently worked at Indian outsourcer HCL Technologies Ltd. fielding customer calls for Google\u2019s ads business. In multiple emails and complaints to HCL, the person described repeated verbal harassment from colleagues \u2014 including anti-Muslim and anti-Arab taunts. When no action was taken, the person sent emails to a Google manager and Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Sundar Pichai. The vendor received no response. HCL investigated the claims and found no cause for action, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg News. The person asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal from his current job.\u00a0Google did not provide comment on that episode, but a spokeswoman\u00a0said that TVCs have access to Google\u2019s complaint channel, and that it reviews those it receives and investigates when appropriate. HCL did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cWe have allowed businesses to really sever their responsibility for more and more for the people who create value,\u201d said David Weil, dean of The Heller School at Brandeis University and a former Labor Department official under President Barack Obama. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed them to have their cake and eat it too.\u201dOver the years, Google\u2019s influx of contractors has changed with investment priorities. Google Fiber, its broadband unit, was once a major contractor hub, but has scaled back operations. However, other parts of the company that lean on contract work are ramping up. Google\u2019s device sales and cloud-computing units both use call-centre support staff to handle customer issues.Artificial intelligence projects may do so as well. Duplex, Google\u2019s eerily human-sounding calling service, which debuts this summer, will turn to phone operators when the AI can\u2019t carry on the conversation. Some of those operators will be contracted out, executives said recently.Under Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, Alphabet has tightened its once freewheeling spending. Yet the company hasn\u2019t stopped its appetite for expensive engineers, who can easily fetch US$1 million a year or more. That decision necessitates more contractors. Every company division must petition for a budget and staff headcount. Talented engineers are pricey and take bites out of the budget. To compensate, managers will then fill out staff with TVCs, according to Jos\u00e9 Benitez Cong, a former Google hiring manager who runs the human resources firm Plause. \u201cCompanies are scaling faster than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cA company like Google may want to rely on contractors to maintain such growth.\u201dContractors can offer a potential regulatory break, too. Seattle recently weighed a tax based on the staff headcount companies have, a way to reap more from local giant Amazon. Officials in Google\u2019s hometown have voiced support.\u00a0A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment.Google\u2019s lengthy hiring process is also a factor, Benitez Cong said. Google employees can take several months to recruit, whereas the company can tap TVCs within weeks or even days. They can also be dismissed just as quickly.\u00a0One contract worker, who spent two years at Google, said TVCs devoted much of their day to \u201ctagging\u201d their work \u2014 a way to document what the worker\u00a0had done\u00a0for managers so it could be passed seamlessly to others, or replaced with automation. \u201cI felt the clock ticking,\u201d the person said. \u201cThat\u2019s a stressful experience.\u201dAnother recalled being sent from San Francisco to New York City, along with direct employees, for a marketing project. Before the assignment wrapped, the contractor got an unexpected email from his hiring agency asking him to turn in his laptop the next day. His stint at Google was up. \u201cPeople would just disappear,\u201d the ex-contractor said. That day he returned to his hotel, which Google covered, without an exit interview. He remembered\u00a0the email: \u201cThanks for the good work.\u201dLast year, a trio of Adecco employees who worked for Google\u2019s food delivery service filed two lawsuits at the Los Angeles County court against both companies. The contractors claim Adecco withheld wages and did not provide meals and rest periods required under California law. Through their lawyer, Paul Tashnizi, the employees declined to be interviewed.\u00a0Some of the claims have been forced into arbitration, and the others are on hold in the meantime.Adecco is a favourite contractor for the tech giant. The Swiss temp agency, which posted 23.6 billion Euros (US$26.73 billion)\u00a0in revenue in 2017, secures staff for Google\u2019s maps, cloud and apps units, as well as for Waymo, Alphabet\u2019s autonomous car unit. For multiple former Adecco hires, however, the company was virtually absent. Several people recalled seeing its staff when they joined Google and again when they left. According to two former Google managers, Adecco takes roughly 20 per cent of the pay of Google\u2019s contracted employees.\u00a0Adecco did not answer questions about those claims, but\u00a0spokeswoman Waddill said that \u201cwe continuously listen to our employees\u2019 needs and work to provide them an outstanding experience,\u201d including when it comes to the company\u2019s \u201cunique benefits packages.\u201dIn recent years, Google has brought some contract positions in-house. Following criticism, in 2014 it announced that some security guards would become direct staff. Most contractors do not work longer than two year stints, according to multiple contract workers who spoke to Bloomberg News, but some serve multiple terms on the hopes of becoming direct employees. Google did not provide data on how many achieve that.And for many white-collar TVCs, the second-class status at the first-rate tech behemoth pays off. TVCs are asked to list their status as contractors on LinkedIn accounts \u2014 but they can still mention Google. Chris Szymczak, a former TVC who worked on marketing for Google from Poland, said multiple full-time coworkers served as a reference for future work. \u201cThey were just immensely supportive even past our work relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gig was a real springboard for me.\u201dThat ladder is not available for everyone. One former TVC recalls an uncomfortable lesson. A new executive came to the division, sat down with each staffer and asked about his or her \u201cfive-year plan,\u201d a standard managerial tactic. The next day, the manager returned sheepishly, explaining that he didn\u2019t realize his report was a contractor rather than full-time staff. He asked that they forget their conversation entirely.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Stefanie Marotta", "title": "Toronto's tech scene gets hotter, beating San Francisco Bay area in new jobs and New York in 'talent'", "description": "Toronto is among the best values for tech firms, CBRE Canada says, citing cheaper labour and real estate and a well-educated workforce", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/torontos-tech-scene-gets-hotter-beating-san-francisco-bay-area-in-new-jobs-and-new-york-in-talent?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 24, 2018 11:30 AM EDT", "content": "Toronto\u2019s tech scene is so hot the city created more jobs than the San Francisco Bay area, Seattle and Washington, D.C., combined last year, while leapfrogging New York in a ranking of \u201ctalent markets.\u201dToronto was the fastest-growing tech-jobs market in 2017, according to CBRE Group Inc.\u2019s latest annual survey, released Tuesday. The city saw 28,900 tech jobs created, 14 per cent more than in 2016, for a total of more than 241,000 workers, up 52 per cent over the past five years, CBRE said. Downtown, tech accounted for more than a third of demand for office space.Canada\u2019s biggest city took fourth place in \u201ctech talent,\u201d a broad measure of competitiveness, pushing New York down a notch and coming in just after the Bay Area, Seattle and the U.S. capital. CBRE ranked 50 markets across North America, using measures such as talent supply, concentration, education and cost as well as outlooks for job and rent growth for both offices and apartments.The real estate services firm cited some 5 million technology workers in the U.S. and more than 830,000 in Canada, across all sectors.For employers, combined labour and occupancy costs increased in every market, by 13 per cent even in the least expensive one, Montreal.\u201cCompanies looking to house operations are putting serious thought to locating in Canada,\u201d Paul Morassutti, executive managing director at CBRE Canada, said in a statement accompanying the report. Toronto is among the best values for tech firms, he said, citing cheaper labour and real estate and a well-educated workforce. The U.S. Midwest offers good value as well, the report noted.A 500-worker company requiring 75,000 square feet (7,000 square metres) of office space can expect total annual costs, in U.S. dollars, to range from US$27.6 million in Montreal to US$32.2 million in Ottawa, with Toronto in the middle at US$30.2 million. The costs in Rochester, New York, the cheapest U.S. market of those CBRE studied, amount to US$36.3 million, while the Bay Area adds up to US$57.4 million.\u201cThe forces that are driving innovation and technology are really in the early stages here,\u201d Morassutti said by phone. \u201cWhen it comes to overall costs, even if you assume upward pressure on office rents, housing and salaries, our major markets still constitute a significant bargain to the U.S.\u201dTo measure a market\u2019s growth potential, CBRE looked at the concentration of technology labour as a percentage of total employment. Here the winner was Ottawa, Canada\u2019s capital, at 11.2 per cent, more than three times the U.S. national average of 3.5 per cent. Toronto came in third, at 8.9 per cent.\u201cOttawa is shedding its government-town image. It is home to over 1,700 technology companies and employs over 70,000 tech-talent employees,\u201d Shawn Hamilton, managing director of CBRE Ottawa, said in the statement. \u201cIn the last five years, urban tech has grown to be the second-largest user group in downtown Ottawa, bigger than the accounting and legal sectors combined.\u201dU.S. markets rising in the study\u2019s ranks include Cleveland and Columbus, in Ohio, and San Diego.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jonathan Browning and Stefania Spezzati", "title": "FX trader put on \u2018naughty step\u2019 by RBC wins dismissal case in London", "description": "RBC says it would appeal the ruling", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/fx-trader-put-on-naughty-step-by-rbc-wins-dismissal-case", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/0612rbc.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 20, 2018 11:01 AM EDT", "content": "A former Royal Bank of Canada currency trader who was \u201cput on the naughty step\u201d and eventually fired after making repeated complaints about lapses in the lender\u2019s compliance procedures won his London unfair-dismissal lawsuit.John Banerjee said in an interview that RBC promoted a culture of \u201cindolence\u201d where employees failed to sufficiently read through policies and when he pointed the fact out to senior managers, it lost him his job. The lender blamed his lack of punctuality.The bank\u2019s culture was one of \u201cindolence, frankly, and a feeling of arrogance,\u201d Banerjee said, adding that RBC simply wasn\u2019t concerned with ensuring internal compliance with the rules. \u201cWas I unusually zealous in doing this? Well it turns out yes, I was very unusual.\u201dThe trader will learn the size of his compensation at a further hearing in December. RBC, which fired Banerjee in August 2016, saying he repeatedly turned up late for work, said it would appeal the ruling.Banerjee said RBC\u2019s compliance culture didn\u2019t go beyond a \u201cbox-ticking\u201d exercise, that allowed employees to sign off on policy documents having barely read them. Pointing out a broken link to an internal policy document placed him on \u201cthe naughty step,\u201d he said. RBC failed to undertake a proper investigation and shut Banerjee\u2019s complaint down, Judge James Tayler said in his ruling.\u201cThe bank\u2019s actions thereafter were the opposite of their fine, but empty, words,\u201d Tayler said.RBC said in a statement today it encourages a \u201crobust compliance culture which includes promoting the freedom for employees to speak up and blow the whistle.\u201dWhistle-blowing claims are frequently added to U.K. employment tribunal lawsuits to overcome an 83,700-pound (US$109,000) cap on compensation for wrongful dismissal.

The charity Whistleblowers U.K. was supporting Banerjee\u2019s case.The Financial Times reported on the ruling earlier.Banerjee \u201cis dogged in the extreme and, on occasions, chose the wrong battles to fight. No doubt, he was a thorn in the side of his management,\u201d Tayler said in his ruling. \u201cMost people choose to stay silent when something is wrong, as they want a quiet life. Those who blow the whistle must have remarkable and, at times, exhausting determination.\u201d\u201cI have been applying for jobs,\u201d Banerjee said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s quite clear rather like whistleblowers in any industry, but particularly in finance, I\u2019ve been told that I won\u2019t be touched with a bargepole.

Some of their predecessors on the front lines are not so sure.Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner and Henry Paulson all voiced varying degrees of concern about America\u2019s ability to combat another financial meltdown 10 years after they played prominent roles battling the last one.While agreeing that the banking system is a lot stronger than it was back then, they saw some weak spots in the country\u2019s crisis-fighting arsenal that didn\u2019t exist a decade ago. The trio also decried the nation\u2019s ballooning budget deficits in a joint briefing with reporters.Publicly-held federal debt now stands at 77% of GDP, double what it was in 2007\u201cWe\u2019ve got better defences against the more mild, typical sets of shocks that happen to economies and financial systems but in the extreme crisis probably less degree of freedom, more constraints than would be ideal,\u201d former Treasury Secretary and New York Federal Reserve Bank President Geithner said.The U.S. instituted a raft of reforms after the last crisis drove the economy into its worst recession since the Great Depression. Some were designed to fortify the country\u2019s biggest banks and make it easier to shut them down so they wouldn\u2019t have to be rescued by the government if they ran into trouble.Others though limited the discretionary power of the Fed, the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to provide financial institutions with support as lawmakers responded to a public backlash against bailouts and Wall Street.Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles acknowledged in April that the tools available to regulators in an emergency had changed. But he told a conference in Washington, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too negative about our ability to respond in the future.\u201dHis boss, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, has voiced confidence in the government\u2019s ability to shut down a failing financial institution in a crisis without having to sink money in it, telling lawmakers in November that no bank is too big to fail.Geithner, who is president of private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, argued that the emergency powers that proved so essential a decade ago are \u201csomewhat weaker\u201d today.Former Treasury Secretary Paulson agreed, pointing in particular to the limits that Congress placed on the FDIC and the Treasury\u2019s Exchange Stabilization Fund.\u201cThere is some concern there,\u201d said former Fed Chairman Bernanke, who is now a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, though he also noted that regulators are now more attuned to potential systemic risks.The former Fed chief, who was nominated by George W. Bush and given a second term by Barack Obama, criticized the deficit-ballooning tax cuts and spending increases agreed to by President Donald Trump and Congress as ill-timed. Bernanke noted that they come as the country is at or near full employment. He also voiced concern about the longer-term consequences of rapidly rising government debt.\u201cIf we don\u2019t act, that is the most certain fiscal or economic crisis we will have,\u201d said Paulson, who chairs his own institute in Chicago. \u201cIt will slowly strangle us.\u201dThe enlarged deficits and debt also mean that the government has less room to pump up demand than it did during the last crisis, when Obama pushed through a massive stimulus package, Geithner said.Publicly-held federal debt now stands at 77 per cent of gross domestic product, double what it was in 2007.The Fed, too, has less scope to act as interest rates are lower, Geithner said. The central bank\u2019s benchmark rate target is now 1.75 to 2 per cent. It was 5.25 per cent in July 2007.Bernanke though noted that the U.S. central bank is better positioned to respond than other advanced economies. The European Central Bank, for instance, has a benchmark interest rate of zero.The former Fed chairman said the U.S. had made \u201ca lot of progress\u201d toward being able to resolve failing financial institutions without having to bail them out.Paulson basically agreed, with one big proviso. In the midst of a crisis, policy makers may have to provide temporary support so that a collapsing institution can be liquidated over time \u2014 even if that proves politically difficult to do.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have this authority but somebody has got to be prepared to use it and use it in controversial ways,\u201d he said.Asked if policy makers and politicians would be able to set aside their differences to tackle any future turmoil given the toxic atmosphere in Washington, Paulson replied that the answer is \u201cunknowable.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cit\u2019s the right question to ask.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Lilian Karunungan, Jasmine Ng and Abhishek Vishnoi", "title": "'No question': U.S. trade war is an early sign of a global financial crisis coming our way", "description": "'We must remember we're coming off from a period of cheap money'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/no-question-u-s-trade-war-is-an-early-sign-of-a-global-financial-crisis-coming-our-way", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/mobius.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 11, 2018 9:15 AM EDT", "content": "For Mark Mobius, there may be worse to come even after the U.S. fired new shots in its trade war with China: a further 10 per cent drop in emerging-market stocks and a global financial crisis.\u201cThere\u2019s no question we\u2019ll see a financial crisis sooner or later because we must remember we\u2019re coming off from a period of cheap money,\u201d the veteran investor in developing nations said in an interview in Singapore. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a real squeeze for many of these companies that depended upon cheap money to keep on going.\u201dTighter liquidity as the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank normalize monetary policy has weighed on emerging markets this year, along with the rising dollar and deteriorating trade backdrop. The dispute between the U.S. and China will probably worsen as President Donald Trump is unlikely to suffer much blow-back from his tariffs, as their inflationary impact will be matched by rising U.S. wages at a time when unemployment is low, Mobius said.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index will likely fall another 10 per cent from current levels by year-end, predicted Mobius, who left Franklin Templeton Investments earlier this year to set up Mobius Capital Partners LLP. That would tip the gauge, which has fallen around 16 per cent from a peak in late January, into a bear market.Developing-nation currencies have also been under pressure, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index dropping around 6 per cent from a high in late March.

Brazil and Turkey could benefit from a trade war due to declines in their currencies, Mobius said in a separate interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.

She cited the experience in Alberta, where delinquency rates rose in some instances 20 per cent or 30 per cent on a year-over-year basis after the oil-price collapse. Such an extreme case, however, isn\u2019t what Equifax is predicting. \u201cIt will only happen if we start seeing deterioration in employment numbers,\u201d she said, adding delinquencies should remain \u201cstill very low,\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re just going to start inching up a little bit, probably not double digits.\u201dHousehold credit has ballooned to unprecedented levels in Canada, as in many other developed countries, amid historically low interest rates. That hasn\u2019t posed too many difficulties so far, because the economy and the labour market have generated solid growth, allowing people to handle servicing costs. But with the Bank of Canada intent on raising rates and the U.S. and Canada engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff fight, that could change.A red flag in the Equifax data was a decline in the share of people who completely pay off their credit cards each month.

The shift echoes a similar change in sentiment among short-end traders, who are now pricing in roughly 50-50 odds of a rate hike, down from almost 80 per cent just two weeks ago.Poloz said tariffs will figure \u201cprominently\u201d when deliberating on next month\u2019s policy decision, and reiterated the central bank\u2019s dependence on economic data, which has come in below expectations in recent weeks.

In a separate report, the Ottawa-based agency said retailers recorded a 1.2 per cent sales drop in April, also unexpected.The reports \u2014 which come on the heels of other disappointing data \u2014 raise questions about the underlying strength of the economy and could cast some doubt about how quickly the Bank of Canada proceeds with future rate hikes.\u201cThe soft patch in Canadian data continued today,\u201d Royce Mendes, an economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to investors.The Canadian dollar fell after the reports, and was down 0.2 per cent to 74.95 US cents at 8:38 a.m. in Toronto trading. Investors pared their expectations for rate hikes this year. Swaps trading suggests a 54 per cent probability of a hike at the Bank of Canada\u2019s next rate decision on July 11, down from about two-thirds earlier in the day. A hike isn\u2019t fully priced in until October, with chances of a second hike by December below 50 per cent.As recently as last month, more than two more rate hikes had been priced in this year, adding to the three increases the Bank of Canada has already taken.The \u201cbad data make it even more difficult for the Bank of Canada to hike rates in July,\u201d said Mendes. There is \u201cstill time for the data to turn\u201d before the next rate decision with the April GDP release and June employment data due before then, he said.The inflation numbers were a major surprise given economists were anticipating a sharp pick-up in prices in May on the back of higher gasoline prices. However, a sharp decline in telephone services and cars last month acted as a brake on inflationary pressures coming from higher gas prices, the effects of minimum wage increases and higher mortgage rates.On the month, consumer prices rose just 0.1 per cent in May, down from a 0.3 per cent gain in April and well below expectations for a 0.4 per cent gain, Statistics Canada reported.Core measures of inflation \u2014 seen by officials as a better gauge of underlying inflation trends \u2014 posted their lowest readings since January.The weak April retail sales numbers reflected a sharp decrease in car sales. Even excluding autos, the numbers came in below what economists were expecting. Sales excluding car dealers were down 0.1 per cent, versus economist expectations for a 0.5 per cent gain. Retail sales were also down 1.4 per cent once price changes were factored out.One explanation for the poor retail numbers may have been poor weather, Statistics Canada said.\u201cInclement weather in many parts of Canada may have contributed to the overall decline in April,\u201d the agency said in a statement.Nor are the inflation numbers out of line with the Bank of Canada\u2019s own estimates. Its last forecasts \u2014 released in April projected second quarter inflation to average 2.3 per cent \u2014 and the numbers are currently on track for 2.2 per cent. That\u2019s still a lot higher than what the nation has been able to produce recently, with inflation averaging just 1.4 per cent between 2015 and 2017.Yet, the recent pattern has been one of weakness across the economy \u2014 which could be a concern. The poor inflation and retail sales data have come on the back of weak manufacturing sales and employment data \u2014 all within the context of growing trade worries.\u2022 The average of the Bank of Canada\u2019s three key core\u00a0inflation\u00a0measures fell to 1.9 per cent in May from 1.97 per cent in April \u2022 The \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cmedian\u201d core rates were unchanged at 1.9 per cent, while the \u201ctrim\u201d rate fell to 1.9 per cent from 2.1 per cent \u2022 Inflation for services was unchanged in May at 2.3 per cent.

He\u2019s also seeking retail deposits with a new online high-interest savings account called CIBC Agility.\u201cBusiness is really good,\u201d Richman said while sitting beside CIBC CEO Victor Dodig in the wood-paneled room dotted with framed photographs of the 1920s-era building, business trophies and sports paraphernalia. \u201cThis is truly the next chapter of our growth and success and opportunity.\u201dCIBC\u2019s acquisition sought to break the Canadian lender\u2019s dependence on domestic lending. The Toronto-based bank earned $272 million (US$210 million) from U.S. commercial banking and wealth management in its first fiscal half, a fivefold increase from a year earlier, to account for 10 per cent of overall earnings.Dodig, 53, said that he\u2019s \u201cvery confident\u201d CIBC will surpass its goal of 17 per cent of earnings from the U.S. by 2020 \u2014 a bar set in December that also includes U.S. capital markets. The bank is \u201cahead of target.\u201dAs CEO of CIBC Bank USA \u2014 the new name for PrivateBank \u2014 Richman said he\u2019s working to integrate operations with CIBC and build client relationships. The business has generated more than US$1.3 billion of client deposits since the acquisition closed.The advances have impressed analysts including National Bank Financial\u2019s Gabriel Dechaine. \u201cSo far, so good,\u201d Dechaine said in a phone interview. \u201cIt has been a pretty good ride so far.\u201dAdding more loans and leveraging CIBC\u2019s balance sheet will be key to growth, he said.\u201cThis is supposed to be an asset-gathering expansion story, so they\u2019ve got to win more customers, get some deposit growth and avoid mishaps,\u201d Dechaine said. The business must generate \u201cdouble-digit bottom-line growth\u201d to hit its 2020 target, he said.The bank is capitalizing on a Midwest economy benefiting from strong manufacturing growth, gains in consumer and business spending, while unemployment is at the lowest since 2000.Cross-border opportunities have emerged. Richman is targeting more upper middle-market clients now that he\u2019s able to offer CIBC\u2019s investment banking expertise \u2014 something PrivateBank didn\u2019t really have before.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing clients that are coming to us with new business opportunities, because we now have a Canadian capability,\u201d Richman said.CIBC U.S. bank had US$17.2 billion of loans and US$17 billion in deposits for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, according to disclosures. PrivateBank had US$15.5 billion of loans and US$16.3 billion in deposits as of the end of March 2017, before the takeover.Having PrivateBank\u2019s managers lead the U.S. region \u201chas worked out really, really well,\u201d Dodig said. \u201cThey\u2019re incredibly capable, seasoned executives who know how to run a bank.\u201dRichman has a long history in Chicago. He started his career in the mid-1970s at American National Bank and in 1981 joined Exchange National Bank, which was acquired by LaSalle Bank in 1990. He climbed LaSalle\u2019s ranks and was head of commercial banking when Dutch parent ABN Amro Holding NV named him president and CEO in January 2007. He took over the role just months before Bank of America Corp. bought the company for US$21 billion that year.Richman didn\u2019t stay. He was hired a month later to head PrivateBank, reuniting him with more than two dozen senior bankers who switched after the LaSalle sale. When Richman took over PrivateBank, a lender that opened its first office in 1991 in Chicago, he spent a decade building up the bank and ultimately catching Dodig\u2019s eye.When CIBC offered to buy PrivateBancorp Inc. in June 2016 for US$3.8 billion, the firm had US$17.7 billion of assets, about 1,200 employees in 35 locations and a market value of about US$2.8 billion. CIBC ultimately paid US$5 billion in what became the largest acquisition in the Canadian lender\u2019s 151-year history. PrivateBank\u2019s stately building in Chicago\u2019s financial district now bears the CIBC name on its colonnaded entranceway on South LaSalle Street.CIBC made sure Richman stuck around, signing him to a three-year contract. As group head of the U.S. region, he oversees Atlantic Trust private wealth management and has kept oversight of the rebranded PrivateBank as president and CEO.Richman has held onto his key lieutenants, including former LaSalle veterans Bruce Lubin, who oversees commercial banking in Illinois, and Karen Case, president of U.S. commercial real estate. Richman, who said he still sees two clients a day, seems content under Canadian ownership.\u201cI feel really good about it, I\u2019m having fun,\u201d Richman said. \u201cI\u2019m probably working harder than I\u2019ve ever worked \u2014 and I\u2019ve always worked hard.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Torres", "title": "Fed raises interest rate, sees possible acceleration in hikes", "description": "The hike from 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent reflects the economy's resilience, the job market's strength and inflation that's finally nearing the Fed's target level", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-raises-key-rate-and-sees-possible-acceleration-in-hikes", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/0613fed.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 13, 2018 2:27 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve officials raised interest rates for the second time this year and upgraded their forecast to four total increases in 2018, as unemployment falls and inflation overshoots their target faster than previously projected.The so-called \u201cdot plot\u201d released Wednesday showed eight Fed policy makers expected four or more quarter-point rate increases for the full year, compared with seven officials during the previous forecast round in March. The number viewing three or fewer hikes as appropriate fell to seven from eight. The median estimate implied three increases in 2019 to put the rate above the level where officials see policy neither stimulating nor restraining the economy.The Federal Open Market Committee indicated that even though it\u2019s stepping up the pace of interest-rate hikes, economic growth should continue apace. \u201cThe committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee\u2019s symmetric 2 per cent objective over the medium term,\u201d according to its statement following a meeting in Washington.The statement omitted previous language saying that the main rate would remain \u201cfor some time\u201d below longer-run levels. Other changes included referring to \u201cfurther gradual increases\u201d instead of \u201cadjustments.\u201d Officials also said that \u201cindicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.\u201d Previously, the statement made separate references to survey-based and market-based measures of such expectations.The S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks fell after the Fed decision, while benchmark 10-year yields were up to 2.98 per cent from Tuesday\u2019s 2.96 per cent. The Bloomberg dollar spot index, which tracks the performance of a basket of 10 global currencies against the greenback, climbed 0.1 per cent on the day.While the course of interest-rate hikes remains gradual, the slightly more aggressive pace shows officials see more urgency to tighten policy, as unemployment already fell in May to the level they had forecast for year-end. U.S. growth is also getting a boost from US$1.5 trillion in tax cuts and a US$300 billion increase in federal spending, with inflation at the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target for two months.The statement retained language in place since late 2015 saying \u201cpolicy remains accommodative.\u201d Fed officials repeated their assessment that \u201crisks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.\u201d\u201cEconomic activity has been rising at a solid rate,\u201d the FOMC said in its statement. \u201cRecent data suggest that growth of household spending has picked up, while business fixed investment has continued to grow strongly.\u201dWednesday\u2019s decision \u2014 the sixth quarter-point increase in 18 months, raising the benchmark federal funds target rate to a range of 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent \u2014 was a unanimous 8-0.Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m., his second since taking the helm from Janet Yellen in February. Powell has repeatedly played down the dot plot as a guide to future interest rates, though investors continue to focus on it.Updating their quarterly forecasts, officials projected the policy rate at 3.1 per cent at the end of 2019, according to their median estimate \u2014 compared with 2.9 per cent seen in March \u2014 and 3.4 per cent in 2020, unchanged from the prior forecast.Officials lowered their jobless-rate estimates after unemployment fell to 3.8 per cent as of May, matching April 2000 as the lowest reading since 1969. U.S. payrolls expanded by more than 1 million workers in the first five months of 2018, reaching the milestone faster than in the previous two years.Fed policy makers now see U.S. unemployment at 3.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, followed by 3.5 per cent in 2019 and 2020, based on median projections. That compares with March\u2019s forecasts for 3.8 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent in the following two years. Estimates of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate were unchanged at 4.5 per cent.On inflation, policy makers forecast a slight overshoot of their target starting in 2018 at 2.1 per cent, and running through 2019 and 2020, compared with a 2020 overshoot in March\u2019s projections. The Fed\u2019s preferred price gauge \u2014 the Commerce Department\u2019s personal consumption expenditures index \u2014 rose 2 per cent from a year earlier in March and April, after spending most of the past six years below it.The core PCE index, which excludes food and energy and is seen by officials as a better gauge of underlying price pressures, is forecast to reach 2 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2019 and 2020.

The incumbent Liberals, who have been in power since 2003, are staring at an historic defeat.The decision between the NDP\u2019s Andrea Horwath and PC leader Doug Ford \u2014\u00a0 comparisons to Donald Trump included \u2014 boils down to whether the province accelerates its tilt left after 15 years of increasingly progressive Liberal rule, or makes an about-face toward a smaller pro-business government and the spending cuts that may bring. Polls across the province will close at 9 p.m. Toronto time.\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the middle has dropped out of Ontario politics, and we\u2019re moving toward a more ideological politics,\u201d said Darrell Bricker, a Toronto-based pollster at Ipsos Global Public Affairs.Voter DistributionThe NDP, which began the campaign in third place, has had the momentum. They\u2019ve been statistically tied with the Conservatives in most polls taken over the past three weeks, and even led with 37 per cent versus 33 per cent in a poll last week by Abacus Data.The left-leaning party also has a larger pool of potential voters. About 64 per cent of voters would consider voting NDP, compared with 49 per cent for the PCs, according to the Abacus poll, and the party has more support among women, particularly younger ones.Horwath, 55, a former legal-aid counselor, is well liked \u2014 just 20 per cent of respondents have a negative view of her, versus 48 per cent for Ford and 56 per cent for the Liberal\u2019s Kathleen Wynne. Ford, 53, ran his family\u2019s label business, was a city councilor and the brother of late Toronto Mayor Rob Ford who became notorious for his cocaine use.Liberal Kingmaker?Despite that, Ford has one big advantage: voter distribution. A polling aggregation run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. projects the PCs to have, on balance, a small lead in popular vote but a big lead in winnable districts known as seats. The province\u2019s legislature has 124 seats, and the PCs have an 87 per cent chance of winning a majority, the CBC projected as of Wednesday.One thing is certain, the desire for a new government is acute. That\u2019s despite the province\u2019s economy \u2014 which is about the size of Switzerland \u2014 doing quite well, with the unemployment rate at the lowest since 2000. The best the Liberals can hope for is for no one to win a majority, giving Wynne\u2019s party scope to be kingmaker for the next government.Wynne, who has already said she doesn\u2019t expect to win the election, had advanced a largely left-leaning agenda in recent budgets: a cap-and-trade system on carbon emissions, steep minimum wage hikes, and expanded pharmaceutical coverage for some drugs. Her party\u2019s policies have also dramatically increased the price of electricity for consumers and business. The cocktail of cost-boosting measures have become a major burden to industry.And then there\u2019s Ontario\u2019s debt, which has more than doubled to above $300 billion under the Liberals and is among the world\u2019s highest for a sub-national government. The last Liberal budget projected another $33 billion over the next six years at a time when the province\u2019s economy is already running at above its capacity.Tax Burden\u201cI think Ontario has got two problems: an overextended balance sheet and the second relates to an uncompetitive tax machine,\u201d said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc., citing a provincial corporate tax rate of 11.5 per cent and a top marginal income tax rate of 20.5 per cent, on top of federal income taxes. \u201cI think we shouldn\u2019t be close to running deficits with the tax machine we have right now.\u201dThat tax burden will only get higher for companies such as Toronto-Dominion Bank and Shopify Inc. if the NDP wins. Horwath\u2019s party is pledging to increase the corporate tax rate to 13 per cent from 11.5 percent, pushing the combined rate including federal taxes to 28 per cent. It also want to raise the top marginal income tax rate by two percentage points, helping to finance a host of social measures that would add $15.8 billion in annual program spending after five years. Still, the tax increases theoretically mean the NDP will actually run smaller deficits than those forecast by the Liberals.Voter TurnoutWhat Ontario\u2019s fiscal outlook will look like under Ford is still a mystery. The Conservatives are promising to balance the budget over a \u201cresponsible time-frame\u201d even as they pledge to cut personal and corporate taxes, lower hydro rates and increase spending on health care and infrastructure. The PCs say much of this will be financed by cutting government waste, but the campaign has not released a costed plan or a fiscal outlook.The vote\u2019s outcome will inevitably depend on turnout. If Liberal support collapses, the NDP should see a surge \u2014 Abacus found that 79 per cent of Liberal supporters would prefer an NDP win to a PC win. The problem for the NDP, polling suggests, is that its supporters are less committed than PC backers to actually showing up to vote.\u201cIt will be all about turnout,\u201d Bricker said. \u201cThere is definitely a path for the NDP to win a majority but turnout will need to be higher.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Nikos Chrysoloras, Vassilis Karamanis and Heather Harris", "title": "It feels like 2012 all over again as European markets shudder over possible Italy eurozone exit", "description": "Italian, Portuguese and Greek bond yields surged following the prospect of anti-EU parties in Italy turning a repeat election into a referendum on Italy's eurozone membership", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/global-investor/it-feels-like-2012-all-over-again-as-european-markets-shudder-over-possible-italy-eurozone-exit", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/0529italy.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 29, 2018 12:50 PM EDT", "content": "It looks like the debt crisis days of 2012 all over again for investors, as Italian, Portuguese and Greek bond yields surged and billionaire George Soros warned of an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the European Union.The trigger was the prospect of anti-EU, nationalist parties in Italy turning a repeat election into a de facto referendum on Italy\u2019s membership of the euro. Italian assets sank across the board Tuesday, with the risk premium on 10-year bonds over German benchmarks rising to the biggest in almost five years.\u201cItaly is now facing elections in the midst of political chaos,\u201d Soros said at a speech in Paris, warning that failed economic and immigration policies mean that \u201cit is no longer a figure of speech to say that Europe is in existential danger; it is the harsh reality.\u201dFor all the talk of an economic recovery and a return to stability, recent days have shown how quickly sentiment can get upended on a continent where disillusionment and division are still rife, especially in the south. It may not be anywhere like as bad as a few years ago, but there\u2019s little prospect of a let up in political risk over the coming weeks and months.The euro slipped to a 10-month low of US$1.151 against the dollar before paring losses, while the Japanese yen led gains in the Group-of-10 currencies as people sought to avoid risk.Uncertainty over Italy, as well the prospect of political turmoil in Spain as the prime minister faces a no-confidence vote, contaminated European periphery markets such as Portugal and Greece. Yields on 10-year Greek government bonds surged close to 5 per cent, complicating the country\u2019s plans for a clean exit from its bailout program in August.It was elections in Greece in 2012 that put the euro region on tenterhooks before the European Central Bank declared it would do anything it takes to support the currency union.In Italy, it\u2019s a face-off between the establishment and two parties who ran on anti-EU platforms of deficit spending and reduced immigration. It now has investors recalculating the risks of the eurozone\u2019s third-biggest economy exiting the currency bloc.Italy\u2019s Democratic Party charged its rivals, the League and the Five Star Movement, with having prepared a plan to pull the country out of the euro. That evoked memories of 2015, when Greece\u2019s opposition accused the government of Alexis Tsipras of staging a clash with creditors over austerity as a pretense to leave the currency bloc.Italy is always just a few steps away from the \u201cvery serious risk of losing the irreplaceable asset of trust,\u201d Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said.Panic spread to equity markets, with banks hit the most amid fears about their exposure to Italy. A capitalization-weighted index of euro area banks fell as much as 5.2 per cent to its lowest since December 2016, while Deutsche Bank AG dropped by 3.3 per cent to the lowest since September 2016.UniCredit SpA Chief Executive Officer Jean Pierre Mustier said the decline in Italian bank stocks was driven by fears rather than reality based on the performance of the Italian economy or the lenders themselves.Indeed, the euro region\u2019s economy grew at the fastest pace in a decade last year and unemployment has declined to the lowest since the financial crisis.\u201cThis contagion is the effect of the fear of a potential explosion of the eurozone,\u201d said Diogo Teixeira, chief executive officer of Optimize Investment Partners, a Lisbon-based firm that manages 150 million euros (US$173 million) in assets.

It\u2019s a cautious stance driven by a wait-and-see approach to a long list of uncertainties \u2014 everything from Nafta to the housing market \u2014 rather than any concerns about fundamental economic momentum.After the current pause, which came after three rate increases, most economists are expecting the Bank of Canada will return to a hiking path in July, followed by one more increase at the end of the year.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the timing,\u201d said Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto and a former central bank researcher. \u201cFrom our perspective rates are going up there\u2019s no question about it, but it\u2019s just when will they go up.\u201dAs of late Friday, 21 of 24 economists predict Poloz will hold rates steady, with the rest calling for a quarter-point increase. Investors agree chances of an increase are slim; implied odds of a May 30 rate hike fell to 25 per cent last week, from 35 per cent about a month ago. An increase by July and another one by December are almost fully priced in.The Bank of Canada\u2019s announcement will be a shorter one-page statement \u2014 as opposed to the one in July, which will be accompanied by fresh quarterly forecasts and a press conference \u2014 and any new language on trade tensions, the housing market and economic slack will be important clues for assessing a July increase.Trump\u2019s threats this month on the North American Free Trade Agreement and possible tariffs on auto imports from Canada are the latest uncertainties Poloz needs to balance. Another lingering headwind is household debt. Poloz devoted a May 1 speech entirely to how consumers are more sensitive to higher rates.Poloz has also been a big advocate of the idea Canada has moved to the \u201csweet spot\u201d of the business cycle, where companies expand to meet demand and keep the economy at full output without rapid inflation. The Governor has said he has an \u201cobligation\u201d to nurture this process with stimulative borrowing costs.The sweet spot theory is important, because it allows Poloz to reconcile the idea of a cautious policy stance with an economy growing above what is considered its typical non-inflationary speed limit. After a recent soft patch, consensus forecasts show the expansion will accelerate to an annualized pace of at least 2 per cent and that should eat further into Canada\u2019s dwindling spare capacity.But the law of economics will eventually prevail, with plenty of signs of a resilient economy that needs higher rates, economists said. Unemployment is at record lows and executives are telling Poloz they remain largely unscathed from policy uncertainty emanating from the Trump administration.Likewise, after five of years of below-target inflation, rising demand has consumer prices poised to meet or beat the bank\u2019s 2 percent goal through the next year.\u201cWith inflation at target and the labour market looking like it\u2019s at full health, one rate hike wouldn\u2019t be too much for the economy to handle, especially with growth rebounding,\u201d after the first quarter, said Royce Mendes, a CIBC Capital Markets senior economist in Toronto. He predicts a July increase.The big picture remains one of firm inflation and growth, said Silvana Dimino, an economist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in New York. Canada\u2019s housing is headed for a soft landing and the U.S. has an interest in a striking a Nafta deal, she said.\u201cThey feel like they have some room to let things ride out,\u201d Dimino said, adding the hiking cycle will resume. \u201cWhen inflation is stable at 2 per cent, that\u2019s when you expect to be raising interest rates, which is what they are doing.

Worst case: The unemployment rate will spike by more than any recession since the Great Depression.In terms of employment concentration in housing-linked industries, this dependency is particularly pronounced in Ontario and British Columbia but still prevalent across the rest of the country.

That puts them on the frontline of the Bank of Canada\u2019s recent interest rate increases.Jason Wang, vice president of risk analytics at Progressa, an alternative lender that services mostly subprime clients, hasn\u2019t yet seen evidence that higher borrowing costs are leading to more missed payments, but that could change, he says. Of 28.4 million \u201ccredit-active\u201d Canadian consumers, 11.9 per cent fall into the subprime category, according to estimates from TransUnion, one of the country\u2019s two credit-reporting agencies.Progressa\u2019s loss rate, which measures the number of clients 90 days past due on their payments, is a lagging indicator. \u201cI am curious to see if, in a few months, the Bank of Canada raises the rate again, if that would be trickling into our data,\u201d Wang said in a telephone interview.The next opportunity to gauge the impact of higher rates will come with the firm\u2019s next quarterly risk report in July, Wang said. Depending on the results, the lender would decide what action to take and that may include adjusting its risk profile for acquiring new clients, he said.After the Bank of Canada\u2019s three 25-basis-point hikes since July, Wang calculates, someone with a $60,000 (US$46,000) variable-rate loan would need to pay an extra $37.50 in interest every month.

In addition, the mortgage market looks set for a particularly heavy year of renewals in an environment where debt-servicing costs are already rising at the fastest pace in a decade.All we know is it's going to be painful, but how painful isn't quite clearHow well Canadian households can weather the squeeze has become one of the biggest questions for policy makers and will determine whether the economy is headed for a mild, or sharp, slowdown. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz will address the topic in a speech on Tuesday.\u201cThe economy has never been as levered as it currently is, and the economy is far more interest sensitive than it has been in the past, to a degree that we don\u2019t have certainty over how each interest rate hike is going to affect Canadian consumers,\u201d Frances Donald, senior economist at Manulife Asset Management, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cAll we know is it\u2019s going to be painful, but how painful isn\u2019t quite clear.\u201dThe heavy debt burden is one of the reasons the central bank has been reluctant to raise borrowing costs further, after hiking interest rates three times between July and January. Given the nation\u2019s debt load \u2014 as of February, households had a record $2.1 trillion of mortgage and non-mortgage debt \u2014 Poloz estimates the economy is 50 per cent more sensitive to rate hikes than in the past.Here\u2019s what households are up against:Canada is entering its busy season for real estate, with purchases concentrated in the April to July window. Some 47 per cent of existing mortgages need to be refinanced this year versus 25 per cent to 35 per cent typically, according to Ian Pollick, head of North American rates strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto.At the same time, the country\u2019s biggest banks are raising key mortgage rates. Toronto-Dominion kicked it off Thursday, hoisting its five-year fixed mortgage rate 45 basis points to 5.59 percent. Royal Bank followed with its own hikes Friday.New mortgage stress tests are pushing some borrowers from the big banks to alternative lenders charging higher rates.\u201cThat\u2019s an unfortunate outcome of the stress test,\u201d Will Dunning, an economic consultant who specializes in the housing market, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cIn that sense, the stress test is not reducing risk. It\u2019s increasing risk.\u201dThe vise is tightening. According to Statistics Canada, total payments on debt made by Canadian households rose 6.7 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, and the interest-paid component climbed 9.2 per cent. Those were the biggest gains since the financial crisis. A moving average of quarter-over-quarter changes shows a similar pattern, with the 1.62 per cent increase in the latest period the fastest since 2008.Debt payments now represent about 14 per cent of household disposable income, the highest share in three years. Donald expects the debt-service ratio to continue moving higher over the coming quarters.\u201cThe world spends a lot of time talking about the level of Canadian debt being extremely elevated, but what matters most is not the level of debt that Canadians hold, but the cost of carrying that debt,\u201d the Manulife economist said. \u201cCanadians are going to start to feel the pinch.\u201dThere are already signs of strain. The roll rate \u2014 the percentage of credit card users who \u201croll\u201d from early stage delinquencies to 60-89 day delinquencies \u2014 reached the highest since 2008 for one credit card program, while delinquencies for another were above the 10-year average, according to Royal Bank of Canada credit analyst Vivek Selot.While the level of mortgage arrears is still low by historical standards, a rising debt service ratio could signal that\u2019s about to change.Canada\u2019s economy led the Group of Seven in growth last year, mostly because of the willingness of the country\u2019s consumers to spend money. But growth is expected to slow this year. Gross domestic product unexpectedly shrank in January. Data for February is due Tuesday.The nation\u2019s retailers have already had a tough few months. Retail sales in February were still 1.8 per cent below 2017 peak levels. In volume terms, the input used to calculate gross domestic product data, first-quarter retail sales probably posted the biggest quarterly drop since the 2008-09 recession.The low unemployment rate and decent economic growth will help the economy withstand higher rates, though risks are increasing.\u201cYou have some capacity in the economy to absorb this, but the fact that rates are going up isn\u2019t positive for consumers, because it\u2019s making credit more expensive,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Paul Gulberg said Friday by phone. \u201cThat\u2019s the but.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Franz Wild", "title": "Former RBC currency trader sues bank for unfair dismissal, alleges boss offered 'bribe' to cover up error", "description": "John Banerjee is suing for $18 million.

Blue jeans are also permitted \u2014 as long as they\u2019re solid blue \u2014 whereas previously only khaki-coloured or black denim pants were allowed. Visible facial tattoos are forbidden for those hired after April 14, the manual said.The proposed changes are the latest employee-friendly step Walmart has taken in recent months as it battles other retailers to recruit and retain cashiers and shelf stockers. In February, it boosted its starting hourly wage and doled out bonuses to employees. It has also expanded its parental-leave policy and added an adoption benefit. The moves come as the nation\u2019s unemployment rate has plummeted to 4.1 per cent from 5.7 per cent in 2015.Some Walmart workers embraced the dress code changes, with one saying on an employee message board: \u201cI would love this!

It would mark the first time since 2014 that both exceed that level simultaneously.\u201cWhat makes the Bank of Canada uncomfortable is inflation that is north of target at a time where growth isn\u2019t necessarily that different from trend,\u201d Ian Pollick, head of rates strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cThat\u2019s an environment where they\u2019ll be forced to do something.\u201dPoloz has played the cautious card for months, an easy tack to take so long as the numbers backed him up, which they have. Inflation averaged just 1.6 per cent last year, and the economy entered a soft spot in the second half that spilled over into the early part of 2018.But the backdrop is changing. Economists surveyed last week predict inflation will average 2.3 per cent in the second quarter and 2.4 per cent in the third \u2014 the highest levels since 2011. And with oil prices marching higher, the risks are tilted to the upside.Royal Bank of Canada now projects inflation will average 2.9 per cent in the third quarter, at the upper end of the central bank\u2019s 1 per cent to 3 per cent target range.\u201cThere is some sort of sensitivity when you get to the outer edges of the band,\u201d said Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cIt sharpens the debate a little bit.\u201dGrowth, meanwhile, is expected to remain above potential over much of the next two years, starting with a strong rebound this quarter.When at full capacity, the theory goes, Canada\u2019s economy can\u2019t grow much beyond its potential \u2014 estimated by the central bank at 1.6 per cent \u2014 without fueling price pressures and prompting rate increases. And borrowing costs in Canada are still highly stimulative, almost two percentage points below what the Bank of Canada estimates is their \u201cneutral\u201d rate.But Poloz has indicated he\u2019s in no rush to get there \u2014 mainly because, he says, the economy isn\u2019t yet firing on all cylinders. Even with the unemployment rate at the lowest in four decades, Canada still has plenty of untapped potential, such as underemployment among youth and female workers, the governor says. There\u2019s more capacity that needs to be absorbed and the economy can continue to grow above potential, he contends.Because of this extra capacity, the inflation spike this year \u2014 largely the result of an inflation soft patch a year ago \u2014 will be temporary, eventually returning to the 2 per cent target, according to the central bank\u2019s assumptions.For the time being, Poloz can rest easy that economists and investors seem to have bought into his cautious narrative.Most investors have interpreted this as a preference on the central bank\u2019s part for waiting. Markets are assigning just a 20 per cent chance of an increase at the April 18 decision, and two hikes for 2018 \u2014 in July and October.If he becomes unsettled by the inflation and growth numbers, another option for Poloz would be to move more rapidly over the next 12 months, but stop before he gets to the neutral rate. This is what RBC\u2019s Chandler expects. Still cautious, but more active in the near term.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to make an argument that rates need to go higher,\u201d Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of the governor feeling confident enough to pull the trigger.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Mark Gurman", "title": "Apple warns employees to stop leaking information to the media \u2014 or face potential criminal charges", "description": "Apple said said in a lengthy memo posted to its internal blog that it 'caught 29 leakers,' last year and noted that 12 of those were arrested", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/0413apple.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 13, 2018 3:00 PM EDT", "content": "Apple Inc. warned employees to stop leaking internal information on future plans and raised the spectreof potential legal action and criminal charges, one of the most-aggressive moves by the world\u2019s largest technology company to control information about its activities.The Cupertino, California-based company said in a lengthy memo posted to its internal blog that it \u201ccaught 29 leakers,\u201d last year and noted that 12 of those were arrested. \u201cThese people not only lose their jobs, they can face extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere,\u201d Apple added. The company declined to comment on Friday.Apple outlined situations in which information was leaked to the media, including a meeting earlier this year where Apple\u2019s software engineering head Craig Federighi told employees that some planned iPhone software features would be delayed. Apple also cited a yet-to-be-released software package that revealed details about the unreleased iPhone X and new Apple Watch.Leaked information about a new product can negatively impact sales of current models, give rivals more time to begin on a competitive response, and lead to fewer sales when the new product launches, according to the memo. \u201cWe want the chance to tell our customers why the product is great, and not have that done poorly by someone else,\u201d Greg Joswiak, an Apple product marketing executive, said in the memo.The crackdown is part of broader and long-running attempts by Silicon Valley technology companies to track and limit what information their employees share publicly. Firms like Google and Facebook Inc. are pretty open with staff about their plans, but keep close tabs on their outside communications and sometime fire people when they find leaks. In 2016, Google fired an employee after the person shared internal posts criticizing an executive. The employee filed a lawsuit claiming their speech was protected under California law.Apple is notoriously secretive about its product development. In 2012, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pledged to double down on keeping the company\u2019s work under wraps. Despite that, the media has continued to report news on the firm to satisfy demand for information on a company that\u2019s become a crucial part of investment portfolios, many of which support public retirement funds for teachers and other essential workers.In 2017, Apple held a confidential meeting with employees in another bid to stop leaks. Since then, publications, including Bloomberg News, published details about the iPhone X, a new Apple TV video-streaming box, a new Apple Watch with LTE, the company\u2019s upcoming augmented-reality headset, new iPad models, software enhancements, and details about the upcoming iPhones and AirPods headphones.Here\u2019s the memo:Last month, Apple caught and fired the employee responsible for leaking details from an internal, confidential meeting about Apple\u2019s software roadmap. Hundreds of software engineers were in attendance, and thousands more within the organization received details of its proceedings. One person betrayed their trust.The employee who leaked the meeting to a reporter later told Apple investigators that he did it because he thought he wouldn\u2019t be discovered. But people who leak \u2014 whether they\u2019re Apple employees, contractors or suppliers \u2014 do get caught, and they\u2019re getting caught faster than ever.Who\u2019s leaking? In many cases, leakers don\u2019t set out to leak. Instead, people who work for Apple are often targeted by press, analysts and bloggers who befriend them on professional and social networks like LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook and begin to pry for information. While it may seem flattering to be approached, it\u2019s important to remember that you\u2019re getting played. The success of these outsiders is measured by obtaining Apple\u2019s secrets from you and making them public. A scoop about an unreleased Apple product can generate massive traffic for a publication and financially benefit the blogger or reporter who broke it. But the Apple employee who leaks has everything to lose.The impact of a leak goes far beyond the people who work on a project.Leaking Apple\u2019s work undermines everyone at Apple and the years they\u2019ve invested in creating Apple products. \u201cThousands of people work tirelessly for months to deliver each major software release,\u201d says UIKit lead Josh Shaffer, whose team\u2019s work was part of the iOS 11 leak last fall. \u201cSeeing it leak is devastating for all of us.\u201dThe impact of a leak goes beyond the people who work on a particular project \u2014 it\u2019s felt throughout the company. Leaked information about a new product can negatively impact sales of the current model; give rival companies more time to begin on a competitive response; and lead to fewer sales of that new product when it arrives. \u201cWe want the chance to tell our customers why the product is great, and not have that done poorly by someone else,\u201d says Greg Joswiak of Product Marketing.Stopping leaksInvestments by Apple have had an enormous impact on the company\u2019s ability to identify and catch leakers. Just before last September\u2019s special event, an employee leaked a link to the gold master of iOS 11 to the press, again believing he wouldn\u2019t be caught. The unreleased OS detailed soon-to-be-announced software and hardware including iPhone X. Within days, the leaker was identified through an internal investigation and fired. Global Security\u2019s digital forensics also helped catch several employees who were feeding confidential details about new products including iPhone X, iPad Pro and AirPods to a blogger at 9to5Mac.Last year Apple caught 29 leakers.Leakers in the supply chain are getting caught, too. Global Security has worked hand-in-hand with suppliers to prevent theft of Apple\u2019s intellectual property, as well as to identify individuals who try to exceed their access. They\u2019ve also partnered with suppliers to identify vulnerabilities \u2014 both physical and technological \u2014 and ensure their security levels meet or exceed Apple\u2019s expectations. These programs have nearly eliminated the theft of prototypes and products from factories, caught leakers and prevented many others from leaking in the first place.Leakers do not simply lose their jobs at Apple. In some cases, they face jail time and massive fines for network intrusion and theft of trade secrets, both classified as federal crimes. In 2017, Apple caught 29 leakers. 12 of those were arrested. Among those were Apple employees, contractors and some partners in Apple\u2019s supply chain. These people not only lose their jobs, they can face extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere. \u201cThe potential criminal consequences of leaking are real,\u201d says Tom Moyer of Global Security, \u201cand that can become part of your personal and professional identity forever.\u201dWhile they carry serious consequences,\u00a0leaks are completely avoidable. They are the result of a decision by someone who may not have considered the impact of their actions. \u201cEveryone comes to Apple to do the best work of their lives \u2014 work that matters and contributes to what all 135,000 people in this company are doing together,\u201d says Joswiak. \u201cThe best way to honor those contributions is by not leaking.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Torres", "title": "Fed leans toward faster pace of interest rate hikes even as trade war poses risk", "description": "Even with the improved outlook, a 'strong majority' of Fed officials voiced concern that a trade war would harm the economy, minutes say", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-leans-toward-faster-pace-of-interest-rate-hikes-even-as-trade-war-poses-risk", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/0411fed.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 11, 2018 2:28 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve officials leaned toward a slightly faster pace of tightening at their March meeting as their growth outlook and confidence in hitting their inflation target strengthened, according to minutes released Wednesday.\u201cA number of participants indicated that the stronger outlook for economic activity, along with their increased confidence that inflation would return to 2 per cent over the medium term, implied that the appropriate path for the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely be slightly steeper than they had previously expected,\u201d the Federal Open Market Committee said in the records of its March 20-21 meeting.At the gathering, the first under Chairman Jerome Powell, Fed officials lifted interest rates by a quarter percentage point and mostly penciled in two or three more moves this year.

At the same time, a few officials \u201cnoted that the changes in tax policy could boost the level of potential output,\u201d the minutes said.Yet a simmering U.S.-China trade dispute has roiled markets in recent weeks and tightened financial conditions, which could argue for going slower.As the FOMC deliberated, the Trump administration was considering tariffs on Chinese imports, the prospect of which sent U.S. stocks tumbling by close to 6 per cent that week, after a volatile February thanks in part to an unexpectedly strong reading on wages. Equities have since recouped some of those losses amid signs of eased trade tensions.\u201cMany participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous month\u2019s turbulence in stride, although a few participants suggested that financial developments over the intermeeting period highlighted some downside risks associated with still-high valuations for equities or from market volatility more generally,\u201d the minutes said.At the meeting, central bankers raised their median estimates for U.S. growth to 2.7 per cent for 2018 from 2.5 per cent projected in December.They also saw the jobless rate falling to 3.6 per cent by the end of 2019, further below their 4.5 per cent estimate of unemployment\u2019s long-run sustainable rate. The rate was 4.1 per cent in March, holding at the lowest since 2000.Even with the strengthening labor market, most officials \u201cstill described the pace of wage gains as moderate,\u201d according to the minutes. \u201cA few participants cited this fact as suggesting that there was room for the labour market to strengthen somewhat further.\u201d\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Maciej Onoszko", "title": "Canadian dollar's top forecasters say loonie's future not as bad as it looks", "description": "Expectation of NAFTA deal and Bank of Canada rate hike improves currency\u2019s prospects", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/dont-be-so-downbeat-on-the-loonie-top-currency-forecasters-say", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/loonie.jpeg", "publishedAt": "April 9, 2018 3:47 PM EDT", "content": "The outlook for the Canadian dollar has become far too gloomy, according to the currency\u2019s top forecaster.Lloyds Banking Group Plc expects the loonie to bounce after posting its worst start to the year relative to its peers as pessimism lifts over the North American Free Trade Agreement and expectations for rate hikes from the Bank of Canada begin to creep back into the market.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing some progress on the NAFTA front,\u201d said Gajan Mahadevan, a London-based strategist at the bank. \u201cThe risk to the Bank of Canada outlook is now probably skewed to the upside, especially after the recent jump in inflation.\u201dThe loonie fell 2.6 per cent against the greenback in the first quarter, lagging 15 other major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, and traded around 78.30 U.S. cents on Friday. It will advance 2.9 per cent to 80.64 U.S. cents by the end of this year and to 83.33 in 2019, according to Lloyds.The currency has been under pressure this year as the economy slowed and investors cut bets for interest-rate increases. Concerns that negotiations to overhaul NAFTA would fall apart have also weighed on the currency, though as of last week, Lloyds\u2019s optimism was looking well placed.Canada, the U.S. and Mexico are making progress in NAFTA talks, which have entered \u201ca new, more intensive stage of engagement,\u201d Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Friday after meeting with her U.S. and Mexican counterparts in Washington. Talks were expected to resume Monday.Lloyds is more bullish than other Canadian dollar watchers. The loonie will strengthen to 80 U.S. cents by the end of the year, according to a median of forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. And hedge funds and other speculators last month turned bearish on the currency for the first time since July, according to the data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Investors wager there\u2019s a 23 per cent chance of a rate increase at the central bank\u2019s policy meeting on April 18, swaps trading suggests, down from 40 per cent two weeks ago, while a hike in July isn\u2019t fully priced in. In his latest speech from March 13, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the central bank\u2019s latest decision to keep interest rates on hold reflected comfort with recent data.Yet inflation in February accelerated to an annual pace of 2.2 per cent, the highest in three years, even as the economy contracted in January. Data on Friday showed the economy created a higher-than-expected 32,300 jobs in March, keeping the unemployment rate at 5.8 per cent, the lowest in four decades.Global economic growth will remain robust this year, which should help drive crude oil prices higher and support the Canadian dollar, according to Isaah Mhlanga, a Johannesburg-based economist at Rand Merchant Bank, which came in second in the Bloomberg ranking of forecasters. The ranking is based on calls for the first quarter.Mhlanga sees long-term fair value of the Canadian dollar at around 85.47 U.S. cents and expects the currency to strengthen to 81.96 by the end of the year. He doesn\u2019t expect the Bank of Canada to hike as aggressively as the market anticipates, seeing just one more rate increase this year compared to the market pricing in two.\u201cIf you combine one rate hike and commodity prices picking up, that should be bullish for the Canadian dollar,\u201d he said.Bears say NAFTA could still unravel and come back to plague the loonie. The currency will probably weaken up to 76.33 U.S. cents over the next two quarters, according to Juan Perez, a Washington-based senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc. which came third in the ranking of forecasters.\u201cBecause of NAFTA being such a dark cloud and the U.S. economy being resilient and consistent, it weighs on the Canadian dollar in a negative way,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Canadian dollar has much that could improve its situation in the next six months.\u201dFor now though, things are looking up on the future of the North American trade bloc, according to Lloyds\u2019s Mahadevan.\u201cThere was a psychologically based drive to price in a huge degree of risk around NAFTA and after President Trump temporarily exempted Canada from the steel and aluminum tariffs, we\u2019ve seen some of that pullback,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "China vows to fight America \u2018to the end, at any cost\u2019 as Trump threatens $100 billion more in tariffs", "description": "Trump's unexpected move yesterday threatens to unravel efforts to lower the heat in this escalating conflict", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-urges-100-billion-in-new-china-tariffs", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/trade1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 5, 2018 8:05 PM EDT", "content": "China said it would counter U.S. protectionism \u201cto the end, and at any cost,\u201d as a war of words over President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on Chinese imports escalated.The statement from Beijing came after Trump ordered his administration to consider tariffs on an additional US$100 billion in Chinese goods on Thursday, sending U.S. stock futures tumbling. The U.S. president cited \u201cChina\u2019s unfair retaliation\u201d in response to his list of proposed tariffs earlier this week covering US$50 billion in Chinese products.\u201cThe Chinese side will follow suit to the end and at any cost, and will firmly attack, using new comprehensive countermeasures, to firmly defend the interest of the nation and its people,\u201d the Commerce Ministry said in a statement on its website on Friday. The ministry said it would hold a press briefing at 8:00 p.m. in Beijing Friday.China, which is a great economic power, is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization. They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.Trump\u2019s unexpected move threatens to unravel efforts by top U.S. and Chinese trade officials to lower the heat and reach an agreement that could stave off an escalating conflict. Administration officials have spent the past two days trying to tamp down fears of a trade war, with chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow saying Thursday the U.S. could still hammer out a deal with Beijing.European shares, U.S. futures and commodities all fell after Trump\u2019s latest threat, while treasuries climbed.\u201cBy fueling uncertainty among market participants, fears of a \u2018trade war\u2019 have added to the volatility already witnessed earlier this year in equity markets,\u201d Benoit Coeure, a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s executive board, said in Cernobbio, Italy. \u201cNone of this supports growth and employment.\u201dTrump said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would identify which new products may be subject to tariffs. He later stressed that any additional tariffs first would be subject to a 60-day public comment period.\u201cNo tariffs will go into effect until the respective process is complete,\u201d Lighthizer said in a statement. The administration hasn\u2019t said when any of the proposed tariffs would go into force.China said Wednesday it would levy a 25 per cent tariff on about US$50 billion of U.S. imports including soybeans, automobiles, chemicals and aircraft. That was in response to Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs targeting industries including aerospace, robotics and machinery.Were China to want to match Trump\u2019s latest threat, it wouldn\u2019t have enough American goods imports to target. It could take other measures like curbing package tours or student transfers to the U.S., or hamper American companies operating in China.\u201cThis is starting to feel like the beginnings of a trade war, if simply each proposal is matched with a retaliation,\u201d said Patrick Bennett, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cThe U.S. risks isolating itself from global trade in this process and we think the U.S., USD and U.S. asset markets have more to lose.\u201dTrump struck a defiant tone during a speech in West Virginia on Thursday, saying it was time to stop China from \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of America.\u201cYou have to go after the people who aren\u2019t treating you right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a fantastic relationship long term with China, but we have to get this straightened out. We have to have some balance.\u201dThe Trump threat \u201craises the possibility of an alarming escalation in the trade conflict between the world\u2019s two biggest economies,\u201d Tom Orlik, Bloomberg Economics chief economist, wrote in a note. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell the difference between a rhetorical flourish from a president known for bombastic remarks and a meaningful shift in policy.\u201dTrump\u2019s moves are reverberating beyond U.S.-China ties. Beijing has called on the European Union to help it reject U.S. protectionism and uphold the international trade order. South Korea on Friday threatened tariffs on imports from the U.S. in retaliation for imposing safeguard duties on washing machines and solar panels.Both Trump and Xi have to weigh the political costs of a trade war. China\u2019s proposed tariffs on agricultural goods would hit U.S. farmers hard at a time they are already dealing with depressed crop prices and stagnant values for their land. Worries about a potential trade war have rippled through farm states, which are a powerful voting bloc in November\u2019s congressional elections.For Xi, the need to look strong in the face of U.S. threats outweighs any immediate hit to economic growth, according to David Zweig, a political science professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\u201cOf course there is a breaking point, but it would have to take very deep pain and several years of it,\u201d he said when asked about China\u2019s ability to withstand economic pain. \u201cConcessions are more dangerous to Xi than a loss of the U.S. export market, at least in the medium term.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Poloz eyes exports, wages and investment ahead of interest rate decision", "description": "Investors wager there is about a 20 per cent chance of a rate increase at the central bank's policy meeting on April 18", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/poloz-eyes-exports-wages-and-investment-ahead-of-rate-decision", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/0404poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 4, 2018 12:43 PM EDT", "content": "Growing optimism that a preliminary NAFTA deal is within reach hasn\u2019t spilled over into expectations for faster Bank of Canada interest rate hikes, particularly with rising U.S-China tension roiling global markets.Investors wager there is about a 20 per cent chance of a rate increase at the central bank\u2019s policy meeting on April 18, swaps trading suggest, down from 40 per cent two weeks ago. A hike isn\u2019t fully priced in until July.The thinking is that even if a tentative deal emerges from the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz are looking for reasons to be confident the nation can withstand higher borrowing costs and will want to wait for more concrete signs of a pick up in exports, investment and inflationary pressures before moving again after three increases since last July. Not to mention more stable financial markets.Here are some of the key numbers coming out before the April 18 policy meeting that could inform the central bank\u2019s decision making.Statistics Canada releases February merchandise trade numbers on Thursday and policy makers will be looking for some sign of life from exporters, whose performance continues to disappoint even with the benefit of a robust U.S. economy and weaker Canadian dollar.Non-energy shipments in January were 4 per cent below year-ago levels and the malaise in Canada\u2019s export sector isn\u2019t a recent phenomenon. Factoring out price changes over the past decade, non-energy export volumes are still below levels attained before the 2008-2009 recession.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of us waiting and waiting and waiting for an improvement in non-energy exports,\u201d Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview.Job numbers for March are due Friday, with economists anticipating another month of \u201cnormal\u201d employment gains \u2014 in the vicinity of about 20,000 for the month \u2014 after a hiring boom for much of 2017 when monthly increases averaged 35,600.The most closely watched number from the report may actually be wages, which have been showing some signs of strength in recent months as the labour market tightens. Pay rates have posted annual gains of more than 3 per cent in the first two months of 2018, something that hasn\u2019t happened since 2016.Any evidence of further gains, at a time when inflation is already at target, would likely grab the attention of central bank policy makers.The last major bit of data ahead of the April 18 decision is the Bank of Canada\u2019s own survey of business executives, which is a central input into its decision making. The report, to be released Monday, will provide policy makers with information on everything from whether companies are running up against capacity to their inflationary expectations, but one key detail will be whether uncertainty around NAFTA is weighing on business spending decisions.The central bank\u2019s business outlook indicators have been on a steady rise since lows reached in 2015 and are hovering at some of the highest readings in the past 17 years.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jeremy Herron and Sarah Ponczek", "title": "Stocks plummet in tech rout as key support crumbles", "description": "The S&P 500 Index closed at the lowest level since early February and finished below its average price for the past 200 days for the first time since June 2016", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/stocks-tumble-on-tech-rout-as-support-levels-fail-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/traders.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 2, 2018 6:48 PM EDT", "content": "The deepening rout in once high-flying technology shares sent U.S. stocks tumbling to start the second quarter, as fresh presidential criticism of Amazon.com and retaliatory tariffs from China rattled markets.

Officials repeated previous language that they anticipate \u201cfurther gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy.\u201dThe upward revision in their rate path suggests Fed officials are looking through soft first-quarter economic reports and expect a lift this year and next from tax cuts passed by Republicans in December. Financial conditions have tightened since late January as investors look for signs that the central bank might raise rates at a faster pace, while forecasters predict stronger U.S. growth and tight labour markets.\u201cThe job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears to be moving toward the FOMC\u2019s 2 per cent longer running goal,\u201d Powell said in a press conference that he kept somewhat shorter than those conducted by his predecessor, Janet Yellen. Powell said he\u2019s \u201ccarefully considering\u201d expanding the number of such briefings where he explains Fed decision, cautioning that he wanted to be sure that didn\u2019t send any signals about the path of policy.The vote to lift the federal funds rate target range to 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent was a unanimous 8-0.The latest set of quarterly forecasts forecasts showed that policy makers were divided over the outlook for the benchmark interest rate in 2018. Seven officials projected at least four quarter-point hikes would be appropriate this year, while eight expected three or fewer increases to be warranted.In the briefing with reporters, Powell hued to the FOMC plan for gradual rate increases. While generally upbeat about the economy\u2019s prospects, he also said the Trump administration\u2019s trade policy has become a concern for businesses.In the forecasts, U.S. central bankers projected a median federal funds rate of 2.9 per cent by the end of 2019, implying three rate increases next year, compared with two 2019 moves seen in the last round of forecasts in December. They saw rates at 3.4 per cent in 2020, up from 3.1 per cent in December, according to the median estimate.The S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks were higher after Powell spoke, while the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were around 2.89 per cent, little changed from Tuesday. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was lower.In another change to the statement, the Fed said inflation on an annual basis is \u201cexpected to move up in coming months,\u201d after saying \u201cmove up this year\u201d in the January statement. Price gains are still expected to stabilize around the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target over the medium term, the FOMC said.The central bank\u2019s preferred price gauge rose 1.7 per cent in the 12 months through January and officials projected it to rise to 2 per cent in 2019 and hit 2.1 per cent the following year, the latest estimates showed. The estimates for inflation excluding food and energy, which officials see as a better way to gauge underlying price trends, rose to 2.1 per cent in 2019 and 2020 from 2 per cent seen in December.\u201cJob gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low,\u201d the FOMC said. The statement said that household spending and business investment \u201chave moderated\u201d from strong fourth-quarter readings.The statement also repeated previous language that \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s goal is to keep supply and demand in balance in the economy amid a tight labor market, without lifting borrowing costs so quickly that the economy stalls.Officials have had to factor in the impact of fiscal stimulus signed by President Donald Trump since their previous projections.The median estimate for economic growth this year rose to 2.7 per cent from 2.5 per cent in December, signalling confidence in U.S. consumers despite recent weak readings on retail sales that have pushed down tracking estimates of first-quarter activity. The 2019 estimate rose to 2.4 per cent from 2.1 per cent.The committee\u2019s forecast for the long-run sustainable growth rate of the economy was unchanged at 1.8 per cent, suggesting policy makers are still skeptical of the effect of tax cuts on the economy\u2019s capacity for growth. The 2020 gross domestic product growth median projection was also unchanged at 2 per cent.While U.S. unemployment of 4.1 per cent is the lowest since 2000, wage growth has remained moderate and inflation has been below the Fed\u2019s target for most of the last five years.The median projection for the long-run fed funds rate ticked up to 2.9 per cent from 2.8 per cent in December. The Fed had been gradually reducing its estimate of the long-run neutral fed funds rate since it began publishing its calculations in January 2012.Estimates for the long-run sustainable unemployment rate also declined, pushing the median down to 4.5 per cent from 4.6 per cent seen in December.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Frederic Tomesco", "title": "Bombardier hires TD for sale of its Toronto aircraft-assembly plant: sources", "description": "Bombardier has received multiple bids, with residential developers in the mix, sources said", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/bombardier-hires-td-for-sale-of-its-toronto-aircraft-assembly-plant-sources", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0316bombardier.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 16, 2018 2:00 PM EDT", "content": "Bombardier Inc. has hired Toronto-Dominion Bank to find a buyer for the Downsview aircraft-assembly plant in Toronto that could fetch more than $500 million (US$382 million), according to people familiar with the matter.Canada\u2019s biggest aerospace company has received multiple bids, with residential developers in the mix, said the people who asked not to be identified because the matter isn\u2019t public. Housing development would increase the value of the land, though builders may face opposition from the union and lawmakers looking to preserve the land for industry.A sale would further Bombardier Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare\u2019s five-year turnaround plan, which includes bolstering the balance sheet. The Montreal-based company is saddled with about US$9.2 billion of debt after investing in research and development of new aircraft and is stepping up efforts to raise cash with the goal of breaking even on a cash-flow basis this year.Bombardier plans to move its Toronto-area manufacturing activities from Downsview to a site that would provide access to a runway without the costs associated with staffing a fire department or a control tower, according to one of the people. Toronto Pearson International Airport is being considered as an alternative site.Bombardier spokesman Simon Letendre said that the company\u2019s priority is to \u201cextract value from this land\u201d and that it would be up to the buyer to apply for a zoning change. Lynsey Wynberg, a TD Securities spokeswoman, declined to comment.It may be a lucrative time to sell\u00a0the 1.5 square-kilometre (375 acre) site that Bombardier has owned since purchasing Boeing Co.\u2019s de Havilland unit in 1992. The facility, which is about 13 kilometres (8 miles) northwest of downtown, assembles turboprop planes and business jets. Bombardier has said it uses only about 10 per cent of the property and bears the cost of operating a 2,100-metre (7,000-foot) runway.Bombardier hopes to complete a deal involving Downsview \u201crelatively quickly in 2018,\u201d Bellemare said last month.\u00a0He didn\u2019t elaborate on possible financial terms.

Walmart shares fell as much as 2 per cent.Tri Huynh, a former director of business development at Walmart, claims he was terminated \u201cunder false pretenses\u201d after repeatedly raising concerns about the company\u2019s \u201coverly aggressive push to show meteoric growth in its e-commerce business by any means possible \u2014 even, illegitimate ones.\u201dUnder Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon, Walmart has invested billions to catch up with Amazon in e-commerce over the past few years, and last year enjoyed quarterly online sales growth rates surpassing 50 per cent, well above peers that include Target Corp. and Best Buy Co.Huynh claims Walmart mislabeled products so that some third-party vendors received lower commissions, failed to process customer returns, and allowed offensive items onto the site. Huynh\u2019s dismissal in January 2017 \u2014 just a day after a retail-industry publication singled him out as one of the sector\u2019s rising stars \u2014 was in retaliation for warning senior executives about the misdeeds, he said in the lawsuit, filed Thursday by employment litigation attorney David M. deRubertis in San Francisco federal court.\u201cWal-Mart sacrificed and betrayed its founder\u2019s key principles of integrity and honesty, pushing those core values aside in its rush to win the e-commerce war at all costs,\u201d the 70-page complaint says, referring to founder Sam Walton. \u201cIn doing this, it realized it must silence any whistleblower who spoke up against its \u2018win at all costs\u2019 approach.\u201dWalmart officials weren\u2019t immediately available for comment on the lawsuit.Along with the 2016 acquisition of Jet.com, the rollout of two-day free delivery and the recruitment of sought-after web engineers, Walmart\u2019s strategy also includes building up its marketplace site, where third-party vendors sell their wares and pay the retailer a fee, usually around 15 per cent. The number of products available on Walmart\u2019s site has soared, from 7 million in 2015 to about 75 million as of February.Walmart overlooked basic internal controls in its quest for growth, according to the lawsuit. For example, Walmart\u2019s systems sometimes failed to label marketplace items in the right product category, resulting in some vendors paying higher commissions than they should have. The company also failed to process customer returns on items totaling more than US$7 million, which resulted in reporting inflated sales, Huynh said.Huynh, a native of Vietnam, joined Walmart in 2014 from Amazon. He claims he warned his superiors and the company\u2019s ethics department that if \u201cWalmart did not properly address these issues, its failure to do so could have serious long-term implications for its critically important e-commerce business.\u201dHe said he was told to stop raising such concerns, and when he eventually brought them to U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore in early 2017, he was \u201cabruptly terminated\u201d as part of a broader workforce reduction that took place later that month.Huynh sued accusing Walmart of whistleblower retaliation in violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, retaliation in violation of California labour code, failure to prevent discrimination, and wrongful termination. He seeks unspecified damages for lost wages and economic losses, special damages and punitive damages.The case is Huynh vs. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 18-cv-01631, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Untapped potential in labour market key to fuelling expansion without inflation: Poloz", "description": "Bank of Canada governor estimates there are currently about half a million Canadians who can be drawn into the labour force under stronger economic conditions", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/untapped-potential-in-labour-market-key-to-fuelling-expansion-without-inflation-poloz", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0313poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 13, 2018 1:23 PM EDT", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the nation\u2019s economy carries plenty of untapped potential that allows policy makers to prolong an expansion without fuelling inflation.Poloz, in a speech Tuesday that focused on labour market slack, said the nation is at the \u201csweet spot\u201d of the business cycle where growing demand is actually generating new capacity as companies invest to meet sales, a process he said the Bank of Canada has an \u201cobligation\u201d to nurture.The increased investment, meanwhile, will help bring more people into the work force \u2014 such as women, youth and the long-term unemployed. Poloz estimated there are currently about half a million Canadians who can be drawn into the labour force under stronger economic conditions, which could in turn increase potential output by as much as 1.5 per cent.\u201cThe bank has concluded there remains a degree of untapped supply potential in the economy,\u201d Poloz said, according to the prepared text of remarks delivered at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario. \u201cThis is important, for it means that Canada may be able to have more economic growth, a larger economy, and therefore more income per person, without generating higher inflation.\u201dHow quickly the economy expands without triggering inflation is one of the key questions the Bank of Canada is asking. The faster they believe it can run before overheating, the longer policy makers can afford to wait on raising interest rates. And Poloz\u2019s comments seem to be leaning toward faster for longer.The Bank of Canada has increased borrowing costs three times since July, but has taken a cautious stance on further rate adjustments. Investors are pricing in at least two more hikes by the end of this year.\u201cIt should be clear that there are likely to be significant economic benefits associated with allowing the economy to find its way to a higher, more productive economic equilibrium, if this can happen within our inflation-targeting regime,\u201d Poloz said.It\u2019s a controversial position. The economy is as close to full capacity as it\u2019s been in a decade and the central bank\u2019s conventional models are likely telling it to raise interest rates more quickly and aggressively. The Canadian dollar, which has been the worst performing major currency in the world this year as investors pared expectations for rate increases, fell another 0.7 per cent to $1.292 per U.S. dollar at 10:33 a.m. in Toronto trading.\u201cThe Governor\u2019s choice of topics is in line with our view that he\u2019s looking for reasons to take rate hikes slowly,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to investors. \u201cWe\u2019ll retain our call for only one more quarter point hike this year.\u201dTargeting growth isn\u2019t technically part of the central bank\u2019s mandate. The Bank of Canada\u2019s primary objective is to target inflation, and Poloz\u2019s strategy is based on the premise that the erosion of productive capacity in recent years can be in part repaired, which would help keep prices in check. The central bank is forecasting inflation will remain near the bank\u2019s 2 per cent target over the next couple of years.\u201cWe expect to see increased investment \u2014 both in existing and brand new companies \u2014 as well as labour market churn create more supply through higher productivity and employment,\u201d Poloz said.Questions around the true level of the economy\u2019s potential growth rate is one of a number of uncertainties the central bank is taking into account as it rejects a \u201cmechanical\u201d approach to policy and remains cautious on interest rates, he said.\u201cWe cannot know in advance how far the capacity-building process can go, but we have an obligation to allow it to occur,\u201d Poloz said.The central banker cited a number sources of untapped labour market slack, including youth participation rates that still seem low based for this stage of the cycle. There is also scope to increase participation rates among women, Poloz said, citing policy successes in Quebec that helped more women enter the labour force. \u201cThe recent federal budget introduced some new measures in this direction,\u201d he said.Poloz did warn there remain downside risks to higher demand if supply doesn\u2019t start rising. \u201cThese uncertain processes entail both upside and downside risks to inflation and our monetary policy remains particularly data-dependent as we balance those risks\u201d Poloz also made a plea not to worry too much about technological advances, adding that historically they lead to higher productivity and living standards \u201cThe Bank can certainly use its monetary policy to help bring about a stronger, better functioning economy while still pursuing our inflation-targeting goal. This is particularly important in the current phase of the economic cycle, with demand prompting investment that can pull more people into the workforce.\u201d Canada is seeing encouraging signs in data on new company formation \u2014 the most potent form of business investment.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Leslie Patton", "title": "McDonald's workers quitting in droves over 'complicated' technology, new menu items", "description": "Employees are handling more tasks, in many cases, they say, without pay raises or adequate staffing, and they're getting fed up", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/mcdonalds-workers-quitting-in-droves-over-complicated-technology-new-menu-items", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0313burgers.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 13, 2018 12:46 PM EDT", "content": "For Dudley Dickerson, the mobile-app orders were the last straw.McDonald\u2019s Corp. has been updating with new technology, delivery, a revamped menu and curbside pickup.

So Dickerson, 23, handed over his spatula for the last time.\u201cThey added a lot of complicated things,\u201d Dickerson said in an interview. \u201cIt makes it harder for the workers.\u201dSure, lots of fast-food employees hop from job to job. But with unemployment so low, turnover is becoming a problem. Workers are walking rather than dealing with new technologies and menu options. The result: customers will wait longer. Already, drive-through times at McDonald\u2019s slowed to 239 seconds last year \u2014 more than 30 seconds slower than in 2016, according to QSR magazine. It\u2019s also pokier than Burger King, Wendy\u2019s and Taco Bell.Turnover at U.S. fast-food restaurants jumped to 150 per cent \u2014 meaning a store employing 20 workers would go through 30 in one year.

Each of those people generated US$97,000 in revenue, compared to about US$65,000 the year before. While this could be a sign of increased efficiency, it can just as well be seen as stretching thin an inadequate number of employees.In Broward County, Florida, Westley Williams said he\u2019s switching to a job at burger joint Checkers after being stretched too thin at McDonald\u2019s. Williams, 42, says he\u2019s quitting because of the chaos caused by mobile-app orders, new items and six recently added self-order kiosks.\u201cIt\u2019s more stressful now,\u201d said Williams, who added that he didn\u2019t get a raise for doing more work. \u201cWhen we mess up a little bit because we\u2019re getting used to something new, we get yelled at.\u201dOn a recent Wednesday afternoon, about 10 McDonald\u2019s workers hustled behind the counter of a store in Chicago\u2019s Loop. They called out order numbers for those waiting for lunch \u2014 some had ordered via an in-store kiosk, some from the mobile app and some the old-fashioned way, at the register.An order of a Bacon McDouble, small fries and an apple juice took about two-and-a-half minutes, faster than the average drive-through time, but the drink was missing and the employee seemed confused when asked for it.\u201cThe biggest risk when you have a lot of employee turnover is the customer experience,\u201d said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst for Edward Jones. \u201cIf that starts to wane, then this turns into a bigger problem.\u201dAt another restaurant in Chicago the same day, McDonald\u2019s staff rushed to keep up with the dinner crowd.

The outlook for 2018 U.S. expansion was upgraded to 2.9 per cent from 2.5 per cent, and the euro area was lifted to 2.3 per cent from 2.1 per cent.

Downsview, where the company assembles Global 6000 business jets and Q400 turboprops, is now restricted to industrial use.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to move,\u201d Scott McIlmoyle, president of Unifor Local 112, said in a telephone interview. \u201cOur position is that we\u2019re going to do everything we can to keep our members and our work right there. We have a responsibility to look after our members.\u201dChief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare is seeking to sell Downsview as he steps up efforts to increase cash generation at the debt-laden maker of planes and trains. Canada\u2019s biggest aerospace company has hired advisers to find a buyer for the property and is looking at scenarios that include relocating production near the city\u2019s Lester B. Pearson International Airport.Bombardier said in January it had begun reviewing options for Downsview because it uses only about 10 per cent of the 150-hectare (375-acre) site and bears the entire cost of operating a two-kilometre (7,000-foot) runway. Downsview is \u201can amazing piece of land,\u201d Bellemare said Feb. 15 on a conference call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s an underutilized asset.

He didn\u2019t elaborate on possible financial terms.Selling Downsview would buoy Bellemare\u2019s efforts to strengthen Bombardier\u2019s balance sheet, following an announcement last week that the Montreal-based company planned to raise at least $638.4 million (US$498 million) in equity. Bombardier is saddled with about US$9.2 billion of debt after investing in research and development of new aircraft such as the CSeries commercial jetliner and the Global 7000 private jet.Downsview could fetch as much as US$1 billion, a \u201cwild card\u201d that would add \u201cupside\u201d to Bombardier, Cowen & Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr said in a note to clients Feb. 20.Potential bidders could be developers that want to build residential buildings there because it\u2019s near a subway station, though city officials may not be keen on replacing the employment land with condominium towers, Ed Sonshine, CEO of RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, said in a recent interview. Sonshine, who was approached about the property last year, said he wasn\u2019t interested.\u201cThere\u2019s probably only half a dozen players that can handle it, and again, it\u2019s a fairly long term deal, it\u2019s a massive deal and there\u2019s a lot of issues with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll all get sorted out and I think somebody will buy it, but all these issues do is impact value.\u201dBombardier advised Unifor late last year that the company wanted to sell Downsview and consider a move, McIlmoyle said. Pearson is the company\u2019s \u201cpreferred option,\u201d he added.Moving production to Pearson represents \u201cone option, and we\u2019re looking at all the options right now,\u201d Simon Letendre, a Bombardier spokesman, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere is a lot of interest in Downsview because of its location.\u201dAsked about Downsview\u2019s status, Letendre said it would be up to the buyer to obtain permission for a zoning change. \u201cOur priority is to extract the value from this land, and to make sure there is no interruption in production,\u201d he said.In the meantime, Unifor is lobbying city, provincial and federal government officials to preserve Downsview\u2019s designation as an industrial site. About 3,500 people currently work at the Bombardier facility.Bombardier\u2019s collective agreement with Unifor Local 112 expires in June.

The unemployment rate fell to 5.8 per cent from 5.9 per cent, back to the December level that was the lowest in records back to 1976.The numbers are consistent with a tight labour market with little slack left after Canada\u2019s strong economic performance last year prompted a hiring boom. While the February gain is below monthly averages over the past year, it\u2019s more in line with what would be considered normal for an economy the size of Canada.One negative in the report was that the gains in February were driven by part-time employment, which was up 54,700 jobs. Full-time work was down by 39,300. Full-time employment has been responsible for the bulk of the job boom, totalling almost half a million jobs over the past 18 months.Wage growth, which accelerated to the fastest since 2015 in January, also slowed somewhat but remains still above the average over the past year.\u2022 Annual wage gains decelerated to 3.1 per cent in February, after reaching 3.3 per cent a month earlier.

Even then, he predicts one rate hike at most before the year is out. That would be a change of pace for a central bank that\u2019s tightened monetary policy at three of its past five meetings, spurred on by strong growth and a surge in employment.\u201cThe market is being too aggressive for what we\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d Basdeo said. \u201cThat market reaction is tied more toward what\u2019s likely to happen in the U.S. \u2014 that is, the fiscal impulse generates strong growth there and we benefit from that.\u201dA less hawkish BoC wouldn\u2019t bode well for a Canadian dollar that\u2019s already the worst performing Group-of-10 currency this year. The loonie fell to as low as $1.2916 per U.S. dollar Friday, the weakest since December.U.S. investors already wagering the Federal Reserve will increase rates three times this year are beginning to hedge against the likelihood of a fourth after new chairman Jerome Powell gave an upbeat assessment of the economy in front of Congress last week. While that\u2019s more aggressive than what\u2019s being priced for the BOC, traders remain hesitant to bet on too much policy divergence.Participants in the market for Canadian bankers\u2019 acceptance contracts expect officials to tighten policy by another 56 basis point by year-end, from 1.25 per cent. The odds of a hike at the BoC\u2019s April 18 meeting stand at about 38 per cent, according to overnight index swap pricing. That\u2019s down from about 70 per cent after a string of recent economic data misses and the release of a federal budget that kept the fiscal deficit steady.Pacific Investment Management Co.\u2019s Ed Devlin said he also expects the Bank of Canada to take a cautious approach to policy tightening. While it\u2019s possible officials hike twice more by year-end, the prevailing risk is for the BoC to be less aggressive than expected, not more, he said.Without the support of a hawkish BoC, the loonie will struggle to gain traction, he added.Ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations, which are scheduled to conclude their seventh round Monday in Mexico City, remain a likely source of volatility for the loonie over the medium-term. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of duties on steel and aluminum March 1 helped fuel the loonie\u2019s worst week in a year, and come on the heels of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s suggestion that Ottawa is willing to walk away from NAFTA.And while Canada\u2019s economy is coming off a stellar 2017, the country shed a net 88,000 jobs in January, its largest monthly decrease since 2009, while retail sales figures released last month showed receipts fell 0.8 per cent month-over-month in December. Friday\u2019s gross domestic product figures did little to ease concerns of a slowdown, with data showing the economy growing at an annualized pace of just 1.7 per cent in the fourth quarter amid signs indebted households have begun paring spending.\u201cWe\u2019ve come off all this strength in the data,\u201d Brittany Baumann, a macro strategist at Toronto Dominion Bank, said before the GDP figures were released. \u201cWe\u2019re now getting in this more moderation stage.\u201d Baumann expects the BOC to remain on hold for at least the next two policy meetings.The loonie\u2019s 2.6 per cent drop year-to-date is starting to leave its mark on the options market. Realized daily volatility has risen to the highest since September,\u00a0and is nearly a full per cent above its implied counterpart as traders become increasingly concerned about the currency\u2019s direction.In a sign that they\u2019re starting to price in BoC policy risk, currency puts traded this week expiring around the March 7 meeting outnumbered currency calls by about 50 per cent, according to Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation volumes. The one month 25-delta risk reversal, a barometer of sentiment and directional risk, is at its highest level since May as strikes above $1.30 begin to accumulate. A move above this level would likely see volatility rise further.\u201cIf the data is flagging a slowdown, then we should see a different tone from the Bank of Canada,\u201d BlackRock\u2019s Basdeo said. \u201cThat\u2019ll cause the repricing of fixed income assets.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Josh Wingrove", "title": "Canada may have just squandered its best shot at balancing the budget", "description": "And as a result, Morneau is leaving himself without any ammunition to respond to a crisis \u2014 like another downturn, a NAFTA collapse or risks from U.S. tax cuts", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-may-have-just-passed-up-its-best-shot-to-balance-budget?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/0228morneau.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 28, 2018 12:36 PM EST", "content": "Bill Morneau may have passed up his last chance to balance Canada\u2019s budget.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s finance chief released his third fiscal plan on Tuesday in circumstances that have hardly been better. Canada\u2019s economy is near full capacity, led the Group of Seven in growth last year and unemployment recently hit a four-decade low \u2014 all of which Morneau boasts about. He couldn\u2019t have asked for better conditions to move toward what was once his goal: balance.And yet Morneau\u2019s budget Tuesday plots no such course. New spending on indigenous peoples, military veterans, scientific research and gender equity have eaten up windfalls. Even with new tax revenues from marijuana, tobacco and private corporations, Morneau wasn\u2019t able to accelerate the deficit-reduction path, totaling $98 billion (US$77 billion) over six years.The problem, critics say, is Morneau is leaving himself without any ammunition to respond to a crisis \u2014 such as another downturn, or risks posed by U.S. tax cuts and a potential NAFTA collapse, which the budget was silent on. Morneau brushed off the criticism and said Canada\u2019s still got room to maneuver, with the annual deficit at a modest 0.9 per cent of gross domestic product. Canada is one of only a dozen countries with a top sovereign credit rating, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a really low level of debt to our economy, we can deal with all eventualities and we\u2019re being fiscally responsible along the way,\u201d he said in a Bloomberg interview Tuesday evening in Ottawa. \u201cIt\u2019s important to put these demands in context. We\u2019re looking at it. We\u2019re going to carefully analyze it to make sure that our competitiveness stays strong. What I am happy about though is that our economy is in a good position.\u201dMorneau and Trudeau weren\u2019t always this sanguine about deficits. Trudeau campaigned on balancing the budget by 2019, something he\u2019s nowhere near doing. Two years ago, Morneau said growth would bring him back to balance in about five years. Despite strong growth, that\u2019s not in sight.\u201cThe budget is set against what could quite possibly be the high point for economic and fiscal conditions in Canada,\u201d Bank of Montreal Chief Economist Doug Porter wrote in a research note. \u201cWe are observing some tell-tale late-cycle conditions in North America, often a period that governments should build fiscal capacity.\u201dWith the Canadian economy approaching capacity limits, future fiscal savings will likely be harder to come by, and the federal government will have fewer opportunities to rein in persistent deficitsInstead, Morneau largely spent the additional fiscal space that emerged since an October budget update. \u201cThe federal government once again opted to spend those savings rather than banking them,\u201d Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, wrote in a research note. \u201cWith the Canadian economy approaching capacity limits, future fiscal savings will likely be harder to come by, and the federal government will have fewer opportunities to rein in persistent deficits.\u201dThe spending measures themselves were largely lauded as worthwhile, though tended to include things that, at best, drive growth slowly. About $7.2 billion in infrastructure spending \u2014 once hailed as a silver bullet \u2014 is being delayed, in what the government calls \u201creprofiling.\u201d Morneau said the projects are being built anyway: \u201cWhat you think is reprofiling is really in many cases just accounting,\u201d with the federal money set to flow only once a road or other project is built.Canada\u2019s foremost business groups had issued widespread calls for Morneau to improve business competitiveness, either by cutting corporate taxes or providing other incentives for business investment. \u201cWe\u2019ve been not as competitive for years, and the U.S. just shined a stronger light that we haven\u2019t been reinvesting in our plants,\u201d said Dennis Darby, chief executive officer of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters trade group.And yet the budget was silent on the risks posed by Trump. Morneau said he wouldn\u2019t respond to U.S. measures in an \u201cimpetuous way\u201d and that Canada will review its overall competitiveness, and taxes are only part of that. \u201cWe need to do our homework,\u201d he said.The Business Council of Canada, representing some of the country\u2019s top chief executives, said the budget sends an \u201cunfortunate signal to entrepreneurs and companies that are looking to invest and grow,\u201d a sentiment echoed by other groups.\u201cI am concerned that the government feels it\u2019s possible to spend its way to prosperity,\u201d Perrin Beatty, chief executive officer of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview. \u201cIf you can\u2019t balance the books in the good times, what\u2019s going to happen when you get a downturn in the economy?\u201dMorneau projected a shortfall of $19.4 billion in 2017-18 and $18.1 billion in 2018-19 with no return to balance \u2014 all largely in line with what was projected in the October fiscal update. The ratio of debt to the economy is scheduled to fall from 30.4 per cent in 2017-18 to 28.4 per cent in 2022-23.Canada\u2019s next election isn\u2019t until 2019, but this budget has plenty of political overtones. Many measures are aimed at voters that may back the left-leaning New Democratic Party. That included launching a council to study the possible creation of a national plan to cover the cost of pharmaceutical drugs, a big-ticket item. Morneau said it\u2019s not acceptable that some Canadians have no drug coverage. \u201cOur goal is to do this in a way that actually deals with that gap.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Fabiola Zerpa", "title": "'We are dying': Venezuela's oil workers have become so hungry they are too weak to do their jobs", "description": "Food has become more important than employment, and thousands are walking off the job to find it, leaving few left to produce the oil that keeps the economy going", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/too-hungry-to-pump-oil-pdvsa-crews-skip-work-to-hunt-for-food", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/0223venezuela.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 23, 2018 2:00 PM EST", "content": "At 6:40 a.m., Pablo Ruiz squats at the gate of a decaying refinery in Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela, steeling himself for eight Sisyphean hours of brushing anti-rust paint onto pipes under a burning sun.

With children dying of malnutrition and adults sifting garbage for table scraps, food has become more important than employment, and thousands are walking off the job.\u00a0Absenteeism and mass resignations mean few are left to produce the oil that keeps the tattered economy functioning.Venezuela, a socialist autocracy that once was South America\u2019s most prosperous nation, is suffering a collapse almost without precedent, its gross domestic product\u00a0dropping 40 percent\u00a0since 2013. Petroleos de Venezuela\u00a0SA\u00a0(PDVSA), the government oil company and economic linchpin, has fallen into chaos as leaders replaced expert managers with loyalists, padded the payroll and channeled revenue to social programs \u2014 and to epic corruption. Production fell by half in the past 16 years. Daily output dropped to 1.77 million barrels in January from a peak of 3.34 million in 2001.Much of the decline is due to lack of money for maintenance and exploration. Recently, though, hunger is to blame. A survey by three Venezuelan universities released Wednesday found that that more than 64 per cent of residents lost weight in 2017, on average 25 pounds. More than 61 per cent of respondents said they had gone to bed hungry over the past three months.Ivan Freitas, a PDVSA\u00a0union leader and critic of President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s regime, said Wednesday that in Zulia\u00a0State 12 malnourished workers collapsed in November and December and had to be taken off drilling platforms for treatment. More go down each day, he said.Alirio Villasmil, a diver, does underwater maintenance on ships transporting oil in Lake Maracaibo, in western Venezuela. He said in an interview that three people he supervises fainted while working, and he had to rush them from rig platforms to the hospital. He has sent home others too weak to dive.Luis Diaz, a PDVSA\u00a0tugboat pilot at Puerto La Cruz,\u00a0about 320 kilometres (200 miles) east of Caracas, said his union has complained to management about malnourished workers passing out on the job.The Puerto La Cruz region and its ports, where refineries and upgraders are laid out against verdant bluffs and postcard beaches, produce about 89 per cent of Venezuelan oil exports, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. About 42,000 workers labor at PDVSA\u00a0facilities there, processing crude extracted from the plains of the Orinoco basin. Chevron Corp., Statoil\u00a0ASA, Total SA and Rosneft\u00a0PJSC partner with the state company to pump it into international markets.For decades, PDVSA was a dream job in a socialist petro-state. The company supplied workers not only with a good living and revolutionary-red coveralls, but cafeterias that served lunches with soup, a main course, dessert and freshly squeezed juice. Now, the cafeterias are mostly bare, the children are hungry and employees are leaving to work as taxi drivers, plumbers or farmers. Some emigrate. Some hold out as long as they can.Those who quit without notice risk losing their pensions, as bureaucrats refuse to process paperwork. Many managers live in terror of arrest since the Maduro regime purged the industry, imprisoning officials from low-level apparatchiks to former oil ministers. In one human resources office, a sign advertised a limit of five resignations a day.\u201cManagement is holding them back to stop brain and technical drain,\u201d said\u00a0Jose Bodas, general secretary of United Federation of Venezuelan Oil Workers. He estimates 500 employees have resigned at the Puerto La Cruz refinery and nearby processing facilities in the past 12 months \u2014 even though superiors have labeled them \u201ctraitors to the homeland,\u201d\u00a0a phrase that often precedes arrest. In the streets, families sell their boots and the red coveralls.\u201cThey\u2019re giving up because of hunger,\u201d Bodas said. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving because they get paid better abroad. This is unheard of, a catastrophe.\u201dEfforts to reach PDVSA and the nation\u2019s oil ministry were unsuccessful.Wages made meaningless by hyperinflation force workers who remain to rely on the facilities for food. Some change clothes to eat twice, or show up on their off days. Many hoard meals and take them home. Some have started to bring their children. When the cafeterias stopped delivering food in December, protests erupted. A crowd of angry men gathered in PDVSA\u2019s Puerta La Cruz headquarters chanting \u201cOur families are dying.\u201dThey're giving up because of hunger. They're leaving because they get paid better abroad. This is unheard of, a catastrophe\u201cA few weeks ago, punches were nearly thrown at the food line, when the workers realized there was little left,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Leonardo Ugarte, worker at the Petrocedeno upgrader, a joint venture among PDVSA, France\u2019s Total and Norway\u2019s Statoil. Faced with the possibility of riots, PDVSA sends workers home when food is scarce.Dr. Marianella Herrera, head of the Central University of Venezuela\u2019s health and development department, said local health authorities recommend consuming 2,300 calories a day. Since 2015, when the collapse of the economy started to really be felt, researchers found some rural residents consuming as few as 400 calories a day, she said, an \u201canemic\u201d diet of grains, rice and tubers.John Hoddinott, a\u00a0Cornell University professor of applied economics and a nutritional scientist, said people doing strenuous work need at least 3,600 calories a day. When they get less, at first they merely shed weight. Then, torpor sets in.\u201cBasically, they just can\u2019t work as hard,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gradual process, but in the long term it can have very dramatic consequences.\u201dSitting in the living room of his house, on his day off, Endy Torres says he has lost 33 pounds over the past 18 months. He shows his PDVSA identification photo as proof: a chubby-cheeked man, weighing 176 pounds.Ten years ago, he joined the company expecting an ample salary and comfortable pension. Today, his 700,000 bolivars per month, plus a food bonus of 1.6 million bolivars (about US$9.50 altogether) can\u2019t fill the fridge at his grandmother\u2019s house, where he lives.About 10 people from his department resigned in January. There are 263 plant operators remaining and 180 vacancies at the Puerto La Cruz refinery, he said.Absenteeism forces those who show up to work extra hours and burn precious calories. The lack of investment in equipment and maintenance has increased technical failures, almost all in the early hours of the morning, he said. When they occur, workers are too fatigued to act quickly, and accidents occur.\u201cWe have a physical exhaustion that we can not avoid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are dying of hunger in the oil industry.\u201dBloomberg.com\u00a0"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "Vancouver's hot housing market just got tougher for wealthy Chinese", "description": "B.C. launches hike to foreign buyers tax and new speculation tax to crack down on the housing \u2018stock market\u2019", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/vancouvers-hot-housing-market-gets-tougher-for-wealthy-chinese-2", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/canada-housing21.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 21, 2018 12:30 PM EST", "content": "Vancouver, one of the hottest housing markets in North America, is getting a little tougher for wealthy Chinese buyers.British Columbia Finance Minister Carole James announced measures targeting foreign buyers and speculators in the first budget since her government was elected on a pledge to make housing more affordable for residents of Canada\u2019s Pacific Coast province.Starting Wednesday, foreigners will pay the province a 20 per cent tax on top of the listing value, up from 15 per cent now, and a levy on property speculators will be introduced later this year, according to budget documents released Tuesday. The government will also crack down on the condo pre-sale market and beneficial ownership to ensure that property flippers, offshore trusts and hidden investors are paying taxes on gains.Premier John Horgan faces formidable demands after taking power in a fiercely contested election last July. His New Democratic Party made expensive promises to topple the Liberals, whose 16-year-rule brought the fastest growth in Canada, but also surging property while incomes stagnated.Public outrage has surged amid perceptions that global capital seeking a stable sanctuary, especially from China, is driving double-digit gains in Vancouver, the country\u2019s most expensive property market.\u201cThe expectations that we will do everything in our first budget are huge,\u201d James told reporters in the capital Victoria. \u201cOur goal is fairness \u2014 fairness for the people who live here, who work here and pay their taxes here.\u201dJames said a raft of new measures are intended to \u201cmoderate\u201d the surge in housing prices, which she said had emerged as one of the top concerns of both residents and businesses struggling to recruit workers due to the high cost of living.B.C.'s real estate market should not be used as a stock marketThe new speculator tax takes effect this fall and will apply to foreign and domestic investors who don\u2019t pay income tax in the province. It will start at 0.5 per cent of the property\u2019s assessed value in 2018 and rise to 2 per cent thereafter. Primary residences and homes leased as long-term rentals will be exempt.\u201cB.C.\u2019s real estate market should not be used as a stock market. It should be used to provide safe and secure homes,\u201d said James. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re cracking down on speculators who distort our market.\u201dThe levy, she said, will also capture \u201csatellite families\u201d \u2014 a term with Chinese origins to describe those families where the breadwinner remains in the home country while the children and spouse reside abroad to take advantage of educational and employment opportunities.The foreign buyers\u2019 tax will also be extended beyond the Vancouver region to properties in Victoria and other parts of the province. Taxes on the province\u2019s most expensive properties will also rise \u2014 homes worth more than $3 million will pay a 5 per cent property transfer tax when sold, up from 3 per cent.Separately, the government and Airbnb Inc. have reached an agreement requiring the company collect an 8 per cent provincial sales tax and as much as a 3 per cent local tax on short-term rentals, according to budget documents.Public outrage has been further stoked by fresh media reports alleging Vancouver casinos and real estate have become vehicles in recent years for laundering the illicit proceeds of high-rolling Asian gamblers and drug dealers with links to the Chinese fentanyl trade.\u201cWe\u2019re taking steps to counter tax fraud and money laundering \u2014 that starts with closing loopholes and better access to information,\u201d James said. The province has asked the federal government to create a multi-agency group to target tax evasion, money laundering and housing, according to budget documents.James vowed that investors flipping pre-sale condos will have to pay tax. Developers will be required to collect ownership information on the selling and re-selling of contract assignments in new buildings, and the data will be shared with tax authorities.She also vowed to bring more transparency to murky ownership records \u2014 it isn\u2019t clear who owns nearly half of Vancouver\u2019s most expensive properties, according to a budget document. The province will demand more information about beneficial property ownership in tax forms. That information will also be made publicly available and shared with tax authorities and law enforcement agencies, James said.The budget plan forecast a $219 million surplus in the fiscal year beginning April 1, more than the $151 million projected for the year ending March 31. The surplus is expected to rise to $281 million in 2019-2020, according to the budget. Economic growth is pegged at 2.3 per cent this year, following a 3.4 per cent expansion in 2017.Over the next three years, it includes plans to invest more than $1 billion in childcare, $1.6 billion in affordable housing, and to also eliminate healthcare premiums at an annual cost of about $1 billion.That plan will be funded by a new health tax on employers, as well as the new and expanded housing measures. Combined, they will create extra tax revenue of $880 million this fiscal year and $2.2 billion the following year, according to budget documents.New borrowing will rise to $7.7 billion in the coming fiscal year, from $1.9 billion in the current year, to help fund a record $15.8 billion in capital investments in transportation, housing, educational and health facilities, according to budget documents.Provincial debt will rise in the coming fiscal year to $69 billion, from $65 billion for the year ending March 31. Debt will increase to $73 billion by the 2020 fiscal year, the government said.Program spending is forecast to jump 3.5 per cent to $54 billion next year, from $52 billion in 2017-2018.

That fueled an acceleration of the national wage rate to an annualized pace of 3.3 per cent that was the fastest since 2015.The report is a long-waited correction in a tightening labor market that is more consistent with an economy that has been slowing down since the second half of last year. While the unemployment rate increased to 5.9 per cent in January, it\u2019s still near its record low of 5.8 per cent and the faster wage gains may give policy makers at the Bank of Canada more fodder to worry about inflation.\u201cA mysterious mix of good and bad, with the latter\u2019s impact blunted by how strong job gains were in the lead up to these figures,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a note to investors.The Canadian dollar rose after the report, gaining at C$1.2595 per U.S. dollar.Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast the economy would generate 10,000 jobs in January, and the jobless rate would remain unchanged.Canada\u2019s economy has still seen employment increase by 288,700 jobs over the past 12 months \u2014 146,000 of which came in November and December. Full-time employment is up 558,900 over the past 18 months, near record levels hit in 2000.\u201cThis is still a solid job market, we will have to monitor how the market adjusts to the minimum wage,\u201d Brittany Baumann, a macro strategist at TD Securities, said by phone from Toronto. She cited the full-time job gain, faster wages and a low unemployment rate as signs of a resilient labor market.\u2022 Ontario recorded the biggest decline last month, down 51,000 \u2013 \u2013 all part-time. It was the largest monthly drop for the province since 2009.\u2022 Annual wages gains accelerated to 3.3 per cent in January, the fastest since 2015 and up from 2.7 per cent in December. Wage increases for permanent workers increased by 3.3 per cent, up from 2.9 per cent.\u2022 Actual hours worked slowed in January to an annualized pace of 2.8 per cent, from 3.3 per cent in December\u2022 Most of the job losses were in services, which posted a 71,900 decline.

A booming tech and financial sector helped send unemployment in the city to 4.3 per cent in December from 5.5 per cent a year ago even as it remained a magnet for immigrants. Meanwhile, companies such as LaSalle Investment Management Inc. have launched funds focusing on Canadian commercial property as foreign investors seek a haven with open borders and stable finances.Among high-profile transactions was Alberta Investment Management Corp.\u2019s purchase along with KingSett Capital Inc. of the remaining 50 per cent stake in Scotia Plaza for $682 million. Also Leadon Investment Inc. bought the 567-room Delta Hotels by Marriott Toronto for $216 million as part of their larger $1.1 billion portfolio acquisition of properties across Canada from British Columbia Investment Management Corp.Land sales took up the bulk of the annual increase in investment volumes rising 49 per cent to $8.5 billion, Altus said. Residential-land sales should remain strong this year, although high prices and policy changes have introduced more uncertainty to the market, Altus said. Vacancy rates in office and industrial markets should remain low due to tight supply, the group said.Organizations like WeWork Cos., the co-working giant which opened a 35,000-square-foot office with 700 members in Toronto this week, have completely changed the way that space gets contracted, Courteau said. Companies that may have specialized in shopping-mall development are now considering multi-use space that includes apartments, offices and rentals, he said.\u201cThe real estate landscape has changed to one where inventory management, understanding demographics, thinking about the use of property and about different rental scenarios is now a much more sophisticated game,\u201d he said.That\u2019s a bonus for Altus, which provides global data on commercial real estate and consulting options for everything from property tax to investment feasibility. \u201cWe bring a lot of expertise to those large complex type of opportunities.

The narrative was that with a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d economy of growth without much inflation, long-term borrowing costs could stay low. And that was all bullish for stocks. Then yields started popping higher last month. Some warned that if 10-year yields punched through 2.6 per cent, it would spell trouble for equities. They were right.Behind the surge in yields is an increasing debate over the outlook for Fed policy. For much of the current tightening cycle, investors were comfortable with the idea that the U.S. central bank would stop raising its target rate at a much lower level than in the past \u2014 because slower trend growth rates would hold down inflation.Then a $1.5 trillion tax cut was enacted just as the economy expanded an average 3 per cent over the last three quarters of 2017. Friday\u2019s U.S. employment report suggested wage gains are picking up \u2014 potentially boosting inflation. Combined with a changing of the guard in Fed leadership, it all raised the question of whether indeed policy makers would stop at around 3 per cent for the upper band of the target. And it may be weeks before investors hear from the new chairman, Jerome Powell.The strong start to the year in U.S. shares was the \u201cstandout\u201d indicator that stocks were overbought in the short-term, strategists at Citigroup Inc. said on Jan. 25. The weekly relative strength index for the S&P 500 had risen to the highest on record and the strategists noted a pull-back to the current cycle\u2019s trend-line would mean a market correction of over 20 per cent.For Bank of America Merrill Lynch, it was a case of too much money being plowed into the market too quickly. A contrarian sell signal was triggered on Jan. 30, when its \u201cBull & Bear\u201d indicator surged towards the red zone, thanks in part to record equity inflows.The popularity of short-volatility bets showed its ugly side Monday, as selling from trend-following strategies contributed to the mini flash crash that hit U.S. equities around 3:10 p.m. on Wall Street, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists Marko Kolanovic and Bram Kaplan. A rise in realized volatility on Friday had been significant as it was a signal for many related strategies to bail out of risk, they wrote. A continued surge will probably spur a total of $100 billion of outflows from U.S. stocks by funds following so-called systemic approaches, they estimated.U.S. stock valuations were heading to extreme levels, even by the elevated standards of the past three decades. The Shiller P/E Ratio, a measure based on comparing prices with cyclically adjusted earnings, climbed more than two standard deviations above the average of the last century \u2014 only for the third time, after the dot-com bubble and the roaring \u201920s surge that ended with the Great Depression.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jennifer Jacobs", "title": "'Clearly foolish': Donald Trump's habit of taking credit for a bull market just got super risky", "description": "Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for the stock market's rise over his first year in office, and now he risks taking the blame if there's a prolonged downturn", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/clearly-foolish-donald-trumps-habit-of-taking-credit-for-a-bull-market-just-got-super-risky", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/0206trump.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 6, 2018 11:00 AM EST", "content": "The Trump administration is \u201cconcerned\u201d about Monday\u2019s plunge in U.S. stock markets but believes that indicators including unemployment and consumer confidence show a strong economy, a White House official said.\u201cObviously we\u2019re concerned about setbacks that happened in the stock market, but that being said, we\u2019re looking at the long-term strong economic fundamentals,\u201d Mercedes Schlapp, President Donald Trump\u2019s director of strategic communications, said in an interview Tuesday on Fox News.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on CNBC Tuesday that markets are functioning normally and that Americans should focus on long-term investments.Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for the stock market\u2019s rise over his first year in office, and now he risks taking the blame if there\u2019s a prolonged downturn. Monday\u2019s selloff \u2014 the biggest tumble in more than six years \u2014 intensified just as the president was recounting \u201ca tidal wave of good news\u201d about the economy in a speech in Ohio. He didn\u2019t mention markets, even though he often boasts about them with the refrain, \u201chow\u2019s your 401k doing?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re focused on the fact that there\u2019s been the lowest unemployment that we\u2019ve seen in a long time, and there\u2019s confidence in our businesses,\u201d Schlapp said.If we accept that he's taking credit for the market on the way up, logically he must accept credit for the market droppingThe episode highlights the political risk Trump runs tying his presidency too closely to a bull market. Larry Harris, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California, said it was \u201cclearly foolish\u201d for Trump to claim credit for the rising stock market.\u201cIf we accept that he\u2019s taking credit for the market on the way up, logically he must accept credit for the market dropping,\u201d Harris said.Though the Dow and the broader S&P 500 are now down for the calendar year, U.S. stocks are up since election day, the Dow rose more than 25 per cent last year, unemployment remains low and gross domestic product has increased every quarter he\u2019s been in office.\u201cYour paycheques are going way up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYour taxes are going way down.\u201dThe TV in Air Force One\u2019s board room is usually turned to Fox News, but when White House staff boarded the plane after Trump\u2019s Monday speech, the network was broadcasting a red chart illustrating the market decline.

He waved off questions about the stock market and insisted that Fox News, which covered the market downturn throughout the flight, had remained on the TV.It hadn\u2019t been. Aides only turned it back on toward the end of the flight.Trump spent part of the flight talking with Portman, Mnuchin and senior adviser Stephen Miller and was in good spirits, aides said. As the plane approached Washington, the National Security Council\u2019s chief of staff, Keith Kellogg, fetched a bag from the galley. \u201cAt least it\u2019s not an air sickness bag,\u201d he joked to reporters.Later the White House issued a statement drawing on a familiar Washington strategy for addressing market downturns. Like George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and even Herbert Hoover in their own moments of market distress, the Trump team struck an upbeat note, trying to shift the focus to economic \u201cfundamentals.\u201d\u201cThe President\u2019s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment, and increasing wages for American workers,\u201d Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement after the plane landed. \u201cThe President\u2019s tax cuts and regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. economy and continue to increase prosperity for the American people.\u201dTrump told workers at the factory that the Republican tax overhaul \u201cset off\u201d a wave of favourable economic news. He cited a commitment Apple Inc. announced in January to invest US$350 billion in its U.S. operations and also lauded bonuses some companies have given workers since the tax overhaul was passed.Trump has sought to highlight companies that have doled out employee bonuses and raises, citing the tax cuts as the reason, White House aides said. Four corporate chief executives, each of whom paid employees US$1,000 bonuses, were at the Ohio event: Jeff Norris of Sheffer; Greg Carmichael of Fifth Third Bancorp; Christopher Irion of e-Cycle; and Matt Schron of Jergens Inc.The event was the president\u2019s second day trip to promote the GOP tax overhaul he signed in December and his third visit to Ohio since taking office.

Bottom line: this is a healthy correction.\u201dU.S. hiring picked up in January and wages rose at the fastest annual pace since the recession ended, as the economy\u2019s steady move toward full employment extended into 2018. Equities are being tested by the surge in bond yields, with some fund managers saying three per cent U.S. 10-year rates would signal a bond bear market. The level is seen by many stock watchers as a potential trigger for a correction in equities.In Europe, a bond selloff deepened across the continent, and equities dropped for a fifth straight day, the longest streak since November. Disappointing results from companies including Deutsche Bank AG and BT Group Plc. paced losses, with Germany\u2019s DAX giving up the year\u2019s gains, capping the worst weekly decline since 2016. Bund yields reached a fresh two-year high, while the euro and British pound weakened. Japanese debt gained and the yen declined after the Bank of Japan intervened to stem the rise in rates.Canada\u2019s main stock index also took it on the chin, sliding more than 250 points, down 4 per cent over the past week, in a broad-based decline that included drops in every sector. The S&P/TSX composite index fell 254.89 points to 15,606.03.The last such drop on the TSX was more than seven months ago when it lost about 269 points on May 17, 2017. While all sectors finished Friday in the red, shares in health care saw the steepest losses of an average 6.18 per cent.Cannabis stocks led the decline in the sector, with Canopy Growth Corp. dropping $3.44 or 12.49 per cent to $24.11, while Aphria Inc. shares fell $1.60 or 10.34 per cent to $13.88.

Officials also said inflation \u201cis expected to move up this year and to stabilize\u201d around the goal, in phrasing that marked an upgrade from December.At the same time, the Fed repeated language saying that \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.\u201dWith her term ending later this week after President Donald Trump chose to replace her, Yellen is handing the reins to Powell, who has backed her gradual approach and is widely expected to raise interest rates at the FOMC\u2019s next meeting for the sixth time since late 2015. Fed officials are hoping to keep a tight labor market from overheating without raising borrowing costs so fast that it would stifle the economy.\u201cGains in employment, household spending and business fixed investment have been solid, and the unemployment rate has stayed low,\u201d the Fed said, removing previous references to disruptions from hurricanes. \u201cMarket-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low.\u201dWith a gradual pace of rate increases, policy makers want to nudge inflation back up to their 2 per cent target, a goal they have mostly missed for more than five years. Even with a brightening outlook for global growth and Fed tightening, financial conditions continue to ease.The vote by U.S. central bankers to keep the benchmark overnight lending rate in a 1.25 per cent to 1.5 per cent target range was unanimous. Fed officials also voted to continue with their program to reduce the central bank\u2019s balance sheet, which began in October.The FOMC said in a separate statement Wednesday that it elected Powell as its chairman, effective Feb. 3. He will be sworn in as chairman of the Board of Governors on Feb. 5.\u201cOn a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 per cent,\u201d the FOMC said, removing a previous reference to declines in inflation in 2017.Inflation has picked up slightly since the middle of 2017 while remaining short of the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent goal. The Fed\u2019s preferred price gauge, a Commerce Department index linked to consumer spending, rose 1.7 per cent in the 12 months through December. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, inflation was 1.5 per cent.Yellen isn\u2019t scheduled to hold a press conference after this meeting; her final such event was in December. Fed policy makers will update their economic projections in March, when Powell is also expected to hold his first press briefing as chairman.An annual rotation among the 12 regional Fed presidents who vote on the FOMC saw Loretta Mester of Cleveland, Thomas Barkin of Richmond, Raphael Bostic of Atlanta, and John Williams of San Francisco join as members at this meeting. Barkin and Bostic are voting for the first time since taking their posts.The committee also reviewed its long-run policy goals statement at the January meeting and reiterated its support for the 2 per cent inflation target, approving a statement that updated the long-run normal rate of unemployment to 4.6 per cent \u2014 the median in projections from December.Several Fed officials have called for a rethink of the central bank\u2019s policy framework, which could include aiming for a higher inflation target, or allowing prices to rise faster to make up for the time that they were too low.During Yellen\u2019s four years at the helm, U.S. unemployment has fallen to 4.1 per cent, the lowest since 2000, as she navigated the Fed away from its crisis-era emergency policies and inched interest rates away from zero. Yellen exploited low inflation to maintain low interest rates that helped pull millions of more Americans back into jobs, and the Fed under her leadership began to pay more attention to labor-market inequality.\u201cShe is going out on a high note,\u201d Diane Swonk, chief economist for Grant Thornton LLP in Chicago, said before Wednesday\u2019s decision.Powell takes over an economy that expanded at an annualized 2.6 per cent pace in the final three months of the year, helped by stronger business investment and consumer spending. Tax cuts signed into law by Trump in December are also likely to lift growth in 2018, though the Fed and most analysts see little long-term boost, if any, to the economy.The Fed statement didn\u2019t contain any reference to the tax legislation.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Only thing colder than Toronto right now is its housing market", "description": "Mid-winter is never a good time to sell a house in Toronto \u2014 this winter it\u2019s terrible", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/once-hot-toronto-housing-hits-deep-freeze-as-lending-rules-bite", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/house.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 30, 2018 5:19 PM EST", "content": "The only thing that might be colder than Toronto in January is the city\u2019s housing market.While the bleak mid-winter is never the best time to sell a home in Canada, a string of open houses in the country\u2019s largest city were chillingly empty on a recent Saturday afternoon. Tougher mortgage rules went into effect on Jan. 1 just as higher interest rates began to bite, and the market\u2019s on edge, waiting to see if a downturn that began last year will accelerate under the added pressure.\u201cLots of people are sitting on the sidelines waiting or hoping that prices would fall,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto-based Realosophy Realty Inc., said in a phone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to see a rapid increase in prices or a big turnaround this year.\u201dToronto\u2019s housing market has cooled for seven months, with prices falling and listings surging. The market has begun to buckle under a raft of measures to curb prices that were soaring at a 20 per cent clip a year ago and saddling Canadians with debt, part of a global real-estate boom that\u2019s swept cities from Hong Kong to New York.The latest move requires that even people with a 20 per cent down payment, who don\u2019t need mortgage insurance, prove that they can make payments at much higher rates. The so-called stress tests, which already exist for insured mortgages, will be calculated at a rate of at least 2 percentage points above the contracted rate.And those rates are going up. The country\u2019s central bank increased its overnight target rate three times in the past year, to 1.25 per cent. The country\u2019s big banks have followed suit, nudging mortgage rates to a four-year high.Reality is sinking in as buyers update their pre-approved mortgages at the higher rates, Dawna Borg, a sales representative at Remax Premier Inc., said in an email.\u201cThey seem to feel defeated,\u201d she said. \u201cThey feel they will fail the stress tests and they will be forced out of the market.\u201dAnalysts at Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. say the new stress tests and mortgage-rate hikes in Canada\u2019s environment of \u201chyper-leveraging\u201d will have a more severe impact than policymakers expect. The rules alone will reduce purchasing power by as much as 17 per cent, the bank said in a report. Add in the mortgage-rate increase and that number jumps to about 23 per cent.The Magnelli family is feeling the effects. Mom Loredana Magnelli has saved for a few years to help her two kids, age 30 and 26, put together down payments to purchase apartments in Toronto. Their price point of about $300,000 each seemed like a viable opportunity two years ago. Now, that seems impossible.\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at a $400,000 to $450,000 mortgage and your interest rate is going to be higher, that\u2019s huge money,\u201d Magnelli said. She considered adding another mortgage to her own house to help get her kids their dream homes, but ultimately decided against it. They\u2019ve put a stop to their search for now in hopes that home prices will fall to more affordable levels.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cMy son is 30. He\u2019d like to have a place of his own.\u201dAmid the crunch in single-family homes, Tim Syrianos, president of the Toronto Real Estate Board, has seen a \u201ctremendous spike\u201d in interest for more affordable housing types like condominiums, townhouses and semi-detached homes. While the city\u2019s detached-home segment tumbled in the second half of 2017, condominium prices rose at a double-digit pace.Activity is also seeping out into surrounding suburbs that are near public transit and far more affordable than the city core, real-estate agents say.And just when you think the Canadian housing market is down for the count it tends to find a second wind. Vancouver\u2019s housing market plunged for five months after policymakers introduced a foreign-buyers tax in 2016 but has been recovering steadily since last year. Toronto\u2019s economy meanwhile is booming with the unemployment rate falling to 4.3 per cent in December from 5.5 per cent a year ago even as the city remains a magnet for immigrants.Syrianos\u2019s big worry isn\u2019t a cooling market but the lack of supply. \u201cIf supply continues to be as tight as it is, we will see double-digit increase in values.\u201dTwo of his clients for example were looking to buy a new house after having a baby but no longer qualify for a bigger mortgage under the new stress tests. They\u2019re renovating instead.\u201cYou\u2019re creating a heated renovation segment of the market and you\u2019re stifling supply,\u201d Syrianos says. \u201cIt just leads to more values going up faster than they should and making it harder for the average Canadian to buy a home.\u201dUltimately, policymakers and brokers alike want steady, incremental home price gains. Double-digit price growth was volatile and dangerous, said Simeon Papailias, co-founder of the Real Estate Center, real-estate management company. The new stress test will help make sure \u201cthat we don\u2019t have unqualified people creating bidding wars,\u201d he said in a phone interview.The Toronto Real Estate Board will release an outlook for the market on Tuesday with January numbers due in the next several days. But the real test will likely come as the spring selling season gets underway.\u201cSellers are looking for the money they were getting in May, and that\u2019s not a reality, it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Papailias, at the Real Estate Center, said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jill Ward and Stephanie Flanders", "title": "Easy money will be around for \u2018some time yet,\u2019 says Bank of Canada chief Stephen Poloz", "description": "Central banks aren't going to aggressively tighten policy because there are still vulnerabilities in many economies", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-poloz-says-its-not-really-the-end-of-easy-money", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/stephen-poloz6.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 26, 2018 1:18 PM EST", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said central banks aren\u2019t going to aggressively tighten policy because there are still underlying vulnerabilities in many economies.Calling this the \u201c\u2018end of easy money\u2019 is a little too simple,\u201d he said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that money is going to remain easy for some time yet\u201d because \u201ceconomies are still working their way through a lot of underlying stresses.\u201dCentral banks are slowly moving away from the emergency stimulus put in place after the financial crisis, and leaders gathered for the World Economic Forum have combined optimism with caution in their assessment of the outlook. The IMF sees global growth accelerating to the fastest pace in seven years, but exuberance in markets, surging debt in China and elsewhere, and political flash points \u2014 from Brexit to North Korea \u2014 are all risks.In Canada, officials have raised interest rates three times since mid-2017, including a hike just last week, which took the benchmark to 1.25 per cent. Poloz has been trying to gradually bring rates back to more normal levels amid strong growth and a surge in employment, without triggering an unwanted slowdown. He said there\u2019s still \u201cconsiderable\u201d slack in the labour market.In the euro area, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Thursday that while the economy is improving, policy will remain accommodative for some time to come. Policy makers are considering when they need to end their bond-buying program and how to start signalling that a change is coming.Poloz said companies are in an expansion phase and policy makers don\u2019t want higher borrowing costs to crimp confidence or hiring plans. He added that concerns about the future of the Nafta trade agreement are weighing on investment decisions.\u201cWhat happens in this late stage in the cycle is that investment becomes the principle driver of growth, and that builds more capacity, pulling that capacity out of the labour market and raising potential output,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching those ingredients as they unfold, and we can see that it\u2019s underway.\u201dAsked about central banks\u2019 room for manoeuvre, Poloz pointed out that the neutral rate of interest is probably lower now than in the past due to the debt overhang.\u201cThe economy finds a new place where interest rates have much more effect than in the past,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things we have to learn by probing, by moving our way along and assessing how things are evolving.\u201dOne thing he wouldn\u2019t comment on, however, was the conflicting signals coming out of the U.S. on currencies. U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the dollar would get stronger, and that remarks welcoming its weakness made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d\u201cI prefer not to talk about currencies at all except perhaps to interpret their moves,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cExchange rates are what they are.

He said the lender would consider similar transactions, as long as they \u201cpass all of the tests.\u201d\u201cWe assess every single case with those traps I just described,\u201d he said. When asked if the bank plans to take on a bigger role in the marijuana industry, White said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see.\u201dBank of Montreal is one of the few Canadian banks to provide business accounts to companies in the four-year-old medical marijuana industry, serving about a dozen firms. The industry is exploding as Canada moves toward legalizing pot for recreational use this year. At least 84 companies tied to marijuana are trading on the country\u2019s exchanges with a combined market value of about $37 billion.Non-bank Canadian securities firms including Canaccord Genuity Group Inc., GMP Capital Inc. and boutique companies have been most involved with the nascent industry. While most of the country\u2019s big banks have shied away from making commercial loans, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was part of a $20-million credit agreement with MedReleaf Corp. last year.In a wide-ranging interview, White also touched on economics, saying he\u2019s noticed a \u201cpositive vibe\u201d at Davos and in markets in Europe, Asia and North America.\u201cThe big risk that underlies all that is trade,\u201d White said, adding that he worries about the consequences of the North American Free Trade Agreement disappearing or being radically reshuffled. \u201cThe question is, will all that be disrupted if we have bad news on NAFTA?\u201dCanada\u2019s economy is unlikely to repeat last year\u2019s 3 per cent growth rate that topped the Group of Seven nations, he said.

Now we know that\u2019s an old-fashioned idea, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s been put to the test in the 12 months since President Donald Trump moved into the Oval Office. But we\u2019re not giving up!Last year our columnists selected a range of conventional and whimsical metrics by which to judge the success of the new president. We revisit them here. Bottom line: By these measures, he\u2019s doing better than his opponents will admit\u00a0and worse than his supporters believe.Like any president, Trump is taking credit for good economic news. He\u2019s highlighted rising stocks and falling unemployment. But Trump also, famously, regards trade deficits as a sign of economic weakness. And for people who worry about the fact that the U.S. buys more stuff from other countries than it sells them, the news has not been so good. The latest release from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis notes that the trade deficit was 12 per cent higher from January to October 2017 than during the same period of 2016. The trade deficit with China, a particular concern of Trump, is up even more.\u00a0The administration could respond to these numbers by increasing its focus on imposing and threatening tariffs. Or it could ignore them. Or, finally and least likely, Trump could decide that since trade deficits are compatible with economic growth, maybe he should stop caring so much about them.\u00a0Ramesh PonnuruA surprising amount of Americans Googled\u00a0\u201cmove to Canada\u201d in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s victory. His inauguration inspired\u00a0a\u00a0lesser rush of queries. But interest in self-exiling has flatlined ever since. Could it be that everyone who was threatening to flee has already left? Probably not. During the past year, users who searched for \u201cmove to Canada\u201d became intensely interested in a completely different topic: \u201cHow to impeach a president.\u201d So it looks like our prospective American-Canadian expats have switched gears to a slightly less dramatic plan. And\u00a0probably just as unlikely. Elaine OuThis measure, which tracks the relationship of deficits and growth, had a bigger annual improvement under former president Barack Obama than under any president since 1980, though only former president Bill Clinton saw perennial deficits transformed into annual surpluses. Under Trump, the trend is reversing. The deficit-to-GDP ratio widened to 3.4 per cent from 3 per cent since Trump became president amid lower-than-forecast tax receipts, less-than-robust wage gains and an aging workforce. The most extensive rewrite of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years by the Republican Congress and signed by Trump in 2017 will cost US$1 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Trump says that the tax cuts will eventually narrow the deficit by taking GDP growth to an unprecedented 4 per cent annual rate in the 21st century. No studies exist that show such a leap is possible. Matthew WinklerThe four Rust Belt states that gave Trump his unexpected 2016 victory have done reasonably well in the last year, showing cyclical strength but no real change in their unfortunate structural story. The unemployment rates in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin have all fallen. Yet the combined labor-force growth in those states has been a meager 0.4 per cent, suggesting that the jobs picture hasn\u2019t improved enough to change the narrative of long-term demographic decline.That kind of change will require more than presidential tweets and a corporate tax cut. Cyclical economic strength is nice and beats the alternative, but there\u2019s still no reason to believe that the Rust Belt will prosper in 2025, any more than it did in 2015. Conor SenTo the delight of supporters and the fury of opponents, Trump has followed through on his pledges to loosen regulations. \u201cThe administration has instilled a faith in business executives that new regulations are not coming,\u201d Binyamin Appelbaum and Jim Tankersley wrote recently in the New York Times.The most meaningful measures of increasing regulatory burdens come from the QuantGov project, which tracks words like \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d that create legal obligations in government manuals rather than merely counting pages. Its data show a significant slowdown in the growth of federal rules, although not an outright reversal. From Trump\u2019s inauguration through Jan. 16, 2018, restrictions grew by about 0.6 per cent, compared to 1.6 per cent in 2016.That doesn\u2019t make Trump the deregulatory champ, however, and in fact puts him slightly behind Obama\u2019s penultimate year. In 2015, restrictions grew by only 0.5 per cent. Since 1970, the number of restrictions has dropped in only three years: 1983 (-2.19 per cent), 1985 (-2.55 per cent), and 1996 (-3.16). Trump has a long way to go if he wants to beat Clinton\u2019s best year. Virginia PostrelFactory jobs have been an obsession for Trump. And after going flat for most of 2015 and 2016, their numbers have been on the increase since last January. The gains aren\u2019t much in the grand scheme of things \u2014 an estimated 196,000 manufacturing jobs added in 2017, compared with 4.7 million lost since the beginning of 2000 \u2014 and the biggest cause is probably the decline in the value of the dollar that began in December 2016. But tax cuts and the absence of new regulations have helped put U.S. businesses in a hopeful mood, and more manufacturing job gains seem likely. Justin FoxOfficial government numbers aren\u2019t out yet, but surveys by private companies show modest income gains for American households in early 2017.\u00a0It\u2019s way too soon to say whether Trump had anything to do with it; the trend just continues a recovery in real median household income that has been in place since 2014. Thanks to that recovery, income is now slightly higher than it was before the financial crisis. The continued slow expansion shows that Trump didn\u2019t immediately damage the economy when he took office. But the effects of recently passed tax and health-care legislation won\u2019t be known for a while. Noah SmithTrump promised to get U.S. corporations to bring back their foreign cash piles, which Moody\u2019s estimated at US$1.2 trillion at the end of 2016. Cash held by the foreign subsidiaries of U.S. multinationals \u2014 for the most part, tech and pharma ones \u2014 increased to about US$1.4 trillion by the end of 2017. But that doesn\u2019t mean Trump failed.The tax overhaul he signed in December imposes a 15.5 per cent tax on accumulated foreign profits, which is\u00a0expected\u00a0to bring in almost US$339 billion in tax revenue between 2018 and 2027. Apple is about to pay US$38 billion of that this year \u2014 and to invest billions more in the U.S. \u2014 now that its tax future is clearing up. Other companies, too, will probably invest some of their foreign cash in the U.S.Granted, they\u2019ll keep booking their non-U.S. sales in lower-tax jurisdictions like Ireland.\u00a0But Trump has probably done as much as he could to keep this particular promise. Leonid BershidskyOf the 33,425 civilians killed in 2017 in the Syrian war, 2,109 were children. This is according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Last year that was the metric I thought was worth watching. Despite the military defeat of the Islamic State, the resurrection of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime and an uneasy cease-fire negotiated by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the number of children killed in the Syrian war is not much smaller than it was in 2016. That year 2,372 children lost their lives in the conflict, out of 49,742 civilians who perished. Eli LakeCombining stock market performance and approval ratings provides\u00a0useful (and different) information about presidential performance.\u00a0The market boom under Trump is not the largest rally in history, but it\u2019s big. We don\u2019t know to what extent Trump\u2019s policies are responsible for the rise, but he didn\u2019t hurt and he probably helped.\u00a0At the same time, his approval ratings are under 40 per cent. In modern history, no president has entered his second year with such low numbers. We don\u2019t have to accept claims about the wisdom of crowds to agree that when a president has such low approval ratings, he\u2019s probably not doing a great job. On the stock market metric, Trump gets an A. On public approval, he gets a D.\u00a0Cass R. SunsteinA year ago, I wondered what Trump\u2019s disruptive influence would mean for the Washington real estate market. On the one hand, he was bringing in a lot of outsiders \u2014 many wealthy \u2014 who would need to find homes. On the other hand, the liberal affluent class might decide to look for another city to gentrify.What have we learned? In some ways, what we expected: Luxury housing did\u00a0very well\u00a0at the start of the year, while overall home prices rose by a piddly 1.6\u00a0per cent\u00a0\u2014 a big change for Washingtonians, who have seen the median value of homes for sale climb from US$390,000 in December of 2007 to US$535,000 at the end of 2016.The Republican tax bill Trump signed represents another rush of bad news for Washington homeowners. The District of Columbia is a high-tax jurisdiction, with a top income tax rate of 8.95 per cent. Its property taxes are on the low side, but the high value of property has more than made up for that, and homeowners can now deduct only US$10,000 in combined local and property taxes. So homeowners will now have to pay a very hefty premium for the privilege of living within the district.Many of us may have suspected that Trump would be bad for the value of our homes. But few of us could have suspected that the threat would come in the form of \u2026 higher taxes. We\u2019ll just have to sit tight and see if the next year brings further Trump-induced revisions to our bottom lines. Megan McArdleThe Stephen Bannon Index, measuring the media mentions of the Trump adviser as a proxy for bad news for Trump, ought to be obsolete. After all, Trump\u2019s scruffy Svengali was given the boot in August. Besides, lots of stories with words like \u201cMueller\u201d and \u201cRussia\u201d and \u201cguilty plea\u201d don\u2019t mention Bannon at all.Yet the Bannon Index was a reliable guide to a certain kind of bad news nonetheless. It had two big peaks and two small ones last year before exploding this January with the revelation that Bannon had deemed \u201ctreasonous\u201d Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s meeting with Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton.\u00a0There was a small peak at the dysfunctional start of Trump\u2019s administration, which included a few expressions of horror in the media that Bannon had been given a spot (later rescinded) on the National Security Council. There was a big peak in April, when White House leaks about internecine warfare between Bannon and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner kept reporters busy, along with a classic Trump dodge about how he really didn\u2019t know that Bannon fellow all that well. There was another peak when Bannon was fired in August, followed by a small peak when Bannon\u2019s preferred Senate candidate \u2014 the word \u201ccontroversial\u201d is too mousy to do him justice \u2014 managed to lose to a Democrat in Alabama, one of the nation\u2019s most conservative states.We don\u2019t know what 2018 will bring, but the Index doesn\u2019t lie. Bannon news is bad news for Trump.\u00a0Francis WilkinsonThe economy is doing well, with unemployment low and the stock market surging. Islamic State has been uprooted from its strongholds in Syria and Iraq. North Korea even stopped firing off ballistic missiles for a while and launched a charm offensive instead.In normal times, these positive trends would show up as positive responses to the standard poll question, \u201cIs the nation headed in the right direction or off on the wrong track?\u201d But there\u2019s nothing normal about the Trump presidency and Americans aren\u2019t happy about how their country is doing. In the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released on Friday, the public chose \u201cwrong track\u201d by a margin of 60 per cent to 34 per cent.That pessimism has deepened since Trump\u2019s inauguration, when the same polling group found that 52 per cent of Americans thought the U.S. was on the wrong track compared to 36 per cent who thought it was headed in the right direction.\u00a0 Albert R. HuntTrump is famously erratic, but the smart money at Ladbrokes finds the U.S. president remarkably consistent. When we checked in with Ladbrokes the week of Trump\u2019s inauguration, it was offering inauspicious odds on the reality television star. Even before Trump put his hand on a Bible, the betting class pegged his chances of avoiding resignation or impeachment during his first term at no better than 50-50.It turns out Trump is a stable bet. A year later, after tax cuts, indictments and those dismal poll numbers, not much has budged. The odds of Trump making a suspiciously early presidential departure are still about even.

A Bank of Canada report also showed building capacity constraints among businesses. The Canadian dollar strengthened to 80.93 US cents after the jobs data release on Jan. 5, the strongest level since September.Twenty-three of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Bank of Canada to increase its key rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent Wednesday with the market for overnight interest-rate swaps pricing in an 88 per cent certainty on Tuesday. In total, the swaps market is wagering rates will rise three times this year to 1.75 per cent.That\u2019s all a bit too optimistic for the money managers.\u201cAny number of risks could easily materialize to prevent the Bank of Canada from hiking more aggressively, including \u2014 ironically \u2014 that the bank tightens too quickly in the first half of 2018 and ends up straining a highly indebted household sector,\u201d said Ben Homsy, a Vancouver-based fixed income portfolio manager at Leith Wheeler, who helps oversee $20 billion. \u201cThe market is being too aggressive in terms of what is priced for the whole of 2018.\u201dJames Dutkiewicz, chief investment officer at Sentry Investments Inc. pointed to the market\u2019s reaction to reports of NAFTA ructions as an example of how quickly sentiment can turn.

Bloomberg obtained copies of both letters.Bombardier is facing the prospect of import duties of almost 300 per cent on the CSeries, its most advanced commercial jetliner, if the U.S. International Trade Commission confirms a preliminary Department of Commerce ruling later this month. The trade case, initiated by Chicago-based Boeing, has soured diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Canada \u2014 while also angering the U.K., where Bombardier operates a plant that builds wings for the CSeries.\u201cWe\u2019re willing to engage, we\u2019re willing to set up a table, we want solutions.\u00a0That solution means that there should be no tariffs,\u201d Canadian Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said Monday in a telephone interview when asked about the standoff with Boeing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very clear that we\u2019re going to defend the aerospace sector.\u201dBains declined to say whether discussions between Boeing, Canada and the U.K. are ongoing.Last month, Canada\u2019s federal government escalated the trade fight by scrapping plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets while launching a search for new military aircraft under parameters that could hamper future bids from the U.S. planemaker. British Prime Minister Theresa May, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and Clark have all said the case puts at risk Boeing\u2019s chances of winning future contracts from Britain.\u201cWe hope you will agree that it is in our collective interests for this issue to be resolved as soon as possible and would welcome an opportunity to see how we could settle this case in a reasonable way for all concerned,\u201d Freeland and Clark told Muilenburg in their joint letter, dated Dec. 18.The U.K. \u201cis now likely to explore a wider range of procurement alternatives in the future than would have otherwise been the case, in line with requirements on all U.K. procurers to consider social economic objectives,\u201d the ministers added.Dan Curran, a Boeing spokesman, confirmed Friday that Boeing received the letter from Freeland and Clark.\u201cSuggesting retribution against Boeing for calling out Bombardier\u2019s illegal trade practices is regrettable,\u201d Curran said in an emailed message. \u201cThe case is between two companies and concerns fairness in the aerospace market. This letter overlooks our long relationships with Canada and the U.K., and the sustained and significant economic investments we have made in each country.\u201dWriting on behalf of Muilenburg and Boeing\u2019s executive council, Allen said in a letter dated Jan. 5 that the company \u201cvery much\u201d regrets the impact the dispute with Bombardier had \u201con our longstanding relationship last year.\u201dAllen went on to list the economic benefits of Boeing\u2019s presence in both countries in terms of employment and purchasing commitments, adding: \u201cWe value and treasure the relationships that we have had and continue to have with you.

Markets are pricing in at least three more increases this year, which would bring the benchmark rate to 1.75 per cent.\u00a0Canada\u2019s economy, swept up by a synchronized global expansion, a housing boom and recovering oil prices, had a banner 2017 that included a sharp drop in unemployment and output growth that beat expectations. Policy makers now worry the economy could soon overheat, triggering inflation. Which is why they raised borrowing costs twice last year.The only remaining obstacles to further aggressive rate hikes may be high household debt loads and uncertainty about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 only one of which Governor Stephen Poloz has any influence over.\u2022 The Bank of Canada\u2019s overnight lending rate \u2014 which benchmarks most commercial loan rates in the country \u2014 is at 1 per cent.\u2022 It was as low as 0.5 per cent before the Ottawa-based central bank raised interest rates twice last year, in July and September.\u2022 Even with the two hikes, rates are still historically low. The overnight rate has averaged 2.9 per cent over the past 25 years\u2022 Commercial bank prime rates are at just over 3 per cent. While low, they are also up about half a percentage point from last yearCanadian households are easily the most indebted in the Group of Seven, and debt ratios have increased sharply since the 2014 oil shock. That means rate hikes pack a big punch in Canada by having an immediate and direct impact on the finances of many Canadians.Just as debt servicing costs are rising, regulators are also pushing through measures to tighten mortgage eligibility, with the latest moves coming into force on Jan. 1. Canadian households are not only facing more expensive debt payments, but the new rules threaten to damp price gains for their main assets: homes.All this will give policy makers some pause.The debt issue is important for another reason. It weakens the argument for Canada to follow U.S. rates higher.Usually, over time, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect Canadian rates to converge with those in the U.S. On average, the two policy rates align and three hikes would allow Canadian rates to keep pace with the Fed, which began its normalization process sooner. Investors anticipate up to three more hikes in the U.S. this year.Over the past 25 years, Canada\u2019s policy rate has been about a rate hike on average higher than the U.S. rate. At the moment it\u2019s 0.375 percentage points below, so there could be some catching up to do. But the U.S. \u2014 with its less indebted households \u2014 may be in a better position to cope with rate increases. Unlike Canada, U.S. debt ratios have actually been on the decline.In addition, the difference in household debt loads not only could impact the pace of increases, but even affect where interest rates eventually terminate.The Bank of Canada estimates its so-called neutral rate \u2014 a sort of Goldilocks rate that keeps the economy neither too hot nor too cold \u2014 at about 3 per cent. The Federal Reserve sees its neutral rate at 2.75 per cent, according to the median estimate in their most recent projections in December.The neutral rate is key because it gives policy makers a measure for how stimulative their policy rate is. The bigger the gap between the actual rate and the neutral rate, the more stimulative the current policy. The smaller the gap, the fewer rate hikes policy makers would expect to make.Canada\u2019s relatively higher debt levels \u2014 and its greater sensitivity to exchange rate movements \u2014 suggest the neutral rate should be lower in Canada than in the U.S., given it would have more difficulty sustaining rate increases, said Ian Pollick, head of rates strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto.\u201cOur terminal rate is probably lower than the Bank of Canada suggested,\u201d Pollick said. \u201cYou are over-indebted so that sensitivity to rate hikes is much higher.\u201dAnd while much has changed at the Bank of Canada over the past year, there\u2019s one thing Poloz hasn\u2019t budged on. That\u2019s his insistence that any convergence with the U.S. has a way to go, because the oil shock hit Canada harder.

Population growth will also continue to strengthen Canada\u2019s economy, especially as immigration policy stokes demand for housing in the fastest-growing markets.\u201cAfter controlling for fundamentals such as employment, population growth, housing tenure, immigration, education and the solidity of the welfare system, our analysis suggests that the ratio of household debt to disposable income in Canada is relatively conservative,\u201d Marion and Arseneau wrote. \u201cThis probably reflects the cumulative effect of all actions taken to date to mitigate the vulnerability of the financial system to household indebtedness.\u201dCanadians have binged on cheap credit to rack up expenses on homes and cars, pushing the ratio of household debt to disposable income to above 170 per cent. Rising Bank of Canada interest rates \u2014 another hike may come as soon as next week \u2014 will make it more expensive for borrowers to service the $1.5 trillion in mortgage credit outstanding.To be sure, rate hike expectations have cooled given the grim outlook for North American Free Trade negotiations. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said in a speech last month that high levels of debt will make the economy more sensitive to higher interest rates today than previously. The new federal mortgage rules that went into effect this month make it harder for certain borrowers to afford a home and could feed through to price growth, which has already cooled in Toronto and Vancouver over the past few months.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matthew Boyle", "title": "Wal-Mart raises minimum wage to $11, hands out bonuses in wake of U.S. tax overhaul", "description": "The retailer is also doling out one-time bonuses of up to US$1,000 and expanding its maternity and parental leave benefits", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/wal-mart-raises-minimum-wage-to-11-in-wake-of-u-s-tax-overhaul?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/0111walmart.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 11, 2018 3:32 PM EST", "content": "Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is boosting its starting hourly wage to $11 and delivering bonuses to employees, capitalizing on the U.S. tax overhaul to stay competitive in a tightening labor market.The increase takes effect next month and will cost US$300 million on top of annual wage hikes that were already planned, the world\u2019s largest retailer said Thursday. The one-time bonus of up to US$1,000 is based on seniority and will amount to an additional US$400 million. The company is also expanding its maternity and parental leave policy and adding an adoption benefit.Wal-Mart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, has fought in recent years to improve its image in the U.S., as it weathered criticism over its treatment of employees.\u00a0With the wage increase and bonus payment, the company seeks to even its pay gap with resurgent rival Target Corp., while simultaneously sending a high-profile thank you to the U.S. government for slashing the corporate tax rate.On the same day Wal-Mart announced the new benefits, the company also said it will close \u201ca series\u201d of Sam\u2019s Club warehouse locations after a portfolio review, illustrating how cost cutting remains a key focus. Wal-Mart didn\u2019t disclose how many of its 660 units it was shuttering. Business Insider reported it was closing 63 units, citing a company official it didn\u2019t identify.The wage increase comes three years after Wal-Mart\u2019s last big labor outlay, spending US$1 billion in 2015 to lift starting hourly pay to US$9 and then to US$10 the following year \u2014 for workers who complete a 90-day training course. The increase cut into profit and was criticized by some longer-tenured employees as unfair to them.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen wage stagnation for many years, so it\u2019s super important for lower-wage workers to see their wages rise,\u201d said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s due to two factors \u2014 state-level increases and a tightening labor market.\u201dSince Wal-Mart\u2019s initial increase starting in 2015, many states have enacted minimum-wage laws, meaning that a \u201csizable group\u201d of its 4,700 U.S. stores already pay $11 an hour, according to spokesman Kory Lundberg.Workers in the District of Columbia and the states of California, Washington and Massachusetts, already earn at least $11 an hour. And New York, Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Oregon will all reach that level next year, as efforts at the state level to boost livelihoods have gained steam.\u00a0A total of 18 states have increased minimum pay this year.Investors didn\u2019t have a strong reaction to Wal-Mart\u2019s pay hike and the store closures. The shares were little changed on Thursday, trading at US$99.92 at 2:56 p.m in New York. The stock advanced 43 per cent in 2017.The nation\u2019s unemployment rate has also plummeted\u00a0to 4.1 per cent from 5.7 per cent since Wal-Mart\u2019s first announcement of higher wages in 2015, creating a battle to recruit and retain cashiers and shelf stockers.Even with the wage bump, many workers will struggle if they\u2019re the sole breadwinner. A rate of US$11 an hour translates to US$22,000 a year for a typical 40-hour week, with two weeks of unpaid vacation time. The federal poverty level for a family of four is about US$24,600, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Wal-Mart\u2019s hike follows Target\u2019s October decision to increase its minimum hourly wage to US$11, which it will further boost to US$15 by the end of 2020. Costco Wholesale Corp. and other retail chains like TJX Cos. have also raised wages in recent years.The moves by Wal-Mart and others could help move the needle on stubbornly stagnant wage growth during the current economic expansion \u2014 if an increasing number of companies follow with their own pay hikes. Average hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory workers were up 2.3 per cent in December from a year earlier, according to Labor Department figures. In the previous economic uptick, wage growth peaked in December 2006 at 4.2 per cent on a year-over-year basis.Wal-Mart\u2019s decision makes it the latest corporate titan to plow expected tax savings into employee payouts. Boeing Co., AT&T Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. have all made similar announcements in recent weeks. Wal-Mart said it\u2019s \u201cearly in the process of assessing potential additional investments\u201d it could make.\u201cTax reform gives us the opportunity to be more competitive globally and to accelerate plans for the U.S.,\u201d Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Doug McMillon said in Thursday\u2019s statement.The retailer is also coming off a resurgence in same-store sales in recent years, giving it more of a cushion to boost pay. Last quarter, the\u00a0Bentonville, Arkansas-based company posted its strongest U.S. sales gain in more than eight years.\u201cWe think this is a prudent use of tax reform proceeds, as it reinforces the company\u2019s commitment to improving in-store service levels and will pressure other retailers to invest more heavily into wages and prices,\u201d Ben Bienvenu, an analyst at Stephens, said in a note.The one-time bonuses will range from US$200 to US$1,000, depending on how long workers have been with Wal-Mart. The idea is to reward employees who won\u2019t benefit from the new starting wage.The company also will provide full-time hourly workers with 10 weeks of paid maternity leave and six weeks of paternal leave. Parents who adopt kids will get the same benefit, along with US$5,000 to help cover the costs.While companies and states have increased salaries in recent years, the US$7.25 federal minimum wage has not budged since 2009. That irks some economists, who say the federal level has failed to keep up with inflation and productivity.\u201cA better solution would be to raise the federal minimum wage and not leave it up to corporations,\u201d Gould said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Luke Kawa", "title": "Why Stephen Poloz should stop losing sleep over the state of the youth job market", "description": "BoC governor has expressed concern over the youth labour participation rate, but economists say Poloz needn't worry", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/stephen-poloz-can-sleep-soundly-the-canadian-kids-are-alright", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/0109poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2018 1:32 PM EST", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz cited in his last speech of 2017 \u201cthe tough job market for young people\u201d as one of a trio of things keeping him awake at night.The data, however, should prove a soothing lullaby.The rising tide of Canadian employment \u2014 which has expanded for 13 straight monthly readings, punctuated by a whopping addition of 78,600 jobs in December \u2014 has been lifting even the youngest boats. The latest data show 57.2 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 24 years have a job, the highest share since January 2009. The past calendar year saw the largest improvement in the employment rate for this age bracket since 2002.\u201cLabour markets are healthy, with falling youth participation the result of increasing education levels \u2014 a positive long-term development,\u201d Brian DePratto, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a research note Tuesday on the issue.For Poloz, suboptimal outcomes among young Canadians would be a cause for concern. Their lack of participation limits the top speed at which the economy can grow, while impressionable youth who can\u2019t make their way into the labour market may end up grappling with \u201ca scar that could last a lifetime.\u201dIn his December speech, the governor bemoaned how the youth labour force participation rate had fallen nearly 5 percentage points over the past decade. His concern about youth employment is perceived as a dovish signal, an indication he sees continued slack in what is otherwise a red-hot labour market.DePratto thinks the concern is overplayed. \u201cThis is an area where we disagree that the signal is worrisome,\u201d according to the TD report. \u201cTo begin with, a decade ago was a pre-crisis cyclical high\u201d for youth participation rates \u201cand so perhaps should not be viewed as the best point of comparison.\u201dYoung Canadians not in school are just as likely to be in the labour force as they were a decade ago, DePratto notes, with the participation rate among non-students currently just off its post-crisis peak.Digging more deeply into the data, subdued youth participation is acutely attributable to Canadian teenagers: a group with a historically low rate of labour-force attachment.\u201cThe data suggest that any deviations in participation have been driven by high school kids changing their behaviour,\u201d said Randall Bartlett, chief economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t support the narrative that monetary policy should be formulated on the basis of any supposed weakness in these youth labour market metrics.\u201dIndeed, more than 90 per cent of young Canadians outside of the labour force say they don\u2019t want work.That means the room for cyclical improvement in youth underemployment seems fairly limited, no matter what the central bank does. The Bank of Canada\u2019s main tool \u2014 changes to short-term interest rates \u2014 is considered to be a particularly blunt means of influencing economic activity.Unemployed youth are more likely to look for a part-time job \u2014 a sign that a rising youth employment rate might not pack all that big of a punch for the growth of labour input. For example, less than one-fifth of young workers who have a part-time gig say they really want full-time employment, a share that has fallen for three consecutive years.\u201cFinding a negative story in the employ\u00adment data is something of a data-mining exercise,\u201d DePratto writes.That\u2019s reflected in the fact that all of the nation\u2019s six biggest commercial lenders are now predicting the Bank of Canada will raise its policy rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent next week, on the heels of an unemployment rate that\u2019s dropped to its lowest level in more than 40 years and signs that companies are reaching capacity constraints.\u201cThere\u2019s probably less slack in the labour market than there even is in the economy \u2014 for me, that\u2019s a big concern and it should be for the bank,\u201d Bartlett said.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Five reasons the Bank of Canada might NOT raise its rate next week", "description": "But with all six big banks calling for a rise, markets could get a jolt if Stephen Poloz actually holds", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/heres-why-case-for-bank-of-canada-rate-hike-isnt-airtight", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/stephen-poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2018 12:44 PM EST", "content": "A Bank of Canada rate increase next week isn\u2019t a sure thing.Even with all of Canada\u2019s biggest commercial banks now calling for a hike, if the central bank chooses to hold off, it could cite a range of factors from tepid inflation to Nafta uncertainties.There's a pretty good case for them going. I don't think it's airtightOn Monday, Bank of Montreal became the last major Canadian bank to change its forecast for next week to a rate hike. That followed the release of the central bank\u2019s latest quarterly survey, which showed a generally robust outlook for the country\u2019s sales and businesses investment.\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty good case for them going. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s airtight,\u201d said Doug Porter, BMO\u2019s Toronto-based chief economist.Here are some reasons Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz could give for holding steady on Jan. 17.In spite of 2017 producing the strongest gross domestic product growth in six years, and unemployment running at the lowest in four decades, Porter points out that inflation still isn\u2019t dangerously above target.In addition, the business outlook survey Monday showed a majority of executives still see inflation holding at or below 2 per cent over the next two years.The Canadian dollar has strengthened 11 per cent against its U.S. counterpart since May, and speculation about higher interest rates may jack it higher. Poloz could seek to stem that move by staying on the sidelines next Wednesday.Porter and Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, also cited risks the U.S. could abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement, a threat to three-quarters of Canada\u2019s exports.If we're wrong, we're all getting it wrongPoloz has repeatedly said the bank is watching to see how the two rate hikes last year will affect the nation\u2019s highly indebted borrowers. The governor said in a speech last month \u201chigh levels of debt will make the economy as a whole more sensitive to higher interest rates today than in the past.\u201dAn additional consideration is that new federal mortgage rules, which took effect this month, will make it tougher for some borrowers to afford a home and could weigh on prices, compounding the risks from higher rates.Any pause next week could give a bigger jolt to markets than the increase in September, when there was more of a split among economists, according to Holt. \u201cIf we\u2019re wrong, we\u2019re all getting it wrong,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "'We will outperform': Canada's top preferred fund seeks value in turbo-charged market", "description": "The odds of a rate hike have more than doubled, but Canada's best-performing preferred share fund isn't rushing to adjust its strategy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/top-canada-preferred-fund-seeks-value-in-turbo-charged-market", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/01069boc.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2018 10:01 AM EST", "content": "The odds of a rate hike at the next Bank of Canada meeting more than doubled after a blockbuster December jobs report, but Canada\u2019s best-performing preferred share fund isn\u2019t rushing to adjust its strategy.\u201cWe put less of a focus on interest-rate anticipation and more of a focus on selecting undervalued securities,\u201d said Ryan Domsy, manager of the $167 million (US$134 million) preferred share fund at Foyston, Gordon & Payne Inc., a Toronto-based investment manager with $13.3 billion under management. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re floaters, perpetuals or rate resets \u2014 if we\u2019re constantly buying what\u2019s undervalued, we will outperform.\u201dPreferred shares have had a great run as Canada\u2019s economy picked up steam in 2017, culminating in a plunge in the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent in December \u2014 the lowest in more than 40 years.

He believes this approach gives him an edge over other managers, who tend to measure value using more simplistic metrics like yield-to-reset or yield-to-call ratios.\u201cWhen you look at the financials, for example, people paint all banks with almost one brush, which is fairly ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s huge differences between the risk levels of a TD Bank and a National Bank, and when you look at the fixed-income securities that they issue, it\u2019s very rarely ever reflected in the pricing or the return characteristics.\u201dThe fund\u2019s small size gives it an advantage, Domsy said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a US$3 billion fund you literally have to hold everything, you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201dBy contrast, FGP\u2019s fund can be \u201ca lot more nimble than some of the big managers that have to buy every new issue that comes to market,\u201d said Raj Lala, chief executive officer of Evolve Funds Group Inc., whose pref ETF mirrors the FGP fund.\u201cThe nice thing is right now preferreds have actually for the most part lagged the recent changes in interest rates,\u201d Domsy said. \u201cSo even if the interest rate increases aren\u2019t as aggressive as some people are expecting, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a problem with preferreds.

The number of jobs rose by 78,600, beating expectations and bringing the full-year employment gain to 422,500. That\u2019s the best annual increase since 2002.The economy showed unexpected resiliency as the year came to an end, with the figures indicating rapidly diminishing slack in the labor market that may quicken the expected pace of interest-rate increases by the Bank of Canada. Since September, Canada added 193,400 jobs \u2014 the biggest three-month gain since at least 1976.\u201cThe latest data in hand support a rate hike\u201d in January, said Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. \u201cBroad-based growth is still the dominant theme.\u201dCanadian bond yields and the currency soared on the surprisingly strong jobs data. The loonie strengthened to 80.90 US cents, the strongest since September.Bond prices plunged on expectations the jobs report may prompt the central to raise rates as early as this month. The yield on the two-year government of Canada bond jumped six basis points to 1.77 per cent, close to a seven-year high. The odds of a rate hike at the Bank of Canada\u2019s next meeting on Jan. 17 soared to 70 per cent, from 40 per cent yesterday, based on trading in the swaps market.The good news Friday wasn\u2019t just relegated to the jobs market. Statistics Canada reported separately the nation\u2019s exporters are beginning to exit from a months long slump, with shipments jumping by 3.7 per cent in November, the biggest one-month gain in more than a year.While the current jobs data series begins in 1976, the jobless rate may be the lowest since 1974. According to the previous employment data series that ended in 1975, Canada had a jobless rate of 5.6 per cent in November 1974.Both the employment and jobless rate figures beat the consensus economist forecast for a 6 per cent unemployment rate and 2,000 new jobs. PNC\u2019s Adams had the closest prediction to the actual jobs gain, with a forecast for 24,000 new jobs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .The extent of the boom in Canadian jobs this year has largely caught policy makers and economists by surprise, given most have been anticipating an aging workforce to eventually become a drag on employment. Yet it seems the nation\u2019s labor market had plenty of pent up supply, and much of it is rising to the surface as the economy continues to do well.While most of the new jobs in December were part-time, the bulk of new hires in 2017 were full-time. The nation added 394,200 full-time jobs last year, the biggest gain since 1999.The gains last year were led by services with 290,300 new positions. Goods-producers added 132,100 jobs, with an 85,700 increase in manufacturing that was the strongest since 2002. Actual hours worked in December were 3.1 per cent above year-ago figures, the fastest since 2010.And there are signs that wages \u2014 which had been stagnant for much of 2017 \u2014 are showing signs of accelerating.

Even as unemployment dropped to 4.1 per cent, the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation dipped to as low as 1.4 per cent, before rebounding to 1.8 per cent in the 12 months through November.Fed officials said the pace of rate hikes could be slower if inflation failed to move up toward their 2 per cent target. \u201cWhile participants generally saw the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, they agreed that inflation developments should be monitored closely,\u201d the minutes said.The yield curve, or differences between short and longer-term rates on benchmark Treasury securities, received some discussion at the December meeting. Investors have raised concerns that the so-called flatness of the curve, where the spread between short- and long-term rates narrows, could portend a recession.Fed officials \u201cgenerally agreed that the current degree of flatness of the yield curve was not unusual by historical standards,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cHowever, several participants thought that it would be important to continue to monitor the slope of the yield curve.\u201dA week after the FOMC meeting, lawmakers passed a $1.5 trillion cut in corporate and personal taxes.

That may change.The Canadian prime minister spent the end of 2017 on the defensive over tax changes, his finance chief and an ethics reprimand. He often parried the attacks by saying his political opponents were only slinging mud because they didn\u2019t want to talk about the economy, which led the Group of Seven in growth last year.Trudeau\u2019s defence is about to weaken, with Canada\u2019s economy poised to fall back to Earth this year from an expected 3 per cent gain in 2017. The country will expand at a still solid pace of 2.2 per cent in 2018, behind the U.S. and tied with Germany for second in the G7, Bloomberg survey estimates show. Canadian growth is then forecast to slow again to 1.8 per cent in 2019.Strong growth last year \u201cprobably moved the Canadian economy close to capacity, so as a result there are capacity constraints that are starting to kick in,\u201d Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in an interview. In a report last month, RBC forecast growth of 2.9 per cent in 2017, 1.9 percent in 2018 and 1.6 per cent in 2019, all slightly below consensus estimates. \u201cGrowth of 1.9, given the circumstance, is still a solid pace,\u201d Ferley said.A rebound in business investment, which slumped in 2015 and 2016 in the aftermath of the oil shock, helped drive last year\u2019s robust growth, Ferley said. Other factors included the recovery from a major 2016 fire in the heart of Alberta\u2019s oilpatch, and the introduction of a new child benefit that the Bank of Canada has praised and has helped boost spending.It\u2019s not all bad news for Trudeau. If growth were to continue at 2017\u2019s pace, it could lead to excessive inflation, Ferley said. \u201cIt\u2019s not undesirable to see that moderation.\u201dBut bad news dogged the prime minister as the year drew to a close. Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog found last month that Trudeau broke the rules with a vacation the previous year to an island owned by the Aga Khan, and his government had to backtrack on tax changes that angered small businesses and eventually thrust Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u2019s own finances into the spotlight.\u201cFor months, the prime minister and minister of finance have tried to minimize the devastating impact that their tax changes will have,\u201d Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said in the legislature before it broke for the holidays.If they're spending all their time on personal attacks and on supposed ethical issues, why aren't they talking about the economy?Trudeau pointed to the latest jobs data in response. Canada\u2019s unemployment rate is below 6 per cent for the first time since 2008, and the economy has added nearly 400,000 jobs over the past 12 months. \u201cThe positive outcomes leave the opposition with nothing to do but to fling accusations and throw mud,\u201d the prime minister told lawmakers.\u00a0In a year-end interview with broadcaster Global News, Trudeau added: \u201cIf they\u2019re spending all their time on personal attacks and on supposed ethical issues, why aren\u2019t they talking about the economy?\u201dFor now, the strategy is working. Consumer confidence is nearing a record high, phone polling conducted by Nanos Research for Bloomberg shows, particularly in Quebec \u2014 a region essential to Trudeau\u2019s re-election hopes in 2019. His Liberals have rebounded in polls since reaching a low in October, with Nanos polling conducted for CTV News putting them at 42.8 per cent support, 13 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives, their nearest rival in Canada\u2019s multiparty system.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Daniel Moss", "title": "Five things to fear in a strong global economy", "description": "The world economy entered 2018 on a stronger footing than many dared predict, so what could go wrong?

Growth is picking up almost everywhere and deflation is no longer feared. Central banks are making themselves less dominant without scaring markets. Japan is no longer a euphemism for failure, Europe is showing some hard-earned vigor, and China isn\u2019t unraveling. Even Brazil is looking better.What could go wrong? Well, a few things:1. Will the U.S. Federal Reserve make a policy error under its new chair, Jerome Powell? Janet Yellen flawlessly handled three interest-rate increases and the start of balance-sheet reduction. Tensions will rise if unemployment continues to exceed Fed forecasts and inflation continues to lag them. In that event, the Fed may be tempted to take out some insurance by raising rates more than expected in case inflation shows up. That would be a mistake, a disorienting jolt to investors whose asset-price assumptions are predicated on low rates.2. Will China\u2019s economy hold up? It was supposed to slow a bit in 2017. That didn\u2019t happen, adding to global buoyancy. Most economists have penciled in a slight slowing in 2018 as the government nudges state-owned companies to lighten their debt loads. But the debt implosion so many naysayers have predicted hasn\u2019t happened, giving China the flexibility to play an ever larger role in global prosperity. Key man to watch: Liu He, an economic aide to President Xi Jinping who has accrued enormous power over the policy apparatus. And don\u2019t be surprised to see a new central bank governor.3. Will there be a race to the bottom on corporate tax rates? The reduction to 21 per cent that was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in December is likely to tempt other developed countries to consider matching or undercutting them. Combined U.S. corporate tax rates (federal and state) will fall significantly below a number of Group of Seven economies, according to Krishna Guha at Evercore ISI. I wrote last month that tax cutting is a likely part of an expansionary shift in global fiscal policy. Let the games begin.4. Will Trump be provoked? For all the talk about populism and the anti-trade mood in the U.S., Mexico\u2019s presidential election may represent as much risk to the North American Free Trade Agreement as White House swings between hostility and ambivalence. The leftist front-runner in Mexico\u2019s 2018 presidential contest, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, won\u2019t be shy about going toe-to-toe in social media with Trump. It\u2019s not much of a stretch to imagine that Trump, in a fit of pique, announces his intention to quit the trade pact. If the U.S. does exit, a swath of farm-belt states could easily slide into recession.5. Will politics hurt growth, finally? The U.S. wasn\u2019t the only place where markets and growth got the upper hand over geopolitical ructions in 2017. Both Indonesia and Malaysia are preparing for elections, and political Islam is flexing its muscles in both historically secular countries. Indonesian local elections are held in June, and then the focus will shift to next year\u2019s presidential contest. Islamist groups forced the ouster of a key reformist governor close to President Joko Widodo, and have power to get out of the vote and turn people out on the streets. Malaysia\u2019s ruling party faces voters by August and is likely to rely on gerrymandering that favors rural, heavily Malay, culturally conservative districts. Prime Minister Najib Razak tried out this line in 2016: Malays would be \u201cbeggars\u201d in their own land and Islamic institutions would fall should the opposition take over. Najib\u2019s family is part of the old-line political establishment, but he and his bloc have increasingly courted Malay nationalists and Islamists since an intraparty blowup in the late 1990s.Happy New Year.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Daniel Moss writes and edits articles on economics for Bloomberg View.

His wife, sitting in the gallery, burst into tears.Shkreli, who was convicted in August of defrauding investors, is being held in prison while he awaits sentencing. He was ousted from Retrophin in September 2014 and went on to found Turing Pharmaceuticals AG, where he incited public outrage by jacking up the price of a life-saving drug more than 5,000 percent. Just four months later in December 2015, he was arrested and charged with fraud. Greebel was tried separately from Shkreli.Greebel was accused of conspiring with Shkreli by helping him devise sham settlement and consulting contracts to pay back investors, using assets from Retrophin, as well as helping Shkreli in the share-control scheme. Jurors in Greebel\u2019s trial were treated to a virtual repeat of testimony from Shkreli\u2019s case, with most of the witnesses, including investors, consultants and board members making repeat appearances.Dig DirtThis time around, Greebel\u2019s defense lawyers were able to dig up more dirt on the witnesses to impugn their credibility, including an admission from an accountant testifying about an alleged fraud that he had engaged in his own possible ethical breach by making a $200,000 loan off-the-books to another client. Defense lawyers also accused a former Retrophin employee testifying about questionable transactions of engaging in cybercrimes to gather evidence. A lawyer advised him not to answer those questions on grounds of his privilege against self-incrimination.Greebel was a corporate lawyer at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, and he advised Retrophin as outside counsel. Current Retrophin CEO Steve Aselage and former chairman Steve Richardson alleged that Greebel appeared to show more loyalty to Shkreli than to the company, including by advising him about the terms of his employment agreement when the board was in the process of ousting Shkreli in late 2014.Emails also showed the young executive berating Greebel, calling him and his colleagues \u201clazy and stupid and paid too much.\u201d Prosecutors alleged that Greebel showed deference to Shkreli and \u201chatched a plan\u201d with him to engage in fraud.Other lawyers who worked with Greebel, testifying for the defense, said he was a talented attorney and that Shkreli was a just a difficult client. Witnesses for Greebel said that they believed the consulting agreements were legitimate.Greebel was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for helping Shkreli steal from Retrophin and conspiracy to commit securities fraud for helping Shkreli manipulate company shares.The case is U.S. v.

In her final scheduled press conference before before stepping down on Feb. 3, Yellen also said she would do her utmost to ensure a smooth transition to her nominated successor, Jerome Powell.In a key change to its statement announcing the decision, the Federal Open Market Committee omitted prior language saying it expected the labour market would strengthen further. Instead, Wednesday\u2019s missive said monetary policy would help the labour market \u201cremain strong.\u201d That suggests Fed officials expect improvement in the job market to slow.The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell after the Fed announcement, as did the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index. Trading at record highs recently, stocks jumped after the Fed\u2019s announcement before paring gains. Asked during a press conference about rising asset prices, Yellen said the high valuations don\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re overvalued and that she\u2019s not seeing a worrisome buildup of leverage or credit.The 7-2 vote for the rate move, the Fed\u2019s third this year, raises the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.25 per cent to 1.5 per cent. In another move that could tighten monetary conditions, the Fed confirmed that it would step up the monthly pace of shrinking its balance sheet, as scheduled, to US$20 billion beginning in January from US$10 billion.Through the policy adjustments and the statement, the Fed continued to seek a delicate balance between responding to positive news on growth and unemployment that encouraged gradual tightening, while signalling caution due to persistently weak inflation readings that have befuddled policy makers.That puzzle continued earlier Wednesday when Labor Department data showed consumer inflation, excluding food and energy, was lower than expected at 1.7 per cent in the 12 months through November.\u201cHurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding have affected economic activity, employment and inflation in recent months but have not materially altered the outlook for the national economy,\u201d the Fed said. Repeating language used since June, the FOMC said that \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.\u201dIn the latest set of quarterly forecasts released Wednesday, the median estimate for economic growth next year jumped to 2.5 per cent from 2.1 per cent. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how much of the change reflected confidence that the tax-cut legislation moving through Congress will boost growth, or other factors such as pickups in business spending and global growth.At the same time, the committee\u2019s median forecast for long-run expansion was unchanged at 1.8 per cent, suggesting officials aren\u2019t yet convinced the tax package will significantly affect the economy\u2019s capacity for growth.Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and the Chicago Fed\u2019s Charles Evans both dissented against the interest-rate decision, preferring to leave them unchanged. It was the first meeting with more than one dissent since November 2016; Kashkari\u2019s dissent was his third this year. Evans dissented for the first time since 2011.What Our Economists Say: \u201cThe most important takeaway from the December FOMC meeting is that even though policy makers are becoming more bullish on economic prospects, they are not shifting to a more hawkish policy stance.\u00a0An extended inflation soft patch is giving the Powell-Fed a free pass to continue along Janet Yellen\u2019s gradualist path toward policy normalization.\u201d \u2014 Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, Bloomberg Economics.That follows a solid rebound for the expansion since a disappointing start to 2017. Gross domestic product grew at more than a 3 per cent annualized pace in both the second and third quarters, and is on track to expand in the fourth quarter by 2.9 per cent, according to the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow tracking estimate.Despite the upgrade in near-term growth expectations, policy makers left the number of hikes projected for 2018 effectively unchanged. The median forecast pegged the federal funds rate at 2.1 per cent at the end of next year.That could, in part, reflect lingering concerns over sluggish wage and price gains. The Fed\u2019s preferred gauge of inflation, based on consumer spending, gained just 1.6 per cent in the year through October.Weighed against unemployment, which has dropped to a 16-year low at 4.1 per cent, that weakness has puzzled economists and made some policy makers declare the Fed should hold off on additional rate increases until prices respond more briskly.The committee lowered its median estimate for the unemployment rate, expecting it to hit 3.9 per cent by the end of 2018, compared with a September projection of 4.1 per cent.The committee left its median estimate for the lowest sustainable\u00a0level\u00a0of long-run unemployment at 4.6 per cent, suggesting that officials still expect the drop in joblessness to eventually boost inflation. Forecasts showed little change in the inflation outlook over the next three years.Yellen is expected to chair the committee\u2019s next meeting on Jan. 30-31 for what will be her last FOMC gathering of her time on the committee spanning three decades as chair, vice chair, San Francisco Fed president and governor.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Eric J.

The test for policy makers, including incoming Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, will be whether they can continue pulling back without derailing demand or rocking asset markets.\u201c2018 is the year when we have true tightening,\u201d said Ebrahim Rahbari, director of global economics at Citigroup in New York. \u201cWe will continue on the current path where financial markets can deal quite well with monetary policy but perhaps later in the year, or in 2019, monetary policy will become one of the complicating factors.\u201dA clearer picture should form this week when the Norges Bank, Fed, Bank of England, European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank announce their final policy decisions of 2017. They collectively set borrowing costs for more than a third of the world economy. At least 10 other central banks also deliver decisions this week.The Fed will dominate the headlines on Wednesday amid predictions it will raise its benchmark by a quarter of a percentage point. Outgoing chair Janet Yellen is set to signal more increases to come in 2018. On Thursday, the SNB, BOE and ECB will make decisions in quick succession although each is forecast to keep rates on hold.There will likely be more activity next year as Citigroup estimates the advanced world\u2019s average rate will reach its highest since 2008, climbing 0.4 percentage point to 1 per cent. JPMorgan projects its gauge to rise to 1.2 per cent, a jump of more than half a percentage point from 0.68 per cent at the end of this year.Citigroup expects the Fed and its Canadian peer to move three times and the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Norway once. JPMorgan is forecasting the Fed will shift four times, the same as the median estimate of economists in the latest Bloomberg survey.Behind the shift are expectations that the world economy will expand around 4 per cent next year, the best since a post-recession bounce in 2011. Among the accelerators: falling unemployment, stronger trade and business spending, as well as a likely tax cut in the U.S.The International Monetary Fund predicts consumer prices in advanced economies will climb 1.7 per cent next year, the most since 2012, although it remains below the 2 per cent most central banks view as price stability.The global tightening will still leave rates low by historical standards and central banks may ultimately hold fire if inflation stays weak. Neither the ECB nor the BOJ are currently expected to lift their benchmarks next year.Past and ongoing bond buying will cushion the withdrawal of stimulus elsewhere, as will easing by some emerging market central banks. Russia and Colombia may this week follow Brazil in cutting their benchmarks.While BOE Governor Mark Carney and ECB President Mario Draghi pivoted away from easy money without roiling financial markets, the calm may not last. The Bank for International Settlements warned this month that policy makers risk lulling investors into a false sense of security that elevates the risk of a correction in bond yields.\u201cMany developed market central banks, led by the Fed, are entering 2018 taking a leap of faith that inflation will return as they move toward normalizing monetary policy.\u00a0Continued asset purchases by the BOJ and ECB\u00a0will buy sometime for policy makers to discover the unattended consequences of quantitative tightening without risking a severe market disruption. Nevertheless, too much normalization too fast, risks reversing a relatively upbeat global economic outlook in 2018, especially if central bankers\u2019 assumptions on the Phillips Curve prove to be false.\u201d \u2013Michael McDonough, Bloomberg EconomicsInvestors are already less bullish than most economists. In the U.S., where inflation has shown some signs of slowing, the market sees about two quarter-point hikes next year, according to federal funds futures contracts. There is also speculation the bond yield curve may even invert as long-term borrowing costs fall below short-term ones, a trade which sometimes foreshadows a recession.Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, is betting that \u201cquantitative tightening\u201d will hit markets in the second quarter. That\u2019s when he assumes U.S. inflation takes off and the ECB signals an end to bond buying.\u201cWe see 2018 as a pretty key year for normalization,\u201d said Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec in London. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite challenging for central banks to get the balance right on how much to do.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Borrowers might dodge a rate hike today, but brace yourself for three, or more, next year", "description": "At least two economists think the Bank of Canada will deliver more rate hikes than the market is expecting next year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-set-to-end-year-on-pause-after-two-summer-hikes", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/stephen-poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 6, 2017 9:25 AM EST", "content": "Governor Stephen Poloz is expected to stay on hold at his last interest-rate decision of 2017, capping a year that saw the Bank of Canada start the delicate process of raising borrowing costs to more normal levels.Investors are assigning a 20 per cent chance of an increase at the decision Wednesday, with a statement to be released at 10 a.m. Ottawa time. Only four of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect Poloz to increase his 1 per cent benchmark rate, with all major Canadian banks expecting a pause.Central bank policy makers \u2014 who raised borrowing costs for the first time in seven years in July and September \u2014 are handling the normalization of policy very carefully. By their own measure, interest rates are still a full 2 percentage points below what they would consider \u201cneutral\u201d but the Bank of Canada is wary of raising borrowing costs too quickly for fear of inadvertently triggering another downturn.Investors anticipate as many as three more hikes by the end of 2018 with the first in March, swaps trading suggests.Rates will need to rise to account for an economy that has been one of the strongest in the developed world with a jobs market on a tear. Even with an anticipated second-half slowdown, Canada is headed for 3 per cent growth for all of 2017. That\u2019s almost a percentage point above U.S. growth and has prompted some to question whether historically low interest rates \u2014 currently at below the rate of inflation \u2014 are appropriate for an economy at near its full capacity.\u201cWe continue to think the central bank will be forced by strong data to deliver more interest rate hikes than what markets are currently expecting for 2018,\u201d National Bank of Canada economists Stefan Marion and Krishen Rangasamy said in a note to investors Monday.But there is also a case to be made for caution, and central bank policy makers have spent much of the past two months making it.\u201cWhether it\u2019s about how aggressive or how cautious policy should be \u2014 getting the dosage right demands sound judgment about complex trade-offs,\u201d Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said in a Nov. 15 speech, the last by a central bank governing council member before the decision.One argument against rate increases is weak inflation, which has undershot the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target for years. If the economy can continue expanding at a fast clip without overheating, policy makers can afford to wait longer before raising interest rates.The Bank of Canada has also been voicing a narrative that the economy is at the \u201csweet spot\u201d of the business cycle where growing demand is actually generating new capacity as companies invest to meet sales. The idea essentially is that demand can actually generate supply, at least temporarily, limiting price pressures.The central bank has cited a number of other reasons for its caution:Policy makers are worried about the impact of higher borrowing costs on the ability of Canadians to pay their bills \u2014 and the nation is carrying the heaviest household debt burden in the Group of Seven, by far. Growing risks associated with renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. A slowing housing market coupled with the impact of new regulatory measures to rein in lending. Continued evidence of slack in the labour market despite the unemployment rate being at a decade low.There is also the impact higher interest rates could have on the Canadian dollar. Policy makers were spooked earlier this year by a sharp gain in the currency following its two rate increases that spurred expectations the Bank of Canada would outpace the Federal Reserve\u2019s hiking path.Talk of caution has helped weaken the currency by almost 5 per cent since the September rate hike, and brought policy expectations more into sync with the Fed. Bank of Canada officials may be more comfortable with that.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "From picked-over carcass to agile global player: How a 107-year-old Canadian steelmaker is stirring to life", "description": "After decades of crisis, a renewed sense of purpose has settled over Stelco, which just completed an IPO under the leadership of a turnaround artist with a solid track record", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/at-age-107-steelmaker-once-seen-as-a-relic-is-stirring-to-life", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/1205stelco3.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 5, 2017 9:48 AM EST", "content": "Winter is coming and\u00a0Stelco Holdings Inc.\u2019s steel plant\u00a0on the\u00a0Canadian shore of Lake Erie is stocking up for the stormy months ahead.\u00a0Iron ore from Minnesota and\u00a0Appalachian coal are streaming off ships on conveyor belts toward the blast furnace and coke ovens. Behind the docks, 25-ton coils of steel are lined up for shipment, still radiating heat three days after they were produced.After decades of crisis, a renewed sense of purpose has settled over the 107-year-old company, which just completed the first\u00a0initial public offering of a North American steelmaker in seven years. The question hanging over the reinvigorated enterprise is whether Stelco\u00a0is finally on the cusp of sustained profitability, or whether it will wilt in an industry dominated by global giants and cheap Asian producers.In the pantheon of great Canadian corporate names, Stelco doesn\u2019t exactly scream confidence. The Hamilton, Ontario-based\u00a0Steel Company of Canada was once the country\u2019s biggest producer, with a workforce of 25,000 in the 1970s.It\u2019s since gone through two stints in creditor protection while it struggled with operating losses, bitter labour relations, high debts and pension deficits. Its most recent owner,\u00a0U.S. Steel Corp., plucked some of Stelco\u2019s best contracts and abandoned what was left of the company in 2015. Ahead, the winter freeze is the least of its worries as protectionist moves in the U.S. threaten to restrain its ability to expand in North America.Who in their right mind would want to take control of such a business?Meet\u00a0Alan Kestenbaum, the 55-year-old Brooklyn-born turnaround artist who\u2019s now Stelco\u2019s principle owner and chief executive. Where others see a picked-over carcass, Kestenbaum sees an agile global player. Where some see old facilities and a potentially fractious workforce, Kestenbaum talks up unused capacity, strategic locations on the Great Lakes and fixable labour relations.Investors seem\u00a0willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, for now. Stelco\u2019s\u00a0stock is up\u00a0almost 13 per cent since the company\u2019s $17-a-share early-November IPO, giving it a market value of\u00a0about $1.7 billion (US$1.3 billion). Bank of Montreal analyst\u00a0David Gagliano\u00a0initiated coverage with an outperform rating and a price target of $23, saying, \u201cStelco represents a compelling investment vehicle within the North American steel sector.\u201dPurchased\u00a0through Kestenbaum\u2019s Miami-based private equity firm\u00a0Bedrock Industries\u00a0Group LLC in June, Stelco has major advantages over some of its predecessors and competitors. After $4.4 billion of debt and pension obligations were eliminated through a restructuring that ended this year, Stelco has\u00a0a clean balance sheet, along with $230 million of fresh cash raised in the IPO. The company says in its prospectus its total costs are \u201camong the lowest in North America\u201d and it expects its margins to expand as it uses more of its assets and regains lost volume.What\u2019s more, Kestenbaum has a track record of finding and turning around struggling metal companies at Miami-based Globe Specialty Metals Inc., which he bought for US$1 million in 2006. After 11 acquisitions and a\u00a0merger with Grupo FerroAtlantica, London-based\u00a0Ferroglobe Plc\u00a0is now worth about US$2.7 billion. Kestenbaum believes he can achieve similar returns at Stelco.\u201cTwo or three more acquisitions down the road and we\u2019ll turn around and we\u2019ll be $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion, why not?,\u201d Kestenbaum says in an interview at Stelco\u2019s Lake Erie Works in Nanticoke, Ontario.The company declined to say how much Bedrock invested in the Stelco acquisition.Joe Ragan, who worked as\u00a0Kestenbaum\u2019s chief financial officer at Globe Specialty Metals, says the man has \u201cthe magic.\u201dTwo or three more acquisitions down the road and we (will) turn around and we (will) be $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion, why not?\u201cHe always gets an extraordinary deal for the assets he buys,\u201d Ragan, now Ferroglobe\u2019s CFO, says of his former boss. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very sharp acuity on how to structure a deal to get a really good value.\u201dThe origins of Kestenbaum\u2019s grand gamble on the\u00a0Great Lakes trace back to an unsavoury dispute over 40 cents.While he was still at Globe Specialty Metals,\u00a0that company acquired a ferro-silicon facility in\u00a0Bridgeport, Alabama\u00a0from a New York-based hedge fund. When Kestenbaum looked into the situation, he was appalled at the way the workers had been treated.\u201cAll around this facility I saw probably the poorest neighborhood I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. These are US$5,000 homes and kids walking around without shoes,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd I remember sitting with this hedge fund manager at the plant and he was bragging to me how he knocked 40 cents an hour off the workers, US$3.20 a day, for a savings of US$100,000 a year.\u201dWhen the deal closed, the first thing Kestenbaum did was to give workers back the 40 cents an hour.That move came to the attention of\u00a0Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union, who asked to meet him. \u201cI thought that was pretty unique,\u201d Gerard said by phone from Pittsburgh.A few years later, Gerard suggested Kestenbaum take a look at a Canadian steelmaker languishing in bankruptcy protection. Kestenbaum\u2019s interest was piqued. \u201cThis is part of the payback for the lousy US$100,000 I gave to those workers in Alabama,\u201d he says.A productive labour relationship would be a sea change for Stelco. When it was a\u00a0subsidiary\u00a0of\u00a0Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, the company\u00a0locked out workers three separate times, was\u00a0sued by the Canadian government\u00a0for breaking employment promises after the financial crisis and finally shut the Hamilton blast furnace in 2013.\u201cHamilton was an Academy Award performance on both sides of how you do bad labour relations,\u201d said Peter Warrian, a senior fellow at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs who is a\u00a0former USW research director. \u201cThey both heavily invested in rewarding the wrong behaviour.\u201dThe Kestenbaum era looks like it\u2019s off to a better start. He has already secured a five-year agreement with the remaining 1,650 hourly workers, and he\u2019s made symbolic changes, such as allowing the union to fly its flag at the plants and inviting workers to a bell-ringing ceremony at the Toronto Stock Exchange.Forces beyond Kestenbaum\u2019s control have also been\u00a0moving in Stelco\u2019s favour. Steel prices\u00a0have been rising as China, the world\u2019s biggest producer, takes steps to reduce output to cut pollution and close illegal and inefficient plants, while prices for key inputs\u00a0iron ore\u00a0and metallurgical coal have declined in the past year.The near-term picture, though, looks less rosy. The unpredictability of the North American Free Trade Agreement talks is a risk for Stelco and its ability to win U.S. contracts. If Stelco gets through that unscathed, the Trump administration may still follow through on\u00a0threats to slap\u00a0tariffs on steel imports, or otherwise ramp up\u00a0Buy American\u00a0provisions limiting the use of foreign steel.The company is hinging a good part of its growth on winning contracts in the auto industry, which\u00a0used to be an important part of its business before U.S. Steel migrated many of those contracts to its U.S. plants. This is where a collapse of NAFTA, which favours North American automakers, could really pose a \u201cunique threat\u201d to Stelco, Warrian said.U.S. Steel doesn\u2019t comment on its commercial relationships or labour relations of other companies, spokeswoman Meghan Cox said in an email.Stelco will have to offer lower prices to compete with its former parent company and other major players, and that won\u2019t be easy without scale, said James May, managing director of Toronto-based price forecaster Steel-Insight. \u201cThey\u2019re screwed in a downturn,\u201d when smaller companies will have to discount their price in order to generate sales, May said.Kestenbaum says his new company is ready for the worst. On the threat of reduced access to the U.S., he points out he\u2019s also looking to boost sales to Mexico and Europe, taking advantage of the company\u2019s location on the Great Lakes. And he says he\u2019ll be more careful than previous owners in preserving a clean balance sheet.\u201cYou don\u2019t take on debt that can only be repaid in optimal market conditions,\u201d he says.Back on the Lake Erie dock, the CEO will soon begin ramping up exports from a port that was primarily built for imports, with a goal of eventually exporting 500,000 to 1 million tons of steel a year to customers around the world.\u201cWe look at ourselves as a global player,\u201d Kestenbaum\u00a0says.\u2013With assistance from Joe Deaux.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn and Theophilos Argitis", "title": "The loonie is on fire as Canada\u2019s jobless rate falls to lowest in decade", "description": "Canada's economy gained 79,500 jobs last month, a surprise jump in hiring that defies a slowdown in the rest of the economy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-jobless-rate-falls-to-lowest-in-a-decade-on-hiring-surge", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/loonieflight_np.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 1, 2017 1:02 PM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy is showing unexpected resiliency in the second half of the year despite slumping exports, driven by the strongest job market since the 2008-2009 recession.The jobless rate plunged to 5.9 per cent in November as employers added another 79,500 workers during the month, bringing gains over the past 12 months to nearly 400,000, Statistics Canada said Friday from Ottawa.The Canadian dollar soared on the data, rising more than a cent to 78.67 US cents.The increased employment is helping to fuel household spending, a separate report showed.

Convoluted laws force these firms to stay tiny but you can see them everywhere you go, repairing cars or frying chips, manufacturing components for powerful machines on the factory floors of big corporations or engaged in intricate embroidery for French fashion houses.Starting January, state-run Small Industries Development Bank of India and Crisil Ltd. \u2014 the local arm of S&P Global Inc., parent of Standard & Poor\u2019s \u2014 will publish a quarterly sentiment indicator to track capacity utilization, order books and margins at micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.There is a dearth of real-time data at the micro level... . We expect the index to provide a trend which will allow policy makers to take timely, even proactive, steps, including based on early warningsThe new index will cover more than 1,000 MSMEs, drawn through sources including\u00a0SIDBI and Crisil\u2019s client base. Sectors with strong MSME presence, such as engineering and textiles, will have bigger representation in the sample and so will states that are home to a larger number of these firms.\u201cThere is a dearth of real-time data at the micro level, making it difficult to assess the true impact of major economic policy initiatives,\u201d said R. Vasudevan, business head at Crisil SME Ratings. \u201cWe expect the index to provide a trend which will allow policy makers to take timely, even proactive, steps, including based on early warnings.\u201dThe need to track India\u2019s small companies is greater than ever, after Modi last year invalidated 86 per cent of currency in circulation and this July rolled out a new consumption tax. The moves disproportionately affect MSMEs as they transact mainly in cash and can\u2019t afford high compliance costs.Sanjeev Prasad, managing director at brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities, said he will watch for disruptions to business models of listed companies because of the changes, as well as any shifts in patterns within the informal sector as they\u2019re forced into more formal means of business.Analysts at Morgan Stanley, including Subramanian Iyer and Derrick Kam, say MSMEs will be one of the key beneficiaries from the changes. While their access to credit was inconvenient, expensive or unavailable, Modi\u2019s policies have forced them to embrace formal channels of finance, they said.To understand how behaviour may change in an increasingly digital India, the analysts surveyed 1,522 businesses with sales of less than 50 million rupees (US$770,000) across 28 large and small cities. \u201cSurvey conclusions overall increase our conviction in our thesis,\u201d they wrote in a Nov. 9 report.MSMEs are also important because they\u2019re often the only employers for millions of Indians fleeing a weakening farm sector. Failure to offer jobs to the swelling workforce risks triggering social strife in the world\u2019s second-most populous nation, observers including Raghuram Rajan, a professor at the University of Chicago and India\u2019s former central bank governor, have warned.So, while informality itself isn\u2019t a bad thing, the sector needs to be tracked to ensure workers are ultimately provided stable wages and other benefits offered by big companies, said Sudha Narayanan, associate professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research in Mumbai."}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Mikael Holter", "title": "Oil industry shows signs of life after Norway wealth fund shock", "description": "The latest spending plans from oil companies show how Norway's not about to quit petroleum", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-industry-shows-signs-of-life-after-norway-wealth-fund-shock", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/1123norway.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 23, 2017 11:29 AM EST", "content": "A week after Norway\u2019s US$1 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it wanted to get out of oil and gas investments, the latest spending plans from oil companies show how the country\u2019s not about to quit petroleum.Oil companies operating offshore Norway increased their investment forecast for next year and could add billions of kroner more over the next months as a wave of new projects is expected to be green-lighted, according to a quarterly survey from Statistics Norway. Investments are seen reaching 144 billion kroner (US$18 billion) next year, up from an August estimate of 142 billion kroner, it said in a statement on Thursday. Spending this year is seen at 151 billion kroner, down from 156 billion kroner in the previous survey.While the survey now indicates a decline into 2018, that could change as companies are expected to submit final investment decisions for eight projects before the end of February, the statistics office said. The biggest are Statoil ASA\u2019s Johan Castberg and Snorre Expansion, which alone represent investments of more than 70 billion kroner over several years. The second phase of the giant Johan Sverdrup field is also expected to go forward later in 2018.\u201cIf the schedules for these plans are realized, the accumulated investment costs in 2018 from these projects will increase the investments significantly in field development, compared to the present estimate,\u201d the agency said in the statement.The revision of the 2018 spending forecast \u2014 and the potential for more \u2014 is consistent with the government\u2019s view that a three-year slump following the crude-price collapse in 2014 will bottom out this year. It also illustrates how Norway intends to profit from its position as western Europe\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer regardless of whether its sovereign wealth fund is allowed to drop fossil-fuel equities.The proposal from the central bank, which runs the fund, resonated across the world last week as an acknowledgment from one of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers of the uncertainty that weighs on that industry\u2019s future. The bank said the plan was meant as a measure to reduce risk exposure, and didn\u2019t imply any particular view of future oil prices. The heads of both Norway\u2019s oil-industry lobby and its biggest energy union said last week it was entirely possible for the country to both cut the fund\u2019s exposure to oil and bet on its own offshore industry\u2019s future.\u00a0Investments offshore Norway, western Europe\u2019s biggest producer of oil and gas, have dropped continuously from 220 billion kroner in 2014, the peak of a decade-long boom. The backlash has been rougher on oil-dependent Norway than the 2008-2009 financial crisis, with about 50,000 jobs lost in the offshore industry and unemployment reaching 20-year highs. The central bank has cut rates to record lows, while the government made its first ever withdrawals from its huge sovereign wealth fund to compensate for lower oil income and to stimulate the economy.The central bank has now signaled that it may raise interest rates again at the end of next year as the economy recovers. The government said in October when it presented its budget for next year that it expects oil investments to rise to 157 billion kroner in 2018 from 150 billion kroner in 2017.The revision of the 2018 spending forecast \u201cimplies some upside\u201d to Norges Bank\u2019s projections, Svenska Handelsbanken AB said in a note to clients on Thursday. Still, as the oil industry\u2019s share of the economy has shrunk over the past years, that\u2019s unlikely to change the central bank\u2019s outlook for gross domestic product growth enough to have a \u201cmaterial impact\u201d on the interest-rate path, it said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Bay Street gain vs Wall Street pain: Toronto adds finance jobs while New York loses", "description": "Toronto's employment rose 25 per cent, adding 54,580 positions between 2006 and 2016", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/bay-street-gain-vs-wall-street-pain-toronto-adds-finance-jobs-while-new-york-loses", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/1123bay.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 23, 2017 10:55 AM EST", "content": "It\u2019s a tale of Toronto\u2019s gain versus New York\u2019s pain.Employment in Toronto\u2019s financial-services sector has surged over 10 years while major U.S. banking centres saw jobs disappear due to the lingering impact of the financial crisis, according to a Conference Board of Canada report.

Removing those barriers could boost OECD growth by between six and 20 per cent, they estimated.\u201cIt\u2019s about the sheer scope for growth \u2014 six per cent is what we arrived at for advanced economies, for emerging market countries it\u2019s even higher. So why aren\u2019t we going for it?,\u201d Fordham said. The proposals in the report would contribute \u201csignificantly more than the monetary-fiscal policies that are under discussion.\u201dFemale participation rates are often significantly below those of men, even in advanced economies. The share of women working or actively looking for work in OECD countries averaged 64 per cent last year, compared with a male participation rate of 80 per cent.That gap is particularly large in Italy and Japan. The gulf is more than 10 percentage points in the U.S. and the U.K., and it\u2019s only slightly lower in France and Germany.Policies reducing gender inequality are vital given relatively sluggish growth prospects in advanced economies and the more limited potential of other reforms, the report said.The European Commission estimates that if all of its possible structural reforms \u2014 including those on tax, unemployment benefits, product markets, human capital and R&D investments \u2014 were implemented, they could lift EU growth by about 6 per cent over 10 years. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus could potentially boost U.S. GDP by 1 to 1.5 per cent over 2018-21.\u201cI\u2019d suggest that the Trump administration have a look at this report,\u201d Fordham said. \u201cMany of the ways to remove barriers to women are pretty easy to implement \u2014 and you can see that in the case where we compare the U.S. and Canada.\u201dFemale labour force participation in Canada has risen gradually since 1990, helped by tax reforms, family support and wage and income equalization, the report said. The public sector has made gender diversity an objective, and private firms and institutions have started to collect metrics to track and reduce wage discrepancies.But progress in the U.S. has stalled. There are few U.S. federal mandates that support equal pay between men and women, no laws that guarantee paid family leave and tax rules continue to penalize married couples.Both Canada and the U.S. nevertheless have a gender wage gap that exceeds the OECD average.\u201cConstraints on women\u2019s economic empowerment are rooted in unaddressed gender inequalities in society,\u201d the report said. \u201cLayers of disadvantage \u2014 including those related to poverty, ethnicity, disability, age, geography, and migratory status \u2014 remain powerful obstacles to equal rights and opportunities for hundreds of millions of women.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Archana Narayanan, Matthew Martin, Ruth David and Zainab Fattah", "title": "Saudi billionaires said to move funds to escape asset freeze", "description": "Saudi Arabia's elite are on the run after phase one of a crackdown targeting some of the kingdom's most prominent princes, billionaires and officials", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/saudi-billionaires-said-to-move-funds-to-escape-asset-freeze-2", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/salman.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 9, 2017 4:07 PM EST", "content": "Wealthy Saudis are moving assets out of the region\u00a0to avoid the risk of getting caught up in what authorities call a crackdown on corruption, according to six people with knowledge of the matter.Some Saudi billionaires and millionaires are selling investments in neighboring Gulf Cooperation Council countries and turning them into cash or liquid holdings overseas, the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. In Saudi Arabia, some are in talks with banks and asset managers to move money outside the country, the people said.Until the surprise arrests of dozens of people last weekend, Saudi Arabia\u2019s elite was the target of\u00a0Deutsche Bank AG, UBS Group AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and other global banks seeking to manage their wealth. They now find themselves on the run in the face of a campaign that has targeted some of the kingdom\u2019s most prominent princes, billionaires and officials.The central bank asked lenders in the kingdom to freeze the accounts of dozens of individuals who aren\u2019t under arrest, as well as the assets of those being detained, people familiar with the matter said. The Saudi attorney general said in a statement released Monday that the weekend arrests were only \u201cphase one\u201d of the crackdown.In addition, the United Arab Emirates central bank asked financial institutions to provide information on the accounts of 19 Saudi citizens, people familiar with the matter said Thursday. The regulator asked to be informed of any accounts, deposits, investments, financial instruments, credit facilities, safe deposit boxes or financial transfers linked to the people, according to a circular seen by Bloomberg.While efforts to curb corruption are welcome, the \u201cspeed and breadth of the crackdown has stirred fear among investors,\u201d said Jason Tuvey, London-based Middle East economist at Capital Economics.\u201cThere\u2019s the added concern here that the political uncertainty leads to a period of capital outflows that forces SAMA to burn through its foreign-exchange reserves at a faster pace,\u201d he said, referring to the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, as the central bank is known.The arrests have prompted investors from within the region to sell, pushing benchmark stock indexes lower. The selloff across the GCC has cost stocks US$17.6 billion as of Wednesday, dragging the collective market capitalization for bourses in the region to US$900 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gulf investors sold a net US$92.5 million of Dubai stocks on Tuesday, the most since February. The benchmark Tadawul All Share Index was down 0.3 per cent at 2:18 p.m. in Riyadh.The crackdown started after King Salman formed an anti-corruption commission on Saturday, headed by his son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Among those detained was Prince Miteb Bin Abdullah. He was also removed from his post as head of the powerful National Guard, a move that has reinforced speculation the king was preparing to hand over power to his son. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the world\u2019s 61st-richest person, also was arrested.The purge is affecting some of Saudi Arabia\u2019s richest families. For decades, they benefited from a close relationship with the country\u2019s rulers, which helped them win major contracts and partner with international companies seeking a foothold in the Arab world\u2019s biggest economy.It also comes at a time when the economy is struggling to cope with the slump in oil prices. Unemployment among Saudis is rising and non-oil gross domestic product is barely expanding. The government has raised tens of billions of dollars from international bond markets and has drawn down on central bank reserves to finance a budget deficit that reached about 15 per cent of gross domestic product in 2015.The shift in assets is \u201cunsurprising given a true corruption cleanup would go much further than the events of the weekend,\u201d said\u00a0Emad Mostaque, London-based co-chief investment officer of emerging-markets hedge fund Capricorn Fund Managers Ltd. The central bank \u201chas strong systems in place to track flows and excellent relationships with major banks globally so any assets moved offshore could be frozen and returned if from corruption.\u201dSome of the country\u2019s wealthy are worried that shifting assets outside Saudi Arabia may draw suspicion and are instead focusing on their GCC holdings, two people with knowledge of the matter said.Saudi Arabia is also in the midst of implementing a transformation aimed at weaning the economy off oil. The government plans to create the world\u2019s largest sovereign fund and sell hundreds of state assets, including Saudi Arabian Oil Co., as well as stakes in the stock exchange, soccer teams and flour mills.Concerns of a renewed confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran is also prompting investors to dump stocks in the region. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned on Saturday, announcing his decision from Saudi Arabia and blaming Iran and the Hezbollah militants it backs for the his decision.Kuwait\u2019s SE Price Index has lost 4.4 per cent, while Dubai\u2019s DFM General Index fell 4.8 per cent.

The steelmaker raised $200 million in its initial public offering after pricing its shares at $17 apiece, the midpoint of its disclosed range.The share gain probably stems from the fact that there are no other publicly traded Canadian steel companies, said James May, managing director of Toronto-based price forecaster Steel-Insight.\u201cI think it\u2019s just a limited availability of steel names out there in the Canadian market,\u201d May said Friday in a phone interview. \u201cThere isn\u2019t really a peer.\u201dThe trading debut, the first IPO globally for a steelmaker since 2010, marks a rebirth for Hamilton, Ontario-based Stelco, which emerged from creditor protection in June after it was purchased by private equity firm Bedrock Industries. Stelco was previously owned by Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel Corp., which acquired the Canadian company in 2007 after it emerged from its first stint in bankruptcy protection.The timing of the U.S. Steel deal was unfortunate, made shortly before the global financial crisis sent steel prices plunging. As part of its agreement with the Canadian government to purchase the assets, the U.S. company vowed to maintain certain levels of employment and production at the renamed U.S. Steel Canada Inc. \u2014 commitments that were broken once the financial crisis hit.Already tense labour relations deteriorated further under U.S. Steel, with three separate lockouts at the Canadian operations in Hamilton and Nanticoke, Ontario. The company permanently shut down its blast furnace in Hamilton in 2013.In 2014, the former Stelco was granted protection from its creditors once again, citing an aggregate operating loss of US$2.4 billion since December 2009 and $1 billion in pension liabilities.\u201cOperational changes, cost reduction initiatives and streamlining of operations cannot on their own make it competitive in the current environment,\u201d Michael McQuade, president and general manager of U.S. Steel Canada, said at the time.Through the second restructuring process, the company was able to eliminate $3 billion of debt and $1.4 billion of pension and benefit obligations. Stelco also was able to secure a five-year agreement with the United Steelworkers union, which represents its 1,650 hourly workers.Under Bedrock Industries\u2019 Alan Kestenbaum, who is Stelco\u2019s new chief executive officer, the company plans to focus on making high-strength steel for the automotive and construction industries.Stelco will have to compete with its former parent company, which migrated many of Stelco\u2019s auto contracts to its U.S. plants. The auto industry accounted for 37 per cent of Stelco\u2019s consolidated shipments in 2006 and only 3 per cent in 2016, according to the company\u2019s prospectus.Stelco\u2019s trading debut comes as uncertainty looms over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is being renegotiated. The company\u2019s prospects also may be affected by a U.S. investigation into whether steel imports threaten national security. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last month the Trump administration will defer a decision on steel tariffs as it focuses on tax reforms.Stelco is selling shares from treasury and will use the proceeds to fund capital expenditures, restart some of its operations, prepay pension and retirement obligations and for other general corporate purposes, according to a regulatory filing.The share sale was led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of Montreal. The banks on the deal have the option to purchase additional shares that could increase the total proceeds to $230 million, the filing shows.Stelco, which will use the stock ticker STLC on the Toronto Stock Exchange, is trading on a so-called \u201cwhen-issued\u201d basis until the sale closes Nov. 10.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Why is Canada\u2019s job market so hot when the economy is leaving us cold?", "description": "Canada is a jobs machine lately, with the longest streak of gains in more than 10 years and biggest full-time gains ever", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/largest-ever-gain-in-full-time-is-making-canada-a-jobs-machine", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/jobs.jpeg", "publishedAt": "November 3, 2017 2:04 PM EDT", "content": "Canada produced another stellar month of job gains in October, with signs of tightening that include stronger wage increases and a surge in full-time employment.\u2022 Employment increased by 35,300 (est. 15,000) \u2022 Full-time jobs were up 88,700 versus a 53,400 decline in part-time jobs \u2022 Average hourly pay gains hit 2.4 per cent, the fastest since April 2016The data reveal the expected slowing of Canada\u2019s labour market has yet to materialize, with the biggest increase in full-time employment over the past two months on record \u2014 potentially casting doubt on the Bank of Canada\u2019s contention there remains enough employment slack to keep producing non-inflationary growth.\u201cGrowth indicators for Canada have been decelerating, but you wouldn\u2019t know it looking at the labour market, where employers are still beefing up their workforce,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a note to investors.The country has now produced job gains for 11 consecutive months \u2014 the longest streak in more than a decade.

The idea was that low rates would encourage spending by businesses and consumers.Although experts disagree about how effective the stimulus was in stoking broad-based economic growth, two conclusions are in little dispute: The deluge of cash staved off a global financial collapse, and it helped propel stocks and bonds to record levels. Now policy makers believe their economies are strong enough to thrive with less stimulus.The U.S. Federal Reserve made the first move in October when it started allowing a portion of bonds on its US$4.5 trillion balance sheet to mature without replacing them. The European Central Bank is still buying government and corporate bonds, though it recently delineated a plan for tapering off those purchases starting in January. China\u2019s policy makers are expected to tamp down on credit growth next year, as President Xi Jinping focuses on defusing financial risks. The Bank of Japan will probably keep printing money, but that won\u2019t be enough to offset a global decline in central bank stimulus, which economists see starting sometime in mid-to-late 2018.\u201cIt will worry a lot of investors, because no one\u2019s really prepared for it,\u201d says Nader Naeimi, a fund manager at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney who\u2019s boosted his cash allocation to 30 per cent in anticipation of pain in bonds and stocks. \u201cIt will hurt \u2014 you want it to hurt, otherwise financial conditions will be too loose.\u201dIn surveys, global investors identify a shift to monetary tightening as the single most likely cause of the next recession. History shows such transitions are fraught with risk. When the Fed started boosting rates in 1994, it set off the worst corporate bond slide in two decades. It also helped trigger a sudden devaluation of the Mexican peso and the ensuing Tequila Crisis.Adding to the uncertainty: Three of the world\u2019s four most important central bank chiefs are nearing the end of their terms and may be replaced. The same factors are likely to propel their successors toward reducing monetary stimulus. Most economies are posting solid growth. Job markets have returned to what policy makers deem full employment. American household incomes are at a record high. Crisis-wracked European countries such as Spain have recouped economic losses. China has shaken off fears of a debt crisis. Even Japan has pulled out of a long cycle of mini-recessions.True, central bankers haven\u2019t been hitting their inflation targets; the failure of prices to rise is one sign that growth is still subpar. But policy makers are setting that concern aside as they increasingly focus on curbing the financial excesses that could set the stage for another crash.European Central Bank: \u2018Whatever it takes\u2019European Central Bank President Mario Draghi vowed five years ago he\u2019d do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. So far it\u2019s taken more than 2 trillion euros (US$2.3 trillion). That\u2019s the amount by which he\u2019s expanded the balance sheet. On Oct. 26 the ECB announced that its bond buying will continue through September 2018, albeit at 30 billion euros a month starting in January, or half the current pace. The institution also stressed that it will reinvest proceeds from maturing debt for an extended period.European policy makers have been among the most forceful in their campaign to push down borrowing costs. They championed negative interest rates, which leave investors who choose to stash their money in government bonds with less than they started with. And unlike the Fed, which has confined its purchases to government and mortgage bonds, the ECB has also been buying corporate debt. In doing so, it\u2019s extended a lifeline to European businesses that might have otherwise been forced to retrench.That aggressiveness has never sat well with German officials, who\u2019ve traditionally favored tighter controls to keep inflation down. Draghi\u2019s term runs through October 2019. Any German candidate could have an inside track for the job, given that Europe\u2019s largest economy has never had one of its own at the helm of the region\u2019s central bank.Federal Reserve: It\u2019s Powell\u2019s Fed now The Fed pumped about US$3.6 trillion into the U.S. economy from 2008 to 2014. The link between monetary stimulus and markets was remarkably tight: More than half the gains in the S&P 500 from 2008 until the Fed started raising interest rates at the end of 2015 came on days the Fed announced policy decisions. That\u2019s why, despite Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s assurances that reducing the balance sheet will be a non-event \u2014 \u201clike watching paint dry,\u201d she said \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to rule out a sharp reaction in the markets.The Fed stopped replacing some maturing bonds in October and has effectively put the process of shrinking its balance sheet on autopilot, with the rundown in assets accelerating in stages; US$50 billion a month will be taken out of the nation\u2019s bond markets by October of next year.Yellen\u2019s four-year term as chair is up in February, and she\u2019s set to be replaced by Jerome Powell, who was nominated as her successor by President Donald Trump Thursday. Powell, a former private-equity executive who\u2019s been a Fed governor since 2012, has voted in lockstep with Yellen in gradually removing stimulus and is expected to maintain continuity in monetary policy. A Republican appointed by President Barack Obama, he\u2019s earned a reputation as non-ideological and pragmatic. He sympathizes with White House calls to ease financial regulations.Adding to the uncertainty: Three of the world's four most important central bank chiefs are nearing the end of their terms and may be replacedKuroda\u2019s five-year term ends in April. When he was nominated in 2013, his three-decade-plus tenure at the staid Finance Ministry and his optimistic, almost avuncular personality helped ensure his confirmation. Since then, he\u2019s shaken up an institution that had long been criticized for doing too little to lift Japan out of stagnation.Now it\u2019s fiscal conservatives who are peeved: They say Kuroda\u2019s easy money policies have allowed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s government to avoid wrestling down the largest public debt load in the world.Their calls for a more centrist policy are likely to go unheeded in the wake of Oct. 22 legislative elections that solidified the ruling party\u2019s hold on power. Market watchers believe that Abe, who\u2019s said he has \u201ccomplete trust\u201d in Kuroda\u2019s abilities, will reward him with an unprecedented second full term.People\u2019s Bank of China China\u2019s central bank is more opaque than its peers. Still, there\u2019s a clear consensus among China watchers that officials in 2018 are likely to intensify efforts to whittle down a record buildup of debt in the financial system since the global crisis.At the October gathering of the Communist Party leadership, President Xi Jinping reiterated that defusing financial risks is one of his top priorities. A sign of that commitment was the promotion of Liu He to the 25-member Politburo. A longtime Xi adviser on economic matters, he\u2019s been an advocate of debt reduction.Despite layers of capital controls, the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s actions can still roil markets around the globe. A surprise move in August 2015 to devalue the Chinese currency proved so unsettling that the Fed shelved a widely anticipated rate hike the following month.Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has held the job for almost 15 years. The question of who will replace him became more urgent after he hinted at the recent party congress that he\u2019s ready to retire. Even though the central bank takes instructions directly from the government, the pick for the top job still matters. Zhou\u2019s successor will have to craft a monetary policy that balances concern about the nation\u2019s debt load with support for an economy that\u2019s shifted into a slower growth track.Bloomberg News"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jean Tirole", "title": "The future of work might not be so terribly bleak: Nobel winner", "description": "Both technology-based and knowledge-based fields will have their challenges, but there is one certain solution", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/executive/careers/the-future-of-work-might-not-be-so-terribly-bleak-jean-tirole", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/aassgettyimages-519109949.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 3, 2017 7:42 AM EDT", "content": "What\u2019s the future of work? Will gigs replace salaried employment, and will robots eventually leave humans with nothing to do? I see reason for skepticism, but also for concern.Technology, of course, is already making independent work a lot easier. It puts workers into contact with customers and helps them run a back office. More important, it allows individuals to build and promote their reputations at low cost. Customers used to rely on a taxi company\u2019s reputation, or choose a washing machine by the manufacturer\u2019s brand. Now, each worker has a brand: On Uber, customers can reject drivers based on their personal ratings. A firm\u2019s collective reputation, with the concomitant control of its employees\u2019 behaviour, is becoming gradually less important.That said, technology can also favour standard salaried employment. Economists George Baker and Thomas Hubbard, for example, have noted how onboard computers could change U.S. trucking. By monitoring behaviour, they would solve a moral hazard problem: Drivers have little incentive to be as careful with company trucks as they would with their own. As a result, more drivers could become employees of companies that buy and maintain fleets, rather than going it alone. They wouldn\u2019t have to invest in their own vehicles, which makes them vulnerable to recessions by putting their savings in the same sector as their labour; and they wouldn\u2019t be out of pocket and out of work when their trucks broke down.More generally, conventional jobs have a lot of advantages. First, a single worker or group of workers might lack the capital needed to set up a business, or prefer to avoid the stress and risk of running one (consider doctors or dentists who choose to be employees of a medical clinic). Second, business owners might not want their employees to have other bosses \u2014 particularly if the work involves confidential information or team projects that require undivided time and attention. Third, reputations based on ratings might not be reliable: The economist Diane Coyle has shown that the quality of individual consultants can be hard to monitor, at least immediately, whereas a traditional consultancy may be more efficient at \u201cguaranteeing\u201d quality.In short, I believe that salaried employment will not disappear, although it might become less prevalent over time.But what about artificial intelligence? Not a day passes without the media fretting about the mass unemployment that will ensue as robots take over for humans. Many jobs involving routine (and thus codifiable) tasks have been eliminated: banking transactions are digitized, cheques are processed by optical readers, call centres use software to shorten the length of conversations between customer and employee, or even replace humans with bots.These changes have global repercussions. They threaten the low-salary, outsourced jobs that emerging and underdeveloped countries have counted on to escape poverty. In developed countries, as the economist David Autor and his coauthors have demonstrated, they tend to benefit those employees whose skills complement the new digital tools. This hollows out the distribution of jobs into either high-paying skilled positions or low-paying basic service positions. In the U.S., the difference in salary between those who hold university degrees and those who went to work right after high school has grown enormously in the past 30 years.It\u2019s still not clear, however, which human tasks computers will be able to replace, and what the effects will be. Deductive problems, in which the particular is deduced from the general rule in a logical way, are the easiest. An ATM verifies a card number, the PIN code and the account balance before issuing money and debiting the account. Nonetheless, total employment in banking rose even as the ATM network spread, because demand grew and teller jobs were replaced by new tasks.Computers have also made great advances in induction, which starts with specific facts and works toward a general law. For example, algorithms are capable of predicting the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions about patents just as well as any legal experts. Similar techniques are enabling automated facial recognition, voice recognition, medical diagnosis and other tasks that previously only humans could perform.The people best equipped to succeed in the new world will be those who have acquired abstract knowledge that helps them adapt to their environmentThe most difficult tasks for computers involve unforeseen problems that do not match any programmed routine. Rare events cannot be analyzed inductively to generate an empirical law. Frank Levy and Richard Murnane offer the example of a driverless car that sees a little ball pass in front of it. This ball poses no danger to the car, which therefore has no reason to slam on the brakes. A human being, on the other hand, will probably foresee that the ball may be followed by a young child, and will therefore have a different reaction. The driverless car will not have enough experience to react appropriately. Although machine learning might be able to solve this problem, it illustrates the obstacles that computers still encounter.So humans and computers face different challenges. Computers are much faster and more reliable when processing logical and predictable tasks. Thanks to machine learning, they can increasingly cope with unforeseen situations, provided they have enough data to recognize the structure of the problem. On the other hand, the human brain is more flexible: A five-year-old child can handle some problems better than any computer. So the people best equipped to succeed in the new world will be those who have acquired abstract knowledge that helps them adapt to their environment, while those with only simple knowledge preparing them for routine tasks are most in danger of being replaced.This is why education is crucial. If we don\u2019t have a system that gives everyone a chance to gain the necessary skills, differences in education and family background will lead to even greater inequality.Jean Tirole, winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in economics, is chairman of the Toulouse School of Economics and of the Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse, France.

Inside, a full-page spread detailed the aspirations of the kids vying for homecoming king and queen.Yet it\u2019s here, in an unremarkable warehouse in the foothills of the Ruby Mountains, that Barrick Gold Corp. has created an in-house coding hub to design software for its nearby Cortez operation \u2014 one step in its plan to use technology to revolutionize the business. From underground WiFi to sensors that track the output of every miner, it\u2019s all part of what Cisco Systems Inc. Executive Chairman\u00a0John Chambers calls an \u201caudacious goal\u201d by his Barrick counterpart John Thornton to drag gold mining into the 21st century.\u201cThe challenge is to move from thinking of it as a series of tasks to a sort of self-perpetuating machine which becomes the culture,\u201d Thornton said during a recent stop in Elko, about 675 kilometres from the bright lights of Las Vegas. \u201cYou move \u2014 to make it slightly dramatic \u2014 from being a mining company, to being a digital company that happens to be in mining.\u201dIt\u2019s been 13 months since Thornton, 63, unveiled his vision to team up with Cisco and transform Barrick\u2019s Nevada operations into a high-tech blueprint for the rest of the company.\u00a0While Chief Operating Officer Richard Williams is \u201cexceptionally pleased\u201d with progress, it\u2019s been slower than expected, he told analysts on a conference call Thursday. Digital remains critical to Barrick\u2019s goal of reducing all-in mining costs to US$700 an ounce from an expected US$740 to US$770 an ounce this year, he said.So far, the miner has created C0dem1ne, its Elko software hub; added autonomous mining equipment; and built a nerve center called the Analytics and Unified Operations Center. The latter will become Barrick\u2019s \u201cunblinking eye,\u201d crunching a \u201cdata lake\u201d of information fed by tens of thousands of sensors and spitting out analysis to employees.This year\u2019s digital budget of US$50 million is a drop in the bucket for a company with a market value of about US$17 billion. But under the watch of Williams, a former SAS commanding officer, Barrick has approached every spend with military precision.\u201cWe have examined, and examined, and examined the value of our digital investment in ways that is out of all proportion to its number,\u201d Williams said during a 90-minute drive from Elko to Cortez. \u201cWhy? Because we want to be absolutely sure, at every level of the organization, that this makes sense.\u201dInvestors have learned the hard way what happens when miners overspend on poorly conceived makeovers. Since 2010, Paulson & Co. estimates the gold industry has written off US$85 billion, much of it for ill-advised mergers during the heady days when gold fetched US$1,700 an ounce. Barrick has taken its own lumps, including over the debt-swelling 2011 purchase of Equinox Minerals Ltd. at the height of the commodity super cycle. The stock is still down more than 60 per cent from its 2010 peak.When Thornton first announced he would digitize operations to help make Barrick the most efficient mining company in the world, the response was muted. With the entire industry focused on wringing more out of existing operations, including better technology, the biggest question from analysts was: What is Barrick doing differently?Just this month, Rio Tinto Group sent a driver-less iron-ore train 100 kilometres across Western Australia for the first time. Newmont Mining Corp., Barrick\u2019s chief rival and neighbor in Nevada, has embraced sensors, autonomous equipment and virtual reality, and recently ran a \u201cdigital assessment\u201d on one of its Nevada mines to pinpoint more opportunities.\u201cWe use technology in all different places, but it\u2019s more a fit for purpose approach,\u201d Newmont Chief Executive Officer Gary Goldberg said at a mining conference last month in Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s still incremental; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a step change.\u201dWilliams thinks it can be. Barrick\u2019s goal \u2014 which he says will be largely realized in the next two years \u2014 is to integrate hundreds of incremental improvements into a larger system in which the sum becomes greater than the parts.\u201cDigital is a step change. It\u2019s a multiplier,\u201d he maintains, drawing on his experience with the U.K. military in Iraq where \u201celectronic penetration\u201d allowed commanders to view the entire battle space for the first time.Already, unit costs have fallen from US$190 per ton of rock to US$140 at Cortez\u2019s underground operations, he says, and full integration will result in \u201csignificant\u201d dollar-per-ton margin improvements.Three of C0dem1ne\u2019s bespoke apps have been put into use at Cortez, including an interval control system common on factory floors that allows miners to adjust mine plans mid-shift. Another monitors the health of Cortez\u2019s fleet of 350-ton trucks. Because it owns the data, Barrick can upgrade this software as often as needed. In-house technology also liberates the company from costly service contracts and allows it to track operations at a more granular level.That raises the question of how tech suppliers will respond to Barrick moving into their territory. In the case of its so-called short interval control, the company heard pitches from 14 outside vendors before deciding to design its own software. Barrick opted to turn off Caterpillar Inc.\u2019s predictive maintenance software on its trucks once it was clear, employees say, their own app performed better.\u201cClearly there are implications,\u201d said Denise Johnson, Caterpillar\u2019s group president of resource industries. \u201cNot every mining company is going to want a full CAT solution.\u201d\u00a0That said, she thinks miner interest in technology will ultimately be good for Caterpillar\u2019s business as long as it\u2019s prepared to offer different combinations of equipment and software that interact with outside systems.\u00a0\u201cYou have to be able to play in multiple ways and each customer is going to have to make a decision for themselves on how they want the pieces to come together,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf we make ourselves completely closed we won\u2019t even sell the equipment, let alone the digital solution or technology that is out there.\u201dAs Barrick\u2019s software efforts ramp up, attracting coding and developing talent to Elko may be another challenge. The company is hedging its bets, with a second coding facility at its Henderson office near Las Vegas. Further out, it hopes to create a more technologically skilled pool of local employees through an initiative with Cisco to create relevant courses at Elko\u2019s Great Basin College.Barrick also has moved to reassure its 3,000-strong Nevada workforce, and local officials, that digitization won\u2019t mean significant job losses.\u201cI\u2019ve been told it\u2019s a net net on jobs,\u201d Elko County Commissioner Cliff Eklund says over coffee and dessert at the Gold Dust West Casino. Eklund is a veteran of the mining industry, as his family\u2019s drilling company held contracts with Barrick and Newmont for 50 years. During that time, technological improvements often proved neutral for employment, he says. Fewer drivers were required when haul trucks got bigger, but more jobs were created by processing increasingly complex ore.Thornton\u2019s hope is that digitization will give Barrick an edge developing other complex deposits around the world. Within the next three years he expects most of the heavy lifting will be done in terms of digitizing Barrick\u2019s other mines. He and Williams are vague on future costs, saying only that cash flow will be made available for any projects that pay for themselves within 12 months and generate returns above 15 per cent.Meanwhile, the company is investing in other areas, including the use of artificial intelligence for exploration, and cyanide-free leaching, all of which have the potential to add revenue streams down the line. The latter could be key to speeding up development of Pascua-Lama and the El Indio belt along the Argentina-Chile border, a string of deposits that \u2014 like Nevada \u2014 the company hopes to mine for over a century.\u201cOur view of mining in the high Andes is underground, fully automated, remotely operated, environmentally neutral,\u201d Williams says.Ultimately, using technology to unlock those sorts of deposits will also make Barrick attractive beyond the gold space, according to Thornton. \u201cWe want to be a leading 21st-century company in any industry, in any jurisdiction. That\u2019s the goal. I don\u2019t intend to leave until that goal\u2019s accomplished.\u201dBloomberg News"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Torres and Jennifer Jacobs", "title": "Yellen finds unlikely advocate at White House: the president", "description": "Under the incumbent Federal Reserve chair's watch unemployment fell to 4.2 per cent in September, a 16-year low, and the economy's been expanding for nine years", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/yellen-finds-unlikely-advocate-at-white-house-the-president-1", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/top-fed-contenders.png", "publishedAt": "October 25, 2017 5:28 PM EDT", "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Janet Yellen\u2019s only advocate in the White House may be the one person who matters most: President Donald Trump.The incumbent Federal Reserve chair was impressive in an Oval Office interview with Trump on Thursday, several people familiar with the matter said.\u00a0She made clear to the president that she wants to keep her job, set no preconditions for appointment to a second term, and offered suggestions for the vice chairman position that were welcomed by the Trump team.Yellen, the first woman to lead the U.S. central bank, also made the case that the economy is doing well, and that Fed policies have been supportive of growth.

Trump also faces a diversity issue in his choice. Breaking the glass ceiling at the 100-year-old central bank by appointing Yellen was a significant step for women in finance and economics.In July, Yellen had an hour-long breakfast meeting at the central bank with the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who had reached out to the most powerful woman in economics after reading a speech she gave earlier in the year about the history of female participation in the American labor force.If she doesn\u2019t get the job that is \u201ca devastating message for women in economics, which is already struggling with gender imbalance,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of Macropolicy Perspectives and a former Fed staff member.However, Yellen lacks support from key Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee that would vote on her nomination, and among White House staff and Trump allies who want to see change atop the central bank.\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see at the Federal Reserve is new leadership down there,\u201d Senator Richard Shelby, the number two Republican on the Banking Committee, said Monday at the Capitol. \u201cI think we can do better.\u201dShelby said Powell is \u201cvery good\u201d and spoke favorably of Taylor\u2019s credentials as a monetary policy expert.But Trump\u2019s Fox Business Network interview demonstrated that he grasps the gravity of his choice \u2014 disruptive outsiders may not be good for a central bank that can\u2019t be successful without the confidence of investors and the public.\u201cIt\u2019s a hard decision,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf the right person is in there, a lot of good things can happen.\u201dNevertheless, many Republicans retain distrust of her association with the Fed\u2019s extraordinary policies during the financial crisis, and she carries a political stain as an Obama appointee.\u201cI have disagreed very strongly with the policies, like quantitative easing and the liberal policies that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Mike Crapo, the Idaho Republican who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, told Bloomberg News Oct. 19.\u201cI would like to see the Fed change direction,\u201d he said. \u201cGet back to more normal, traditional monetary policy.\u201dBloomberg"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Torres and Jennifer Jacobs", "title": "'I really like her a lot': Janet Yellen impressive in interview with President Trump", "description": "President Trump would be bucking conservatives in his own party if he opts to reappoint Janet Yellen as Fed chair", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/i-really-like-her-a-lot-janet-yellen-impressive-in-interview-with-president-trump", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/trump2.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 25, 2017 9:20 AM EDT", "content": "Janet Yellen\u2019s only advocate in the White House may be the one person who matters most: President Donald Trump.The incumbent Federal Reserve chair was impressive in an Oval Office interview with Trump on Thursday, several people familiar with the matter said.

Breaking the glass ceiling at the 100-year-old central bank by appointing Yellen was a significant step for women in finance and economics.In July, Yellen had an hour-long breakfast meeting at the central bank with the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who had reached out to the most powerful woman in economics after reading a speech she gave earlier in the year about the history of female participation in the American labor force.If she doesn\u2019t get the job that is \u201ca devastating message for women in economics which is already struggling with gender imbalance,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of Macropolicy Perspectives and a former Fed staff member.However, Yellen lacks support from key Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee that would vote on her nomination, and among White House staff and Trump allies who want to see change atop the central bank.New Leadership\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see at the Federal Reserve is new leadership down there,\u201d Senator Richard Shelby, the number two Republican on the Banking Committee, said Monday at the Capitol. \u201cI think we can do better.\u201dShelby said Powell is \u201cvery good\u201d and spoke favorably of Taylor\u2019s credentials as a monetary policy expert.But Trump\u2019s Fox Business Network interview demonstrated that he grasps the gravity of his choice \u2014 disruptive outsiders may not be good for a central bank that can\u2019t be successful without the confidence of investors and the public.\u201cIt\u2019s a hard decision,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf the right person is in there, a lot of good things can happen.\u201dNevertheless, many Republicans retain distrust of her association with the Fed\u2019s extraordinary policies during the financial crisis, and she carries a political stain as an Obama appointee.\u201cI have disagreed very strongly with the policies, like quantitative easing and the liberal policies that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Mike Crapo, the Idaho Republican who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, told Bloomberg News Oct. 19.\u201cI would like to see the Fed change direction,\u201d he said. \u201cGet back to more normal, traditional monetary policy.\u201dBloomberg"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katia Porzecanski", "title": "Ray Dalio makes a case for viewing the U.S. as two economies", "description": "Ray Dalio believes the gap between the two economies will only intensify over the next five to 10 years", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/ray-dalio-makes-a-case-for-viewing-the-u-s-as-two-economies", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/income.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 23, 2017 11:45 AM EDT", "content": "The Federal Reserve should more closely monitor the economic struggles of the bottom 60 per cent of the economy when making policy since \u201caverage statistics\u201d are camouflaging what\u2019s really occurring in the U.S., billionaire Ray Dalio wrote in a report Monday.Dalio noted wide disparities in factors including labor, retirement savings, health care, death rates and education between the top 40 per cent and bottom 60 per cent of the country. The founder of Bridgewater Associates said it would be a \u201cserious mistake\u201d for the Fed to just focus on a national average as it could lead the policy makers to see a brighter economic picture than the reality.\u201cBecause the economic, social, and political consequences of an economic downturn would likely be severe, if I were running Fed policy, I would want to take this into consideration and keep an eye on the economy of the bottom 60 per cent,\u201d Dalio said in his Daily Observations report. \u201cSimilarly, having this perspective will be very important for those who determine fiscal policies and for investors concerned with their wealth management.\u201dThe difference in the financial conditions for the two groups \u2014 due in part to whether they can take advantage of the market rally \u2014 is a major cause of slowing growth, he wrote. The gap between the two economies will only intensify over the next five to 10 years, as changes in demographics will challenge the government\u2019s ability to meet pension and health-care demands, while changes in technology will continue to impact employment, he said.The disparities he listed include: The top 40 per cent now has on average 10 times as much wealth as those in the bottom 60, up from six times as much in 1980. Just a third of the bottom 60 per cent saves any of its income, compared to about 70 per cent of the top 40. Premature deaths among those in the bottom 60 per cent are up 20 per cent since 2000, and the odds of a premature death within that group are twice as high as the top 40.With fewer children growing up to earn more than their parents, the bottom 60 per cent are more likely to think they\u2019re worse off than the previous generation. Total health-care spending, including insurance, by the bottom 60 per cent is about half of the top 40. Many are skipping care due to the high costs, with 12 per cent of the bottom 60 going uninsured.Fed officials have struggled to understand contradictory economic data and what that should mean for monetary policy.The Federal Open Market Committee hiked rates in March and June, primarily spurred by the expectation that robust job gains would eventually raise wages and inflation. Surprisingly low inflation in recent months, however, has caused several policy makers to waiver in their resolve to move again in December.Unemployment fell to 4.2 per cent in September, its lowest level in more than 16 years, while inflation has languished well below the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has called this a \u201cmystery,\u201d but has signaled her desire to continue raising rates gradually. Investors see the probability of a December hike at about 80 per cent, according to pricing in federal funds futures contracts.Dalio has said the Fed has given itself limited room to maneuver in the event of a downturn, and therefore must be careful not to trigger one as it moves towards tightening monetary policy.He has also said that the longer-term picture for the U.S. is worrying because of the abundant debt and non-debt obligations, like health care and social security, that are coming due, creating a squeeze.\u00a0\u201cThis squeeze will come gradually, not as a shock, and will hurt those who are now most in distress the hardest,\u201d he said in a post in May.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Steve Matthews", "title": "Trump's short list for Fed chair features these hawks and doves", "description": "Fed Chair Janet Yellen, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell and former Governor Kevin Warsh are among the possibilities", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trumps-short-list-for-fed-chair-features-these-hawks-and-doves", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/federal-reserve.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 5, 2017 1:39 PM EDT", "content": "Here\u2019s a look at the candidates President Donald Trump is considering over the next few weeks\u00a0to nominate as chairman of the Federal Reserve and where they stand on monetary policy.Trump has met with Fed Chair Janet Yellen, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell and\u00a0former Governor Kevin Warsh as he considers his choice to head the U.S. central bank, three people familiar with the discussions said last week.\u00a0Stanford University economist John Taylor is also on the list of recommendations put together by Trump\u2019s advisers. There\u2019s no clear front-runner and outlier candidates haven\u2019t been ruled out.Trump has said he expects to make a decision on the Fed-chair search this month. That\u2019ll kick off a months-long process of Senate confirmation before Yellen\u2019s current term expires in February.\u00a0Hawk or Dove?\u00a0Yellen, 71, has had a track record of keeping rates low over her four-year term. She has consistently supported gradually tightening policy and gradually unwinding the balance sheet. Yellen has been a \u201csuper-dove,\u201d though \u201csprouting a few hawk feathers,\u201d Amherst Pierpont Securities Chief Economist Stephen Stanley said.Last month, Yellen said it\u2019s uncertain exactly why inflation has been running below the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target \u2014 which it has mostly missed for the past five years. Weak inflation \u201cstrengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments\u201d in rates.Regulatory Views: Yellen has defended stricter banking rules introduced after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. \u201cAny adjustments to the regulatory framework should be modest,\u201d she said in August.Pros: Trump told the Wall Street Journal in July that he favors low rates, adding: Yellen has\u00a0\u201chistorically been a low-interest-rate person.\u201dCons: Yellen is a Democrat appointed by Barack Obama who\u2019s led the regulatory policies the Trump administration is seeking to change. She\u2019s an academic, while the administration has preferred installing business people into top positions.Hawk or Dove? From the little we know, Cohn would likely be at least as dovish as Yellen. In 2015 when Cohn was still president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., he questioned Yellen\u2019s plan to hike rates, saying she had \u201cno legitimate argument to raise rates without inflation being close to \u2014 or having some inkling that it\u2019s approaching \u2014 2 per cent.\u201d Cohn, 57, has criticized the Fed\u2019s move toward transparency, arguing in a March 2016 speech that the central banks\u2019 \u201cvery definitive forward guidance has gotten the markets very confused.\u201dRegulatory Views: In February, Cohn said rolling back regulations is a central priority\u00a0for the White House. \u201cWe need to deregulate and cut down the regulatory process to grow jobs in this country.\u201dPros: Cohn, who has helped lead the president\u2019s drive on a tax overhaul, would seem to meet Trump\u2019s twin goals of wanting low interest rates and pushing deregulation. Most Republican policy makers are more hawkish, by contrast.Cons: Cohn\u2019s prospects have dimmed after he publicly criticized remarks the president made in the wake of racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Cohn was at Goldman when the firm engaged in some of the era\u2019s most controversial trades, and he helped manage the firm\u2019s pre-crisis bet against the housing market. That background would be sure to be scrutinized in any congressional hearings.Hawk or Dove?\u00a0The Fed governor was rated as neutral on monetary policy by the Bloomberg Intelligence Fed Spectrometer. He\u2019s never dissented on the Federal Open Market Committee since taking office in 2012. A survey of 30 economists in March found he was slightly more dovish than average Fed central bankers.Powell, 64, in August presaged comments by Yellen that the softness in inflation this year was a \u201cmystery\u201d and said the low price readings allowed the Fed to be patient in raising interest rates. He also privately voiced skepticism of the third round of asset purchases \u2013 known as quantitative easing \u2013\u00a0launched in 2012, but ended up voting for the initiative championed by then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.Regulatory Views: Powell this month said he wants to preserve gains from post-crisis reforms, though \u201cwe can do it more efficiently. That\u2019s the process we are actively engaged in right now.\u201dPros: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin favors Powell, according to Politico. \u201cPowell has Republican credentials, knows the board and FOMC well\u201d and \u201chas impressed with his grasp of monetary economics,\u201d Deutsche Bank Chief Economist Peter Hooper wrote in a report.Cons: Powell\u2019s continuity might not be as appealing as a bigger Fed overhaul for the Trump administration. Powell \u201cappears to largely support\u201d the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that increased regulations in the financial industry, which conflicts with plans by this administration on scaling back rules, Capital Economics Chief U.S. Economist Paul Ashworth wrote in a report.Hawk or Dove?\u00a0The former Fed governor is among the most hawkish of the contenders. In January, Warsh said the Fed was close to achieving its goals of maximum employment and price stability. \u201cTell me again why interest rates seem to be so far away\u201d from the historical target,\u00a0Warsh\u00a0said.Warsh, 47, has said central bankers should be concerned about elevated asset prices. \u201cI see way too much complacency,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I see volatility measures in the stock market and bond market at historic lows, if I were a central banker, I wouldn\u2019t take comfort from that.\u201d As a Fed governor, he opposed the second round of quantitative easing, then voted to support the stimulus to provide a greater consensus behind Bernanke.Regulatory Views: He co-wrote a commentary in July supporting the Trump administration\u2019s plans for higher growth in part by reducing regulations. He has said Fed regulation \u201cnow micromanages big banks and effectively caps their rate of return.\u201dPros: His regulatory views fit closely to Trump\u2019s so he would be more likely to overhaul rules as opposed to fine-tuning them. While less dovish than Yellen, \u201cWarsh has never seemed doctrinaire on rates,\u201d said\u00a0Amherst Pierpont\u2019s Stanley. Warsh\u00a0also has a personal connection. He\u2019s married to Jane Lauder, daughter of Trump friend Ronald Lauder and a global brand president at the cosmetic company founded by her grandmother, Estee Lauder.Cons: He\u2019s the youngest and least experienced of the contenders. His concerns about inflation as a Fed governor have proven to be misplaced, as\u00a0inflation has undershot the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent goal. His candidacy has attracted opposition from left-leaning activists, particularly for his cheerleading prior to the financial crisis of Wall Street innovations.Hawk or Dove?\u00a0He\u2019s likely among the most hawkish of the contenders. Taylor created a widely cited rule for setting interest rates that\u2019s named after him. The 70-year-old has called for rules-based policies and argued the Fed has engaged in too much discretion. He\u2019s also argued the Fed\u2019s unconventional policies, including asset purchases, haven\u2019t work. \u201cThe Federal Reserve is a little behind the curve\u201d in raising rates, Taylor said in January.A strict adherence to the so-called Taylor Rule would have required the Fed to hold interest rates higher during most of Yellen\u2019s four-year term, though its policy prescription varies a lot depending on what assumptions are made about the economy\u2019s potential rate of growth.Regulatory Views: Taylor has argued less regulation is key to pro-growth policies. \u201cTo turn the economy around we need to take the muzzle off, and that means regulatory reform, tax reform, budget reform, and monetary reform,\u201d he wrote in his blog.Pros: Taylor has served in four presidential administrations. He was part of the Council of Economic Advisers under Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush. George W. Bush named him undersecretary for international affairs at the Treasury. His Taylor Rule has been widely quoted by leading central bankers including those at the Fed.Cons: \u201cThe various iterations of the Taylor policy rule almost certainly would mean higher rates,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence economists wrote in report. \u201cIf Trump wants to push for 3 per cent GDP growth, Taylor will almost certainly make the task all the more challenging.\u201dBloomberg"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Emily Chasan", "title": "Starbucks, Google, Apple assailed by shareholders over gender policies", "description": "'This is an employment discrimination situation waiting to happen'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/executive/starbucks-google-assailed-by-shareholders-over-gender-policies", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/aapple_inc.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 2, 2017 5:01 PM EDT", "content": "Investors focused on social issues are finding that trickle-down diversity doesn\u2019t work.\u00a0For years, they surmised that having enough women on boards and in senior management would produce fairer policies. Now investors are changing tactics, saying it\u2019s not enough and that employers also need to implement gender-pay equity and paid-leave policies that attract and retain women.Zevin Asset Management,\u00a0in a first-of-its-kind shareholder proposal, has asked Starbucks Corp. to prepare a report on its new paid-leave policy for U.S. workers that took effect Oct. 1, saying the approach is \u201cparticularly unequal.\u201d The coffee chain offers 18 weeks of paid leave for mothers in corporate headquarters and just six weeks for those who work in its stores, while also excluding fathers and adoptive parents.\u201cThis is an employment discrimination situation waiting to happen,\u201d Pat Tomaino,\u00a0associate director of socially responsible investing at Boston-based Zevin, said in an interview.\u00a0\u201cWe want to focus on companies that are managing human capital appropriately and attuned to investing in women\u2019s career paths. Such a big divide between headquarters and the front-line workforce can erode morale.\u201dJaime Riley, a Starbucks spokeswoman, said the policy announced in January is \u201cexceptional\u201d for a retailer because it\u2019s offered to employees who work a minimum of just 20 hours a week, without a tenure requirement.\u201cWe take a competitive approach and evolve our benefits based on ongoing conversations with our partners as we learn more about their different benefits needs and preferences,\u201d Riley said in an email.This is an employment discrimination situation waiting to happenZevin has approached more than a dozen major companies about their paid-family-leave policies \u2014 they include Costco Wholesale Corp., United Parcel Service Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. \u2014 and plans to file more proposals in coming months. The pressure on firms to deliver is higher now, Tomaino said, noting a lack of action on paid-leave policy from the U.S. government.Another asset manager, Arjuna Capital, filed nine shareholder resolutions last year over gender-pay gaps at technology companies. Of those, Facebook Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. \u201cfailed to take meaningful action,\u201d Arjuna said in a statement last week. \u201cToday, Alphabet is under fire for its lack of transparency on gender-pay equity, making it subject to federal, class action and shareholder actions,\u201d Arjuna managing partner Natasha Lamb wrote in a Sept. 26 letter to Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt.Google reported earlier this year that women are paid 99.7 per cent of what men make and has already provided the methodology it uses to determine equitable pay that Arjuna is asking for, a Google spokesman said. Last month, three women who worked at Google in recent years filed a class-action lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court, accusing the company of systematically paying male employees more than their female counterparts. Google has said it disagrees with the lawsuit\u2019s central allegations and that it has \u201cextensive systems in place to ensure\u201d fair pay.There isn't necessarily a correlation between having women on the board and in the C-suite and having fair policies and practicesCorporate policies and practices on gender issues are \u201cthe next frontier\u201d for investors, said Suzanne Biegel, a senior adviser at the Wharton Social Impact Initiative and founder of Catalyst at Large, a consulting firm that focuses on investing through a gender lens.\u201cUnfortunately, there isn\u2019t necessarily a correlation between having women on the board and in the C-suite and having fair policies and practices,\u201d Biegel said.Investors, meanwhile, still remain focused on getting more women on boards and into senior management. State Street Corp., the US$2.6 trillion asset manager, voted against director slates this year at about 400 companies that lacked female board representation. The firm\u2019s SPDR Gender Diversity exchange-traded fund focuses on companies that have greater gender diversity in senior leadership. BlackRock Inc., the world\u2019s biggest money manager, said it supported eight of nine shareholder proposals on board diversity this year and opposed board members at five companies that failed to address it.Shareholders are drilling down into the details. The top request from Aflac Inc. investors this year was for more information on gender pay equity policies, said Catherine Blades, a spokeswoman for the insurer. That prompted the company to include a detailed section in its corporate responsibility report for the first time about how it determines equitable pay for employees, she said.These policies are also quickly becoming an issue that can affect customers\u2019 willingness to open their wallet, according to Aflac.The insurer, in a June survey of 1,001 consumers and 100 investors, found\u00a0consumers were less willing to forgive a company for not paying employees equitably than for polluting. Slightly more than half of consumers and 34 per cent of investors said paying male and female employees the same amount for the same job was a top priority. Paid leave was a bigger issue for investors, with 59 per cent saying they strongly agreed that responsible companies offer paid maternity leave policies, versus 51 per cent of consumers.\u201cInvestors and the public are moving fast,\u201d Blades said. \u201cPeople will go out of their way to penalize companies they don\u2019t think are doing the right thing."}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Fed seen staying on track for December rate increase: Survey", "description": "Economists widely expect Fed officials to begin winding down their US$4.5 trillion balance sheet in October", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-seen-staying-on-track-for-december-rate-increase-survey", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/nybz101-ap1.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 19, 2017 1:03 PM EDT", "content": "By Christopher Condon and Catarina SaraivaThe Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting this week while staying on track to lift its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point in December, according to a Bloomberg survey of 42 economists.Results of the survey, conducted September 12-14, showed economists also widely expect Fed officials to begin winding down their US$4.5 trillion balance sheet in October, and will announce that timing at 2 p.m. Wednesday after their two-day meeting in Washington.\u201cWhile transitory factors may stay the Fed\u2019s hand in the short-term, the path to normalization of the fed funds target range should continue in December,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West, in San Francisco.Concern the Fed might delay a third rate hike this year following a spate of weak inflation readings eased after the consumer price index rose 1.9 per cent in the 12 months through August. Just 20 per cent of survey respondents said the risks for growth and inflation lie mainly to the downside, the lowest in a Bloomberg survey since March.In line with that, 75 per cent of respondents said the Fed wouldn\u2019t change its post-meeting statement to reflect growing concerns over inflation, up from 67 per cent in a July survey.\u201cThe recent CPI number may have provided some confirmation that things aren\u2019t as bad as people feared,\u201d said James Orlando, a senior economist at TD Bank in Toronto.Respondents say the Fed will slightly shift the projected path of rates when they release an updated set of quarterly economic projections following the FOMC meeting. Economists said the Fed will still pencil in three hikes for 2018, but with the first of those not projected until June, versus March in the Fed\u2019s previous set of forecasts.Economists also lowered the level at which they expect rates to crest in this tightening cycle to 2.75 per cent from 3 per cent, with that peak seen coming in the fourth quarter of 2019. They also expect Fed officials to trim their estimate for the long-run rate of unemployment to a median 4.5 per cent from 4.6 per cent.The long-run rate represents the level below which officials believe unemployment becomes inflationary. A lower estimate of long-run unemployment could explain why low unemployment hasn\u2019t yet triggered higher inflation, and justify the Fed keeping rates low to run the economy a little hotter.Unemployment has dropped near to a 16-year low of 4.4 per cent, while the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge of 12-month inflation has remained under its 2 per cent target for most of the last five years. During that same period, the Fed\u2019s estimate of long-run unemployment has dropped almost a full percentage point.Bloomberg "}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Google sued by women workers claiming gender discrimination", "description": "Three women are suing Google in San Francisco Superior Court, alleging the company pays women less than men for equal or similar work", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/google-sued-by-women-workers-claiming-gender-discrimination", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/skintones_b.gif", "publishedAt": "September 14, 2017 4:07 PM EDT", "content": "By Erik LarsonGoogle Inc. was accused of systematically paying male employees more than females, adding the internet giant to a growing list of technology companies sued for gender discrimination.Three women who worked at Google in recent years sued the company in San Francisco Superior Court alleging that it continues to pay women less than men for equal or similar work, according to a copy of a complaint provided by their lawyer. The filing couldn\u2019t be immediately verified in court records.The case comes as the tech industry has been bombarded with accusations of sexism and sexual harassment.Microsoft Corp. and Twitter Inc. were both sued in 2015 on behalf of female engineers claiming men are favored for advancement. That\u2019s the same year Ellen Pao put Silicon Valley\u2019s male-dominated culture front and center during a trial pitting her against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. She claimed there was a sexually charged atmosphere where men preyed on their female coworkers and that she\u2019d been blocked from promotion and fired for her gender. She lost, but the trial rallied other women to speak out.The proposed class-action seeks to represent all women who have worked at Google in California during the last four years. The company violates the state\u2019s Equal Pay Act by paying women lower wages than men who perform similar work and have the same experience and skills, according to the suit. Google has been well aware of the problem for years but perpetuates it by promoting women less frequently, the women say.One plaintiff, software engineer Kelly Ellis, worked at Google\u2019s Mountain View office from about May 2010 to July 2014, according to the complaint. Another,\u00a0Holly Pease, performed a variety of managerial roles at two of Google\u2019s offices from 2005 to 2016.

That\u2019s a legacy of white-minority rule South Africa imposed when it controlled Namibia from World War I to 1990, with black people being disenfranchised and displaced.Critics of South Africa\u2019s policy, including the biggest labor-union federation, say it has failed to redress inequalities because it focuses on increasing black ownership of companies rather than raising education standards to match a skills shortage, and has benefited a small number of wealthy individuals. Proposals by Namibia, the world\u2019s biggest marine-diamond producer, are similar, which could hamper investment and growth in an economy that\u2019s contracted every quarter since March last year.The plan \u201chas caused much unease among white business owners and heightened investment uncertainty,\u201d Gerrit van Rooyen, an analyst at NKC African Economics in Paarl, South Africa, said in an emailed response to questions. Both governments have to \u201ccreate incentives to boost employment and stimulate investment. Black economic empowerment cannot succeed without job creation and wage growth.\u201dThe New Equitable Economic Empowerment Framework Bill outlines six areas to increase black citizens\u2019 participation in business, including developing people\u2019s skills and providing financing for those disadvantaged by inequality to buy stakes in companies. Zimbabwe enacted legislation a decade ago that required all foreign or white-owned businesses to sell or cede 51 per cent ownership to black nationals.The Namibia Chamber of Commerce and Industry wants the focus on economic ownership scrapped, saying it will result in capital flight. It also calls for a rethink on employment equity, because it requires \u201cformal racial classification and promotes racial polarization; blames white racism, brushes over complex causes of interracial inequality,\u201d the NCCI said in its response to the proposed law.The chamber suggests the bill should target \u201conly the needy and disadvantaged,\u201d and that selection criteria be based on \u201cloyalty, restraint and goodwill and not on greed, tokenism and discrimination.\u201d Namibia ranks alongside South Africa and Lesotho among the world\u2019s most unequal societies in terms of distribution of income, according to Gini coefficients compiled by the CIA World Factbook.The Law Reform and Development Commission is revising the bill and doesn\u2019t yet know when the new version will be ready, Yvonne Dausab, the body\u2019s chairwoman, said.The current version of the plan has helped see Namibia, the world\u2019s fifth-biggest uranium producer, lose its spot as Africa\u2019s second-most attractive jurisdiction for mining companies to invest in, based on policies, to Botswana, the Fraser Institute\u2019s 2016 survey of 2,700 firms worldwide shows.On June 19, Fitch Ratings Ltd. kept its assessment of Namibia\u2019s foreign-currency debt at the lowest investment grade, saying the draft empowerment law represents a \u201cmodest risk\u201d to the business and investment climate as uncertainties remain about what will ultimately be approved as legislation.Almost two months later, Moody\u2019s Investors Service cut its rating of the country\u2019s debt to junk, citing a \u201cmaterial\u201d decrease in the country\u2019s fiscal strength, with public debt reaching 42 percent of gross domestic product from 26 percent when the company first assigned a rating in 2011. It has the assessment on a negative outlook, which means the next move could be another cut, saying that a change of investment sentiment is among risks to the rating.Besides the empowerment law, Namibia is proposing legislation that will limit foreign ownership of land, and it has signed an investment promotion act that will reserve some business activities for black Namibians, Van Rooyen said.\u201cThe government seems to be shifting towards nativist and protectionist policies, which typically discourages foreign investment and impedes economic growth,\u201d he said.Bloomberg News"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Can you fire someone for being a white supremacist?

Outside of the office, however, the relationship between corporate codes of conduct and hateful politics\u00a0is\u00a0less straightforward. It\u2019s not entirely clear that employees will always be fired for being an after-hours Nazi.Take the recent white-nationalists rallies in Charlottesville, Va., which featured anti-Semitic slogans, Nazi symbols, and an attack on counter-protestors that left one person dead. At least four participants\u00a0in the rallies have lost their jobs as a result.Using images of the Charlottesville marches, amateur investigators\u00a0such as\u00a0Logan Smith, who runs the Twitter account Yes, You\u2019re a Racist,\u00a0have exposed the identities of participants and, in some cases, their places of employment.\u00a0Within a\u00a0week, several of those identified had\u00a0reportedly lost jobs over conduct that took place far from their workplaces.\u00a0Not all employees are equally vulnerable.Public-sector employees have the most protections, even for what might be deemed out-of-office hate speech, thanks to the restrictions of the First Amendment on government action.\u00a0That doesn\u2019t mean that someone employed by a public institution can say\u00a0whatever he wants without any consequences.\u00a0If\u00a0a government employer can prove that an employee\u2019s\u00a0actions are an \u201cissue of public concern,\u201d there\u00a0may be a case for termination,\u00a0said\u00a0Jonathan Segal, an employment lawyer at Duane Morris. He suggested, as an example, that a\u00a0police officer who is part of a white nationalist group might lose his job. (This happened in 2015 when two Alabama police officers lost their jobs for belonging to a white nationalist group.)\u00a0Private-sector employees have fewer protections, unless working under a contract that explicitly states otherwise.\u00a0Union contracts\u00a0often require an employer to demonstrate \u201cjust cause\u201d for firing an employee,\u00a0and Segal said that behaviour outside of work alone won\u2019t always suffice. An employer would have to prove that the activity\u00a0somehow affects the workplace or the worker\u2019s ability to do his job. If\u00a0a member of a white supremacist group\u00a0acts as a company representative as part of his job, for example, the employer might\u00a0reasonably\u00a0allege that the organization\u2019s\u00a0reputation would be tainted by association. Other workers could also potentially complain of a hostile work environment.\u00a0Most people employed in the private sector have less generous\u00a0\u201cat-will\u201d employment contracts. \u201cThat means they can be fired for any reason\u2013as long as it isn\u2019t an illegal reason,\u201d said\u00a0Elizabeth Owens Bille, the general counsel for the Society for Human Resource Management. And firing someone for attending a Nazi rally is potentially illegal, depending on the state.\u00a0About half of U.S. states have laws that prohibit firing workers\u00a0based on their off-duty\u00a0conduct, although\u00a0these\u00a0protections vary widely. In South Carolina, where Nick Krofta lost his job after appearing in a picture at the Charlottesville rally, a single activity, such as smoking, might be protected in the law. Other states\u2013California, Colorado, New York, and North Dakota\u2013specify that employers can\u2019t fire workers for participating in \u201clawful\u00a0activities,\u201d including political protests.\u00a0Even in those states where the law protects employees who\u00a0attend a march, companies can still defend firing a white supremacist\u00a0other ways.\u00a0\u201cIf they\u2019re screaming comments about Jews, gays, and Muslims, I believe a good argument is that you\u2019re not responding to the political activity,\u201d said Segal. \u201cYou\u2019re responding to the content of what is said\u2013the hate speech, not the march.\u201d Unlike government employees, private-sector workers don\u2019t have First Amendment rights on the job. Some states have laws that prohibit firing workers based on political speech, but Segal says those laws are\u00a0generally narrow.In states without these \u201coff-duty\u201d protections, it\u2019s not difficult for companies to fire at-will employees who participate in white supremacist rallies\u2013or any other off-hours behaviour deemed unsavoury.\u00a0\u201cIt is perfectly OK to terminate somebody,\u201d said Jay Starkman, chief executive\u00a0of Engage, which provides HR services for small and midsize\u00a0companies. \u201cThe reason for the termination is that it doesn\u2019t\u00a0reflect the values of the organization.\u201dSocial media posts can also get a worker fired, even for stuff not posted at work. Many companies have policies about what their workers can and can\u2019t post online. Any content that\u2019s inconsistent with the company\u2019s antidiscrimination policy can get an employee fired.White supremacists in the workplace are problems for their employers. They can tarnish the reputation of an organization, create a hostile work environment for nonwhite workers, and counteract\u00a0diversity and inclusion initiatives.\u00a0Still, companies don\u2019t want to chill employees into thinking that they can get fired for anything they do on their own time.\u201cYou don\u2019t want this to be\u00a0political, you want it to be a decency vs. hatred issue,\u201d said Segal.\u00a0\u201cSo people don\u2019t think they can\u2019t have different\u00a0political views, even where that wouldn\u2019t be protected.\u201dBloomberg News"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Five charts that show Canadian stocks could rise from the dead", "description": "One of the worst performing markets in the world this year, the TSX looks set for a rebound, say some prominent stock watchers", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/five-charts-that-show-canadian-stocks-may-rise-from-the-dead", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/stocks1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 14, 2017 1:07 PM EDT", "content": "It hasn\u2019t been a pretty year for Canadian stocks but signs are growing that the S&P/TSX Composite Index may be set for a rebound \u2014 if investors can move past geopolitical tensions and focus on the fundamentals.After gaining 18 per cent in 2016 and hitting a record in February, the S&P/TSX has been one of the worst-performing benchmarks in the developed world with a decline of 1.7 per cent year-to-date, second only to Israel\u2019s 7.3 per cent drop.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the unwind, and clearly you can blame energy for that,\u201d Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a phone interview.The energy index has been the worst performer on the S&P/TSX this year with a decline of 15 per cent, outpacing about 9 per cent drop in West Texas Intermediate crude prices. Energy stocks account for 20 per cent of the benchmark\u2019s weight.However, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Canadian investors. Of the 143 index members that have reported second-quarter earnings, 64 per cent have beat analyst estimates and 30 per cent have missed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This is a significant improvement from the first quarter, when 49 per cent beat and 43 per cent missed, and an indication that corporate fundamentals are improving.\u201cInvestors are finally going to come to grips with Canadian growth and earnings growth is a little bit better than everybody thought so that\u2019s where you can get more upside,\u201d Belski said.An upbeat earnings season hasn\u2019t had much impact on valuations yet. The gap in forward price-to-earnings between the S&P/TSX and the S&P 500 Index is the biggest it\u2019s been since 2008. Several strategists and investors say a gap this big can\u2019t last and will either be narrowed by declines in the U.S. or gains in Canada.\u201cThere\u2019s a good case to be made for the bout of serious underperformance in Canada to subside,\u201d Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.Any recovery in the S&P/TSX will need energy stocks behind it, given their importance to the benchmark. Although there are plenty of unknowns for oil prices \u2014 including OPEC\u2019s commitment to production cuts and U.S. shale producers\u2019 ability to fill the gap \u2014 there are also signals that investors are getting more bullish on energy.Traders invested $42 million in the iShares S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF in July, the biggest exchange traded fund tracking Canada\u2019s energy index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That inflow was the largest since September 2016, a month when oil prices rose 7.9 per cent and energy stocks gained 3.5 per cent.Canadian oil producers are also more resilient than they were before the downturn following significant cost-cutting efforts. Meanwhile, the price discount between Western Canada Select and WTI has narrowed to about $10, the smallest in more than two years and down from a high of more than $40 a barrel in 2013 \u2014 another positive sign for the Canadian oil patch.\u00a0A rebound in Canadian stocks also won\u2019t get far without the help of financials, which account for 34 per cent of the S&P/TSX. Financials have lost 0.5 per cent this year as concern about overheated housing markets weighed on shares of the big banks.Belski said that will change as investors look for dividend growth as an alternative to bonds in a rising-rate environment. Canada\u2019s five largest banks have averaged dividend growth of 64 per cent since 2008 compared with 32 per cent for the five top utilities stocks on the S&P/TSX over the same period.\u201cWe still believe that most investors are under-exposed financials,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the next three to five years in equity investing around the world, one of the biggest secular themes is going to be dividend growth and Canadian financials are among the best dividend growers in the world.\u201dJohn Aiken, financials analyst at Barclays Capital, said he expects bank valuations to continue to rise in the back half of the year as stocks are buoyed by a steady domestic economy, the strongest employment landscape since the financial crisis and rising interest rates, which will boost net interest margins.\u201cFurther, we believe strengthening commodity prices, most notably WTI, could be the fuel that drives further upside to bank valuations,\u201d Aiken wrote.Not everyone is bullish on Canadian equities. David Doyle, market strategist at Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. called Canada, its equity market and the loonie \u201cmaximum underweights\u201d in a recent note, citing the Bank of Canada\u2019s recent interest-rate hike.\u201cEven a modest rate-hike cycle introduces downside risks to our base case for a prolonged period of subdued 1 per cent real GDP growth,\u201d Doyle wrote. \u201cA \u2018made in Canada\u2019 recession has moved from being an interesting outlier scenario to worthy of serious consideration.\u201dAnd a new wrinkle has presented itself in growing tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, which pushed Canadian stocks to their biggest weekly decline since June.But the economy\u2019s growth of well over 3 per cent in the first half of 2017 \u2014 the fastest among the Group of Seven \u2014 will give equities the chance to climb out of the doldrums, Belski said. He has a 16,000 target on the S&P/TSX, which would be up 6.4 per cent from Friday\u2019s close.\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to see is an improving Canadian economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a nice opportunity for a game of catch-up in Canadian stocks, especially considering that U.S. stocks are sitting near all-time highs.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Toronto has more housing than you think \u2014 and that could be a problem", "description": "Census data throws cold water on the argument that the city's affordability crisis won't be resolved unless the government introduces measures to help increase supply", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/mortgages-real-estate/toronto-has-more-housing-than-you-thought-canada-eco-watch", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/housing2.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 14, 2017 7:24 AM EDT", "content": "By Erik Hertzberg and Theophilos Argitis When it comes to Toronto\u2019s runaway housing prices, the most important question remains the extent to which speculation is driving demand.Ideally, fundamentals such as demographics and employment are at play, and the price gains reflect natural household growth getting ahead of supply. If that\u2019s true, the market should eventually stabilize once new supply kicks in.A situation where speculators are bidding up prices would be much more problematic.Canada\u2019s 2016 census, which the statistics agency is releasing piecemeal this year, is providing some insight into the debate. The results: supply may not be the big problem many people thought it was.Between 2011 and 2016, the number of households in Toronto rose to 2.14 million, an addition of about 146,200, according to the census data, the latest round of which came out Wednesday. That compares to 175,825 new homes built over that period. In other words, supply of new houses exceeded real household demand by almost 30,000 over those five years.That throws cold water on the argument \u2014 voiced particularly by the industry \u2014 that the city\u2019s affordability crisis won\u2019t be resolved unless the government introduces measures to help increase supply.Some of the imbalance between supply and household formation over the past five years is a consequence of the construction slump during the last recession. Over the previous census period \u2014 2006 to 2011 \u2014 completions totaled 160,195, compared with 188,450 new households. In other words, supply almost perfectly matched natural household demand over the past 10 years.One segment of the Toronto market where lack of supply is definitely a problem is single-detached homes. These highly-coveted properties accounted for just 29 per cent of new builds over the past five years, down from 40 per cent over the 10 years prior. They\u2019ve also been growing at a much slower pace than household formation. The number of single-detached homes in Toronto is up about 13 per cent over the past decade, versus 19 per cent in the number of households formed.The city is simply running out of room to build on large properties, evident in census data that show its population density has surpassed 1,000 people per square kilometre for the first time ever, another factor that should continue supporting prices for detached homes.If the supply imbalance does lead to a price correction in Toronto\u2019s housing market, there may be a ready supply of buyers waiting in the wings.Almost half of young adults in Toronto live with their parents, the highest ratio in Canada, according to last week\u2019s census figures. Pent up demand from these so-called basement kids may quickly emerge to take up any pricing slack.Diana Petramala, an economist at Toronto Dominion Bank, says the high proportion of young adults living with their parents is slowing the formation of new households.After all, faced with the challenges of buying a home in Toronto, where the average price was running at about $746,000 in July, younger adults are more likely to defer decisions on starting families and less likely to take on the burden of ownership.\u201cI think household formation looks low given population estimates and the age structure of the population,\u201d Petramala said in an interview last week, estimating household formation would typically have been about 16,300 higher over the five years.The age analysis, released in May, offers some insight into another impact of rising home prices in Toronto. The city was once the place young families went to start a life, but that\u2019s no longer the case.In 2001, more than 30 per cent of Toronto\u2019s population was in what can be described as the young family cohort (those aged between 0 and 9, plus those aged between 30 to 39). That was the highest share among the country\u2019s largest urban centers, and compares to 28 per cent in Montreal.While the share of that cohort has since fallen across the country, Toronto has seen one of the largest drops. The census data show the young family cohort now accounts for 24.9 per cent of Toronto\u2019s population, placing it in the middle of the pack among major cities and half a percentage point below Montreal.To date, Statistics Canada has released 2016 census data centered around household formation, age, sex and dwellings. Data on income, immigration and mobility is due in the coming months.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Google fires author of divisive memo on gender differences that created a firestorm in Silicon Valley", "description": "James Damore, the Google engineer who wrote the note, confirmed his dismissal in an email, saying that he had been fired for \"perpetuating gender stereotypes.\" He said he's \"currently exploring ...", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/google-fires-author-of-divisive-memo-on-gender-differences-that-created-a-firestorm-in-silicon-valley", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/google1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 8, 2017 8:53 AM EDT", "content": "Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google has fired an employee who wrote an internal memo blasting the web company\u2019s diversity policies, creating a firestorm across Silicon Valley.\u00a0James Damore, the Google engineer who wrote the note, confirmed his dismissal in an email, saying that he had been fired for \u201cperpetuating gender stereotypes.\u201d He said he\u2019s \u201ccurrently exploring all possible legal remedies.\u201dThe imbroglio at Google is the latest in a long string of incidents concerning gender bias and diversity in the tech enclave.\u00a0Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick lost his job in June amid scandals over sexual harassment, discrimination and an aggressive culture. Ellen Pao\u2019s gender-discrimination lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 2015 also brought the issue to light, and more women are speaking up to say they\u2019ve been sidelined in the male-dominated industry, especially in engineering roles.Earlier on Monday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent a note to employees that said portions of the memo \u201cviolate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.\u201d But he didn\u2019t say if the company was taking action against the employee. A Google representative, asked about the dismissal, referred to Pichai\u2019s memo.Damore\u2019s 10-page memorandum accused Google of silencing conservative political opinions and argued that biological differences play a role in the shortage of women in tech and leadership positions. It circulated widely inside the company and became public over the weekend, causing a furor that amplified the pressure on Google executives to take a more definitive stand.After the controversy swelled, Danielle Brown, Google\u2019s new vice president for diversity, integrity and governance, sent a statement to staff condemning Damore\u2019s views and reaffirmed the company\u2019s stance on diversity. In internal discussion boards, multiple employees said they supported firing the author, and some said they would not choose to work with him, according to postings viewed by Bloomberg News.\u201cWe are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company,\u201d Brown said in the statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long haul.\u201dThe memo and surrounding debate comes as Google fends off a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Labor alleging the company systemically discriminates against women. Google has denied the charges, arguing that it doesn\u2019t have a gender gap in pay, but has declined to share full salary information with the government. According to the company\u2019s most recent demographic report, 69 percent of its workforce and 80 percent of its technical staff are male.Following the memo\u2019s publication, multiple executives shared an article from a senior engineer who recently left the company, Yonatan Zunger. In the blog post, Zunger said that based on the context of the memo, he determined that he would \u201cnot in good conscience\u201d assign any employees to work with its author. \u201cYou have just created a textbook hostile workplace environment,\u201d he wrote. He also said in a email, \u201cCould you imagine having to work with someone who had just publicly questioned your basic competency to do your job?\u201dStill, some right-wing websites had already lionized the memo\u2019s author, and firing him could be seen as confirming some of the claims in the memo itself \u2013 that the company\u2019s culture makes no room for dissenting political opinions. That outcome could galvanize any backlash against Alphabet\u2019s efforts to make its workforce more diverse.In her initial response to the memo, Brown, who joined from Intel Corp. in June, suggested that Google was open to all hosting \u201cdifficult political views,\u201d including those in the memo. However, she left open the possibility that Google could penalize the engineer for violating company policies. \u201cBut that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct, policies, and anti-discrimination laws,\u201d she wrote.The subject of Google\u2019s ideological bent came up at the most recent shareholder meeting, in June. A shareholder asked executives whether conservatives would feel welcome at the company. Executives disagreed with the idea that anyone wouldn\u2019t.\u201cThe company was founded under the principles of freedom of expression, diversity, inclusiveness and science-based thinking,\u201d Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said at the time. \u201cYou\u2019ll also find that all of the other companies in our industry agree with us.\u201dBloomberg News"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Canada\u2019s jobless rate falls to lowest since the dawn of the financial crisis", "description": "Our economy gained jobs for eighth month in a row, but trade disappointed.

The decline in the jobless rate was due in part to a lower participation rate, which fell to 65.7 per cent, from 65.9 per cent, as people left the labor force.A separate trade report showed a pullback in June for exports, down 4.3 per cent during the month and a trade deficit of $3.6 billion that was the widest since September 2016.Economists had forecast a 12,500 increase in employment for July, and a $1.25 billion June trade deficit.Canada\u2019s labor market is running hot.

The David-and-Goliath move worked, and two days later the countries reached an agreement.Fast forward 30 years, and Justin Trudeau, the current prime minister, is arriving at the same crossroads as his predecessor. The U.S. confirmed last week that among its top objectives in upcoming negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 which superseded the FTA in 1994 \u2014 is the elimination of the Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism that Mulroney went to such lengths to preserve.Will it be the deal breaker it was in 1987?\u201cThings like getting rid of Chapter 19 dispute-settlement panels, that\u2019s not a small bean. That\u2019s a biggie,\u201d Derek Burney, Mulroney\u2019s chief of staff during the FTA talks and a key player in NAFTA negotiations, said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have the trade agreement if we didn\u2019t get that dispute settlement.\u201d Burney also zeroed in on why the Canadian side was willing to risk so much to get the mechanism into the FTA: \u201cWe don\u2019t trust their trade-remedy tribunals, we never have.\u201dThe first round of NAFTA renegotiations begin on Aug. 16, with representatives from the U.S., Canada and Mexico gathering in Washington. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if Mexico and Canada don\u2019t agree to more favorable terms for the U.S.Contested IssuesNAFTA\u2019s Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism allows review by independent, binational panels \u2014 instead of judicial review by domestic courts \u2014 in anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases. Since NAFTA came into force, Canada has been involved in about 73 panels over items such as cattle, magnesium, hot-rolled steel, color-picture tubes, greenhouse tomatoes and super-calendered paper, according to the website of the NAFTA Secretariat, which is responsible for managing Chapter 19 proceedings.But given that in the last decade Canada has only initiated three cases under the provision, Robert Wolfe, professor emeritus at Queen University\u2019s School of Policy Studies in Kingston, Ontario, questions whether Chapter 19 is essential. Wolfe suggests Canada may want to consider bluffing, and when push comes to shove, give in on Chapter 19 in exchange for something better, gaining concessions on Trump\u2019s Buy American rules, for example, which restrict the ability of Canadian companies to bid on U.S. government contracts.\u201cIf you had to choose between a real restraint on Buy American and keeping Chapter 19, I\u2019d yell and pound the table and give up Chapter 19,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cA lot more Canadian jobs might benefit from stopping discriminatory government procurement in the U.S.\u201dWolfe says cross-border supply chains are much more prevalent, and a company that is part of such an arrangement would be shooting itself in the foot by taking a trade-remedy action against its partner. He cites the motor vehicle industry, saying \u201cyou\u2019re not going to see anti-dumping between Canada and the U.S.,\u201d because the bits and pieces of the cars go back and forth over the border so many times.Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in a July 19 report the Trump administration\u2019s goal under NAFTA negotiations is to make it easier to restrict imports from Canada and Mexico. That\u2019s \u201cworrisome\u201d because it could eliminate any new trade liberalization gains or reverse previous inroads, and likely lead to a situation where Canada and Mexico respond in kind against U.S. exports.Popular PactBy 2016 only 1.3 per cent of imports from NAFTA partners were covered by U.S. antidumping and countervailing duties versus 9.2 per cent of Chinese imports and 2.7 per cent of imports from the rest of the world, Bown wrote. He predicts Trump\u2019s barriers could more than quintuple the level of Canadian imports covered by trade remedies to 6.6 per cent. Without safeguards such as Chapter 19, the Trump administration\u2019s NAFTA \u201ccould make U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico much less free.\u201dNAFTA, which many people thought would lead to widespread job losses, is now much more popular in Canada than the other two countries. A Pew Research survey found 76 per cent of Canadian respondents felt the pact has benefited their country, versus 60 per cent of Mexicans and 51 per cent of Americans.NAFTA is also credited with having had measurable and positive impacts on everything from trade flows and investment to employment and productivity. A 2014 study on the effects of NAFTA by the Peterson Institute estimates Canada is about $50 billion richer each year in additional gross domestic product because of expanded two-way trade under NAFTA.Trudeau\u2019s LeverageThat may give Trudeau an advantage over his U.S. and Mexican counterparts. The status quo in many respects works just fine, whereas Trump may be under pressure to deliver a quick victory, and the Mexicans are said to want to wrap up negotiations before NAFTA becomes a battleground in summer 2018 presidential elections.\u201cCanada walking away is the worst-case scenario,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to do that, and we don\u2019t want President Trump to rip the thing up. They\u2019re a bigger boy in the school yard than we are, but we don\u2019t have to think we\u2019re going to get pushed around. We do have leverage.\u201dDavid MacNaughton, Canada\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., said at a forum last week that it makes sense to have some kind of dispute-resolution mechanism within the agreement but the current one could be improved. A spokesman for Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, declined to comment on the dispute-resolution mechanism.Mulroney fought so hard to preserve the dispute settlement because without it, he reasoned, Canada would face years of litigation in the U.S. court system whenever a disagreement arose. That\u2019s why he took the extraordinary step in 1987 of calling his chief negotiator in Washington to tell him to pack his bags and come home.Mulroney\u2019s Gambit\u201cI instructed Simon Reisman to return, and used it as a manner of getting the attention of the American government big time,\u201d Mulroney said in a 2011 interview. \u201cThat happened, and I think it led to the resolution of the impasse and the Free Trade Agreement.\u201dBurney, who the government has reached out to for advice as it prepares for a new round of talks, has called on Canada to start drawing lines in the sand and spell out what it\u2019s not willing to compromise on. Trudeau\u2019s government has so far been publicly quiet on its NAFTA priorities. If push comes to shove, Trudeau may need to channel Mulroney, who has acted as his informal adviser in dealing with the Trump administration.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to walk away from the table. Otherwise you don\u2019t go to the table,\u201d John Manley, chief executive of the Business Council of Canada, said in a recent interview. \u201cCanada needs to stand firm on dispute settlement, otherwise we\u2019re sitting ducks.\u201dBloomberg.com"}]
