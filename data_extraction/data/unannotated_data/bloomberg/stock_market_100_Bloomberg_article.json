Some say the S&P/TSX Composite Index\u2019s 36 per cent\u00a0rally from a March low should be seen as a natural market bounce, after a ferocious drop in reaction to the economic damage of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThe strength of the April rally was a function of how violent the sell-off was in March,\u201d Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments, said by phone. \u201cSo given how much March was a disaster, we had to expect some sort of bounce coming out of it and that\u2019s what April really was.\u201d Thursday and Friday\u2019s sessions were not pretty. The benchmark posted its biggest two-day slump since the March 23 low. That will stoke the debate on whether investors who\u2019ve pushed up stock prices have appropriately accounted for a financial landscape utterly changed by the pandemic. A sector rotation may have helped to extend the rally. What started off as a great run for gold miners and tech companies -- Shopify Inc. passed $100 billion in market cap -- has now faded with cyclical stocks taking over. \u201cThe debate is whether that\u2019s good news or bad,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBecause for the market rally to broaden out, you need other sectors to catch up and join in. But at the same time, in sector rotation, when the cyclicals and banks go, that\u2019s usually the end of the rally.\u201d One example of the powerful rally in cyclicals: Sea-Doo maker BRP Inc., which fell 61\u00a0per cent\u00a0in the first quarter, has risen 68 per cent\u00a0in the second. Others say the data we\u2019ve all been waiting for -- economic growth, or lack thereof, and corporate profits -- now points to a bleak picture investors can no longer ignore. \u201cInvestors may find themselves increasingly vulnerable to disappointment in the near-term -- particularly as there\u2019s still plenty of bad news that needs to be absorbed on the economic and corporate earnings front,\u201d said Candice Bangsund, portfolio manager of global asset allocation at Fiera Capital Corp. in Montreal. For bulls emboldened by the possibility of economies reopening, watch out. While the Canadian government has offered more than $70 billion in wage subsidies for business -- as well as loans and assistance with rent -- that doesn\u2019t mean consumer demand will spring back once they open up again. \u201cAs the re-opening of the economy is likely to be both staggered and temperamental, setbacks on the road to recovery are probable and could potentially trigger some period bouts of volatility and risk aversion in the near-term,\u201d Bangsund said. Brian Belski is staying optimistic, adding that the stock market is traditionally six months ahead of the economy. Investors are too focused on risk and not the reward, the chief investment strategist of BMO Capital Markets said by phone. The resiliency in Canada\u2019s stock market can be seen in energy stocks that have bounced back despite the fear and volatility surrounding oil prices, he noted. \u201cAmerica and Canada are the best places in a bad neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are so focused on the negative, we are missing the positive.\u201d Markets -- Just The Numbers Economy Tiff Macklem was appointed to succeed Stephen Poloz as head of the Bank of Canada.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index fell 0.26 per cent to close the day at 14,251; the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index finished fractionally lower, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average clung to positive territory with a 0.17 per cent gain. Equities started the session on a positive note, but reversed direction in the early afternoon after the Financial Times reported a setback in Gilead Sciences Inc.\u2019s test of a potential treatment for severe respiratory issues as the world searches for a way to combat COVID-19 and its accompanying complications. Crude prices continued to recover, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate rising 23 per cent to just shy of US$17 per barrel shortly after 4 p.m. ET. WTI has now gained 47 per cent over the last two sessions, after falling into negative territory Monday. While crude has rocketed off its historic lows, persistent concerns about global oversupply and demand destruction due to the forced economic hibernation undertaken to fight the pandemic have sent WTI prices down 72 per cent year-to-date. Alberta\u2019s Western Canadian Select also marched higher, rising 62 per cent to US$8.09 per barrel, though Canadian crude is priced sporadically throughout the day. Gold prices rose once again, up about two-thirds of a per cent to trade at US$1,750 per ounce. The strength in commodities bore out on Bay Street, as the TSX\u2019s materials subgroup rose 1.69 per cent and the energy subgroup rose 0.99 per cent. Those were the only TSX sectors in positive territory Thursday, with consumer staples, utilities and communications posting the largest percentage losses. The Canadian dollar was lifted by oil, rising 44 basis points against its U.S. counterpart to trade at 71.06 cents U.S. 11:50 a.m. ET: TSX clings to gains, U.S equities push higher North American equity markets hung onto their gains through midday Thursday, with the S&P/TSX Composite Index rising about half a per cent and the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite index all notching advances of about one per cent to extend Wednesday\u2019s rally. Crude continued to rise, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate surging 30 per cent to trade at US$18 per barrel. WTI has gained about 54 per cent over the last two sessions after the historic slide into negative territory Monday. Still, American oil has shed 70 per cent of its value since the beginning of the year over concerns of oversupply and demand destruction stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Alberta\u2019s Western Canadian Select extended its gains, rising 64 per cent to hit US$8.22 per barrel. Canadian crude prices have more than doubled in the last two sessions, after sinking as low as US$0.13 per barrel in the oil rout earlier in the week. In Toronto, eight of the 11 TSX subgroups were in negative territory, with utilities, information technology and real estate posting the largest percentage declines. The entirety of the TSX\u2019s gains were driven by strength in materials and energy. The Canadian dollar rose more than half a cent against its U.S. counterpart to trade at 71.27 cents U.S. 9:40 a.m. ET: North American markets post modest gains, oil extends rally North American equity markets posted modest gains to open Thursday\u2019s trade, with the S&P/TSX Composite Index, S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index rising a little more than a third of a per cent to extend Wednesday\u2019s rally. The modest strength in equities mirrored moves in Europe, where major indices pushed slightly higher. Oil prices continued their March higher, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate surging nearly 20 per cent to trade at US$16.50 per barrel. That move higher has WTI up more than 40 per cent in the last two trading sessions, though American crude is still down 72 per cent on a year-to-date basis. Alberta\u2019s Western Canadian Select was up 56 per cent to trade at US$7.82 per barrel, though the Canadian crude contract is somewhat illiquid and only prices a handful of times per day.

The energy sector has been sent to the mat, losing half of its value amid concerns over falling crude demand due to the virus and the oil price war launched by Saudi Arabia hammering the Canadian producers in an unprecedented manner. The health care names have been hard hit as well. The sector, which is dominated by volatile cannabis stocks, has plunged deep into a bear market under current conditions. Aurora Cannabis Inc. and Hexo Corp. have been the hardest hit.

Energy services company Shawcor lost nearly 90 per cent of its value after suspending its dividend in the face of the crisis, sending shares plunging. Shares of Vermilion plunged after the company, which has production in Southwest Saskatchewan and Europe, slashed its dividend. Whitecap, Cenovus and Secure were similarly caught up in the damage. While the TSX energy index is under pronounced pressure, Ninepoint Partners partner and senior portfolio manager Eric Nuttall said he expects a strong recovery once fundamentals solidify. \u201cWe are literally in the valley of death for Canadian energy, but those [companies] with good hedges can make it out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Canadian energy industry is under severe pressure, but it will survive.\u201d Nuttall said he thinks mid-cap companies will see the biggest rebound in any rally. In the wake of the selloff, investment industry professionals are urging calm. In a phone interview with BNN Bloomberg, Richardson GMP chief investment officer Craig Basinger said investors should stay the course in times of volatility. \u201cIt\u2019s time likes these that you can do more damage to your portfolios than good \u00a0\u2013 this too shall pass,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t panic, think things out.\u201d Goodreid Investment Counsel senior vice-president and portfolio manager Brian Madden echoed that response, adding clients used to nothing but upside action in equities should remain sanguine. \u201cPeople think their portfolios are bullet-proof. They don\u2019t want to eat their vegetables, but volatility happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking through the greatest economic dislocation of our lifetime.

Here are some of their views: Key Support Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at Manulife Investment Management, which manages $879 billion (US$677 billion) of assets: The S&P/TSX composite index has slumped to levels not since 2016, when the price of oil bottomed out. The market was about 1 per cent\u00a0away from that as of noon on Wednesday. \u201cThe 2016 low is a key support level and one we are watching right now. This is an important technical support level that we would expect to hold. Given valuation, the current market environment is very similar to 2014-16 not only within the energy sector but financials and other areas of the market.\u201d \u201cIn 2016 there were many great opportunities for investors based on valuation and dividend yields. This environment is very reminiscent of that.\u201d \u201cI am as close to the markets now as when I am in the office.

It\u2019s cozy to say the least.\u201d Liquid ETFs David Prince, founder of Harbinger Capital Markets Inc.: \u201cWhen I am talking to the traders, I\u2019m focused on ETFs, it\u2019s because that\u2019s where the volume is and that\u2019s where the biggest volatility has been. But at least it\u2019s tradeable and those ETFs are primarily in the U.S. and that\u2019s what I have been recommending people invest.\u201d He pointed to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF as examples of liquid ETFs. He recommends Canadian investors continue buying U.S. dollars and luxury goods providers with global supply chains, such as Burberry Group Plc and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. The return of Chinese shoppers to glitzy malls and boutiques will help boost demand for these types of companies, he said. Energy stocks now have smaller weighting on the Canadian benchmark than they did four years ago, Prince said. If the slide falls below the 2016 level, \u201cit\u2019ll mean that defaults are accelerating in this country. And to me, that\u2019s the scary part,\u201d he said.

Investors largely responded to headlines about countermeasures for the outbreak including an infusion of liquidity from China and other central banks and a report about a potential vaccine to treat the virus, later refuted by The World Health Organization. \"Nonetheless the mood has improved quite substantially here this week again just on speculation that this is not going to evolve into a full-blown epidemic,\" said Candice Bangsund, portfolio manager for Fiera Capital. Armed with lots of cash on the sidelines, investors jumped back into the market after it was oversold last week, she said. \"So there just seems to be a renewed momentum in the market based on the more positive or optimistic mood,\" Bangsund said in an interview. The S&P/TSX composite index moved within points of the record high in intraday trading and gained 138.86 points to 17,651,59 in setting a record close. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 483.22 points at 29,290.85. The S&P 500 index was up 37.10 points to a record close of 3,334.69, while the Nasdaq composite was up 40.71 points at a record close of 9,508.68 after setting an intraday high. The Canadian dollar traded for 75.25 cents US compared with an average of 75.31 cents US on Tuesday. Energy was the big gainer on the day with eight of the 11 major sectors of the TSX moving higher. It gained 3.7 per cent with shares of Crescent Point Energy Corp. and Cenovus Energy Inc. climbing 7.9 and five per cent respectively. The increases came as crude oil prices rose above US$50 a barrel on a brighter outlook for Chinese demand and expectations that OPEC countries will agree to a larger cut of supply. The March crude contract was up US$1.14 at US$50.75 per barrel and the March natural gas contract was down 1.1 cents at US$1.86 per mmBTU. The increase in crude prices came despite a growth in weekly U.S. inventories. Materials was also higher with Teck Resources Ltd. up 5.1 per cent on higher metal prices. The April gold contract was up US$7.30 at US$1,562.80 an ounce and the March copper contract was up 3.25 cents at US$2.57 a pound. The heavyweight financials sector moved higher on rising bond yields and stronger economic data. In Canada, the merchandise trade deficit shrank to $370 million in December compared with $1.2 billion in November, as crude oil exports rose. Payroll processor ADP said that private U.S. companies added 291,000 jobs in January, a big increase from December and ahead of Friday's employment data. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of business activity by service sector companies increased in January, an indicator of continued steady expansion of the economy. Technology, health care and consumer staples were lower as Shopify Inc. was down 1.9 per cent while Aphria Inc. was 3.5 per cent lower."}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "Avoiding the stock market will likely hinder your retirement goals", "description": "Dale Jackson", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/avoiding-the-stock-market-will-likely-hinder-your-retirement-goals-1.1375648", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jan 17, 2020", "content": " News that stock markets are hitting new highs isn\u2019t news at all. They\u2019ve been hitting new highs for over a decade and before that they hit new highs. Over the long-term, they have always gone up.\u00a0 All those highs can be problematic for long-term investors adhering to the \u2018buy low, sell high\u2019 principle, and sitting on the sidelines waiting for the next big market correction. Keeping a large chunk of savings in cash or fixed income is not an option for most Canadians who want to retire comfortably. Cash generates close to zero returns over time and two per cent is a stretch for safe, fixed-income investments like bonds.\u00a0 Most retirement plans are based on an assumption that equity returns in the upper single digits will compound over time. That won\u2019t happen for investors waiting for the lows to be low enough. Being skittish about putting your retirement savings at risk is perfectly natural. Psychologists consider it a behavioural bias called loss aversion. Deep in the back of our minds, the pain of losing money is disproportionately stronger than the pleasure from gaining it, putting fear ahead of reason. A recent study on loss aversion by Sun Life Financial attempted to quantify this bias in terms of dollars, by asking people how much they would need to gain in relation to the amount they would risk losing. The study found most respondents would not risk losing $100 if the potential gain was only $100. More agreed to take the risk as the potential gain increased. It found most investors would only risk the $100 if the potential gain was doubled.\u00a0 Much of today\u2019s loss-aversion sentiment could be rooted in the global market meltdown of 2008, which can also serve as a worst-case scenario since it was the worst financial collapse since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In both cases, losses were devastating, but markets eventually recovered and investors who overcame their fear and held steady recouped their losses. Long-term charts of the benchmark S&P 500 and S&P/TSX composite index show steady gains in the decades before 2008. The S&P 500 lost half its value between October 2007 when the meltdown began and its March 2009 bottom. By October 2013, the S&P 500 topped its pre-meltdown high and has since doubled from there \u2013 as if the meltdown never even happened. The plunge was much quicker and the recovery much slower for the TSX, which lost nearly half its value between June 2008 and February 2009. It wasn\u2019t until June 2014 that the TSX topped its pre-meltdown high. It has since rallied an additional 20 per cent.   That\u2019s not to say the next big correction won\u2019t be tomorrow, but it\u2019s a fact of life that most of us need to invest to retire comfortably and getting there usually requires taking a leap of faith in the equity markets. As the mandatory investment industry disclaimer says: \u201cpast returns are not an indication of future performance.\u201d Investors cannot control the broader markets but there are hedging strategies that can help cushion the blows and outpace the highs, which are outlined below.

They meet again Friday. The group will decide whether to cut their oil production, pushing up prices. They are expected to prolong the cuts they've agreed on for the past three years. OPEC has already committed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day through March 2020. Some have speculated the group could agree to further trim production, floating another possible cut of 400,000 or 500,000 barrels per day, said Currie.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law two bills backing protesters in Hong Kong on Wednesday, prompting a warning from China that the move would undermine co-operation with Washington. The U.S. laws, which passed both chambers of Congress almost unanimously, mandate sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who carry out human rights abuses in Hong Kong, require an annual review of Hong Kong's favourable trade status and prohibit the export to Hong Kong police of certain non-lethal munitions. The former British colony, granted semi-autonomy when China took control in 1997, has been rocked by demonstrations for six months, some of which have turned violent. Some investors are concerned the dispute could thwart efforts to conclude the first phase of an agreement to end a protracted trade war between the world's two largest economies. Cieszynski said the negative reaction was mostly in Asia and Europe. That could change if China suddenly said it was furious and walking away from trade negotiations. \u201cOtherwise a lot of it is posturing,\u201d he said in an interview.

Energy rose marginally even though the January crude contract was down 21 cents at US$57.90 per barrel and the January natural gas contract was down two cents at US$2.48 per mmBTU. Friday's half-day trading session in the U.S. is also expected to be quiet, said Cieszynski. Trading Friday will conclude a positive month in which North American stock exchanges have set new record highs. The TSX is up 3.8 per cent in November while U.S. markets have climbed by 3.8 to five per cent, as of Wednesday's close. Cieszynski partially attributed the bullishness to investors responding positively to the Federal Reserve's decision to stop cutting interest rates because the economy doesn't need the extra stimulus. Although markets ended last year down, December is historically a good month. It could get off to a good start depending on next week's economic numbers. \u201cIf they're still decent I think we could see the markets just continue to move forward as they have been,\u201d he said. \u201cI think overall sentiment's a lot better this year than it was this time a year ago and so the fourth quarter this year has had a very different tone than last year and this year has been more in line with what we would call historical seasonality.\u201d"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "TSX reviewing CannTrust listing due to failure to file financial statements", "description": "VAUGHAN, Ont. -- Troubled cannabis company CannTrust Holdings Inc. says the Toronto Stock Exchange is reviewing the company's eligibility for continued listing on the exchange.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tsx-reviewing-canntrust-listing-due-to-failure-to-file-financial-statements-1.1354240", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Nov 27, 2019", "content": " VAUGHAN, Ont. -- Troubled cannabis company CannTrust Holdings Inc. says the Toronto Stock Exchange is reviewing the company's eligibility for continued listing on the exchange.

At the start of the century, the New York Stock Exchange employed about 5,000 traders to execute all orders. Today, the only finance professionals who work in the landmarked space also do double duty as extras for bell-ringing ceremonies and programming on CNBC, which leases some of the space. In reality, most of the action of the NYSE, by far the world\u2019s largest exchange measured by market value, happens at its\u00a0data center across the Hudson River, in Mahwah, N.J.

New York isn\u2019t the only city to decommission its trading floors; cities such as Manchester, Paris, and Vancouver have, too. After Nasdaq pioneered electronic trading in the 1970s, the so-called open outcry\u00a0on most exchanges gave way to nanosecond, electronic\u00a0flash trading, leaving professionals to rely on cables and speed rather than shouting within haloed neoclassical or Edwardian edifices. Hoteliers and developers around the world have begun using\u00a0these architectural showstoppers to draw in the masses to new hotels, museums, and gyms.\u00a0Owners aren\u2019t just adding a crown jewel to their portfolio, but expecting healthy\u00a0returns for going through the trouble of updating the historic structures, which typically come with outdated\u00a0plumbing and heating. \u201cFrom an investment perspective, introducing a new use to the exchange is a bold move\u00a0but a wise one,\u201d says Winston Zahra, chief executive officer of GG Hospitality, which opened the Stock Exchange Hotel this month in Manchester, U.K.\u00a0\u201cTrophy asset?

Though miles apart, each of these exchanges share a common thread. The designers and developers recasting them are abiding by capitalism\u2019s core tenant: leaving behind the vestiges of earlier eras to welcome something new. Here are six exchanges that are having second lives either as high-end hotels, soaring museums, or, in San Francisco, as an Equinox. Stock Exchange Hotel, Manchester Former Manchester United footballers Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs teamed up with Maltese hotelier Winston Zahra to restore this Edwardian edifice at a cost\u00a0of \u00a318 million (US$23 million). After five years of planning and renovation work, it opened as the Stock Exchange Hotel in November \u2014 feted with a modern-day dinner party that hardly resembled the building\u2019s inauguration in 1906 as a gentleman\u2019s-only, top-hats-and-tails establishment. Its 40 rooms are elegantly outfitted by the Turkish studio Autoban and feature writing desks topped with Italian marble, leather headboards, handcrafted sofas, and freestanding Victoria & Albert bathtubs set on heated tile flooring. English chef Tom Kerridge and executive chef Dan Scott have signed on to run the main restaurant and bar,\u00a0The Bull & Bear,\u00a0housed beneath the original dome ceiling of the former trading floor. On the menu are throwback martinis, pints on tap, and British classics such as scotch eggs, Yorkshire Pudding, and crispy pig\u2019s head.\u00a0Rooms from \u00a3200 ($258 USD) Bourse de Commerce, Paris The French are turning their 130-year-old commodities exchange, long forgotten by Parisians, into a contemporary art museum. After multiple delays, Paris will finally open the Bourse de Commerce in June, unveiling a completely transformed interior designed by Japanese Pritzker Prize laureate Tadao Ando. Ando was commissioned by French billionaire Fran\u00e7ois Pinault to create the space in part to house Pinault\u2019s extensive private art collection. \u201cBy nesting new spaces within it, while respecting the memories of the city engraved in its walls, I will transform the building\u2019s entire interior into a space for contemporary art,\u201d\u00a0says\u00a0Ando on the project\u2019s website. Until a few years ago, the site was occupied by a handful of fonctionnaires from the Chamber of Commerce, who\u2019ve since relocated to a less grandiose office as part of Pinault\u2019s deal with Paris\u00a0Mayor Anne Hidalgo to rehabilitate the space. Expanding the museum cost $170 million\u2014more than Pinault, a French art legend, spent on either the Palazzo Grassi or the Punta della Dogana in Venice\u2014with much of the budget going to a restoration of the facade. While details of the inaugural exhibition have yet to be announced, the showstoppers will surely be inside. Pinault\u2019s collection comprises some 5,000 works by artists including Cindy Sherman, Albert Oehlen, Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and Louise Bourgeois. Exchange Hotel, Vancouver The US$240-million makeover of the neo-Gothic Vancouver Stock Exchange (VSE) building at 475 Howe Street took three years\u2014a short time to shake its reputation as the \u201cscam capital of the world,\u201d as the exchange was dubbed by Forbes in 1989. The onetime market, which traded in barely regulated small-cap mining\u00a0and oil and gas exploration stocks, is now home to the Exchange Hotel. The classic renovation added 20 glass-walled stories with aluminum louvers to create a pinstripe effect,\u00a0and 202 contemporary rooms with herringbone hardwood floors and bull and bear bronze desk sculptures. In the lobby you\u2019ll find the original hexagon marble flooring and hand-painted ceilings. As for the infamous trading floor \u2014 it\u2019s now a brassy, classic cocktail bar called Open Outcry,\u00a0which slings sidecars and Sazeracs from tableside trolleys.\u00a0Rooms from $178 Bergen Bors Hotel, Norway Opened in 2017, the Bergen Bors Hotel is by all accounts the most fashionable hotel in Bergen, attracting a cosmopolitan crowd to the second-largest city in Norway. Housed in a Renaissance Revival building from 1862, the 127-room hotel occupies the upper floors of the old stock exchange building and has its own take on Scandinavian design, with minimalist furnishings and neutral color palettes. The feel is unquestionably modern, with\u00a0smart TVs and Nespresso coffee machines. But back in the day, this was a place for merchants to trade shares in each other\u2019s fishery, shipping, and oil companies. After the building became obsolete in the 1990s, it took 250 million Norwegian kroner (US$27 million) of private investment from a family-owned hotel group,\u00a0De Bergenske, to bring it back to life. \u201cYou have to develop these properties into more relevant businesses \u2014 and in Bergen, we have strong tourism,\u201d says CEO Kjetil Sm\u00f8r\u00e5s.\u00a0Rooms from NOK 1,540 ($169 USD) Equinox, San Francisco You may not be able to sleep there, but you can certainly break a sweat at the San Francisco Stock Exchange building\u00a0at 301 Pine Street \u2014 it\u2019s now an Equinox gym. The\u00a0fitness outpost was among the earliest of these conversions, dating to 2004. The renovation maintained the 1930s-era Moderne style exterior and Yule marble facade,\u00a0while swapping the brokers\u2019 old workstations for sleek ellipticals, tech-friendly spin bikes, a yoga studio, pilates studio, juice bar, and spa. For Equinox, the building\u2019s prime location in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District, known as North FiDi, is more important than its 124-year history of trading through the California gold rush and the Great Depression. Today\u00a0the gym offers \u201cconvenient access for corporate clientele,\u201d a company representative says. Once a capitalist\u2019s temple, always a capitalist\u2019s temple. 123 Greenwich Street, New York City The former American Stock Exchange building \u2014 aka the Amex,\u00a0once a rival of the NYSE \u2014 is now a real estate project titled 123 Greenwich Street. Headed by GHC Development, the US$65 million plan to repurpose the building was announced in January 2018 as a joint venture with Clarion Partners that comprises offices, retail space, and\u00a0by 2021,\u00a0a high-end boutique hotel. \u201cThis is a crown jewel property with a wow factor that cannot be replicated,\u201d says GHC\u2019s real estate developer Allan Fried. He\u2019s\u00a0seeking office tenants and a boutique hotel that\u2019s the right fit, offering about 174 rooms and an aesthetic \u201calong the lines of The Beekman,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to retain as much of a historic perspective as possible, keeping intact the landmarked limestone exterior. For instance, the trading floor has a 60 foot ceiling height. We\u2019re not bastardizing that. The beauty of such a space is not re-created today.\u201d Regardless of which brand signs on, the future hotel will be near all manner of attractions in Manhattan\u2019s financial district, including the One World Observatory at the World Trade Center, the 9/11 Memorial & Museum,\u00a0Nobu Downtown, and the shops at Brookfield Place. Developers also plan to host more retail events at 123 Greenwich Street similar to last January\u2019s \u201cVolez, Voguez, Voyagez\u201d exhibition for Louis Vuitton.

Canada\u2019s S&P/TSX Composite Index has returned 157 per cent, including dividends, since the end of 2008 as the economy chugged along, jobs creation surged and corporate profits rose. Despite hogging all the headlines, prices of residential property in Canada\u2019s most populous city trailed that with a 127 per cent\u00a0increase, according to the Teranet-National Bank Home Price Index. It\u2019s clear either of those investments have delivered a tidy return but there\u2019s one group of investors who have done exponentially better: those who bet on the equity version of real estate. The S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index has risen 354 per cent, dividends included, since the end of 2008 and the S&P/TSX Composite Real Estate Index, made up of real estate income trusts and other companies in the industry gained 262 per cent. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about things like actual maintenance and keeping the property lease up,\u201d said Jenny Ma, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cAnd also you get the diversification of many properties, across different markets and potentially across different asset types as well.\u201d Liquidity is also key. \u201cYou buy and sell REITs like you do any stock on the exchange rather than actually buying and selling properties themselves, which take a lot more time and also have a lot of transaction costs involved,\u201d Ma said.  Low Fees To be sure, investing in Canada\u2019s stock market has had its ups and downs with concerns surrounding global economic growth, the U.S.-China trade war and the boom (and bust) of commodity prices. So which investment is more risky? \u201cStocks likely have more short-term volatility than home prices, but home prices may be a bit more vulnerable to change in tastes, as well as prolonged periods of under-performance,\u201d said Douglas Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, adding real estate is clearly a less liquid market. Holding costs are much higher in the world of real estate when you add in property taxes, maintenance costs and other expenses. Meanwhile fees are being reduced or eliminated for many stock-market products. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s actually quite difficult to properly evaluate real estate returns to equity market returns. And, of course, even then, there\u2019s the issue that you can\u2019t live in your equity portfolio,\u201d Porter said. --With assistance from Erik Hertzberg, Shelly Hagan and Natalie Wong."}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": null, "title": "Branson ready for his biggest test yet as space shot beckons", "description": "Richard Branson plucks a dried grasshopper from a jar, takes a bite, and pronounces the insect surprisingly tasty before slurping down a vegan yogurt and offering to trial the concoction on Virgin Atlantic Airways flights.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/branson-ready-for-his-biggest-test-yet-as-space-shot-beckons-1.1338477", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 28, 2019", "content": " Richard Branson plucks a dried grasshopper from a jar, takes a bite, and pronounces the insect surprisingly tasty before slurping down a vegan yogurt and offering to trial the concoction on Virgin Atlantic Airways flights. The U.K. billionaire, a serial creator of companies spanning record labels to airlines to fizzy drinks and bridal gowns, is in his element. He\u2019s meeting with fellow entrepreneurs at a so-called \u201cPitch to Rich\u201d session in Israel, where the contest\u2019s winner gets a business-class flight to London for a week of hot-housing at Virgin\u2019s own innovation hub. The event in Tel Aviv speaks to the appetite for fresh ideas that still drives Britain\u2019s best-known businessman in his seventieth year. Branson\u2019s own contribution to human endeavour is about to enter a critical phase as Virgin Galactic, the prime focus of his attention for 15 years, prepares to launch the first tourists into space next year. Travelling straight from Israel to the U.S., Branson will ring the opening bell in the New York Stock Exchange on Monday as Virgin Galactic becomes the first space-launch company to go public. On a trip marking Virgin Atlantic\u2019s arrival in the Israeli market, the Englishman said he\u2019s trying to quell his mounting anticipation about the upcoming space voyage given previous delays, including a hiatus following a crash that killed two test pilots in 2014. Branson has pledged to personally be aboard the first public space shot. \u201cVirgin Galactic has been a difficult baby and it\u2019s gone through some tough teenage years, but we\u2019re now close to creating something very special,\u201d he said. \u201cThere need to be more test flights this year and I\u2019m trying not to get too carried away until a few months before the launch, but I\u2019m very excited.\u201d FIRED UP The spaceflight is just one of a series of planned milestones in a 12-month period that\u2019s set to define the Virgin Group\u2019s future. With his iconoclast approach intact even after five decades in the business of disruption, Branson also has big plans for his airline, a satellite launcher and a cruise-ship business he plans to introduce next year, among other projects. Boeing Co.\u2019s future-technologies arm has pledged US$20 million for a minority stake in Virgin Galactic, a business finding itself in increasingly hot competition for billionaire-funded space travel. Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin company plans to take payloads and tourists to the edge of space on an 11-minute flight, while Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX has also joined the race with a pledge in to send passengers to the moon, Mars and beyond. Rather than an IPO, Virgin Galactic is listing through a merger with a publicly traded investment vehicle, Social Capital Hedosophia. Its shares rose 11% Friday after the combination was completed. The new entity will be known as Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. and trade under the ticker SPCE. Galactic is interested in developing hypersonic airline flights that would slash global travel times. While the dream of linking London with Australia in just a few hours remains distant, its technology could be more readily adapted to link far-flung U.S. cities, Branson predicts. Branson speaks in glowing terms of 35-year-old Virgin Atlantic, the airline that took the brand from a quirky U.K. record label known for signing the Sex Pistols to a globally recognized force. INDIAN PLANS Among Branson\u2019s travel frontiers is India, where he will seek to crack the burgeoning travel market with a service to Mumbai that kicks off this month. A route to Sao Paulo will follow next year as the carrier steps up competition with arch-rival British Airways, emboldened by a partnership with Delta Air Lines Inc. In Delta, Virgin Atlantic now has an ally with shoulders broad enough to take on British Airways after years of often bitter competition -- and courtroom clashes -- with the larger carrier. That push could gain traction with an increase in flights following the opening next decade of a new runway at London\u2019s Heathrow airport. Branson says he\u2019s been buoyed by the hub\u2019s positive reaction to his calls for a shakeup to the slot-allocation systems to allow his airline to become a second U.K. flag carrier. He admits to a sadness surrounding the imminent reduction of his majority stake in Virgin Atlantic to a 20-per-cent\u00a0holding, saying he\u2019s taking the step reluctantly to safeguard the carrier\u2019s future in an industry increasingly dominated by a handful of airline groups linked by cross-shareholdings and cost and revenue sharing \u201cIt\u2019s not a deal that I particularly like doing because from talking to the staff they\u2019d quite like the airline to remain slightly more personal,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve promised them I\u2019m going to remain very involved.\u201d Next year will also see the launch of the new Virgin Voyages cruise line, with the first ship commencing sea trials in the Mediterranean before being based in Miami, with three more to follow. Branson is pitching the business at people who would normally hate such a holiday -- \u201clike me,\u201d he says -- and has asked managers to submit their own list of bugbears, headed by his own dislike of buffet dining, which he plans to eliminate. Also in the pipeline are Virgin Orbit\u2019s first full \u201cdrop and fire\u201d launch from the wing of a modified Boeing 747 in January as the satellite-deployment startup heads toward its commercial debut. PASSENGER PODS Then there\u2019s the opening of Virgin Hotels in four U.S. cities that will more than double the size of a business founded as a bet on real estate after the 2008 crash, followed by the construction of Virgin Hyperloop One\u2019s link between Mumbai and Pune, marking the world debut of technology that shoots passenger pods through a tube at near-supersonic speeds. Back in Tel Aviv, Branson regales his audience of Israeli startups with tales of how he became a one-man promotional campaign for the Virgin brand. They\u2019re familiar stories for many \u2014\u00a0death-defying stunts in hot-air balloons and yachts, getting arrested at Heathrow after painting a Virgin logo on the tail of a BA Concorde, crushing Coca-Cola cans in a Sherman tank in Times Square to promote Virgin Cola \u2014\u00a0but told with a renewed energy. One thing seems certain: The man with the broad smile and surfer-dude wavy mane isn\u2019t about to step back from the fray. \u201cI enjoy every minute of my life and the variety of what we do,\u201d he says. \u201cTrue, I sometimes glance in the mirror and wonder who the hell that is looking back. But I don\u2019t feel any older and I want carry on and use the experience that I have.\u201d"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Olga Kharif", "title": "Bakkt plans first regulated options contracts on Bitcoin futures", "description": "Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, is doubling down on cryptocurrency derivatives with a plan to offer options on its Bitcoin futures contracts.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bakkt-plans-first-regulated-options-contracts-on-bitcoin-futures-1.1336997", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 24, 2019", "content": " Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, is doubling down on cryptocurrency derivatives with a plan to offer options on its Bitcoin futures contracts.

LSE shares, which traded below HKEX\u2019s 8,361-pence offer since it was announced Sept. 11, dropped as much as 6.5 per cent\u00a0in London morning trading. The decision is a\u00a0rare setback\u00a0for HKEX Chief Executive Officer Charles Li, who saw London at the\u00a0center of trading\u00a0between Eastern and Western markets. The withdrawal leaves LSE free to pursue its US$27 billion takeover of Refinitiv, taking the 300-year-old bourse further away from a traditional exchange model and deeper into big data. Li said Tuesday that the \u201cvision for the business looking forward is to build upon the role we already play in Hong Kong, China, Asia and more widely.\u201d A spokeswoman for LSE declined to comment. Before Tuesday\u2019s about-face, the region\u2019s largest exchange by revenue struggled to regain momentum after last month\u2019s stinging\u00a0rebuke\u00a0from LSE\u2019s board. HKEX executives met LSE shareholders in London and New York to try to gain their backing for the takeover plan. The bourse also\u00a0was in talks to borrow\u00a0as much as 8 billion pounds to fund the purchase. While the HKEX\u2019s board continues to see a combination as \u201cstrategically compelling,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cdisappointed that it has been unable to engage with the management of LSEG in realizing this vision, and as a consequence has decided it is not in the best interests of HKEX shareholders to pursue this proposal,\u201d the exchange said in a\u00a0filing\u00a0on Tuesday. With the takeover offer pulled, \u201cHKEX should resume its focus on strategic initiatives linking mainland China\u2019s capital markets with Hong Kong,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sharnie Wong said in a research report Tuesday morning. Li\u2019s LSE counterpart, David Schwimmer, has said he preferred direct access to China and didn\u2019t need the former British colony as a conduit. LSE last month\u00a0rejected\u00a0HKEX\u2019s initial takeover proposal, citing complications ranging from political unrest in Hong Kong to potential problems with regulators. HKEX countered with a charm offensive, bringing in UBS Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc to try to persuade shareholders of the merits of its proposal, Bloomberg\u00a0reported. \u201cThe whole offer was a farce,\u201d Christopher Cheung, a Hong Kong lawmaker and HKEX shareholder, said in phone interview. \u201cWhen HKEX announced the offer, I thought they\u2019ve already had discussions with London Stock Exchange and their regulators. It turns out they have not. HKEX now must address the danger of stagnant business growth.\u201d Exchange companies have tried and failed to combine in recent years, as political, regulatory and economic considerations have foiled the efforts. LSE\u2019s attempted merger with Germany\u2019s Deutsche Boerse AG was ultimately abandoned, and Singapore Exchange Ltd.\u2019s bid for ASX Ltd. was rejected by Australian regulators in 2011 because of national interest concerns. Consolidation Predicted Despite the fumbles, analysts and observers have long predicted that the global exchange sector will consolidate.

As has repeatedly happened in U.S. stocks, a few days of losses just undid weeks and months of progress, depositing the S&P 500 at an all-too-familiar level. Frustrated traders were left to lament that it has taken the better part of two years for the index to advance all of 15 points. \u201cI\u2019m looking at this thing and my god, it\u2019s like a Tour de France kind of bike ride,\u201d Marvin Loh, global macro strategist at State Street, said by phone. \u201cMassive climbs and great descents -- except these are horrible descents. And then we climb up to the next peak and then we get to ride it down.\u201d Trump loves touting equity gains more than his predecessors, who were usually wary of taking credit for unpredictable returns largely out of anyone\u2019s control. And while the president\u2019s record remains a solid one by historical standards, with the S&P 500 up almost 43 per cent including dividends since his election victory, on a price basis it\u2019s the same return he could\u2019ve claimed in January 2018. Amid uneven economic data and a two-year trade war, the market hasn\u2019t budged since. For investors watching day-to-day swings, two years of inertia have been anything but boring. February 2018\u2019s convulsions in volatility markets were followed eight months later by the bull market\u2019s nearest-to-death experience in seven years. The Federal Reserve has done a complete 180, cutting interest rates twice after a series of hikes. Now deteriorating economic data, including the worst manufacturing report in a decade, is reviving recession fears. The president doesn\u2019t see it that way. In another torrent of tweets Wednesday morning, he said Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is the reason stocks are falling. A day earlier, he blamed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell after equities got rocked by a weak factory report.  Politics aside, a more pressing concern for investors this week has been economic data that hints of a recession. Carmakers sank Wednesday after quarterly sales reports from Ford and General Motors added to concern over thinning profit margins in the industry. Ten of 11 S&P 500 sectors fell at least one per cent after a private payrolls report showed slowing growth one day after the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s factory index slipped to 47.8 in September, the lowest level since 2009. Of course, recession fear is nothing new, and as high as anxiety levels have occasionally gotten among investors, it\u2019s been matched by the market\u2019s resilience. After a vicious August in which the S&P 500 plunged more than 2.5\u00a0per cent three separate times and rallied one per cent\u00a0or more seven, the index vaulted within points of a record in September. As things stand now, it\u2019s been 614 days since the S&P 500 surged to a high of 2,872 in January 2018. In that period, the benchmark has hit 18 fresh records, suffered through a correction, a near 20\u00a0per cent loss, and two more declines of 6% this year. After Wednesday capped the first back-to-back declines of one\u00a0per cent this year, the index is roughly where it stood after Trump\u2019s tax overhaul sent stocks soaring. But what tax cuts gave by way of optimistic forecasts, Trump\u2019s trade war has taken away. Persistent uncertainty has led companies to cut back on investment spending, while confidence has faltered. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s all Trump, because you can blame trade and tariffs on Trump,\u201d said Susan Schmidt, head of U.S. equities at Aviva Investors. \u201cIt\u2019s noise that\u2019s cascading out of actions from the administration. We have stalled out because we need another tailwind and nothing is there. If anything, the headwinds are keeping the market from moving up.\u201d But while equity markets have stood still, bond yields have plunged. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields stand more than 100 basis points lower than where they were when the S&P 500 hit a record in January 2018. That\u2019s pushed equity investors into so-called bond proxies, with utilities and real estate stocks each up more than 20% in the same 21-month period that the S&P 500 has gone nowhere. To Andrew Lapthorne, global head of quantitative strategy at Societe Generale, the move is ill-advised, as investors are lulled into a false sense of safety. \u201cMany argue that low bond yields justify higher stock valuations, but in a bear market ALL stocks tend to lose money,\u201d Lapthorne wrote in a note to clients this week. \u201cInvestors are playing a game of chicken: hoping lower bond yields do not lead to a recession, but equally that the global economy remains sufficiently moribund to not cause bond yields to rise.\u201d Kim Forrest, the chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Management in Pittsburgh, agrees, and says it\u2019s encouraging that stocks have been stagnant. Amid trade concerns, impeachment proceedings and slowing growth, it\u2019s quite a feat that the S&P 500 is still up 15\u00a0per cent year-to-date, she says. It could be worse, but that doesn\u2019t mean investors should run for cover. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with investors that they actually say, \u2018I\u2019m going into cash or I\u2019m buying all utilities?\u2019 You think that\u2019s going to save you?

Yet, expectations for the rest of the year are nowhere as rosy as the rally seen in the first quarter. The S&P/TSX Composite Index will sign off 2019 at 16,940, according to the average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg. While that\u2019s 18 per cent above its 2018 close, it\u2019s a mere 1.7 per cent gain from the end of September. The market\u2019s wall of worry has only gotten higher. It could be last year\u2019s fourth-quarter sell-off that\u2019s prompting investor anxiety about a possible rehash this time around. May be it\u2019s the lingering U.S.-China trade war that has investors worried. Or political turmoil across the world.  Expectations that the Fed would cut rates had investors anticipating narrower interest margins from banks in the U.S. and Canada, and that sent their stocks lower, said Laura Lau, senior portfolio manager at Brompton Corp. Financials make up nearly 33 per cent of Canada\u2019s benchmark. Oil stocks, which account for more than 10 per cent of the gauge, have also been the pariahs of the market. After climbing more than 12 per cent at the start of the year, Canada\u2019s benchmark stock gauge gained less than 2 per cent in each of the two subsequent quarters. That\u2019s still the longest quarterly rally since March 2017. \u201cSeptember was an important inflection point for the TSX,\u201d said Tina Normann, technical research analyst at Eight Capital. \u201cThe composite broke out to new highs driven by financials. This coincided with the Canadian 10-year yield stabilizing along with most global yields,\u201d she said. Still, signs of fatigue were visible at the peak of benchmark\u2019s ascent. At its Sept. 20 high, the S&P/TSX Composite flirted with the overbought level and quickly slipped back down, snapping a four-week winning streak. In the U.S., traders are bracing for a big shock as downside options that expire within the next month become expensive. After suffering from a volatile third quarter, caution prevails ahead of more U.S.-China trade talks next week, the upcoming profit reporting reason, federal elections where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is fighting for his political life and Bank of Canada\u2019s monetary policy decision. These events are slated for October alone. The sight of an inverting U.S. Treasury yield curve and President Donald Trump\u2019s relentless tweets about trade relations with China has put a shine on defensive and value stocks. Utilities, real estate and financials were among the top gainers in the third quarter and in September: \u201cOne thing is clear, we\u2019re definitely not going to be seeing interest rate hikes any time soon,\u201d John Goldsmith, head of Canadian equities at Montrusco Bolton said on BNN Bloomberg on Tuesday. \u201cThat definitely puts the onus on what\u2019s considered to be defensive sectors.\u201d Earnings season will be key to monitor the effects of slowing global growth and any spillover effects of the 18-month-old trade war. While profit estimates for companies listed on the Canadian benchmark have grown, the U.S. paints a different picture as CFOs have preemptively cut their forecasts at a rate not seen in three years. \u201cFour quarters of decelerating earnings may have reached a bottoming point primarily due to low interest rates and easier comparisons,\u201d Normann said. \u201cThis creates a path for stronger earnings growth in 2020.\u201d --With assistance from Aury Cifuentes \u00a0"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Caitlin Webber", "title": "Trump warns of market crash in flurry of anti-impeachment tweets", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump predicted sinking stocks and a reversal of economic gains if House Democrats'\u00a0impeachment inquiry proceeds.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/trump-warns-of-market-crash-in-flurry-of-anti-impeachment-tweets-1.1322333", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Sep 26, 2019", "content": " U.S. President Donald Trump predicted sinking stocks and a reversal of economic gains if House Democrats'\u00a0impeachment inquiry proceeds. \u201cIf they actually did this the markets would crash,\u201d Trump said in a tweet Thursday morning that cites stock session lows after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment inquiry was announced Tuesday.

The transformational deal promises to create global scale and growth in fast-growing markets such as Asia, Schwimmer said on a media call. It will also make Refinitiv\u2019s owners, including Blackstone Group Inc., some of the biggest LSE shareholders with a combined 37 per cent stake. Yet, it comes with risks: The firm will take on a US$13.5 billion bridge loan to cover Refinitiv\u2019s debts, which would lead to leverage above targets in the short term. LSE also raised the possibility of asset sales to meet worldwide regulatory approval, a process that could take over a year. The U.K.\u2019s\u00a0potential hard Brexit\u00a0in October could create further antitrust headwinds. The transaction is expected to complete in the second half of 2020, according to a statement on Thursday, although the deal allows for the process to extend to 31 May, 2021. \u201cData capabilities will define the success of financial market infrastructure business in the future as our customers to seek to create value through unique insight and analysis and operate businesses in the most efficient technology enabled way,\u201d said Schwimmer on the call. The plan will need regulatory approval in multiple countries, Schwimmer said, adding there were \u201cno plans or intentions around divestiture.\u201d The LSE said in a statement it might be required to make divestments, which could be material. Refinitiv will get a break fee of 198.3 million pounds if clearances are not obtained. The purchase marks the first major move by Schwimmer, who joined the 300-year-old bourse from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. a year ago and has been riding a 30 per cent surge in the stock price from his first day through July 26, when news of the discussions broke. Until recently, he had made some strategic but low-key acquisitions, such as increasing the exchange\u2019s stake in clearing business LCH Group Holdings Ltd. Refinitiv serves over 40,000 institutions in 190 countries including buy and sell-side firms, governments and corporations. Its trading venues include a stake in the recently listed Tradeweb and the FXAll and Matching platforms, with average daily trading volume of over US$400 billion in currencies and US$500 billion in fixed income. Schwimmer said he expects Tradeweb to keep its listing following the deal. Refinitiv\u2019s products also include the Eikon terminal and the trading-execution system Redi. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with Refinitiv to provide financial news, data and information. LSE said the deal is expected to produce 350 million pounds (US$424 million) in annual savings within five years. CFO David Warren said there were overlaps in technology, property and corporate functions, with some job cuts possible, although he declined to give more detail. Refinitiv has 19,000 staff while LSE has about 4,500. Blackstone, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and GIC, Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, acquired 55 per cent of Refinitiv -- as the former financial and risk unit of Thomson Reuters was renamed -- in a transaction last year that valued the business at US$20 billion. These shareholders will be entitled to nominate three board members, as long as they hold at least 25 per cent of the enlarged firm. They are committed to holding their stock for at least two years. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says \u201cLondon Stock Exchange\u2019s US$27 billion bid for Refinitiv likely faces rigorous scrutiny in Europe, but antitrust concerns may be small compared with the size of the deal, in our view.

The S&P 500 index was down 7.79 points at 3,013.18, while the Nasdaq composite was down 19.71 points at 8,273.61. Nine of the 11 major sectors of the TSX were lower, led by consumer discretionary and telecommunication sectors, along with the heavyweight financials sector.

The September crude contract was up US$1.18 at US$58.05 per barrel and the September natural gas contract was up 3.1 cents at US$2.14 per mmBTU. Crude rose on expectations that Wednesday's U.S. stockpile report will show sharp declines in inventories. Materials was also higher as shares of Canadian fertilizer giant Nutrien Ltd. jumped 7.1 per cent after it posted strong second-quarter results despite what it called the \"worst U.S. planting season in history.\" In addition, gold prices rose on anticipation that the U.S. central bank would cut interest rates for the first time since 2008. The December gold contract was up $8.50 at US$1,441.80 an ounce and the September copper contract was down 3.9 cents at US$2.68 a pound. Markets are anticipating that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 0.25 per cent on Wednesday, followed by three more cuts through the end of 2020. Bangsund is more hawkish, anticipating that the central bank will disappoint markets by cutting just once. Consumer confidence numbers released Wednesday were stronger than expected, further tempering Fed chairman Jerome Powell's need to aggressively cut rates because of a weakening economy, she said. \"Our expectation is that he signals an openness to lowering rates further but maintains some flexibility, essentially allowing for the Fed to monitor the economy and the geopolitical as well as the trade backdrop before making their next move,\" she said in an interview. \"It could be a case of the Fed not being able to meet the market's very hopeful expectation for multiple rate cuts.\" Bangsund said there's a lot of nervousness among investors about the direction of monetary policy and trade talks. \"If it wasn't for the fact that global trade was weighing on the global economy, the Fed would not be cutting rates tomorrow.\" \u00a0"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Brian Chappatta", "title": "Central banks are creating a horde of zombie investors", "description": "Ruchir Sharma,\u00a0chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, wrote a provocative op-ed in the New York Times last weekend.

I would add that central bankers\u00a0are creating a horde of zombie investors as well. By now, bond markets have adjusted to\u00a0the unabashedly dovish shift from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. In the U.S., benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell below 2 per cent\u00a0for the first time since Donald Trump was elected president, and some Wall Street strategists expect it\u2019ll reach a record low around this time in 2020. Across the Atlantic, 10-year German bund yields plumbed new lows of negative\u00a00.33 per cent, French 10-year yields hit zero\u00a0for the first time, and the entire yield curve in Denmark was on the cusp of turning negative. With\u00a0any sort of risk-free yield largely zapped worldwide on the prospect of further monetary easing, is it any surprise what happened next? Investors turned to the tried-and-true playbook of grabbing anything risky. No matter that the global recovery has lasted nearly a decade, trade concerns abound\u00a0and central banks see economic weakness\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the S&P 500 Index promptly rose to a record high as investors mindlessly plowed in. And in a more specific example highlighted by my Bloomberg Opinion colleagues Marcus Ashworth\u00a0and\u00a0Elisa Martinuzzi, bond buyers were all-too-eager to snap up subordinated Greek bank debt from\u00a0Piraeus Bank SA, which tapped\u00a0European capital markets for the first time since the financial crisis. \u201cThe offer would have been unthinkable a year ago,\u201d they wrote. Are these really the characteristics of\u00a0healthy\u00a0financial markets? It hardly seems ideal that individual investors, pensions and insurers are effectively forced into owning lower-rated bonds, equities or even alternative assets like timber\u00a0to meet their return targets. In fact, that sounds like the textbook definition of a bubble. But as\u00a0Sharma points out, permanently easy policy aims to create an environment in which those bubbles can\u2019t pop. \u201cGovernment stimulus programs were conceived as a way to revive economies in recession, not to keep growth alive indefinitely. A world without recessions may sound like progress, but recessions can be like forest fires, purging the economy of dead brush so that new shoots can grow. Lately, the cycle of regeneration has been suspended, as governments douse the first flicker of a coming recession with buckets of easy money and new spending. Now experiments in permanent stimulus are sapping the process of creative destruction at the heart of any capitalist system and breeding oversize zombies faster than start-ups. To assume that central banks can hold the next recession at bay indefinitely represents a dangerous complacency.\u201d  Time and again, market watchers will warn that the credit cycle is on the verge of turning.\u00a0\u201cThe future looks pretty bleak,\u201d\u00a0Bob Michele,\u00a0JPMorgan Asset Management\u2019s\u00a0head of global fixed income, said this week as he advocated selling into high-yield rallies.\u00a0\u201cWe have probably the riskiest credit market that we have ever had,\u201d Scott Mather, chief investment officer of U.S. core strategies at Pacific Investment Management Co., said last month.\u00a0Morningstar Inc. just suspended\u00a0its rating on a fund owned by French bank\u00a0Natixis SA because of concerns about\u00a0the \u201cliquidity and appropriateness\u201d of some corporate bond holdings, adding to jitters about a broader liquidity mismatch in the money-management industry. It\u2019s hard to take this fretting too seriously when central banks persistently come to the rescue. What\u2019s more, in many ways it\u2019s in the best interest of all involved not to get too worked up about those risks. U.S. households and nonprofits had a combined net worth of US$109 trillion in the first quarter of 2019, a record, according to Fed data. Dig a bit deeper, and it\u2019s clear that a surge in the value of their equity holdings plays a crucial role. They directly owned US$17.5 trillion of stocks, which represents 110% of their disposable personal income. That ratio reached\u00a0120 per cent\u00a0in the third quarter of 2018, very nearly topping the all-time high of 121.2 per cent\u00a0set just before the dot-com crash. Add in \u201cindirectly held\u201d stocks,\u00a0and individuals look as exposed to equities as ever. At US$12.3 trillion, those holdings were worth 78.6 per cent\u00a0of DPI in the third quarter, compared with 69.5 per cent\u00a0at the dot-com peak. To put it more plainly, since the start of the economic recovery in mid-2009, their total assets\u00a0have increased by almost 70 per cent. Financial assets(1) have appreciated 76 per cent. Stock holdings have soared by more than 140 per cent. Effectively, the sharp rally in equities has turbocharged a resurgence in the overall wealth of Americans. The prospect of losing those gains is almost too painful to think about. Perhaps that\u2019s why, as DoubleLine Capital\u2019s Jeffrey Gundlach pointed out in January, investors\u00a0were \u201cpanicking into stocks, not out of stocks\u201d during the late-2018 sell-off. \u201cPeople have been so programmed\u201d to buy the dip, he said, that it reminded him a bit of how the financial crisis developed. Call investors programmed; call them zombies \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s the same thing. The Fed, for its part, argues that it\u2019s doing good by sustaining the expansion. Notably, Powell said the economic recovery is starting to reach\u00a0segments of the U.S. population that had been largely left out thus far\u00a0\u2014\u00a0communities that \u201chaven\u2019t had a bull market\u201d and \u201chaven\u2019t had just a booming economy.\u201d\u00a0Overall, he said officials don\u2019t see\u00a0signals that the U.S. is at maximum employment.\u00a0Morgan Stanley\u2019s Sharma argues wage growth is sluggish because bigger companies have more power to suppress worker pay, given that they crowd out (or acquire) startups and other competition. There are no easy answers to these large-scale problems. That includes central banks simply lowering interest rates or purchasing more government bonds. Powell said as much, noting\u00a0\u201cwe have the tools we have.\u201d But at least he has some room to maneuver toward a soft landing.\u00a0The ECB, which has pushed yields on some corporate bonds in the region below zero, and the Bank of Japan, which owns large swaths of local exchange-traded funds, have done virtually no tightening and may soon need to ease even further. The most troubling part of this heavy-handed\u00a0approach among central banks is that it eliminates the option for investors to earn any sort of return above inflation on safe assets. This delicate balance seems as if it can only last\u00a0as long as business and consumer sentiment allows.\u00a0It has been more than a decade since the Fed last cut interest rates, and during that period, it paid handsomely to be a zombie investor\u00a0throwing money at the S&P 500. With the next easing cycle upon us, much is riding on the status quo prevailing.

Treasury 10-year yields fell to 1.97 per cent\u00a0Thursday, the lowest since 2016, while markets are pricing in more than 25 basis points of easing at the Fed\u2019s July meeting. The Dollar Index has tumbled 1.1 per cent\u00a0in June, heading for the biggest monthly loss this year. The 200-day moving average was at 96.633 on Friday. \u201cIt is hard to imagine global central banks out-easing the Fed in the coming months since everyone has run out of ammo with negative rates, compared to the Fed that has a nice cushion,\u201d Upadhyaya said Thursday by email. \u201cThis marks the green light for the start of the USD bear market.\u201d The bearish outlook marks a slight shift for Upadhyaya, who before the latest Fed meeting said a depreciation in the dollar could take months to materialize. He\u2019s still keeping the door open for a slow move. \u201cIf the data remains sound and if there are signs of an impending deal\u201d between the U.S. and China, the Fed could \u201chold its fire,\u201d Upadhyaya said. \u201cWhile it looks like a rate cut in July is a done deal, the door is not entirely closed for a pass at the July meeting.\u201d Despite the potential for Fed cuts, there are still plenty of factors on the greenback\u2019s side. Treasury yields remain relatively high compared with other developed markets, with the world\u2019s stockpile of negative-yielding bonds topping US$13 trillion. Uncertainty about global economic growth may fuel haven demand for the dollar as investors question whether rate cuts will provide the desired boost. With a number of Fed policy makers scheduled to speak in the next week, there\u2019s a risk they could dial back the dovish rhetoric. Still, Fed watchers generally view a rate cut in July as most likely. Almost half of policy makers in the Federal Open Market Committee indicated Wednesday they are leaning toward a cut by year-end. Wall Street\u2019s sell side is also jumping on board. Lower interest rates will gradually eat into the advantage the dollar gets from higher yields, said Zach Pandl, head of global foreign-exchange strategy at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

From Alan Greenspan through Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve has cut a dozen times with equities within 2 per cent\u00a0of a record: June 1989, July 1989, July 1990, March 1991, August 1991, October 1991, November 1991, September 1992, July 1995, December 1995, January 1996 and October 2007. Dotted lines on the above chart denote occasions when the S&P 500 was less than 2 per cent\u00a0from a record, while solid lines indicate that stocks closed at a record the day of the reduction.  One explanation for the Fed\u2019s repeated decision to ease monetary policy with markets in relatively good shape is that economic conditions don\u2019t always jibe with stocks -- at least not at the start of the last six easing cycles. This speaks to the discretion central bankers have in acting and responding to perceived changes in the outlook for the world\u2019s largest economy. In fact, their framework tells them they have to be forward-looking, since monetary policy has a delayed and variable effect. This means that a worsening outlook -- whether it\u2019s due to temporary issues like trade or more long-term concerns like persistently slow inflation -- could be sufficient reason to ease monetary policy. There\u2019s almost somewhat of a circular reasoning at play: equities are resilient in part because investors have priced in Fed easing, and investors expect the Fed to ease because they believe stocks will fall if they don\u2019t. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi added a global dynamic to this conundrum on Tuesday by indicating that he was prepared to take policy rates even further below zero. The overnight rally extended when U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that he would be meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit at the end of this month."}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani", "title": "\u2018Devil in the details\u2019 as Feds launch stock options tax review: Money manager", "description": "The federal government is officially launching consultations on its plan to change the way stock options are taxed, but one Bay Street money manager is warning the Liberals to tread carefully to ensure start-ups aren\u2019t punished in the process.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/devil-in-the-details-as-feds-launch-stock-options-tax-review-money-manager-1.1274836", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jun 18, 2019", "content": " The federal government is officially launching consultations on its plan to change the way stock options are taxed, but one Bay Street money manager is warning the Liberals to tread carefully to ensure start-ups aren\u2019t punished in the process.

Gains above $200,000 will be taxed as income. Kash Pashootan, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at First Avenue Investment Counsel, said on Tuesday that he sees logic behind the government\u2019s move to crack down on what can be seen as tax deferrals, but added that he hopes lawmakers consider what needs to remain in place. \u201cReally, the devil is going to be in the details,\u201d Pashootan told BNN Bloomberg in an interview.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re talking about start-ups being exempt from that, and that\u2019s a key part of this, because certainly start-ups don\u2019t have the same capital and same balance sheets\u00a0necessarily as a large, established [companies].\u201d Presently, any profits from stock options are taxed as a capital gain, which means half of the amount can be considered tax free, while the other half is taxed as income. The Department of Finance said in a press release on Monday that options granted by Canadian-controlled private corporations, and certain qualifying start-ups will be exempted from the new limit on stock options. \u201cThe public policy rationale for preferential tax treatment of employee stock options is to help smaller, growing companies such as start-ups\u2014that do not have significant profits and may have challenges with cash flow\u2014attract and retain talent,\u201d the department said, adding it is looking for input on what should be considered \u201cstart-ups, emerging or scale-up companies.\u201d The proposed changes were first announced in March as part of the federal budget. The Department of Finance said that the new rules will apply to stock options granted on or after January 1, 2020. Pashootan said that as long as the government\u2019s tax change is well thought out and is not an \u201coverriding blanket rule,\u201d it would be justified. \u201cI think [the government\u2019s] efforts will be well received, reasonable and understood by the market,\u201d Pashootan said. \u201cI think stock options are an effective tool if used responsibly like many things in the world of finance.\u201d"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Adam Haigh", "title": "Bitcoin climbs above US$9,000 as Facebook reports buoy sentiment", "description": "Bitcoin climbed past US$9,000, to its highest since May 2018, as reports that Facebook Inc. is\u00a0due to unveil\u00a0a digital currency added to optimism that cryptocurrencies are becoming more widely adopted by mainstream finance.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bitcoin-climbs-above-us-9-000-as-facebook-reports-buoy-sentiment-1.1273946", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jun 16, 2019", "content": " Bitcoin climbed past US$9,000, to its highest since May 2018, as reports that Facebook Inc. is\u00a0due to unveil\u00a0a digital currency added to optimism that cryptocurrencies are becoming more widely adopted by mainstream finance.

Litecoin, which has gained more than 360 per cent\u00a0since the beginning of the year, is outpacing all its crypto peers, including Ether and XRP, as well as the best-known and largest token Bitcoin. It has a market cap of about US$8.4 billion, making it the seventh-largest digital asset, according to data compiled by Mosaic Research Ltd. The rally can partly be attributed to Litecoin\u2019s upcoming halving (also known as halvening), whereby the number of coins awarded to so-called miners is slashed by 50 per cent. The idea is that a cut in supply will not only drive up its price but will also prevent an erosion of value. Miners currently receive 25 new Litecoins per block, but following the halving -- which is expected to fall on Aug. 6 -- they will receive 12.5. Halving typically happens roughly every four years and the run-up to it has, in the past, coincided with a rally in the underlying tokens. Four years ago, when the last Litecoin halving occurred, the coin gained about 60 per cent\u00a0in the three months beforehand, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. And the phenomenon isn\u2019t isolated to Litecoin, either -- Bitcoin is set to undergo its next halving in May 2020 and its biggest proponents are already seizing on the drop in supply as a catalyst for further gains. \u201cEvery time we\u2019ve seen a halving event in Bitcoin or Litecoin, the price has risen astronomically,\u201d said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at trading platform eToro, in a phone interview. \u201cSo if that pattern continues, what we\u2019ve seen so far is small potatoes in comparison,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is quite normal for the crypto market.\u201d Cryptocurrencies are undergoing a renaissance this year on the back of wider acceptance from mainstream institutions and increased attention from Wall Street. E*Trade Financial Corp. is said to be readying cryptocurrency trades on its platform, as is Fidelity Investments. AT&T Inc. now lets customers pay their bills using digital tokens, the first U.S. carrier to do so. And among the most anticipated developments is an upcoming announcement from Facebook Inc., which is reportedly set to release more details on the basics of its own digital token.  These developments, among others, have pushed up the price of Bitcoin by 120 per cent\u00a0since the beginning of the year. Ether, too, has gained close to 100 per cent. Litecoin, which was trading below US$30 at the end of last year is now worth US$133. The elements behind the rally \u201care justifiable and real and factual,\u201d said David Tawil, president of crypto hedge fund ProChain Capital. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question by how much does it gain?,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it reasonable to think that this halving, this catalyst, should allow the Litecoin to reach its previous highs? I think so. I think it could.\u201d But the recent resurgence in digital assets is masking an unwelcome reality: relatively few are using Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, for anything other than speculation. Merchant transactions account for only about 1.3 per cent\u00a0of economic activity, according to data from Chainalysis Inc., a number that\u2019s stayed little changed even over the boom and bust cycles of the prior two years. Huge upswings or downswings in prices from day to day -- which isn\u2019t uncommon in the crypto world -- make it difficult to utilize for things like bill paying or even to purchase a cup of coffee. After peaking in January 2018, Litecoin transactions are down dramatically, falling about 84 per cent\u00a0since the peak. They are up since the beginning of this year, however. And transaction fees in Litecoin have been unpredictable, jumping 10-fold in late May before dropping again, according to BitInfoCharts.com. Such volatility can make developers hesitate to create apps for this blockchain, as a jump in fees can impact usage. Litecoin \u201conly thrives if Bitcoin is valuable,\u201d said Aaron Brown, an investor who writes for Bloomberg Opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s an established, convenient transaction currency well suited to a world in which Bitcoin is the store of value. I don\u2019t think it has much value in a world in which Bitcoin prices are low.\u201d Litecoin\u2019s founder, Charlie Lee, cashed out of all of his holdings at the height of the digital asset bubble in 2017 when the token was trading for about US$375. It was a prescient decision -- Litecoin lost almost 90 per cent\u00a0of its value the following year. Lee, who founded the coin in 2011, said at the time that he sold or donated all of his holdings and that the liquidation was aimed at preventing a \u201cconflict of interest.\u201d Critics accused Lee of recognizing the frenzy around digital assets and cashing out ahead of a severe decline. Lee told Bloomberg News at the time that he was turning his focus to increasing use by merchants. Representatives for Litecoin didn\u2019t comment. But now, with 53 days to go, Litecoin fans will continue to count down until the halving. \u201cIt\u2019s a good potential trading opportunity,\u201d said Tawil. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s important in the broader fundamental development of crypto.

That makes Lyft the \u201cmost expensive to borrow\u201d U.S. stock with more than US$5 million in balances, Markit\u2019s director of securities finance Samuel Pierson said in an emailed statement. In the overnight settlement reports, 6.61 million shares were reported as on-loan, for a market value of US$455 million, according to Markit data.

Earlier this year, the price for shorting the cannabis company Tilray Inc. shot through the roof, with the borrowing cost soaring as high as 900 per cent. Since then, Tilray shares have fallen 20 per cent, even though the stock is up nearly 275 per cent from its July 2018 IPO level.

Under the current rules, employee stock option benefits are taxed at half the normal rate of personal income -- the same rate as capital gains. The plan announced in the federal budget Tuesday will put a $200,000 annual cap on the stock-option grants that get the preferential treatment, but only for employees of large firms. Start-ups and rapidly growing businesses, which typically can't pay big salaries, are excluded from the cap so they can continue to attract and reward employees. \"We will take action to limit the benefit of the stock option deduction for executives of large, long-established corporations -- while ensuring that everyday employees aren't affected, and that start-ups and emerging Canadian businesses can continue to grow, attract talent, and create more good jobs,\" Finance Minister Bill Morneau said. The rationale for preferential tax treatment of employee stock options is to support younger and growing businesses, the government says, noting that it does not believe the options should be used to reward executives of large, mature companies, only because they come with favourable tax treatment. However, Ben Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, which represents the fast-growing tech sector, said it would \"imprudent\" to categorize any Canadian technology company as \"mature\" for the purposes of stock option tax treatment. \"The proposed rules could lead to no Canadian headquartered large technology companies, which would have anegative impact on our prosperity and competitiveness for decades to come,\" Bergen said. \"Our members are anxious to ensure these changes do not hinder a high-growth company's ability to access and retain skilled talent and Canada's long-term economic prosperity.\" Further details of the plan are expected to be released in the summer. Bruce Ball, vice-president for taxation at the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada, said the details of the plan will be key. \"They have to figure out exactly which companies the new rules will apply to and which ones they don't,\" Ball said. \"There are references to start-up companies and growth companies and there are references to mature companies at the other end, so I think we'll need some sort of clarification in the middle.\" The Liberals set themselves up similarly in their 2017 budget, promising changes to restrict the use of private corporations by professionals such as doctors to get better tax treatment for their incomes, with details to come. When Morneau released those details the following summer, the angry reaction ultimately caused the government to back down. In their 2015 campaign platform, the Liberals had promised to set a cap on how much could be claimed through the stock option deduction, but Morneau backed away from the plan in his first budget in 2016 after he said he heard from smaller companies that use stock options. \"Capping the stock option deduction is a welcome surprise in this budget to partially close one of the most regressive tax loopholes. However, it should be the start, and not the end, of addressing and capping regressive tax expenditures,\" said David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. The government noted the change to the taxes on stock options will only apply to options granted in the future and will not apply to those granted before the announcement of legislation to implement the new plan. Employee stock options allow workers to buy shares of their employers at a set price, which might be less than the market price. \u00a0"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "Financials help lift Toronto stocks higher, U.S. stock markets also climb", "description": "TORONTO -- A broad-based rally led by the financials and health care sectors helped Canada's main stock index close higher, while U.S. markets also rose.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/financials-help-lift-toronto-stocks-higher-u-s-stock-markets-also-climb-1.1229654", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 15, 2019", "content": " TORONTO -- A broad-based rally led by the financials and health care sectors helped Canada's main stock index close higher, while U.S. markets also rose.

While the divestment by Norway\u2019s US$1 trillion fund doesn\u2019t include Big Oil, instead rooting out US$7.5 billion of companies that focus purely on exploration and extraction, the impact of the announcement rippled through the sector. Shares of all oil companies initially plunged on the news, suggesting the move sets the industry up for greater disruption. It\u2019s a bitter taste of the new reality for oil producers, which increasingly have to fight for investor dollars rather than enjoying the perks of being indispensable to the global economy. \u201cThe Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is seen as something of a poster-child amongst sovereign wealth funds,\u201d said Alejandro DeMichelis, director of oil and gas research at Hannam & Partners LLP. \u201cThis decision could also trigger other large investors to review their stance toward investing in the oil and gas sector.\u201d Life is changing for oil companies. Ten years ago, they accounted for about 15 per cent of the S&P 500 index. Today, they make up just 5 per cent, having been mostly displaced by technology giants such as Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. Driving this shift is a smorgasbord of new energy sources that\u2019s bringing unprecedented competition for capital. Consumer choices are set to drift farther from the hydrocarbons of the 20th century, with renewables potentially meeting about a quarter of demand by 2040, according to oil major BP Plc. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that investors are increasingly questioning the wisdom of betting on oil and gas. A divestment campaign started by activist group 350.org in 2012 has already persuaded funds holding US$8 trillion to back away from fossil fuels, according to its website.  Scrutiny could intensify as AGM season approaches. Catherine Howarth, chief executive officer of ShareAction -- a group that has targeted Royal Dutch Shell Plc in the past -- said she expects a \u201cramp-up\u201d of pressure at annual general meetings that start in the spring. \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 Industry \u201cInstitutional investors are withdrawing their capital from oil and gas companies on the grounds that quicker-than-expected growth in clean energy and associated regulation is making oil and gas business models highly vulnerable,\u201d Howarth said in an email. It\u2019s not only oil companies facing pressure. One of the world\u2019s biggest sellers of coal, Glencore Plc, yielded to investor demands earlier this year by promising to limit production of the fuel and align the business with Paris climate targets. In oil and gas, Shell and BP have made pledges around transparency and climate after facing the wrath of shareholders. The list of companies to be excluded from the Norwegian fund includes Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Cnooc Ltd. and Tullow Oil Plc. Shale producers like EOG Resources Inc., which extract fuel from the heartland of America\u2019s oil and gas boom, are also included. Higher Costs In the longer term, a dearth of capital will push up the cost of borrowing to explore for oil and gas, with those costs likely passed on to consumers, according to Georgi Slavov, head of research at energy broker Marex Spectron. That makes renewables comparatively cheaper, further pushing fossil fuels out of the market. While Shell, BP and other oil majors were spared in Norway\u2019s decision on Friday, they may yet be earmarked for divestment in the future. \u201cThe country may eventually revisit the issue and target such holdings,\u201d said Rob Barnett, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In particular, the fund could consider shedding \u201cintegrated companies not allocating a portion of their capital spending toward clean energy.\u201d For those oil companies moving to diversify, there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. In its statement, Norway said some of the biggest investments in renewables now come from Big Oil. The fund \u201cshould be able to participate in this growth,\u201d the Finance Ministry said. \u201cWhile the fund was initially built on revenue from oil and gas, the Ministry of Finance understands that the future belongs to those who transition away from fossil fuels,\u201d said Mark Campanale, founding director of energy researcher Carbon Tracker. \u201cNow is the time for smart investors around the world to follow their lead and make decisions driven by the reality of the energy transition.\u201d"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "North American stock markets slip on Poloz remarks, commodity weakness", "description": "TORONTO -- Canada's main stock index closed lower along with U.S. markets as key commodities fell, while the loonie slipped lower as the Bank of Canada governor gave mixed commentary on the economy.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/north-american-stock-markets-slip-on-poloz-remarks-commodity-weakness-1.1217785", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Feb 21, 2019", "content": " TORONTO -- Canada's main stock index closed lower along with U.S. markets as key commodities fell, while the loonie slipped lower as the Bank of Canada governor gave mixed commentary on the economy.

The health care sector gained five per cent on the day led by cannabis heavyweights Aphria Inc. which rose by nearly 13 per cent, Cronos Group Inc. 12 per cent and Aurora Cannabis 8.8 per cent on heavy trading. Technology was up 1.6 per cent to follow the direction of the U.S. sector. Energy was up more than one per cent despite a dip in crude oil prices. The March crude contract was down 70 cents to US$54.56 per barrel and the March natural gas contract was down 7.4 cents at US$2.66 per mmBTU. The rally in oil prices over the past few weeks along with an improved performance of cannabis stocks have provided a lift for the TSX in 2019 and contributed to an 8.5 per cent gain for the market in January. \"Those two sectors, I would say, have provided the majority of the lift for the domestic market,\" Fehr said in an interview. The influential industrials sector lost 0.09 per cent while materials was up just 0.14 per cent as gold prices fell. The April gold contract was down US$2.80 at US$1,319.30 an ounce and the March copper contract was up 2.15 cents at US$2.79 a pound. The Canadian dollar traded at an average of 76.18 cents US, down from Friday's average of 76.37 cents US, which was the highest level since Nov. 7. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 175.48 points at 25,239.37. The S&P 500 index was up 18.34 points at 2,724.87, while the Nasdaq composite was up 83.67 points at 7,347.54. North American markets have been driven higher by an improved outlook for economic growth, higher corporate profits, dovish monetary policy particularly on interest rate hikes and hope that a U.S.-China trade skirmish will be resolved, said Fehr. U.S. corporate profits have set a positive tone even though they are a bit more mixed than a year ago. Alphabet Inc. beat analyst expectations in reporting after markets closed that it earned US$8.95 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss a year earlier. Net revenues after deducting advertising commissions was US$31.84 billion. \"We're getting some relief in the market as earnings announcements have come in that show that corporate America -- and I think as we start to see TSX reports corporate Canada as well -- is a little bit healthier than perhaps was the expectation as we went through that decline in late 2018,\" said Fehr. The Canadian corporate profit outlook is \"decent\" even though the TSX doesn't have the balance across industries and sectors as the U.S., he added. \"So we can see quarter to quarter things can be a bit distorted but I think the corporate profit outlook is still more positive than negative at this stage for the TSX.\" \u00a0"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Esha Dey", "title": "Tesla loses most valuable carmaker crown as GM catches up", "description": "The battle between Tesla Inc. and General Motors Co. for the most valuable U.S. carmaker is heating up.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tesla-loses-most-valuable-carmaker-crown-as-gm-catches-up-1.1200561", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jan 18, 2019", "content": " The battle between Tesla Inc. and General Motors Co. for the most valuable U.S. carmaker is heating up.

GM, whose shares have gained as much as 0.6 per cent today, is now valued at US$54.4 billion.

Tesla\u2019s forecast of a \u201cvery difficult road\u201d ahead, as it tries to ramp up the production of the lower-priced versions of the Model 3 sedan, contrasts starkly with the surprise outlook from GM earlier this month. The company, which was expected to warn about tough times due to a slowdown in auto markets in Europe and China, dismissed all concerns and forecast a strong profit, surprising investors. Despite going through a rough and turbulent year as a company, Tesla shares managed to gain about 7 per cent in 2018, mostly helped by strong deliveries and profit for the third quarter, while GM\u2019s stock dropped more than 18 per cent. The trend has been reversed so far this year, with Tesla dropping 5.6 per cent and GM rising nearly 15 per cent. Tesla\u2019s job cut news was not unexpected, Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said, noting that it was consistent with slower growth rates and also an opportunity to improve productivity. The analyst said Tesla still leads the electric vehicle industry as it moves the price of its Model 3 car toward US$35,000, while most competitors remain engaged in an \u201cEV negative margin sum game at higher price points.\u201d Still, the U.S. peers are valued at a fraction of the global heavyweight, Toyota Motor Corp.

The outlook underlined the risks that continue to be seen around the sector, which remains more than 16 per cent below record levels.  The partial recovery in prices has not been matched by a rebound in sentiment. According to Bloomberg data, exchange-traded funds that track the technology sector have generally seen outflows even as the stocks have risen. More than US$2 billion was pulled from the category in the week ended Dec. 28, followed by an additional US$1.4 billion in outflows the subsequent week.

Slack hasn\u2019t filed with U.S. regulators for the listing yet and it\u2019s unclear when it will because of the continuing shutdown of the federal government, the person said. The share sale, which might take place toward mid-year, could value Slack at more than US$7 billion, according to the person, who added that the company\u2019s plans could still change. A representative for San Francisco-based Slack declined to comment. The company was valued at US$7.1 billion in a US$427 million funding round in August. If Slack goes ahead with a direct listing, it will follow music streaming service Spotify Technology SA, which began trading in New York using that method in April. In an IPO, underwriters hammer out the number of shares to sell and at what price, and then take their fees out of the proceeds from an offering. A direct listing allows current investors to offer their stakes directly to new shareholders priced purely on demand. Slack\u2019s plans were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. U.S. share listings are facing delays as the government shutdown hits regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. Anticipated IPOs that may face continuing delays include Lyft Inc., which announced in December that it had filed confidentially for an IPO, and Uber Technologies Inc., which also filed confidentially last month, a person familiar with the matter has said.

Even though there are fears of a recession if the yield curve inverts, Marion pointed out that the global economy is still set to grow 3.5 per cent this year. \u201cSo, that would suggest slightly higher long-term interest rates and if it steepens that way then, it\u2019s pro-growth for financials and the banking sector,\u201d Marion said. \u00a0\u201cI think that there\u2019s a lot of pessimism that was built into the valuations, and now we have to normalize again, so that probably means more upside for markets to reflect that the economy remains resilient,\u201d he added."}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Abhishek Vishnoi, Min Jeong Lee and Matthew Burgess", "title": "\u2018Completely bizarre\u2019\u00a0stock moves leave traders scratching heads", "description": "As a turbulent December in equity markets draws to a close, there\u2019s one thing traders and investors can agree on: these are not usual times, especially for this time of year.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/completely-bizarre-stock-moves-leave-traders-scratching-heads-1.1188516", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Dec 27, 2018", "content": " As a turbulent December in equity markets draws to a close, there\u2019s one thing traders and investors can agree on: these are not usual times, especially for this time of year.

First, since 1945, December has produced the highest average gains of any month, he says, but this month is set to be the worst of the year. Second, since the 1970s, the S&P 500 has never slumped when earnings growth was more than 10 per cent, according to him. But as a long-only investor, Matthews is planning to ride it out. \u201cI remain invested through good times and bad,\u201d he says. \u201cNot being invested, over the long term, is like betting against the house in a casino.\u201d Over in Sydney, Sean Fenton is scratching his head. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly unusual for this time of year,\u201d the portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners says of the market moves. \u201cYou see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility.\u201d Fenton, like Matthews, says he\u2019s hunkering down, betting that the U.S. economy is robust and the sell-off will bottom out. For this time of year, he\u2019s \u201cprobably a little more focused on the market,\u201d he says, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s got reasons for the moves. \u201cTrying to explain short-term movements in the markets is an exercise in futility because generally it\u2019s pretty random,\u201d he says. In Tokyo, Hajime Sakai is just staying away from trading. The chief fund manager at Mito Securities Co. admits the whole thing took him by surprise. \u201cI can\u2019t really say I\u2019ve been dealing with it,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t quite able to respond.\u201d That\u2019s partly because of the time lag between when he makes a trading decision and when the trade is executed, which is often a day or two later. In markets this choppy, that gap makes trading close to impossible. \u201cWe\u2019re increasingly faced with situations where the price is completely different at the point of execution versus when we made the decision,\u201d he says.  Hold Cash \u201cWe have never seen the U.S. market dropping at this magnitude and speed for the past eight to nine years,\u201d says Margaret Yang, a market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore. Yang\u2019s solution is to go overweight cash for the time being. She expects the volatility to continue until year-end, until investors get a clearer picture from the holiday earnings season. But longer-term, she doesn\u2019t know if this will prove a \u201chealthy correction\u201d as investors find the S&P 500\u2019s low valuations attractive and earnings come in above expectations, or if it will mark the end of the 10-year bull run. Either way, one thing\u2019s for certain: \u201cThe recent movement is definitely unusual,\u201d she says. In South Korea, Lee Dong-jun agrees. The head of the global investment team at DB Asset Management in Seoul has also been staying as clear of the market as possible this week, tending only to existing investments and keeping away from new trades. \u201cThis isn\u2019t normal,\u201d he says of the market turbulence. \u201cInvestor sentiment is very bad.\u201d And while \u201cwe don\u2019t think this kind of huge volatility will persist,\u201d he says, \u201cour thinking is that it\u2019s not a good idea to actively trade stocks in a market like this.\u201d"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Elena Popina", "title": "Current market rout showing shades of\u00a01987 and 2008", "description": "Take a peak beneath the surface of the latest turmoil in U.S. equities and you\u2019ll find upheaval of a magnitude on par with the two biggest market crashes of the past four decades.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/current-market-rout-showing-shades-of-1987-and-2008-1.1186832", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Dec 20, 2018", "content": " Take a peak beneath the surface of the latest turmoil in U.S. equities and you\u2019ll find upheaval of a magnitude on par with the two biggest market crashes of the past four decades.

In a note to clients he cited the company\u2019s valuation as well as a \u201cfurther monetization of its 750+ million active iPhone installed base through future upgrades and a US$50 billion+ services revenue stream.\u201d The comments echoed a recent report from Morgan Stanley, which also touted Apple\u2019s services business and argued that the recent decline had been overdone.  Apple shares have plunged almost 25 per cent from a record high in early October, a slump that ended the company\u2019s multiyear streak as the largest stock by market capitalization. The stock has dropped more than 20 per cent thus far this month, putting it on track for its biggest monthly decline since September 2008, during the financial crisis. The shares rebounded 1.3 per cent pre-market on Wednesday.

Strip out the volatility. Calculate the returns. Then find a nice corner where you can weep, and wish you\u2019d put everything in T-bills. After another bruising week as portfolios sank deeper into the red, there may be no escaping it: Almost everything is going to lose this year. By one simple measure, this is the worst cross-asset performance in more than a century. With about US$3 trillion of U.S. stock value wiped out since the September peak, investors mapping strategies for 2019 are facing a gut check as a topsy-turvy market defies conventional wisdom. Above-trend growth, tax cuts, record stock buybacks and stellar corporate earnings were supposed to power the bull market anew. What hope now for the business and market cycle? \u201cThat\u2019s the market making a pretty big call on what\u2019s about to come -- the cycle is winding itself down finally, after nine years of recovery,\u201d said Rich Weiss, chief investment officer and senior portfolio manager of multi-asset strategies at American Century Investments. \u201cThere is nowhere in the rest of world that you can look to for help.\u201d \n Volatility Bites Amid the debris of 2018 may be some lessons of survival for the year ahead, not least the role of volatility. The spread between the best and worst performers this year among 23 major asset classes selected by Bloomberg is the narrowest since the financial crisis, based on absolute returns. Put simply, everything is struggling together. But an interesting thing happens when you adjust for volatility -- that is, compare the relative performance of stocks and bonds and commodities after accounting for how much each one bounced around. Doing this, something that rises 20 per cent in a year by going up or down 5 per cent a day compares unfavorably to something that rises 10 per cent via a steady succession of tiny gains. Viewed this way, the gap among asset returns becomes the widest over that period -- stripping out the year\u2019s stomach-turning volatility neutralizes everything and makes the quiet advance in Treasury bills all the more precious. In 2018, escaping price swings has been your ticket to outperformance. And here U.S. Treasury bills lived up to their reputation as the safest, most even-keeled asset of all, earning risk-adjusted returns of almost 20 per cent -- more than double the nearest rival, leveraged loans. They are the undisputed winners of 2018. The global sell-off has other silver linings. It\u2019s bringing valuations back down to earth, and may wind up restoring some discipline to the equity and credit market. \u201cThis volatility either will act to deflate excesses and extend the cycle or pull forward a downturn,\u201d said Geof Marshall, who oversees $40 billion\u00a0of assets at CI Investments\u2019 Signature Global Asset Management in Toronto. King Dollar Wall Street\u2019s America-First playbook may be struggling in stocks and credit but it\u2019s working for dollar bulls, with the currency topping the pile in absolute terms. But for those assuming the tumultuous year for overseas assets is just a strong-greenback story, think again. As of mid-November, the tally of assets losing in local-currency terms was 66 per cent, or 46 out of 70 markets, according to Deutsche Bank. That\u2019s the third-worst showing since 1901. And the dollar\u2019s 4.7 per cent return, if it holds, would make it the weakest top performer since at least the crisis -- underscoring just how lackluster 2018 has been overall. At the other end of Bloomberg\u2019s performance table, stocks across emerging markets and the Asia-Pacific region as well as oil are the biggest disappointments in 2018 in absolute terms. But their losses -- in the region of 10 per cent -- look in line with recent years. Developing-nation assets may turn a corner soon enough. GMO LLC, a value investor with US$70 billion, foresees negative returns across most asset classes adjusted for inflation for the next seven years, with emerging-market assets alongside cash offering the only source of gains. There are crumbs of comfort in this year\u2019s ruins. The average return for the set of 23 major assets tracked by Bloomberg, both in absolute and risk-adjusted terms, is only the worst since 2015 on an equal-weighted basis. Back then heavy losses in commodities, the dollar and euro conspired for an even uglier 12 months. And crypto investors have had it much worse: the value of digital tokens is down by almost US$700 billion since the January peak, or about 80 per cent. In sum, after basking in synchronized growth, monetary stimulus and vanquished volatility in 2017, investors are getting a lesson in the violent nature of market swings -- and it\u2019s raising existential questions about the link between the business and market cycle. \u201cAre we now in a regime where developed-market growth can be above trend but with asset prices facing more headwinds and with higher volatility than they were when growth was weaker?\u201d asked Deutsche Bank credit strategists led by Jim Reid. --With assistance from Cecile Gutscher, Natasha Doff, Lu Wang and Srinivasan Sivabalan."}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Esha Dey", "title": "GE fall sets up worst month since depths of 2009 bear market", "description": "General Electric Co. shares tumbled toward their worst month since the depths of last decade\u2019s recession after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned of a potential \u201ctail risk\u201d at the troubled manufacturer\u2019s finance arm.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ge-fall-sets-up-worst-month-since-depths-of-2009-bear-market-1.1169483", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Nov 16, 2018", "content": " General Electric Co. shares tumbled toward their worst month since the depths of last decade\u2019s recession after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned of a potential \u201ctail risk\u201d at the troubled manufacturer\u2019s finance arm. A thorough review of GE\u2019s 10-Q financial report still shows more questions than answers around the company, especially because GE Capital could face additional headwinds, analyst Joe Ritchie wrote in a note. GE investors are grappling with two key questions -- how big of an equity infusion GE Capital needs, and whether the Power unit business is close to a bottom. Goldman sees a chance that the equity infusion from GE to GE Capital might be larger than the US$3 billion previously stated for 2019. Goldman does not \u201csee GE as inexpensive given its leverage profile...and tail risk associated with GE Capital,\u201d the analyst said Friday, slashing the price target on the stock to US$9 from US$12. The stock sank as much as 5.4 per cent at 12:55 p.m. in New York, on pace to close at its lowest since March 2009. While GE shares have plunged by more than half this year, the pace of decline has been especially sharp over the past month, with the stock down 22 per cent since the beginning of the month. At that rate, November would be the worst month for the stock since February 2009, when it fell 30 per cent. The company disclosed an expanded federal accounting probe in late October, and analysts have warned about escalating liquidity concerns, as well as deteriorating results at GE\u2019s troubled power division and financial business.

But Obin, who rates GE a neutral, said the company still has a number of levers to meet the liabilities, including monetizing its assets. Concerns aside, the recent plight of GE shares is driven more by \u201csentiment, not as much fundamentals,\u201d Obin said. \u201c... GE\u2019s valuation partly reflects the \u2018fear of unknown\u2019, as the company\u2019s balance sheet is thinly stretched to be able to absorb any incremental bad news and the Street has gone through multiple negative surprises over the past year,\u201d Bank of America added."}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Matthew Boyle and Brandon Kochkodin", "title": "Buffett bids farewell to Walmart after 20 years as Amazon reigns", "description": "Warren Buffett has cut bait on Bentonville.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/buffett-bids-farewell-to-walmart-after-20-years-as-amazon-reigns-1.1168374", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Nov 14, 2018", "content": " Warren Buffett has cut bait on Bentonville.

Cohen, who returned to the business earlier this year after a government ban on him managing capital for clients ended, described how it was easier to make money during the early decades of his business because of the bull market in stocks and less competition in the industry. Cohen, 62, started his former firm, SAC Capital Advisors, in 1992 and it averaged returns of about 30 per cent annually. The hedge fund pleaded guilty to securities fraud in 2013 and paid a record fine as part of a U.S. crackdown on insider trading on Wall Street. Always Adapting Cohen said he raised US$5 billion from outside clients when his Point72 Asset Management became a hedge fund this year, and that it was easy to gather money. He said he took only 10 to 15 meetings, including one overseas trip. Cohen rarely speaks publicly about markets. In the wide-ranging talk with Fuhrman, Cohen touched on subjects including fatherhood, emerging artists and Chinese technology companies.

When the greenback goes up, the precious metal almost always goes down. Few assets have a stronger inverse correlation to the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, with gold favored as a hedge against the world\u2019s reserve currency. But that\u2019s not what happened in October, a month when both assets gained ground for the first time in 20 months. The change has been driven by last month\u2019s rout in emerging market equities, and particularly in China, which has seen investors seek out haven assets. At the same time, the strength of the U.S. economy is benefiting the dollar. The inverse relationship between gold and the dollar could continue to break down, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at CMC Markets in Sydney. Concerns about rising inflation and the outcome of the midterm Congressional elections could drive gold higher. \u201cWe\u2019re likely to see both a rising U.S. dollar and a rising gold price at least into next Tuesday night,\u201d McCarthy said by phone. The midterms are \u201ca potential game-changer. Predicting beyond that at the moment is very difficult.\u201d The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 2.3 percent in October to the highest in 17 months, while gold gained 2 percent, the most since January. The metal advanced 0.8 percent to $1,224.64 an ounce at 10:04 a.m. in London. Risk Aversion Gold\u2019s gains owe \u201cmostly to the recent de-risking in equity markets that we view as a correction rather than being in the throes of a bear market,\u201d Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity-markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA, said by email. While the bank raised its forecasts for gold, it still sees it declining, from an average $1,260 an ounce in 2018 to $1,145 in 2019. \u201cRisk aversion has crept back in as we\u2019ve seen declines in emerging markets around the world and now Asian markets following,\u201d said Mark O\u2019Byrne, Dublin-based executive director at brokerage Goldcore Ltd. \u201cFund managers are rebalancing after a very good run on the stock market, taking chips off the table and putting money into gold and cash, hence why the dollar has also risen.\u201d The inverse correlation on a 120-day basis has been narrowing since June, with the trend accelerating in October. It has gone from as strong as minus 0.75 to less than minus 0.55. A reading of minus 1 means the two are always moving in the opposite direction. Gold typically acts as a hedge not only against the dollar, but against fiat currencies in general. That the metal is priced in dollars further strengthens the connection. The reverse correlation faltered in June 2016, after the Brexit vote, and broke down completely during the early stages of the Greek debt crisis in 2010. When things are going badly everywhere else in the world, the dollar and gold act as a haven simultaneously. Gold and the dollar may continue to rise in tandem in the short term, \u201cbut I\u2019d be amazed if that continues into 2019,\u201d said O\u2019Byrne. U.S. policymakers won\u2019t want the currency to go much higher, whereas gold demand is just starting to come back. \u201cSo although I wouldn\u2019t want to bet against the dollar in the short-term, longer term it looks very positive for gold.\u201d \u00a0"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Alastair Marsh and Sridhar Natarajan", "title": "Crypto miners are new pot of gold offered to U.S. junk lenders", "description": "The company converting a disused aluminum smelter near the U.S.-Canada border into the world\u2019s largest digital-currency mining center plans to tap the debt market to fund its ambitious project.

While the amount the company wishes to borrow is small by credit-market standards, the interest rate for the senior secured revolving-credit facility may entice lenders. Coinmint has proposed an interest rate of as much as 12 per cent a year, a person familiar with the matter said, which is higher than the average yields on the lowest-rated U.S. junk bonds. The loan is a rare opportunity for credit investors to gain exposure to digital currencies, which remain largely isolated from traditional financial markets. In spite of the risks, it\u2019s also a way to bet on the viability of crypto assets, which have had a torrid year, with some tokens plunging as much as 90 per cent. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about lenders getting into a new space that they\u2019re not as comfortable with, they will look at us as higher-risk, and use that as an excuse to charge higher rates,\u201d said Prieur Leary, co-founder of Coinmint. He declined to comment on the specific terms of the loan. Leary said he expects credit markets will help finance a wide array of crypto businesses and that his company has used private credit facilities in the past. Disused Smelter Coinmint said earlier this year it would invest up to US$700 million in revamping its Massena plot, which was an active smelter for Alcoa Corp. until 2014. The new loan facility will form part of this funding, Leary said. Coinmint isn\u2019t the only crypto company to seek to finance its growth in the credit market. Debt was also part of a recent round of finance for BCause LLC, a U.S. mining and trading company, according to founder Thomas Flake. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rely on a decentralized network of computers to confirm transactions, rewarding those who verify transactions and maintain a ledger with new coins in a process known as mining. Miners are often drawn to sites with cheap electricity and cold temperatures to cool the servers, setting up in places from Iceland to central Washington State."}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "John Ainger and Liz Capo McCormick", "title": "Global bonds surge amid equity rout, tempered tightening outlook", "description": "Treasuries surged and a sovereign debt rallied globally equities extended their slide and expectations for central bank tightening in Europe and America were tempered.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/global-bonds-surge-amid-equity-rout-tempered-tightening-outlook-1.1158869", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 26, 2018", "content": " Treasuries surged and a sovereign debt rallied globally equities extended their slide and expectations for central bank tightening in Europe and America were tempered. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes slid Friday to its lowest level in more than three weeks, while rates on similar-maturity German bunds fell to a level unseen in almost two months as worse-than-anticipated earnings from U.S. technology giants Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. helped spur a sell-off in riskier assets. That combined with a spate of weak data in the euro area that prompted European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to list a \u201cbunch\u201d of downside risks to the central bank\u2019s normalization plan on Thursday. Traders have pushed back their pricing of the ECB\u2019s first interest-rate hike to 2020 and trimmed expectations on the pace of Federal Reserve tightening, with less than two quarter-point increases priced in for 2019. Stronger-than-expected U.S. economic growth numbers for the third quarter provided one upbeat note Friday, and prompted some brief paring of Treasury gains, but the market tone remained risk-averse as U.S. stock indexes traded in the red. \u201cYou have bear markets everywhere now in equities,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed-income at Natalliance Securities in New York.

Yields on Treasuries with 10 years to maturity fell as much as 6 basis points to 3.05 per cent, the lowest since Oct. 3. Haven demand this week has dragged the rate well below the seven-year high of 3.26 per cent reached earlier this month. While traders continue to expect a quarter-point hike from the Fed in December, expectations within the eurodollar futures market for how much tightening they might do next year have slipped to around 38 basis points from a high of around 60 earlier this month. The yield on 10-year German securities dropped as much as 6 basis points to 0.34 per cent, the lowest level since Sept. 5, before paring its move slightly. Money markets now see a 10-basis-point rate move by the ECB in January 2020, having previously priced in a December 2019 hike before Thursday\u2019s meeting. \u201cMarkets are reconsidering the pace of monetary policy normalization,\u201d said Pooja Kumra, European rates strategist at Toronto Dominion Bank.\u201d --With assistance from James Hirai."}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Heesu Lee", "title": "Oil's decline stretches to third week as 'fear selling' spreads", "description": "Oil tumbled for a third straight week as crumbling equity markets across the globe stoked concern about a slowdown in energy demand growth.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/oil-s-decline-stretches-to-third-week-as-fear-selling-spreads-1.1158558", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 26, 2018", "content": " Oil tumbled for a third straight week as crumbling equity markets across the globe stoked concern about a slowdown in energy demand growth.

Anyone counting on a breather in this year\u2019s final stretch got slapped with another 8.4 per cent drop for the Shanghai Composite Index so far in October, putting it on course for its worst month since early 2016. That sets the gauge up for its third-worst annual performance ever, behind a 65 per cent meltdown at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 and a 22 per cent plunge in 1994. China has become the world\u2019s worst place to own stocks in 2018. Reasons to flee the nation\u2019s stocks have piled up this year, starting with a liquidity squeeze spurred by China\u2019s deleveraging campaign that\u2019s led to record bonds defaults and hurt economic growth. Add to that a worsening trade war, rising interest rates and the strong U.S. dollar souring the outlook for emerging-market assets, and Chinese stocks are now facing a downward spiral made worse by the billions of dollars of shares at risk of forced selling. Here\u2019s a look at everything that\u2019s weighing on sentiment: Shadow financing, which includes entrusted loans, trust loans and bank acceptances, is getting worse. Its outstanding volume shrank for a seventh straight month in September, reaching its lowest since January 2017. A government-orchestrated campaign to cut leverage has squeezed private companies that relied on such funding channels, as banks have curbed lending. Another hit to sentiment came in the past two days, when quarterly statements showed five funds linked to the Chinese government sold all their stock holdings. That prompted speculation about whether Beijing will help put a floor on equity prices, with investors wondering if the move suggests its so-called \u201cnational team\u201d is withdrawing from the market. There\u2019s also the threat coming from brokers and banks, which account for more than half of the US$640 billion of shares pledged for loans. The stock rout may force lenders to sell equities, accelerating a vicious circle. The strength in the greenback -- the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index hit its highest level since June 2017 this week -- has also been a key reason of concern. That\u2019s prompted an exodus from emerging-market assets and increased pressure on the yuan. In the latest sign that capital outflows are picking up, Chinese banks sold the most foreign currency to their clients since December 2016, data by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange showed Thursday. It doesn\u2019t help that markets around the globe are sinking, giving stock investors nowhere to hide. In the U.S., tech shares have been pummeled, with companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. being the latest to give disappointing earnings results. Equities worldwide have lost almost US$7.8 trillion in market value this month alone, and US$15 trillion since January. That\u2019s all added up to a turbulent ride for Chinese stock traders: The Shanghai Composite Index is on track to post its wildest average intraday moves since January 2016 this month.

As major U.S. cannabis firms make their way to Canadian capital markets, no venue has embraced them as much as the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), which has benefited from a policy that welcomes issuers that operate in the U.S., standing in contrast to the more restrictive policy in place at TMX Group Ltd., the country\u2019s dominant exchange operator. And those U.S. pot companies are wearing out the CSE\u2019s welcome mat. Curaleaf Inc. is expected to soon raise about $525 million for a market valuation north of $4 billion when it trades on the CSE sometime this month, according to two people familiar with the company\u2019s listing plans.\u00a0 Harvest Enterprises Inc., an Arizona-based producer and retailer with operations in 10 states, is another U.S. cannabis company eyeing a CSE listing, and aims to raise at least $50 million at a $1.5-billion valuation, the sources said. Bloomberg has also reported that Acreage Holdings, which recently added former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to its board of directors, is looking to raise $200 million in a private placement via a reverse-takeover that would value the company at between US$2 billion to US$2.5 billion. \u201cWhat we see here is a reflection of investor appetite,\u201d said CSE Chief Executive Officer Richard Carleton in a recent phone interview with BNN Bloomberg from Tel Aviv where he was courting Israeli firms to list on the exchange. \u201c[Cannabis] is a real business and we\u2019re bringing it from the dark into the light.\u201d Harvest Chief Executive Officer Steve White, who declined to specifically comment on his company\u2019s listing plans, said the CSE\u2019s willingness to embrace U.S. pot companies is going to be the \u201cbest move that it\u2019s ever made.\u201d \u201cYou have an exchange in Canada that has opened its arms to U.S. cannabis companies. You don\u2019t have that in the United States,\u201d said White in an interview with BNN Bloomberg, on the sidelines of a recent conference in Toronto. But that\u2019s not to say that Canadian pot companies have yet to make their way onto Wall Street. Although several producers such as Canopy Growth Corp. and\u00a0Cronos Group trade on major U.S. exchanges, that list pales in comparison to the dozens of pot firms that opted to list on an exchange that has opened its doors to the volatile industry. \u00a0 The CSE was launched in 2003 and was formally approved as a stock exchange by the Ontario securities regulator in 2004. Since then, it\u2019s grown to offer an alternative to the much-larger TSX and TSX Venture while carving out a reputation as a market that caters to entrepreneurs. Although its trading volumes are dwarfed by the TSX, the CSE has seen a staggering rise in trading activity over the past few years thanks to its embrace of the cannabis sector. Along the way, the CSE has seen its share of growing pains. Bloomberg recently reported the exchange ran afoul with a shareholder rights advocate who criticized its policy of publishing investors\u2019 personal information. Greg Taylor, a portfolio manager at Purpose Investments, added that companies listed on the CSE often suffer from lower valuations than\u00a0those listed in the U.S. or on the TSX. \u00a0 Meanwhile, TMX Group sent a notice in October 2017 reminding its issuers that every company listed on the TSX or TSX Venture must comply with all the laws and regulations in the federal jurisdictions in which they operate. In other words, even if a U.S. state deems marijuana legal and the company does business in that state, it\u2019s unable to trade on a TMX Group exchange given that cannabis remains an illegal drug federally. That warning spurred some producers to reevaluate their holdings in order to stay in the good graces of TMX Group. \u00a0For example, Aphria Inc. had to divest its stake in Liberty Health Sciences Inc. for $59 million last month to remain compliant with the TMX Group\u2019s policy. The CSE, on the other hand, didn\u2019t fret when it came to what jurisdiction its issuers operated in as long as disclosure requirements were met. Thus, an opportunity emerged for U.S. cannabis firms to be lured on the Canadian exchange. Issuers raised $2.4 billion in the first nine months of the year, $1.54 billion of which came from cannabis companies, according to the CSE. That\u2019s a big jump from 2017 when $1.37 billion was raised throughout the year, $691 million of which came from pot companies. Carleton noted the U.S. players that are now opting to tap capital markets through the CSE are generally more mature than early-stage Canadian pot companies and tend to already be profitable with a more robust operating history. \u201cThose companies are commanding larger and larger market capitalizations when they do enter the public market,\u201d he said. But investors should remain aware that companies that list on the CSE may be riskier than issuers that opt for the TSX or other exchanges, said Jos Schmitt, chief executive officer of Toronto-based NEO Exchange, which does not list smaller, junior-level securities on its platform. \u201cI\u2019m a very firm believer that you have to be very cautious when you go public,\u201d said Schmitt in an interview with BNN Bloomberg. \u201cIf you look at the venture space, we know there\u2019s a reasonable probability that companies may not succeed.\u201d Additionally, Purpose Investments\u2019 Greg Taylor noted that some U.S. retail investors may be unable to trade CSE-listed stocks if their brokerage doesn\u2019t have access to the junior exchange. Institutional investors also often eschew investing in companies listed on the TSX Venture and CSE, which are home to the bulk of the cannabis sector. \u201cIt\u2019s a more striking contrast in the marijuana space because it\u2019s more retail than institutional,\u201d Taylor said. Carleton isn\u2019t turning a blind eye to some of the criticisms directed at his exchange. He told BNN Bloomberg the CSE has been adding staff to conduct more thorough background checks and review company listing statements and disclosures more thoroughly. While he can\u2019t provide specific figures, Carleton noted that it is \u201cnot uncommon\u201d for the exchange to force some pot companies to sever ties with insiders who have evidence of criminal activity and \u201canti-social behaviour\u201d prior to their listing. \u201cAt the end of the day, no screening process has been perfect but we do the best that we can,\u201d Carleton said.

The city\u2019s equity index is on pace for its worst year since 2008, while about one-fifth of the gauge\u2019s more than 2,000 stocks have lost at least half of their value. \"The risks in share-pledged loans will continue to grow if the stock market falls further,\" said Shen Bifan, chief strategist at Shenzhen Spruces Capital Management Co. \"Major shareholders usually tend to increase collateral to avoid forced selling.

As the Philippine Stock Exchange Index dipped below 7,100 during Tuesday\u2019s session, taking its valuation to its lowest level since January 2016, Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. is among the firms that\u2019s staying on the sidelines. John Padilla, the head of equities at the money manager, says he\u2019s too concerned about the high inflation level, rising oil prices, weakening peso, increasing interest rates and drying up liquidity. \u201cEverybody is bracing and positioning for a higher inflation, and with oil continuing its climb there isn\u2019t anything to say that\u2019s enticing to go bargain hunting at this point,\u201d said Padilla, who helps manage 450 billion pesos (US$8.3 billion). \u201cIt used to be that a buy-on-weakness strategy works, but now for prudence it\u2019s better to step aside and let the market take its course.\u201d The Philippine Stock Exchange has plunged 17 per cent since the end of December, becoming the world\u2019s biggest losing equity market and taking its valuation to 15 times estimated earnings for the next year, below its five-year average. The gauge fell as much as 0.5 per cent to 7,095.26 on Wednesday. The recent sell-off from emerging markets and U.S.-China trade frictions only added to worries over the nation\u2019s headwinds. Overseas investors have withdrawn almost US$1.6 billion in 2018, exceeding inflows from the past four years. Padilla said it\u2019s not improbable for the Philippine stock gauge to fall below 7,000 in the near term and that it could go as low as 6,600. He said his firm will change its underweight call on the equities should consumer prices, the peso, interest rates and liquidity show improvements. September inflation data are due on Friday. \u201cYou can get a better return with your cash in time deposit now rather than exposing it to equities, where at best you get a flat return but run the risk of losing part of your money if you buy the wrong name,\u201d Padilla said. The country\u2019s shares will face more challenges before things get better, according to Michael Enriquez, the chief investment officer of Sun Life of Canada Philippines Inc. The PSEi could stay at around 7,100 this year, with earnings growth of 5.5 per cent compared with 10 per cent to 12 per cent consensus, he said. To put that into perspective, the key stock gauge closed at almost 8,559 at the end of last year. Steven Ko, who helps manage 60 billion pesos at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., sees further risk as limited. While the benchmark index may drop to 6,900, he says there\u2019s also a chance it could climb to 8,000 this year as sentiment improves. He expects inflation to peak and says the peso may have already seen its sharpest depreciation this year. \u201cWe are still holding on to our cash, but we are selectively buying some of the oversold names that are already worth looking into,\u201d Ko said. He favors property stocks because he sees higher earnings-growth prospects and likes banks as he deems them unduly hit by the rout. \u00a0"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Lulu Yilun Chen and Mark Bergen", "title": "35-year-old unknown creates the world\u2019s most valuable startup", "description": "When Zhang Yiming first shopped the idea of a news aggregation app powered by artificial intelligence six years ago, investors including Sequoia Capital were skeptical.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/35-year-old-unknown-creates-the-world-s-most-valuable-startup-1.1144564", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Sep 28, 2018", "content": " When Zhang Yiming first shopped the idea of a news aggregation app powered by artificial intelligence six years ago, investors including Sequoia Capital were skeptical. Back then, the question was how a 29-year-old locally trained software engineer could outsmart the numerous news portals operated by the likes of social media behemoth Tencent Holdings Ltd. and extract profit where even Google had failed. Zhang, now 35, proved them wrong. Today his company, Bytedance Ltd., is on its way to a more than US$75 billion valuation -- a price tag that surpasses Uber Technologies Inc. to top the world, according to CB Insights. The latest in a long line of investors who\u2019ve come around is Softbank Group Corp., which is said to be planning to invest about US$1.5 billion. Bytedance now counts KKR & Co., General Atlantic and even Sequoia as backers. Much of its lofty valuation stems from the creation of an internet experience that\u2019s a cross between Google and Facebook. \u201cThe most important thing is that we are not a news business. We are more like a search business or a social media platform,\u201d Zhang said in a 2017 interview, adding that he employs no editors or reporters. \u201cWe are doing very innovative work. We are not a copycat of a U.S. company, both in product and technology.\u201d What\u2019s remarkable is Zhang was able to do it all without taking money from the twin suns of China\u2019s internet: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent. It\u2019s the first startup to emerge from the dwindling cohort of mobile players that hasn\u2019t sought protection or funds from either of the two. In fact, it\u2019s often locked horns with them, in court and elsewhere. The story of how Bytedance became a goliath begins with news site Jinri Toutiao but is tied more closely to a series of smart acquisitions and strategic expansions that propelled the company into mobile video and even beyond China. By nurturing a raft of successful apps, it\u2019s gathered a force of hundreds of millions of users and now poses a threat to China\u2019s largest internet operators. The company has evolved into a multi-faceted empire spanning video service Tik Tok -- known as Douyin locally -- and a plethora of platforms for everything from jokes to celebrity gossip. But as with Facebook at the same stage of its life, Bytedance now faces questions over when or even how it will start making a profit. \u201cThe predominant issue in China\u2019s internet is that the growth in users and the time each user spends online has slowed dramatically. It is becoming a zero-sum game, and costs for acquiring users and winning their time are increasing,\u201d said Jerry Liu, an analyst with UBS. \u201cWhat Bytedance has created is a group of apps that are very good at attracting users and retaining their time, in part, leveraging the traffic from Jinri Toutiao.\u201d Despite that seeming isolation, it\u2019s become the most successful major Chinese tech company in creating an international base, venturing via apps like Tik Tok into the U.S., Southeast Asia and Japan. Even Tencent\u2019s WeChat had to pump the brakes on its own overseas initiative four years ago. What Zhang perceived in 2012 was that Chinese mobile users struggled to find information they cared about on many apps. That\u2019s partly because of the country\u2019s draconian screening of information. Zhang thought he could do better than incumbents such as Baidu, which enjoyed a near-monopoly on search. The latter conflated advertising with search results, a botch that would later haunt the company via a series of medical scandals. There was little Toutiao could do about censorship -- in fact, the company\u2019s been repeatedly excoriated by authorities for failing to filter content and been forced to clean up its services with alarming regularity. But Zhang held fast to his early vision of delivering content that mattered to users through AI. The closest American equivalent was Facebook\u2019s news feed. After falling flat with the bulk of China\u2019s venture capital stalwarts, Zhang eventually secured investment from Susquehanna International Group. It began offering the news app in August 2012. The platform studied what users read and searched for, then referred information and articles based on those habits. The more people used it, the better the experience, and the longer people stayed. By mid-2014, daily active users had climbed to more than 13 million. Sequoia finally came to the table, leading a funding round of US$100 million. \u201cWe push information, not by queries, by news recommendations,\u201d Zhang said in the interview last year. But it was video that really propelled Bytedance into the big leagues. Streaming services have always been popular in China. Even during the desktop era, companies like YY Inc. championed a model where people sang and danced in virtual showrooms to win online gifts from fans. Later, outfits like Kuaishou fueled that penchant for zany showmanship. Bytedance saw an opportunity, but made its videos much shorter: 15 seconds, to be precise. Around September 2016, it quietly launched Douyin. The app let users shoot and edit footage, add filters and share them across platforms like the Twitter-like Weibo or WeChat. That format appealed to shorter millennial attention spans and became an instant hit, so much so that WeChat later blocked direct access to the app. A year after, Bytedance acquired Musical.ly for US$800 million. It saw synergy between the buzzy teen U.S. social video app created by Chinese co-founders and Tik Tok, and is now in the process of combining them. Tik Tok and Douyin had a combined 500 million users as of July. The challenge now is in translating buzz and viewership into dollars. The company is expanding its ad sales operations, particularly for Toutiao. Several media buying agencies said its massive reach and the attention it draws is a natural lure for marketers. Many said Bytedance is even pulling spending away from Tencent. Bytedance, which previously cut a deal with Cheetah Mobile to sell ad space, has brought most of its ad sales in-house, said Kenneth Tan, the chief digital officer for Mindshare China, an agency. \u201cFrom a pricing perspective, they are expensive for what they are. They definitely charge a premium,\u201d Tan said. \u201cBut that has not been an inhibitor for the large brands.\u201d There\u2019s a big caveat, however. Brands remain cautious about Bytedance\u2019s regulatory issues, particularly given Beijing\u2019s historic unpredictability around censorship. This year, it had to shut down a popular joke-sharing app in April just as it appeared to take off. It also suspended Douyin and its bread-and-butter Toutiao around the same time. That\u2019s \u201ca potential risk to brand collaboration,\u201d said Sherry Pan, general manager for China at the agency Magna Global. --With assistance from David Ramli."}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Aoyon Ashraf", "title": "Rookie pot stocks overshadow more established peers in September", "description": "Move over marijuana heavyweights, the rookies are taking over.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/rookie-pot-stocks-overshadow-more-established-peers-in-september-1.1144817", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Sep 28, 2018", "content": " Move over marijuana heavyweights, the rookies are taking over.

The SEC\u2019s allegation, contained in a lawsuit filed fewer than two months after Musk\u2019s August tweet, sent Tesla\u2019s shares (TSLA.O) down more than 11 per cent in after-hours trading. It sought unspecified monetary penalties and added a market-rattling request -- that a judge bar Musk from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The SEC brought the case swiftly because its investigation was done -- and impact would be greatest soon after the alleged misconduct, SEC co-enforcement director Steve Peikin said in a news conference. That request could force Musk to step to the negotiating table quickly to reach a settlement, lest he leave investors wondering about the fate of a company whose image has become intertwined with that of its maverick CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual for a case of this significance to move this quickly, in particular when you\u2019ve got a high-profile individual,\u201d said Robert Long, a former SEC enforcement attorney now in private practice at Bell Nunnally in Dallas. Still, because the investigation was narrowly focused on several tweets, he said the agency \u201ccould have conducted its investigation quickly.\u201d The agency said Musk fabricated the claim in his August tweet that he had \u201cfunding secured,\u201d which sent Tesla shares higher. After calculating a price for taking the company private, the SEC said Musk rounded up to US$420 -- a reference to \u201cmarijuana culture\u201d that he thought his girlfriend would find humorous. \u201cIn truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,\u201d the SEC said in complaint filed Thursday in Manhattan federal court. The company, which wasn\u2019t sued, didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. \u201cThis unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed,\u201d Musk said in a statement. \u201cI have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.\u201d Even before the tweets, the SEC was investigating issues at Tesla including its car sales projections. The Justice Department is also looking into whether Musk misled investors, Bloomberg News has reported. On July 31, the SEC said in its complaint, Musk met with three members of a \u201csovereign wealth fund\u201d at Tesla\u2019s factory in Fremont, California, for approximately 30 to 45 minutes. In that meeting, a member of the fund expressed interest in taking Tesla private. Musk took that to mean he was proposing a \u201cstandard\u201d going-private transaction, but the terms were not discussed. Musk has previously said he was talking to Saudi investors about a plan to take the company private. On Aug. 2, Musk sent an email to the company\u2019s board of directors, chief financial officer and general counsel with a subject line of \u201cOffer to Take Tesla Private at $420.\" In the email, Musk explained he wanted to sidestep the \u201cconstant defamatory attacks by the short-selling community, resulting in great harm to our valuable brand.\u201d Musk came up with the price because he thought a 20 per cent premium was standard. At the time, that calculation resulted in a US$419 price. Musk rounded up to 420 because he thought his girlfriend \u201cwould find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price,\u201d the SEC cited him as saying. On Aug. 6, Musk discussed a potential takeover with an unnamed private equity executive who has experience with such transactions. That executive told Musk that such a deal was \u201cunprecedented\u201d in his experience. The next day, Musk tweeted from his cell phone: \u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\u201d Shares rose 11 per cent and trading volume spiked. About 12 minutes later, Tesla\u2019s head of investor relations sent a text to Musk\u2019s chief of staff asking, \u201cWas this text legit?\u201d About 20 minutes later, the company\u2019s chief financial officer texted Musk: \u201cElon, am sure you have thought about a broader communication on your rationale and structure to employees and potential investors. Would it help if [Tesla\u2019s head of communications], [Tesla\u2019s General Counsel], and I draft a blog post or employee email for you?\u201d Musk responded, \u201cYeah, that would be great.\u201d Tesla\u2019s Chief Financial Officer then replied, \u201cWorking on it. Will send you shortly.\u201d Musk didn\u2019t clarify his statement until an Aug. 13 blog post in which he tried to walk back the tweet. On Aug. 24., the company announced that it would not be pursuing a buyout. \u201cMusk made his false and misleading public statements about taking Tesla private using his mobile phone in the middle of the active trading day,\u201d the SEC said. \u201cHe did not discuss the content of the statements with anyone else prior to publishing them to his over 22 million Twitter followers and anyone else with access to the Internet. He also did not inform Nasdaq that he intended to make this public announcement, as Nasdaq rules required.\u201d \"Musk\u2019s false and misleading statements and omissions caused significant confusion and disruption in the market for Tesla\u2019s stock and resulting harm to investors,\" the SEC said in its complaint."}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Jonathan Roeder and Craig Giammona", "title": "Papa John's shares spike on reports of renewed buyout activity", "description": "Shares of Papa John\u2019s International Inc. jumped the most in more than two months as deal speculation heats up.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/papa-john-s-shares-spike-on-reports-of-renewed-buyout-activity-1.1143440", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Sep 26, 2018", "content": " Shares of Papa John\u2019s International Inc. jumped the most in more than two months as deal speculation heats up.

Tilray Inc. closed down 30.25 per cent to US$123 on the Nasdaq, two days after it went on a wild ride by surging more than 90 per cent, dropping into negative territory and rebounding after the licensed producer said it got approval to export medical cannabis from Canada to the U.S. for a clinical trial. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average hit a new high, gaining 86.52 points to 26,743.50. The S&P 500 index lost 1.08 points to 2,929.67, while the Nasdaq composite was down 41.28 points to 7,986.95.

I think today the market is just hanging out after the various indexes have made new highs this week.\u201d Earlier, the bullish mood that characterized most of the week buoyed global equity markets. Stocks rallied in Europe and Asia, and the MSCI All-Country World Index was poised for a seven-month high. Treasury yields held above 3 per cent. The dollar and commodities gained. The pound sank after Prime Minister Theresa May said the U.K. and European Union were \u201cat an impasse\u201d on Brexit. The euro slipped from a three-month high after data showed euro-area expansion edged lower in September. Italian bonds climbed as Finance Minister Giovanni Tria prepares a draft budget. In Japan, news that the BOJ is trimming purchases of debt maturing in more than 25 years helped boost 20-year and 30-year government bond yields. Raw materials, stocks and emerging-market assets are all rallying as investors bet the global economic expansion is intact despite the latest data from Europe and the escalating trade war. The Bloomberg Commodity Index climbed to its highest level in more than a month, fueled by gains in crude oil and copper. Emerging-market stocks and currencies extended a rally. Indian stocks bucked the developing-nation trend, however, as a plunge in banks set off an exodus from financial shares. The big rearrangement of the GICS takes effect Sept. 24, with the creation of the communication services group. The new industry category will include three of the four FANG stocks -- Facebook, Alphabet and Netflix -- and could force investors who track indexes based on the classification to reshuffle their money.

Shares of Tilray Inc. have rallied more than 1,000 per cent since the Canadian pot firm went public in July, leaving some of the most hyped digital-currency companies in the dust. By comparison, Riot Blockchain Inc. only surged around 400 per cent after the former machinery maker for the biotech industry ditched its old name, Bioptix Inc., in October. Tilray shares skyrocketed 50 per cent on Wednesday alone after Chief Executive Officer Brendan Kennedy claimed the company may one day be among a few other players in the industry with a valuation north of US$100 billion. That followed a 30 per cent increase on Tuesday after the firm got approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration to import cannabis into the U.S. for medical research. Tilray isn\u2019t alone. Alkaline Water Co. and New Age Beverages Corp. also rallied recently after eyeing cannabis-related drinks. Companies that rebranded with crypto or blockchain late last year saw dramatic gains in their share prices, but the euphoria was short lived.

Privateer Holdings Inc., a Seattle-based fund started seven years ago to focus on the marijuana business, holds 76 per cent of Tilray, a stake now worth more than US$12 billion after the stock soared more than 10-fold from its July public offering. Tilray, a Canadian company with just US$20 million in revenue last year, has benefited from the surge in demand for pot stocks as Canada gears up to legalize the drug next month, and companies including Coca-Cola Co. and Diageo Plc show interest in the sector. Tilray, based in the Vancouver Island town on Nanaimo, has drawn more interest than most, in part due to its listing on the Nasdaq, making it easier for U.S. investors and hedge funds to get a piece of the action. The limited float may also be adding to the volatility, making it more expensive for skeptical investors to short the stock. Citron Research said it remains short on Tilray, calling the stock\u2019s surge \u201cbeyond comprehension\u201d in a Tweet Wednesday. Bigger Than American Tilray has surpassed Canopy Growth Corp. as the world\u2019s largest cannabis company, with a market value of more than US$20 billion. Canopy, which added a New York listing in May, is worth US$12 billion. Tilray jumped another 38 per cent to US$214 at 10:25 a.m. in New York Wednesday, giving it a value higher than American Airlines Group Inc. Cowen & Co. took the company public in July at US$17. When Tilray\u2019s unlisted Class 1 shares are included, Privateer\u2019s holdings rise to almost 75 million shares, worth more than US$15 billion. Privateer\u2019s partners include Brendan Kennedy, who serves as Tilray\u2019s chief executive officer, Michael Blue and Christian Groh. Kennedy and Blue are both graduates of Yale School of Management\u2019s MBA program. Kennedy and Groh both formerly worked together at SVB Analytics, a non-bank affiliate of Silicon Valley bank. Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund became the first institutional investor in the cannabis industry through Privateer Holdings\u2019 US$75 million Series B financing round in December 2014, according to the company\u2019s website. Tilray, which has agreements to sell pot in Canadian pharmacies including Shoppers Drug Mart, has ambitious plans well beyond Canada. It\u2019s focused on medicinal marijuana in 12 countries that span five continents. \u201cOur long-term vision is if a patient walks into any pharmacy in any country in the world that has legalized cannabis that patient should be able to obtain a Tilray product. That\u2019s our global goal,\u201d Kennedy said in an interview this week from New York. Tilray is investing in production capacity in Portugal so it can supply products to the EU from within Europe, he said. The company also has its High Park brand for the recreational market in Canada, which has secured supply agreements with seven provinces and territories, Kennedy said. The company also has a deal to develop medicinal cannabis with the Canadian division of Novartis AG of Switzerland. Kennedy said he\u2019s not interested in getting taken over by a large consumer company. In a testament to the euphoria surrounding the space, he claimed the company may one day be worth more than $100 billion. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get bought by AB-InBev or Diageo, I want to be that company,\u201d he added.
