The Oklahoma-based company was founded in 1989, and became a pioneer in fracking, a controversial process of injecting pressurized water and chemicals into previously unobtainable natural gas reservoirs in order to extract them.\nAt its peak, the company was one of the most influential energy companies in the U.S., but it has been hit hard recently amid declining energy prices and COVID-19.\nThe company was trying to pivot from natural gas to a greater emphasis on oil when a Saudi-Russian energy price war earlier this year upended those plans and the oil market as a whole.\nBut the company's main problem is its debt load, which it accumulated during an aggressive pace of acquisitions.\nThe company owes almost $9 billion\u00a0\u2014 more than ten times the company's current value. The bankruptcy plan is seemingly those lenders taking over the company in order to get as much of their money back as they can.\nChesapeake's shares nearly tripled\u00a0on Monday under extremely heavy trading in what was likely a short squeeze \u2014 a sudden move higher for stocks investors are betting heavily against. About 20 per cent of Chesapeake's shareholders are shorting the stock right now, according to financial data firm Fintel.\nWatch the video below for an explainer of what short selling is, and how it works:\nThe stock was halted 22 times due to the volatility.\nAfter markets closed on Monday, the Bloomberg report of bankruptcy plans sent investors running for the exits.\nChesapeake shares were changing hands at $32.25 on the NYSE on Tuesday, down 54 per cent from Monday's level. Trading in the shares were halted another 14 times on Wednesday. At current prices, the company is worth about $700 million, a fraction of the almost $40 billion it was worth more than a decade ago.\nIn April the company\u00a0implemented a 200-for-1 stock consolidation\u00a0in an attempt to stop its shares from being delisted from the stock exchange. In May it warned that bankruptcy was possible, telling investors as it withdrew its financial guidance that it was\u00a0\"working with its financial and legal advisors to best position Chesapeake for the future, including analyzing all available strategic alternatives to address its capital structure and improve its financial position.\"\nChesapeake had about 2,300 employees at the end of last year, before announcing a 13 per cent cut to its workforce in April.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1725703235509", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1704849475631", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1708995139657", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1709167171581", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1709170243575", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1668997187803", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/programs/ottawamorning/coronavirus-and-the-stock-market-1.5482115", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1703688771992", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1713828931570", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "How Canadians can interpret COVID-19's volatile effect on the stock market", "description": "Is it too soon to invest hope in the latest round of market gains?", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/the-economy-with-a-capital-e-1.5542514/how-canadians-can-interpret-covid-19-s-volatile-effect-on-the-stock-market-1.5542515", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5496168.1587913387!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/aptopix-financial-markets-wall-street.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 24, 2020 10:30 AM ET", "2020-04-24T14:30:00.920Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has\u00a0sent stock markets on a roller-coaster ride since March.\nInvestors are seeing steep, historic drops \u2014 followed by multi-day rallies.

Such a halt automatically suspends all trading on the market for 15 minutes after a decline of more than seven\u00a0per cent\nA level 2 halt is automatically imposed after a decline of 13 per cent, for another 15 minutes. If the decline hits 20 per cent, a level 3 halt comes in to shut down trading for the rest of the day.\nWhen the halts lifted, cooler heads were in short supply as the sell-off continued.\nThe TSX\u00a0fared worse than just about anyone, with the benchmark index closing down more than 1,660 points,\u00a0or more than 10 per cent,\u00a0to 14,514. That's the worst day for the TSX since Black Monday in 1987 \u2014 worse than any single day during the financial crisis of 2009.\nIt also means that the TSX has lost more than 18 per cent of its value in less than a month, as the TSX was flirting with the 18,000-point level as recently as Feb. 20.\nThings were almost as bad in New York, too, as the Dow Jones lost more than 2,000 points, or almost eight per cent, while the broader S&P 500 lost 226 points, or 7.6 per cent of its value.\nEven the technology-focused Nasdaq fell by seven\u00a0per cent.\n\"This is basically panic selling,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital in New York. \"There's a lot of fear in the market and \u2026 it's an indication that a\u00a0global recession is not far away.\"\nWall Street's so-called \"fear index,\" known as the VIX, which spikes during times of volatility, jumped by 14 points to 56.61. That's its highest level since 2009, during the financial crisis.\nThe panic started on Sunday evening after Saudi Arabia kicked off an all-out price war in the oil market, announcing it would be removing any\u00a0production caps. That move sent the price of crude crumbling more than 25 per cent, and came on top of existing fears over the coronavirus currently spreading around the world.\nToronto-based money manager John Zechner\u00a0called the sell-off \"a selling panic.\"\n\"It's a sell now and ask questions later kind of thing,\" he said in an interview. \"The probability of recession\u00a0has gone up very dramatically.\"\nTSX was hit more than most stock exchanges because so many energy companies trade on the exchange.\u00a0Canadian energy companies sold off\u00a0hard. Suncor lost more than 17\u00a0per cent of its value. Cenovus\u00a0closed down 51 per cent. MEG Energy closed down 55 per cent.\nBond yields in the U.S. and Canada fell to their lowest levels on record as investors fled for safety. Investors flock toward things like bonds because they are perceived to be safer than other assets, as governments are unlikely to default on their loans.\nAll that bond buying pushes up their price, which counterintuitively drives their yields down \u2014 because governments don't have to offer a very good interest rate to find a willing buyer for their debt.\nAt one point on Monday morning, the yield on the Canadian government's 10-year bond dipped below 0.3 per cent, its lowest level on record. That means a buyer of that bond is effectively willing to\u00a0loan\u00a0the government $1,000 for an entire decade, and is only going to get $3 a year for their troubles. With inflation factored in, they're actually losing money.\u00a0But they are willing to accept that meagre return because it is preferable to other options where they think they'll do even worse.\nThe U.S. 10-year is telling a similar story, falling to a record low of 0.3228 per cent at one point on Monday morning\n\"The\u00a0lower it does go, the more people are likely to panic even further,\" said Rick Meckler, a partner with Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey. \"The\u00a0more it goes down, the more people will be nervous about it.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/programs/onthecoast/january-9-2020-stock-markets-1.5421725", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "COVID-19 comes for the stock market", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/frontburner/covid-19-comes-for-the-stock-market-1.5491912", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3650797.1466799963!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/britain-eu-british-stock-markets-plunge-after-brexit-june-24-2016.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 5:12 AM ET", "2020-03-23T17:46:33.351Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It was a historically bad day for global markets.

In the years since, he's renovated the property (in a bid to increase its value) and rented part of it out (to help cover mortgage costs). He's also helped countless clients make the most of their own real estate purchases.\nBut until very recently, stock market investing was a foreign world to him. \"If you asked me a month ago what an ETF (exchange traded fund) was, I'd have no idea,\" Palios says. \"Honestly, I was completely green.\"\nPalios waited to start investing until all he'd paid off all off his debts and had a substantial savings fund to withdraw from. Once he achieved both financial milestones, he enrolled in an investing crash course, and by the end of the program he'd outlined a plan for purchasing his first stocks.\n\"And then, the pandemic happened,\" Palios says.\nHe was wrapping up his last lesson when the country moved into a lockdown state and stock prices plummeted. He'd already settled on his investment criteria (no fossil fuel or mining companies; only companies with at least one woman on their board of directors; and special focus on companies building health-care or renewable energy technologies). After seeing how low stock prices had fallen, he finally took the leap: Palios purchased $5,000 in stocks.\nInvesting a solid chunk of cash in a market on the decline may feel like a risky move for many \u2014 and it's one that experts say isn't advisable for those who've been laid off or are currently taking financial hits. But for millennials with stable income streams, current market prices may offer an opportunity to scoop up quality stocks at low prices.\nPalios admits the value of the sum he put into the stock market has declined by about four per cent in the few weeks since doing so. But he's taking a long-game approach to investing and says he'll be happy if sees noticeable returns in five or ten years.\n\"It's not money, it's part ownership and shares of a company that currently is trading at a lower value than history tells us it's worth, so...\u00a0I don't feel panicked when I look and see that my $5,000 that I transferred over is now only worth $4,800,\" Palios says.\nHe says investing as a first-timer is only advisable for those with the flexibility to take a similar approach. Anyone who's hoping to see returns within the next year or two should stay away from the stock market, which may remain volatile for the next couple years before rebounding again. He also suggests staying away from investing if you're still paying off debt or don't have the security of a built-up rainy day fund (both lessons were among the first he learned in his online crash course).\nToronto-based personal finance expert Barry Choi takes a similar approach. Buying stocks solely because they are \"on discount\" right now is not enough of a reason to take financial risks, especially as a first-timer, Choi says.\nHe suggests new investors start with diversified portfolios, like ETFs or mutual funds, and use dollar-cost averaging (continuing to contribute a fixed amount on regular intervals despite volatility in the stock market) to grow their assets over time. The latter approach is proven to work primarily because it prevents investors from making large lump-sum investments that are poorly-timed with stock market prices.\n\"Quite often people will see things that are 'attractive,' like bank stocks, airlines, and stocks that are near all-time lows but traditionally have been more valuable in the past,\" Choi says. \"Choosing which stock will be the next winner is like gambling.\"\nHe suggests a low-risk approach for first-timers and veteran investors alike in times of market turbulence. If you've been laid off or are facing financial difficulty and don't have emergency savings to turn to, there's no shame in reducing your contribution or selling your stocks off, even at a loss, Choi says.\nBut it's a decision that should be made with caution. If you're economically stable but prone to bouts of anxiety related to market turmoil, hastily selling shares is probably not the way to go. Instead, turn off the news, limit how often you check your portfolio, and find a way to stay distracted while riding the recession out.\n\"What we have learned is things will eventually rebound, Choi says. \"So once you are employed again or you've got the cash flow, as long as you keep investing on a regular basis, and you've got time on your side, then eventually your portfolio will go back up in value.\"\n\"As long as you're dollar cost averaging,\" Choi says. \"You'll probably come out ahead in the long run.\"\n"}, {"author": "Vera-Lynn Kubinec", "title": "Manitoba securities commission warns investors about letter exploiting COVID-19 stock market anxiety", "description": "Gold mining company named in letter says it\u2019s not involved", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-securities-commission-investor-alert-covid-19-1.5528585", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5528624.1586471738!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/coronavirus-letter.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 09, 2020 5:42 PM CT", "2020-04-09T23:08:52.522Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Financial regulators are warning Manitobans about a letter delivered to mailboxes in what's being called an attempt to exploit fears of a recession related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Manitoba Securities Commission issued an investor alert Thursday \"warning the public to exercise extreme caution about aggressive promotion of Crestview Exploration Inc., a British Columbia gold mining company,\" an MSC release said.\nThe promotion came in the form of a letter sealed in a white envelope without a return address, marked in bold red letters, \"CORONAVIRUS AFFECTING MARKETS: READ NOW.\"\nCopies were delivered to homes in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. this week, the MSC said.\nThe letter from someone describing himself as a \"stock analyst and geologist\" makes \"exaggerated claims about Crestview, predicting that its stock price 'will soar as the recession hits'\", the MSC said.\nThe regulator received complaints about the letter this week, said Jason Roy, a senior investigator with the MSC.\nCrestview Exploration, listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, issued a statement Wednesday saying it was not responsible for the letter.\n\"...To the best of the company's knowledge, no officers and or directors were involved in disseminating this letter,\" the statement said.\n\"Crestview has not paid any compensation nor has it requested for this analyst to endorse the company nor its stock.\"\nThe company\u00a0urged investors to visit its website for up-to-date information about the company and its mining assets.\n\"Crestview advises all investors and potential investors to properly verify the information provided by any individual and or third parties regarding buy recommendations,\" the statement said.\nRoy told CBC News the MSC investigation is underway and it has not yet determined who distributed the letters.

Major indexes ended slightly lower Tuesday after being up more than 3 per cent\u00a0earlier. The market was coming off an even bigger gain of 7 per cent\u00a0the day before. The rally faded after the price of U.S. oil flipped from a gain to a steep loss of more than 9 per cent.\nIt had otherwise been an ebullient day for markets worldwide following encouraging signs that the coronavirus pandemic may be close to levelling off in some of the hardest-hit areas of the world.\nEven though economists say a punishing recession is inevitable, the stock market this week has been looking ahead to when economies will reopen from their medically induced coma. A peak in new infections would offer some clarity about about how long the recession may last and how deep it will be.\nInvestors could then, finally, envision the other side of the economic shutdown, after authorities forced businesses to halt in hopes of slowing the spread of the virus. In the meantime, governments around the world are approving or discussing trillions of dollars more of aid for the economy.\nMany professional investors say they've been wary of the recent upsurge and expect more volatility ahead. Those concerns were borne out Tuesday, when the S&P 500 swung up, down, up, down and back up again through the day. It is nevertheless on track to eke out one of the few back-to-back gains for the market since the coronavirus outbreak caused it to start selling off in mid-February.\n\"We are still in what you would call the relief rally off of the prior low,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. He noted that this kind of a rally is common within deep bear markets, Wall Street-speak for when stocks decline 20 per cent\u00a0or more from a peak.\n\"There's no guarantee that the worst is behind us, yet traders believe that at least there is some short-term money to be made,\" Stovall said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 26 points after leaping 900 points at opening.\nIn Toronto, the TSX eked out a small gain of 21 points, after earlier having been up by as much as 450 points.\nOil prices have been even more volatile than the stock market in recent weeks as demand dries up for energy amid a global economy weakened by the coronavirus outbreak. Russia and Saudi Arabia have also been locked in a price war, refusing to cut production even as the world is awash in excess oil.\nPresident Donald Trump said last week that he hoped and expected the two sides could agree on production cutbacks, which helped prices spurt higher temporarily. But investors still aren't convinced they can reach a deal, and benchmark U.S. crude oil fell $2.45, or 9.4 per cent, to settle at $23.63 per barrel.\u00a0\nOil from Canada's oilsands lost more than half its value, closing down $5 a barrel to $3.92.\nEarlier in the trading day, stock markets in Europe and Asia climbed before oil's downward shift.\nThey rallied after China, the first country to lock down wide swaths of its economy to slow the spread of the virus, authorities reported no new deaths over the past 24 hours. Many experts, though, are skeptical of China's virus figures.\nInvestors also see signals that the number of daily infections and deaths may be close to peaking or plateauing in Spain, Italy and New York. The number of daily deaths rose in New York, the centre of the U.S. outbreak, but other statistics were more encouraging, including the average number of people hospitalized each day.\nExperts say more deaths are on the way due to COVID-19, which has already claimed at least 76,000 lives around the world. The U.S. leads the world in confirmed cases with more than 369,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.\nMore economic misery is also on the horizon. Economists expect a report on Thursday to show that 5 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as layoffs sweep the country. That would bring the total to nearly 15 million over the past three weeks. Analysts also expect big companies in upcoming weeks to report their worst quarter of profit declines in more than a decade.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "TSX and NYSE closed for Good Friday but Asian stock markets rise", "description": "Oil loses ground again after producing nations still can't agree on production cuts", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/markets-dollar-oil-friday-1.5529047", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5246630.1565796598!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/germany.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 10, 2020 8:14 AM ET", "2020-04-10T12:17:07.064Z"], "source": null, "content": "Asian shares were steady in quiet Good Friday trading after Wall Street closed out its best week in 45 years thanks to the Federal Reserve's titanic effort to support the economy through the coronavirus crisis.

In all, the city will have been locked down for more than 10 weeks, but the easing is\u00a0a sign for investors that there may be a light at the end of the tunnel North America has just entered into.\nAnother reason for optimism is that U.S. lawmakers seem to be lumbering toward some sort of deal in Washington that could see the world's richest economy pour roughly $2 trillion US into offsetting the impact of the virus there, which has shut down large swathes of the economy.\nAnd the G7 group of rich and powerful nations on Tuesday pledged to work together and do whatever it takes to beat the pandemic, including spending money to help poorer vulnerable nations.\nDespite the optimism, the volatility that has waylaid markets is showing no signs of dissipating completely. Wall Street's so-called fear index,\u00a0the VIX, which measures volatility, fell to 52\u00a0points on Tuesday.

We don't know how to treat it. We don't have a vaccine.

Two of the worst days in the history of the TSX have happened in the past week alone, a pace and depth of selling that eclipses even what was seen during the financial crisis.\nFour times since the start of the sell-off, automatic circuit breakers have kicked in to shut down the markets temporarily amid heavy selling pressure of more than seven\u00a0per cent at a time.\nThose short shutdowns have some people thinking it may be time for a longer, more coordinated one.\u00a0\n\"Things are changing faster than investors can process the impacts and outcomes, and all we're getting is bad news,\" investor Jeff Jongsma\u00a0said in an email to CBC News on Wednesday. \"Perhaps there is value in doing nothing for a few days, to examine the impacts and outcomes?\"\nAndy de Beer, a retiree in Saskatoon, has watched as his savings have been wiped out in the current sell-off, and he estimates he's now back to where he was in 2014. He's in favour of a shutdown mainly because he thinks huge\u00a0institutional traders are making things worse and can find ways of profiting at the expense of smaller investors like him.\n\"Big money managers, the computer-driven sellers and buyers, and the hedge fund operators are driving this for their profit,\" he said.

The Toronto Stock Exchange was shut down for several months in the First World War\u00a0and the exchange shut itself down for two days following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The TSX has also had numerous short shutdowns over the years, including mysterious trading glitches last year and last month, in addition to the recent flurry of circuit breakers.\nThe New York Stock Exchange was shut down all those times and more \u2014 most recently\u00a0for two days following Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The NYSE was also put on ice after the JFK assassination and when U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt\u00a0mandated a shutdown of the entire banking system for a month during the Great Depression.\nBut for now, the people who run the exchanges don't sound like they are leaning toward a similar extended move.\nJohn McKenzie, interim CEO of the TMX Group, which owns and operates the TSX, called the current sell-off \"an exceptional and evolving situation,\" but added\u00a0that there are no current plans to pull the plug.\u00a0\n\"At this point, TMX feels strongly that it is in the best interest of all of our stakeholders, including\u00a0issuers, investors\u00a0and market participants\u00a0that\u00a0the markets remain open,\" he said in a statement emailed to CBC News.\nThe person in charge of the New York Stock Exchange is even more adamant. NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said in a message on social media\u00a0this week it's important for stock markets to stay open \"and for them to function in a fair and orderly manner, as they have been.\"\n\"While we are deeply conscious of, and sympathetic to, investors' concerns around price declines, the market is a reflection of the larger uncertainties that everyone is experiencing during these challenging days. Closing the markets would not change the underlying causes of the market decline, would remove transparency into investor sentiment\u00a0and reduce investors' access to their money,\" she said. \"This would only further compound the current market anxiety.\"\nIt falls well short of a total shutdown, but the NYSE said late Wednesday that it will temporarily close its iconic trading floor in lower Manhattan and move to all-electronic trading beginning Monday as a precautionary step amid the coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0\nDespite the sea of red on stock markets right now, Cunningham isn't the only one who thinks the stock market being open is doing some good right now.\nFrances Donald, global chief economist with\u00a0Manulife Investment Management in Toronto, said\u00a0the solution to the market panic isn't less action on the stock market \u2014 it's more.\n\"We are in the midst\u00a0of one of the largest confidence\u00a0shocks that we've seen in the modern economy,\" she said in a phone interview. \"People are scared for not just their physical health but also their financial health, [so] we need to give them access to their money.\"\nWhile Donald\u00a0sympathizes with retail investors waylaid by seeing several years' worth of gains wiped out on paper, she noted that the way through all the fear and uncertainty\u00a0is to keep markets as transparent as possible.\n\"When you want to sell, someone has to buy.

Even hard-hit Canadian banks made up some ground, and airline shares were up too.\nThe coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has spooked stock market investors this week as they worry about the worst-case scenario for corporate profits and the economy, where factories and supply chains are shut around the world due to quarantines and people stay huddled at home instead of working or spending.\nThat's why many say the market will continue to swing sharply at least until the number of new cases decelerates.\nUntil the market has a clear picture of how bad the virus outbreak will be in North America, stock markets are in for a wild ride, says\u00a0Paul De Sousa, senior vice-president at Sightline Wealth Management in Toronto.\n\"People have been lulled into a false sense of complacency,\" he said, cautioning that volatility will be the name of the game for a while.\u00a0\n\"There's always a\u00a0reversion to the mean in markets,\" he said in an interview, \"and now we've swung\u00a0the pendulum dramatically in the opposite direction.\"\nInvestors have had a \"sell-first, ask questions later\" reaction to the uncertainty, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.\nStill, he urges investors to avoid changing their long-term investment strategies, which can play out over years or decades, because of short-term volatility.\n\"Markets fall quickly, but they can rebound rapidly,\" McBride said. \"Investing is a marathon, not a sprint.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/we-expect-a-level-of-volatility-in-the-stock-market-right-now-1.5496191", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Stock markets finish rough week with another dive into the red", "description": "TSX loses 3% as global stock sell-off continues for 6th day", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/friday-markets-1.5480540", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4604408.1522851005!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tsx-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 28, 2020 4:35 PM ET", "2020-02-28T21:37:14.858Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Toronto Stock Exchange lost 454 points on Friday after a technical glitch shut down trading early the day before \u2014 and investors picked up right where they left off by dumping shares in just about everything.\nCanada's largest stock exchange lost about three per cent of its value\u00a0as the fear over the coronavirus that has settled into financial markets this week continued to batter the share prices of Canadian companies.\nEvery sector was lower, from banks and\u00a0energy companies\u00a0to mining firms, health-care companies and IT.\u00a0\nOnly 17 companies listed on the S&P/TSX Composite Index made gains on Friday, while the other 214 lost ground.\nOil prices slumped again, with a barrel\u00a0of the North American crude benchmark known as West Texas Intermediate off $1.75\u00a0a barrel to barely above $45 US.

It's the latest shudder in Wall Street's wildest week in more than eight years.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 968 points, or 3.6 per cent\u00a0wiping out most of its surge of 1,173 points a day earlier.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange lost 225\u00a0points or more than 1.3 per cent to close at 16,554.\u00a0\nMarkets have been stuck on an up-and-down roller coaster for weeks because of uncertainty about how much damage the outbreak of the new coronavirus will do to the global economy.\nThursday's slide nearly wiped out the surge that stocks had ridden just a day earlier, in part on hopes that more aggressive moves by governments and central banks around the world could help contain the economic fallout.\nThese vicious swings are likely only to continue, as long as the number of new infections continues to accelerate, many analysts and professional investors say. The S&P 500 is on track to move more than 2 per cent\u00a0a fourth straight day, the first time that would have happened since the summer of 2011.\nShort sellers, who make money by betting the market will go down, have had a field day amid all the volatility. Research published Wednesday by analytics firm S3 Partners shows short sellers have made $50 billion US from the sell off since it began last week.\nWatch the video below for an explainer of how short-selling works:\nShort sellers have racked up huge gains by betting against the prices of companies like Tesla, Amazon, Visa, Boeing and Delta during the current market uncertainty\n\"When the markets rebound as the coronavirus effect wanes, we will probably see a pullback in short selling in some of these names as shorts cover to realize their profits,\" S3 said.\nThe growing understanding that the spread of infections may not slow anytime soon is pulling sharply on markets. That pull has taken turns this week with the increasingly worldwide push that authorities are trying to give markets through spending plans and interest-rate cuts.\n\"It's been a roller-coaster market in recent days for equity investors, and today we appear to be on the downward leg for that ride,\" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \"What you need is time, and unfortunately that is still going to result in volatility.\"\nIn China, where the number of new infections has been slowing drastically, Shanghai-traded stocks have rallied nearly 12 per cent\u00a0since hitting a bottom on Feb. 3. They're just 1.4 per cent\u00a0below their highest level since the new virus began to spread late last year.\nFactories in China are gradually reopening, and a return to a sense of normal life may even be on the horizon following swift and severe actions by the government to corral the virus.\nBut elsewhere in the world, the mood is much darker. There are about 17 times as many new infections outside China as in it, according to the World Health Organization. Widening outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran are responsible for the majority of new infections.\nIn the U.S., the death toll climbed to 11 due to the virus. California declared a statewide emergency late Wednesday. Southwest Airlines on Thursday warned its investors that it's seen a significant decline in demand in recent days and an increase in customers cancelling trips.\n\"The Western world is now following some of China's playbook, closing schools and declaring a state of emergency for example, but there is a sense that this is too little, too late,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.\nTravel-related companies continued to fall sharply on worries that frightened customers won't want to confine themselves in planes or boats with others. Royal Caribbean Cruises sank 15.8 per ent, Carnival fell 13.2 per cent\u00a0and American Airlines Group lost 11.1 per cent.\nIt's a sharp turnaround from earlier this year, when a resilient stock market kept climbing to new highs on the hopes that the virus may remain contained in China and be just a short-term challenge.\nNow that a growing list of companies are warning about how the virus is hitting their sales and profits, investors are left with a lot of uncertainty about just how much economic growth and corporate profits will be affected.\n\"We could probably drive a metaphorical truck between the upside and downside cases here,\" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1710609987661", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1584022083704", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/programs/onthecoast/november-22-2019-stock-market-highs-1.5370774", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1704079427775", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/programs/allinaday/money-column-the-psychology-of-a-stock-market-decline-1.5477295", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/how-s-the-premier-handling-the-coastal-gaslink-issue-the-stock-market-and-investments-1.5480568", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-response-to-coronavirus-is-driven-by-stock-market-says-health-watcher-1.5487298", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1707078211521", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Stock markets broadly up on Brexit breakthrough", "description": "Markets also got a lift from solid financial results reported by Netflix, banks ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-up-brexit-1.5324319", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5324502.1571328669!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/financial-markets-wall-street.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 17, 2019 12:18 PM ET", "2019-10-17T16:18:52.454Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada's main stock index edged higher as gains in the materials sector offset losses in the financial stocks, while U.S. stock markets pushed higher.\nThe S&P/TSX composite index was up 5.96 points at 16,433.14.\nIn New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 37.66 points at 27,039.64.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 800 points to close at 25,478\u00a0or almost three per cent on Wednesday,\u00a0as recession fears settled in for stock investors. The Toronto Stock Exchange fared slightly better, down 300 points or almost two per cent to 16,335\u00a0on the same fears.\n\"With the yield curve inverting it certainly raises that [recession] prospect,\" Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for R.W. Baird & Co., told CBC News. \"I\u00a0don't think there's any kind of mystery as to why we're seeing this kind of weakness.\"\nPart of the fear that investors have is that central banks may be running out of ammunition to stimulate growth as countries offset each other's attempts to boost growth with looser fiscal policy.\nWorsening economic data, weak inflationary pressures, the escalating U.S.-China trade war and intensifying tensions between protesters in Hong Kong and the Chinese government have boosted demand for safe-haven debt, sending many European government bond yields deeper into negative territory while the longest-dated U.S. Treasury yields have fallen to record lows.\nThe inversion of key parts of the Treasury yield curve, in which investors in short-term holdings get paid more than those in long-term ones, has historically been a reliable indicator of a coming recession. Typically longer term debt pays out more than short term debt, so when the outlook for the short term looks better than the long term one, it's taken as a sign of trouble ahead.\nOn Wednesday, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note tipped 2.1 basis points below two-year Treasury yields, the first time this spread has been negative since 2007, according to Refinitiv data.\nThe inversion rattled investors already worried that a U.S.-China trade war might trigger a global recession and kill off a decade-long bull market on Wall Street. Major U.S. stock indexes were down about two per cent as a result.\n\"People are becoming more convinced that global growth is weakening and people are starting to see some signs of transmission into U.S. sentiment,\" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate\u00a0strategist at TD Securities in New York.\n\"That longer-end rates are rallying does suggest some lack of confidence that the central banks will actually be able to do anything about the slowing global growth momentum,\" he added.\nAt the start of the year, markets and central banks were more optimistic on the global economic outlook. The European Central Bank had just ended its stimulative bond purchase program while the Fed was seen as likely to continue hiking rates after raising borrowing costs four times in 2018.\nThat shifted in March, however, when the Fed abruptly brought an end to its hiking cycle.\nIn conjunction with disappointing U.S. manufacturing data, the move sparked broad repositioning that led the three-month/10-year yield curve to invert for the first time since 2007. That was followed in July by the Fed's first rate cut since 2008.\nThe U.S. central bank looks better placed to ease conditions than many of its counterparts as it still has room to cut rates. Bond markets are priced for two additional U.S. rate cuts this year and a third in the first half of next year.\nThe ECB, meanwhile, is evaluating cutting rates further into negative territory and undertaking another bond purchase program.\nThe Bank of Japan is similarly looking at lowering its negative interest rates and expanding asset purchases.\nThe Bank of Canada, meanwhile, isn't immune from the sudden movement toward rate cuts, with investors pricing in about a one in four chance of a rate cut next month, and odds that jump to better than 90 per cent by next year.\nBy easing financial conditions, a central bank can stimulate an economy by making business and consumer loans cheaper, while the depreciation of the local currency that results from lower interest rates can boost exports.\nAs central banks compete for more dovish policies, however, they threaten to cancel each other out, making each move less effective.\n\"The reality is that central banks around the world are responding to a diminished outlook, looking to cut rates and ease financial conditions, so basically it means the Fed's not cutting rates in a vacuum,\" said Jon Hill, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.\nLast week, the New Zealand central bank sent investors scurrying to safe-haven currencies by cutting rates more than expected and indicating that it may take rates below zero if needed.\nA chorus of other central banks including those in India, Thailand and the Philippines also cut rates during the week.\n\"Overburdening of monetary policy in recent years has made it almost ineffective, or even harmful in some cases, as central banks are trying to address problems beyond their control, with limited and often experimental policy tools,\" Bank of America Merrill Lynch FX strategist Athanasios Vamvakidis said in a recent report.\n\"We see signs that this is not a sustainable situation and may not end up well,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Peter Armstrong", "title": "Why are stock markets soaring amid so much uncertainty?", "description": "Despite gloomy forecasts and slow growth, it doesn't take much to spur investors", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-market-trump-uncertainty-1.5347006", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4795916.1535029348!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/frontpagenationalbullmarket.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 05, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-11-05T09:00:00.792Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "All three major U.S. stock market indexes hit record levels to start the week.

Spend your money well!\"\nBut there's something of a paradox at play. In spite of Trump's enthusiasm, most forecasts remain gloomy. Uncertainty still dominates the global landscape. Global growth has slowed.\nYet\u00a0it doesn't seem to take much more than a hint of good news to spur investors.\nFor example, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had said early on Monday that trade talks with China have \"come very far along.\"\u00a0It was\u00a0a vague statement and made no allusion that anything is final. It was\u00a0also not the first time investors have heard that sort of thing from either the U.S. administration or the Chinese. Still, that sliver of positivity helped drive\u00a0up markets around the world.\u00a0\n\"It is fascinating to see equity investors, like Pavlov's dog, respond over and over again to the same piece of news,\" David\u00a0Rosenberg, chief economist at the investment firm Gluskin Sheff\u00a0wrote in a letter to clients.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, one of the biggest forces in global economics right now is uncertainty \u2014 over the state of the U.S.-China trade war, over a slowing global economy. China recently posted its lowest\u00a0quarterly growth in 26 years. Europe is struggling too.\u00a0And some of the gloomiest signals are coming from bond markets around the world.\nBank of Nova Scotia's deputy chief economist Brett House says \"erratic policy from the White House\" has weighed on growth. So,\u00a0even a small step toward removing some of that uncertainty, like Ross's comment about China,\u00a0is bound to drive up stocks.\n\"While it doesn't roll back\u00a0much of the damage that's been done,\" he says. \"It takes some of the uncertainty on the forward outlook away.\"\nHouse says all those unknowns have\u00a0shaved as much as 0.75 per cent off U.S. GDP growth.\u00a0\nAnd it's weighed on stock market returns as well. The Dow and the S&P have made notorious\u00a0gains since Trump won the presidency. It's part of the longest bull run in history. But those gains levelled off over the past two years. At the beginning of October, the S&P stood about where it had in January\u00a02018. The more recent highs have broken through that plateau, but there just doesn't seem to be as much wind in the sails of optimism any more.\nRosenberg points out that indexes like the Dow and the S&P which trade in larger, more globally oriented companies are making gains. But indexes that cater to smaller companies aren't doing as well.\nRosenberg mused whether those bigger companies are doing better because they benefit from a perception of a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions, while indexes more tied to the domestic U.S. economy aren't gaining nearly as much.\u00a0He says the Russel\u00a02000 is still nine per cent\u00a0off its all-time high.\n\"The [smaller companies]\u00a0derive 79% of their revenue from the U.S. economy,\" he wrote. \"Q4 GDP estimates now show a US economy sputtering\u00a0and catching down\u00a0to the rest of the world.\"\nThe other major factor here is the cost of money.\u00a0\n\"The vast majority of the worlds' major central banks [are]\u00a0lowering interest rates and making money even cheaper,\" said House, at Scotiabank.\u00a0\"That provides a further lift to real economic activity\"\nBut, House adds, it also means the alternative to investing in\u00a0stocks doesn't\u00a0look terribly attractive to investors.\nUsually, the bond market acts as a sort of safe haven for investors worried about risk. In North America, bond yields are at historically low levels. Worldwide, the bond market is increasingly dominated by bonds with a negative yield. Instead of paying investors a small amount, negative yielding bonds actually charge investors for the privilege of investing.\u00a0\nRight now the amount of bonds with a negative yield has ballooned to a record $15 trillion worldwide. That's a whole lot of money very worried about the future.\nSo stock markets and bond markets are telling us dramatically different things about the economy right now. There's nothing inherently wrong with them sending different signals. But they won't remain at odds for ever. Eventually, either the optimistic stock market or the deeply troubled bond market will be proven right.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "North American markets end best year since 2013 thanks to big gains in tech stocks", "description": "The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was up 19% on the year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/markets-year-to-date-1.5411932", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5411980.1577827746!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/aptopix-financial-markets-wall-street.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 31, 2019 5:10 PM ET", "2020-01-02T15:30:15.219Z"], "source": null, "content": "Stocks are closing out their best year since 2013, led by huge gains in technology stocks.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index soared 28.9 per cent\u00a0for the year.\nMajor indexes ended slightly higher Tuesday after spending most of the day wavering between small gains and losses.

That puts an even bigger spotlight on Friday's jobs report, which economists expect to show an acceleration in hiring.\nHousehold spending has been the bulwark holding up the economy, particularly when manufacturing and business spending are under threat, and a strong job market helps households keep spending.

They must Cut Rates bigger and faster, and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening NOW,\" he said.\nThe Fed slashed its interest rate last week for the first time in more than a decade, and Trump wants that trend to continue so the U.S. economy will be supercharged by cheap access to money. Investors are now assuming another rate cut next month, followed by two more after that.\n\"There is almost a paranoia amongst central bankers to avoid any potential financial hiccups that might hurt the real economy and cause a slowdown,\" Jefferies strategist Sean Darby wrote in a report.\nThe war of words between Trump, China and now his own central bank has left investors reeling, with huge gains and declines.\u00a0\"(Markets) are moving lower on global growth concerns,\" said Mike Loewengart, vice president, investment strategy, at E*TRADE Financial Corp. \"And coming into question is the broader fundamental strength of economies around the world.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged on Monday before recovering a little on Tuesday, and then seesawing on Trump's Fed fight on Wednesday.

In fact, some market indicators anticipate\u00a0three quarter-point cuts in 2019. They may be disappointed.\nCertainly market analysts of all kinds will be examining Powell's every nuance hinting when the next cut might be coming.\nWith signs of trouble brewing in the Gulf of Hormuz \u2014 where\u00a0the U.S. last week\u00a0blamed Iran for attacks on shipping\u00a0\u2014 and with continuing trade squabbles between the U.S. and three of its biggest trading partners, the economic future is at least as hard to predict as ever and maybe more so.\nA survey of economists by the Wall Street Journal showed most are convinced the next rate move by the Fed will be down, not up.\nRecently there has been widespread fear the hot U.S. economy is coming off the boil and actually may soon be helping to nudge the world into recession. While much disputed by those who say,\u00a0\"It's different this time,\"\u00a0inverted yield curve data in Canada and the United States\u00a0point to growth going negative as soon as 2020.\nCutting interest rates is exactly what central banks do to boost a sagging economy. But there are good reasons to expect that Powell will not cut just to prop up markets or to make Trump happy. When his turn for a rate decision comes in July, it is reasonable\u00a0to think Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz\u00a0will also be cautious.\nIf Powell fails to make sharp cuts in\u00a0interest rates this year, he will be flying in the\u00a0face of both the president and of futures market predictions. On the other hand he will be acting with the backing of some very powerful market players.\nAs of Friday, prognostications derived from Fed funds futures market show an 18 per cent chance of a cut this week. But that rises to 83 per cent in July and continues to climb during the year to 98 per cent by December.\nAnother way of examining the futures data seems to predict U.S. rates as low as 1.75 per cent by the end of the year, which implies three quarter-point rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2019.\nInterestingly, two big U.S. market players, UBS and Goldman Sachs, say the futures markets have it wrong.\n\"We believe it would take a recession to provoke the magnitude of rate cuts currently being priced by the market, and this remains unlikely in our view,\" said an economist report from UBS wealth management. A senior Goldman spokesman\u00a0expressed similar skepticism\u00a0in a CNBC interview.\nOf course that does not mean the Fed would not respond to a\u00a0economic disruption much milder\u00a0than\u00a0Powell's predecessor Ben Bernanke faced in 2008. But of course with interest rates just over two per cent now, Powell has much less room to cut before hitting zero, where everything becomes more complicated.\nWhile most economists say a trade war will cut into growth, there are wide differences in estimates of\u00a0how big the impact will be and when it might hit. A sharp rise\u00a0in energy prices and a boost in military spending caused by Middle East\u00a0sabre-rattling could have the opposite effect.\nAs Trump keeps insisting,\u00a0Powell has room to cut. Inflation remains tame. And there would be positive effects for parts of the economy. Interest rate cuts push markets higher almost immediately, which would make people who own stocks (and real estate) happy.\nAny deeper economic impact would be much slower and more uncertain. With rates as low as they already\u00a0are, and in the current climate, it's unclear how many business investors would would be convinced to borrow to expand just because of slightly lower rates. And that rate cut would take months or years to become apparent in the wider economy.\nEven if the U.S. economy continues to weaken slowly, the question Powell and his committee may be asking themselves is how to get the biggest bang for their rate-cutting buck.\nAfter the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, Powell, and Poloz too, might be inclined not to waste a few cuts here and there to cheer up markets and keep people like Trump calm, instead saving the small amount of cutting room they have\u00a0for when the long expansion actually ends.\u00a0\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Stock markets remain jittery even as Trump and China try to ease trade war fears", "description": "As G7 summit nears end, China offers to renew bargaining, U.S president says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-china-markets-trade-1.5259741", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5259746.1566823802!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-trump.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 26, 2019 9:17 AM ET", "2019-08-26T13:17:28.901Z"], "source": null, "content": "The United States and China sought to ease trade war tensions on Monday, with Beijing calling for calm and U.S. President Donald Trump predicting a deal after markets fell in response to new tariffs from both countries.\nTrump, speaking on the sidelines of the G7 summit of world leaders in France, said Chinese officials had contacted U.S. trade counterparts overnight and offered to return to the negotiating table.\nVice-Premier Liu He, who has been leading the talks with Washington, said on Monday China was willing to resolve the trade dispute through \"calm\" negotiations and resolutely opposed the escalation of the conflict.\nTrump welcomed that language and, days after referring to President Xi Jinping as an enemy, heaped praise on his Chinese counterpart.\n\"They want calm, and that's a great thing, frankly.

I can say we are having very meaningful talks, much more meaningful I would say than any time, frankly.\"\nBefore Trump spoke on Monday, global stock markets reeled, while China's yuan currency fell to an 11-year low. Investors streamed into the safe harbours of sovereign bonds and gold.\nThe U.S. president, who at times predicts a deal will happen and at other times says he is happy with the tariff situation, said talks would start again soon and a deal would come.\n\"I think we are going to have a deal,\" he said.\nThe two sides had been slated to meet in September in Washington, but it was unclear last week whether the new tariff tit-for-tat would alter those plans.\nThe United States accuses China of multiple economic sins, including intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, and forced technology transfer by U.S. companies to their Chinese partners as a requirement for doing business in China. China denies the U.S. allegations.\nBeijing and Washington were close to a deal last spring but U.S. officials said China backed away from an agreed text over a reluctance to change laws to address U.S. complaints.\nThe trade war has affected businesses all over the world and disrupted supply chains. Trump recently urged U.S. companies to move their operations out of China, but it was not clear how or whether his efforts to order such a move would work.\nLiu said on Monday: \"We welcome enterprises from all over the world, including the United States, to invest and operate in China.\n\"We will continue to create a good investment environment, protect intellectual property rights, promote the development of smart intelligent industries with our market open, resolutely oppose technological blockades and protectionism, and strive to protect the completeness of the supply chain.\"\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump could order companies out of China under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act if he declared a national emergency.\nChinese state media on Monday hit out at the United States.\nThe official China Daily said Washington would \"never be allowed to control China's fate.\"\n\"It has become unquestionably clear that his administration's tariff war against China is politically motivated. What Washington wants from its largest trade partner is for it to be content to play second fiddle and meekly do as it demands,\" the English-language paper wrote in an editorial.\nThe Global Times, a widely read tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said: \"U.S. companies are welcome to invest and operate in the Chinese market, but if some U.S. companies want to obey Trump's order and join Washington's trade war, the result is bleak.

This, despite veteran investors such as Warren Buffett and Stanley Druckenmiller selling many of their stock positions and appearing cautious in the current market environment.\nThere are several reasons for the uptick in DIY investors \u2014\u00a0some see the recent market crash as an opportunity that only comes along every five to 10\u00a0years, while others are looking to stock trading to replace one of their other vices. For example, people who used to spend a lot of their time analyzing sports teams for the purpose of\u00a0betting have shifted their focus and are now betting on stocks.\nIf you are considering becoming a DIY investor you will need to open a discount brokerage. I use two discount trading accounts, Questrade and Wealthsimple Trade. Questrade offers more in the way of research and recommendations but charges a commission to transact stocks, whereas Wealthsimple Trade is commission free.\nAt the time I opened my brokerage accounts, these two brokers suited my needs \u2014 but this was years ago and it's best to do your own research. There are plenty of useful \"brokerage review\" articles and YouTube videos to help you make your decision.\nYou may be wondering, \"Why would I pay to trade stocks when there is a commission-free option available?\"\n\"Commission-free\" does not mean there are no costs. There is often a 1.5 per cent\u00a0foreign exchange premium/charge on all purchases of international stocks. To avoid this premium, I mainly buy my Canadian stocks in my commission-free account and my U.S. or international stocks in a commission account.\nDepending on the size of the trade, it is often cheaper to pay $5 to $10 per trade rather than the foreign exchange premium charged by non-commission brokerages.\nOther considerations are the sign-up bonuses offered, which range from free money to free stocks, as well as the stability of the trading platform. Last March, when trading volumes spiked, several discount brokerages, including the one I use, experienced system outages, freezing all stock transactions at a very critical time.\nMy advice to first-time DIY investors is to be prepared for a lot of market volatility and a high likelihood that they will lose money. For beginners, I recommend buying indexes such as the TSX 60 or S&P500, which can be done using Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), over individual stocks.\nA common mistake \u2014 one I have made many times \u2014\u00a0is being over-concentrated in one company or sector.\nThis often happens when a trend \u2014 such as tech, cannabis, or precious metals \u2014 becomes \"hot.\" Investors pile into these sectors (buying high) but if the hype\u00a0doesn't live up to expectations, many exit their positions, usually only after the stock prices have crashed (sell low).\nI had to learn this expensive lesson many times before it finally sunk in. I now purposely keep an embarrassingly long list of stock positions in my brokerage account that are in the red with little or no hope of recovering. I use this list as a cautionary tale\u00a0in case I get overly excited about the prospects of a company or industry. It reminds me that it's OK\u00a0to invest in my new favourite business \u2014\u00a0just not\u00a0everything.\nKeep in mind the adage, \"don't put all your eggs in one basket.\"\nIf that basket drops, the eggs break and you are left with a mess or, for many DIY investors, a lot of losses in their brokerage account.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Prices still remain a third lower than at the end of 2019.\nWATCH | Canadian oil producers don't see relief after OPEC deal to cut output:\n\"Prices can be expected to be strong from Monday, keeping their $40 US plus levels,\" said Bjornar Tonhaugen from Rystad Energy.\nSaudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, and Russia have to perform a balancing act of pushing up oil prices to meet their budget needs while not driving them much above $50 US a barrel to avoid encouraging a resurgence of rival U.S. shale production.\nThe April deal was agreed under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants to avoid U.S. oil industry bankruptcies.\nTrump, who previously threatened to pull U.S. troops out of Saudi Arabia if Riyadh did not act, spoke to the Russian and Saudi leaders before Saturday's talks, saying he was happy with the price recovery.\nWhile oil prices have partially recovered, they are still well below the costs of most U.S. shale producers. Shutdowns, layoffs and cost cutting continue across the United States.\nAs global lockdown restrictions to halt the spread of the coronavirus are being eased, oil demand is expected to exceed supply sometime in July but OPEC has yet to clear 1 billion barrels of excess oil inventories accumulated since March.\nTonhaugen said Saturday's decisions would help OPEC reduce inventories at a rate of 3 million to 4 million bpd over July-August.\n\"The quicker stocks fall, the higher prices will get. And that is crucial for many OPEC+ economies, whose fiscal budgets count on oil sales,\" he said.\nNigeria's petroleum ministry said Abuja backed the idea of compensating for its excessive output in May and June.\nIraq, with one of the worst compliance rates in May, agreed to extra cuts although it was not clear how Baghdad would reach agreement with oil majors on curbing Iraqi output.\nIraq produced 520,000 bpd above its quota in May, while overproduction by Nigeria was 120,000 bpd, Angola's was 130,000 bpd, Kazakhstan's was 180,000 bpd and Russia's was 100,000 bpd, according to OPEC+ data.\nOPEC+'s joint ministerial monitoring committee, known as the JMMC, would now meet every month until December to review the market, compliance and recommend levels of cuts.\nThe next JMMC meeting is scheduled for June 18, while the next full OPEC and OPEC+ meeting will take place on Nov. 30-Dec. 1.\n"}, {"author": "Tony Seskus", "title": "What U.S. shale's woes mean for Canada's oil and gas industry", "description": "American oil output could hit 2-year low this month, forecast predicts", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/us-shale-oil-impact-on-canada-1.5593771", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5593850.1591043639!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/oil-discovery-west-texas.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 03, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-06-03T08:00:00.849Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The rise of the U.S.\u00a0shale oil sector shook up energy markets worldwide, but the economic wallop of the pandemic is now rattling that same industry to the core.\nThe situation has led to billions of dollars of losses and fears of a wave of bankruptcies, while some believe a recovery could be at least a year away or even more.\u00a0\u00a0\nShale's struggles are making news around the globe and could have various implications for the Canadian oil and gas sector, whether it's on prices or discussions on energy security.\n\"What we're seeing right now is a very rapid response to the COVID-19-led demand shock and price collapse,\" said analyst Kevin Birn\u00a0with IHS Markit.\nThe most immediate effect has been on oil.\nAs lockdowns took place across North America, demand for fuel collapsed as did the price of crude oil, which briefly turned negative for the first time in April.\u00a0\nWith prices plunging, Canadian companies curtailed production by at least 800,000 barrels per day. But cuts south of the border have been larger and have come on faster than some expected.\u00a0\nRystad Energy expects American production to bottom out at 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, down 2.2 million bpd from March.\nU.S. monthly output is not likely to exceed 11.7 million bpd before 2022, \"a staggering difference from the nearly 12.9 million bpd achieved in March 2020,\" Rystad said in a note last week.\nThe shut-in of so much production has helped bolster the benchmark price for a barrel of North American crude into the mid-$30s US.\u00a0Historic cuts by members of the OPEC oil cartel and optimism surrounding the opening\u00a0of economies are also key factors.\nThough current prices \u2014 down roughly\u00a040 per cent from the start of the year\u00a0\u2014 are far from great, they should help improve company cash flows even if they don't lead to a big ramp-up in production.\u00a0\nBut oil markets still face significant challenges, including the unpredictability of the pandemic.\nBirn said he is hesitant to get too excited, despite signs that the lowest point of the oil price collapse may now be behind the industry.\n\"This supply that's been pulled off in rapid succession both in North America, and also OPEC, also will come back into the market \u2014\u00a0and inventories remain at record highs,\" he said.\n\"These factors are going to weigh on price for a while.\"\nBirn also expects the U.S. oil exports to fall, meaning its contribution to meeting global oil demand could slip through the period.\nWith falling crude production in North America, the U.S. may also face having to import more oil from overseas and Canada's share may decline as a share of the total, he said.\nThat means North American self-sufficiency in energy could decline.\n\"Canada and the United States were each other's largest source of foreign oil,\" Birn said.\n\"While Canada will remain the U.S. primary source of imports, the North American reliance on offshore imports could increase.\"\nThe implications of slowing U.S. shale production aren't limited to crude oil.\u00a0\nIt may also have an impact on the natural gas sector by helping lift prices moving into late 2020, said Morgan Kwan of RS Energy Group, now part of Enverus.\n\"Because we've seen such a drastic downturn in U.S. shale production, especially in the Permian, that means there's a significant cutback in associated gas production,\" she said.\n\"So this actually speaks really well for Canadian gas producers, whereas the last couple of years, Canadian gas prices have been pretty challenged.\"\nWestern Canada's natural gas sector has experienced some tough years due to low prices.\nKwan said AECO, the western Canadian gas benchmark price, has\u00a0since 2018\u00a0been trading\u00a0from $1 US per million British thermal units (MMBTU)\u00a0to $2 US per MMBTU, even periodically dropping below $1 US.\nOver the next heating season this winter, RS Energy is\u00a0forecasting AECO to strengthen within the $2.50 range.\n\"That doesn't seem like a lot, but for the Canadian gas producer, there's a lot of assets that open up with that input price,\" she said.\nMartin King, a senior analyst at RBN Energy, said though things are looking better for Canadian natural gas, his view is one of \"guarded optimism.\"\nWhile he's hopeful lower associated gas supplies can help tighten the market and improve pricing, he's watching to see what happens with U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).\nThe U.S. has emerged as a global LNG producer but demand has weakened due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gas stocks in many countries are also average or above.\u00a0\n\"When we get to the winter, what is going to be a very interesting and unpredictable dynamic will be how much U.S. LNG exports \u2026 get turned away by international buyers and pushed back to the U.S. market,\" King said.\n\"There's lots of gas out there.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Zoom profits soar as pandemic spurs boom in video chatting", "description": "300M users a day now, up from 10M at the start of 2020", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/zoom-earnings-1.5596289", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5596310.1591189529!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/zoom-boom.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 03, 2020 9:16 AM ET", "2020-06-03T13:50:24.736Z"], "source": null, "content": "Zoom Video Communications is rapidly emerging as the latest internet gold mine as millions of people flock to its conferencing service to see colleagues, friends and family while tethered to their homes during the pandemic.\nTuesday's release of the once-obscure company's financial results for the February-April period provided a window into the astronomical growth that has turned it into a Wall Street star.\nZoom's revenue for its fiscal first-quarter more than doubled from the same time last year to $328 million, resulting a profit of $27 million \u2014 up from just $198,000 a year ago.\nThe numbers exceeded analysts' already heightened expectations, providing another lift to a rocketing stock that has more than tripled in price so far this year while the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index has fallen 5 per cent.\nAfter a big run-up leading up to Tuesday's highly anticipated announcement, Zoom's stock initially rose even higher in extended trading. But it abruptly reversed course and fell more than 3 per cent\u00a0after company executives acknowledged during a video discussion that some of its newfound users might depart during the second half of the year if health worries caused by the novel corornavirus dissipate.\nEven if the shares trade in similar fashion during Wednesday's regular session, the stock will still be hovering around $200 \u2014 more than five times the company's initial public offering price of $36 less than 14 months ago.\nThe surge left Zoom with a market value of about $59 billion through Tuesday \u2014 greater than the combined market values of the four largest U.S. airlines, which have seen their businesses hammered by the coronavirus outbreak that has dramatically curtailed travel.\n\"Videoconferencing is going to become a mainstream service,\" predicted Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, who co-founded the company nine years ago. He made the remarks during the video conference that at one point attracted more than 3,000 participants, a reflection of the intense interest in the company and its hot stock.\nIn a sign that the company still expects phenomenal growth in the months ahead, Zoom forecast revenue of roughly $500 million for its current quarter ending in July, more than quadrupling from the same time last year. For its full fiscal year, Zoom now expects revenue of about $1.8 billion, nearly tripling in a year.\nZoom's boom has come despite privacy and security problems that enabled outsiders to make uninvited \u2014 and sometimes crude \u2014 appearances during other people's video conferences.\nThe concerns prompted some schools to stop using Zoom for online classes that have become widespread since February, although the company's efforts to introduce more security protection has brought some back to the service. More than 100,000 schools worldwide are now using Zoom for online classes, according to the company.\nOverall, Zoom now has more than 300 million daily participants attending a meeting held on its service, up from 10 million five months ago. Those numbers include people who join multiple Zoom meetings during the same day, something that has been happening more recently in recent months.\nBut the once-weak privacy controls also helped make Zoom extremely easy to use, one of the reasons it became such a popular way to hold online classes, business meetings and virtual cocktail hours after most of the U.S. began ordering people to stay at home in effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\nZoom also offers a free version of its service, another factor in its popularity at a time when about 40 million people in the U.S. have lost their jobs since mid-March, raising the spectre of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nThe San Jose, California, company has always made most of its money from companies that subscribe to a more sophisticated version of its service that traditionally has been used for business meetings among employees working in offices far apart from each other.\nBut the pandemic-driven shutdown turned Zoom into a tool for employees who once worked alongside each other, but have been doing their jobs from home during the past few months.\nZoom ended April with 265,400 corporate customers with at least 10 employees, more than quadrupling from the same time last year. About 30 per cent\u00a0of the company's revenue in the most recent quarter came from users with fewer than 10 employees, up from 20 per cent\u00a0in the November-January period.\nAlthough Zoom remains focused on servicing its corporate customers, Yuan is hoping to figure out ways to make money from the all the socializing and learning that is happening on the service, too. Some analysts have speculated that eventually may involve showing ads on the free version of Zoom, although the company hasn't given any indication it will do that. \"There are a lot of opportunities ahead of us,\" Yuan said in Tuesday's video conference without elaborating.\nZoom offers an encrypted service for its paying customers, but the CEO reminded its millions of new free users that their Zoom meetings are not encrypted and never will be. \"Free users for sure we don't want to give that because we also want to work together with FBI, with local law enforcement in case some people use Zoom for a bad purpose,\" Yuan said in a webinar discussing the financial results, according to Bloomberg.\nIf it hopes to continue to expand, Zoom also will also likely have to do a better job of protecting the privacy of its video conferences. To help achieve that goal, Yuan has been consulting since April with Alex Stamos, a highly respected online security expert who previously worked at Yahoo and Facebook. Both those companies encountered their only security and privacy problems, too.\nZoom's success is also drawing stiffer competition from much larger companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook.\n"}, {"author": "John Last", "title": "Trappers have eyes on August auction as a wild fur industry comeback", "description": "Spring auction, normally highlight of year, cancelled due to COVID-19", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/wild-fur-auction-august-1.5597480", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5597532.1591224235!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/rack-of-furs-in-n-w-t.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jun 06, 2020 6:00 AM CT", "2020-06-06T12:00:00.640Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "After the COVID-19 pandemic forced the last remaining wild fur auction online, trappers are hoping plans for an in-person auction in August will bring buyers back.\nThe North Bay-based Fur Harvesters Auction is\u00a0the only place left where trappers can sell wild-caught fur in North America, and one of just a handful worldwide.\nBut their spring auction, set to be hosted in Toronto in March, was forced to cancel due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe auction house tried to move the auction online, but in the end saw just a fraction of their stock sold.\nMark Downey, the auction's president and CEO, estimated they sold just 30 per cent of their normal volume.\n\"Fur is a very \u2026 hands-on thing,\" he said. \"You've got to look at it, appraise it, touch it, feel it.\"\nDowney said while some low-cost items, like beaver and muskrat, sold in large quantities \"sight unseen,\" many of Canada's most plentiful varieties failed to move at all.\n\"When it comes to the high end luxury items such as Canadian sables (marten), lynx, bobcats, fancy timberwolves \u2014 [high-priced] items \u2014 it's very difficult,\" Downey said, as most buyers will want to handle the fur before agreeing to a sale.\nMarten, known as sable in the industry, is a staple of trappers' catch across the country, and especially in the Northwest Territories, where government buyers will pay a $65 advance on every pelt.\n\"It is uncommon to have the collection of marten and lynx remain unsold,\"\u00a0Francois Rossouw, the biologist who oversees the territory's fur-buying program, wrote in an email.\nLast season, the N.W.T. purchased $450,000 worth of furs, but just 27 per cent of that sold in the spring online auction.\nNow, Downey said he has a \"whole year's collection of sable\" sitting in warehouses in North Bay, Winnipeg and Wisconsin\u00a0\u2014\u00a0all full to the brim.\nThe auction house is preparing to sell that fur at an in-person auction with 20 to 30 trusted brokers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 expected to be mostly\u00a0from Canada\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in the last week of August. The location still hasn't been determined.\nThe glut of fur held back from spring will \"definitely\" have an impact on prices when they finally hit the market in August, Downey said. And that's not all.\n\"The retail stores, basically around the world, have been shut down,\" he said. \"Macy's and Sachs in New York City, they're not selling anything.\"\n\"The companies that buy on their behalf, their orders are definitely going to be lower.\"\nFor trappers in the N.W.T., that drop in prices will hurt less than elsewhere. The Genuine Mackenzie Valley Fur program pays trappers bonuses when pelts that sell over the advance, but trappers keep that advance even if they sell under.\n\"The Genuine Mackenzie Valley Fur \u2026 program is designed to protect trappers from market downturns and unexpected events exactly like the present,\" reads a release sent to trappers from the program's directors.\n\"The current situation with COVID-19 is a good example of the program performing as it should, keeping trapping as a viable option at a time when employment opportunities in communities may be limited,\" Rossouw wrote to CBC.\n\"Financially the program can withstand these delays.\"\nIn those places where trappers can't rely on a guaranteed price from the government, trappers have had to adapt to fluctuating prices in other ways.\n\"Trappers have made themselves much more than commercial fur harvesters,\" said Bill Abercrombie, the president of the Alberta Trappers\u00a0Association. \"We've made ourselves educators about the land and about wildlife\u2026. We are also a critical cog in the wheel in conservation and conservation research in this province.\"\nEven with the delay getting to market, Abercrombie said trappers have still been able to get cash for their furs from intermediary buyers. He also said the good showing for beavers suggests demand for some wild furs may even be growing.\n\"I'll look forward to seeing what the demand is in August,\" he said.\nFor now, Downey said trappers across the country seem to be sticking together.\n\"They know what we're up against,\" he said. \"We're doing our best to \u2026 get the stuff sold in a professional fashion to the highest price we can possibly sell it.\"\n\"Trappers are probably, of all the people in the world \u2026 the most self-sufficient.

If you are relying on a defined benefit pension plan and your organization has funded it well, then it doesn't make a difference.\nBut\u00a0defined benefit pension plans are becoming more and more scarce, so the majority of people are in a situation where they have a portfolio, where an individual is dependent\u00a0on what's in their portfolio.\nIt's more about where you save and how much. Everyone is going to have a different amount saved and it depends on how much you want during retirement.\u00a0\nCBC K-W: How has COVID-19 impacted those thinking about retiring?\nJames Thompson:\u00a0I think\u00a0that it has forced people to evaluate what they want in retirement if they want to retire\u00a0now.\nThe only way to do it may be to reduce the amount you spend in the first few years of retirement because\u00a0you don't want to draw down on your stocks, which have fallen by a bunch.\u00a0\nWe have lots of research that says that stocks tend to do this every once in a while and selling stocks when they fall is not a good thing.\nWhat you want to do is try to delay selling those undervalued stocks. If you can reduce the amount that you use at the beginning of your retirement\u00a0\u2014\u00a0if you're doing it right now\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you may find that by the time you ramp up spending, stocks may have recovered by then.\nCBC K-W: A question some may be asking is: \"Am I going to have to work longer?\"\nJames Thompson:\u00a0This happened in the credit crisis (2008) when we saw big drops in stock prices, and yes, there are going to be a group of people who may have to work longer. That's a possibility, but it's not a definite.\nYou can retire on time, you just need to plan for it ... what you can tolerate while reducing how much you spend in retirement until things recover. That's your most important factor.\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo: Should people be putting\u00a0money into their RRSPs?\nJames Thompson:\u00a0The biggest recommendation\u00a0out there, and what historical data has shown us is, it's not a good time to panic and sell.\nRRSPs are meant for long-term savings and in these big market dips, if we all sell off our stocks and ship it all into debt, we end up missing out on quite a bit when stocks recover.\nThe recommendation is to add more stocks if at all possible, which for most people is tough right now. Most people don't have a lot of disposable\u00a0income right now to put into the market.\u00a0\nThere are other areas of savings.

The stock of the company, Massachusetts-based Moderna, jumped 21.1 per cent.\nInvestors were also encouraged by remarks over the weekend from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who expressed optimism that the U.S. economy could begin to recover in the second half of the year.

July Brent crude oil, the international standard, vaulted 7.1 per cent\u00a0to $34.81 a barrel.\nBonds yields rose, another sign that pessimism was diminishing.

Hopes for a relatively quick rebound and unprecedented moves by the Federal Reserve and Congress to stem the economic pain fueled a historic rebound for stocks in April.\nMay got off to a downbeat start as investors balance cautious optimism of a recovery as economies around the world slowly open up again against worries that the moves could lead to another surge in coronavirus infections and more economic uncertainty. But Monday's strong start to the week reversed all of the market's losses so far this month.\n\"We had a near 30 per cent\u00a0advance from the March 23 low to April 17, and then basically treaded water for a month as investors were expecting some sort of a retest of the prior low, which obviously did not come,\" Stovall said. \"Usually, markets need to catch their breath after a sprint higher.\"\nWall Street is hoping that the reopening of businesses and the relaxation of stay-at-home mandates continue without any major setbacks, paving the way for corporate profits to bounce back.\nEurope has been taking steps to reopen its economy more widely, and so far, new infections and deaths have slowed considerably across the continent. Some countries there started easing lockdowns a month ago and even the harshest shutdowns \u2014 such as those in Italy and Spain \u2014 have loosened significantly.\nIn his interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes,\" Powell said the U.S. economy was fundamentally healthy before the virus forced widespread business shutdowns and tens of millions of layoffs. He noted that a full recovery won't likely be possible before the arrival of a vaccine.\nBefore trading opened, Moderna said its experimental vaccine showed encouraging results in early testing, triggering hoped-for immune responses in eight healthy, middle-aged volunteers. The vaccine generated antibodies similar to those seen in people who have recovered from COVID-19 in study volunteers who were given either a low or medium dose.\nWorldwide, about a dozen vaccine candidates are in the first stages of testing or nearing it. Health officials have said that if all goes well, studies of a potential vaccine might wrap up by very late this year or early next year.\nMarkets in Europe also notched strong gains Monday.

concerns the deal may reduce competition and result in higher prices.\nA preliminary investigation said Air Canada and Transat have been competing head-to-head for passengers.\nThe commission is worried the proposed deal could significantly reduce competition on 33 origin and destination city pairs between Europe and Canada.\nThese include 29 where both companies offer direct services and four where one company flies direct and the other one indirect via one of its hubs.\nThe commission said in a news release on Monday that it was giving itself until Sept. 30 to decide whether to approve the deal.\n\"This is a challenging time, especially in markets severely impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, but a return to normal and healthy market conditions must be based on markets that remain competitive,\" said\u00a0Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president responsible for competition policy.\nThe commission said even if WestJet expanded its transatlantic operations to Europe, it is unlikely that it would be enough offset the potential loss of competing routes caused by the deal.\nAir Canada's deal to buy Transat for $720 million has been agreed to by shareholders, but still requires regulatory approval in Canada and the European Union.\nAir Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick said\u00a0the commission's announcement is part of the normal, ongoing regulatory review process, and the airline will have to\u00a0\"await the outcome of this process\" before it\u00a0can comment.\nThe Canadian Competition Bureau warned in March \u2014 based on information collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 that eliminating the rivalry between the two Montreal-based carriers would discourage competition by prompting higher prices and fewer services, ultimately resulting in less travel by Canadians on a range of competing routes.\nThe takeover would give Air Canada control of more than 60 per cent of transatlantic air travel from Canada and 45 per cent of passenger capacity to sun destinations, according to the federal agency's report.\nDesjardins Securities analyst Benoit Poirier said at the time that he believes the purchase will still be approved \"considering the companies' willingness to address the bureau's competition concerns,\" such as potential dominance of airport slots.\nTransat's shares lost 57 cents, or 7.6 per

Husky made a similar move on Wednesday, slashing its quarterly payout to shareholders by 90 per cent from 12.5 cents per share, per quarter, to 1.25 cents from now on.\nOil prices have plummeted in recent months, as COVID-19 caused a huge drop-off\u00a0in demand for energy, and the pandemic has hit North America just as Saudi Arabia and Russia started a price war to gain world market share.\nThose two factors have combined to push the price of oil lower than it has ever been.

Cenovus said it produced the equivalent of\u00a0482,594 barrels of oil per day during the quarter. Husky, meanwhile, pumped about 299,000 barrels per day.\nCenovus\u00a0said on average, it took in $22.74 for every barrel of oil it produced during the quarter, a plunge of 54 per cent from the same period last year.\nAnd prices have fallen even more since the end of March, with the price of West Texas Intermediate at just over $15 US a barrel on Wednesday. Oil from Canada's oilsands, meanwhile, is going for just $7.57 US a barrel.\nShares in both companies gained about 10 per cent on the TSX on Wednesday.

That likely helped boost the price of U.S. crude oil by almost 24 per cent on\u00a0Thursday, nearly making up all of its losses from the day before, Krosby said, noting that China is one of the world's biggest oil importers.\nThe Canadian dollar fell to its lowest level since 2003 on oil's weakness on Wednesday, dipping below 69 cents US. But rallied somewhat on Thursday as oil recovered.\nStill, the market will likely remain volatile until investors see more economic data that shows just how badly the outbreak is hurting the economy.\n\"They're doing what they can, and I'm not sure what else they can do,\" said Sal Bruno, chief investment officer at IndexIQ.\nMajor indexes started the day lower, then rose before and during a late morning news conference led by President Donald Trump to give updates on the outbreak. The gains were mostly gone in early afternoon trading as the indexes turned mixed. The indexes snapped back into the green by mid-afternoon, however.\nEuropean stocks swung from gains to losses and back to gains. Asian markets dropped following the brutal 5.1 per cent\u00a0loss for U.S. stocks the prior day.\nUltimately, investors say they need to see the number of new infections stop accelerating for the market's extreme volatility to ease.\nThe total number of known infections has topped 220,000 worldwide, including nearly 85,000 people who had recovered. The death toll has crept toward 10,000.\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and those with mild illness recover in about two weeks. Severe illness including pneumonia can occur, especially in the elderly and people with existing health problems, and recovery could take six weeks in such cases.\nUntil the number of new cases peak, investors will struggle with uncertainty about how much to pay for a stock, bond or commodity when they don't know how long the economic downturn will last. Many economists expect a sharp drop in the economy, but they disagree on how long it will take to bounce back.\nThe hope is that all the emergency actions by central banks and spending by governments can provide support for the economy in the meantime and soften the blow. The Trump administration has pitched lawmakers on a program that could flood $1 trillion into the economy, including checks sent directly to households.\nThe New York Stock Exchange said late Wednesday that it will temporarily close its trading floor and moving to all-electronic trading beginning Monday after two employees tested positive for coronavirus. The exchange has also started medically screening all personnel who enter the building. Much stock trading has gone electronic in recent years, and there are far fewer floor brokers than there used to be.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U.S. Senate intelligence committee chair steps aside during insider-trading investigation", "description": "FBI served search warrant for Sen.

Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, temporarily stepped aside as chairman of the Senate intelligence committee on Thursday after the FBI served a search warrant for his cellphone as part of an ongoing insider-trading investigation tied to the coronavirus pandemic.\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell announced the move, saying he and Burr had agreed that it was in the committee's best interests.\n\"We agreed that this decision would be in the best interests of the committee and will be effective at the end of the day tomorrow,\" McConnell said in a statement.\nBurr had denied wrongdoing. He said he relied solely on news reports to guide decisions on stock sales, amid reports that he and other senators sold shares after private briefings on the risks of the coronavirus crisis.\nHe told reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday he decided to step aside because he did not want the investigation to distract the intelligence committee from its work.\n\"I thought this was the best thing to do,\" Burr said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House before travelling to Pennsylvania on Thursday, said he was unaware that Burr was leaving his intelligence post.\n\"I know nothing about it \u2014 never discussed it with anybody,\" Trump said. \"That's too bad.\"\nFBI officials showed up at Burr's home with the warrant on Wednesday, two people familiar with the investigation said Thursday, marking a significant escalation into the Justice Department's investigation into whether Burr broke the law with a well-timed sale of stocks before the coronavirus caused markets to plummet. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation.\nThe search warrant was served on Burr's lawyers, and FBI agents went to Burr's home in the Washington area to retrieve the cellphone, a senior Justice Department official said. The decision to obtain the warrant, which must be authorized by a judge, was approved at the highest levels of the department, the official said.\nThe official could not discuss the ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment. Burr's attorney did not respond to phone and email messages, but said in a statement last month that the law is clear that any senator can participate in stock market trading based on public information \"as Sen. Burr did.\" Attorney\u00a0Alice Fisher\u00a0said that Burr welcomed a review of the stock sales, \"which will establish that his actions were appropriate.\"\nBurr has denied wrongdoing but has also requested an ethics review of the stock sales. Burr is an amiable member of the Senate, and his quick call for an ethics investigation and willingness to co-operate with authorities appears to have bought him some goodwill among colleagues tapping down immediate calls for him to step aside.\nSenate records show that Burr and his wife sold between roughly $600,000 US and $1.7 million\u00a0in more than 30 transactions in late January and mid-February, just before the market began to nosedive and government health officials began to sound alarms about the virus. Several of the stocks were in companies that own hotels.\nBurr was not the only lawmaker to sell off stocks before the market slide.\nSen. Kelly Loeffler, a new senator from Georgia up for re-election this year, sold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in late January and February, as senators began to get briefings on the virus, according to records. So did fellow Georgia Sen. David Perdue, another Republican lawmaker running for re-election,\u00a0and also Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California.\nSenators did receive a closed-door briefing on the virus on Jan. 24, which was public knowledge. A separate briefing was held Feb. 12 by the Senate health, education, labour and pensions committee, which Burr is a member of. It's unclear if he attended either session.\nIt's unclear who will take Burr's place. The next several Republican members in seniority are already chairs of other committees, though they could choose to switch.\nNext in seniority is Idaho Sen. James Risch, who told reporters on Thursday that he didn't know if he would keep his current perch as chair\u00a0of the Senate foreign relations committee or move to the intelligence panel.\nFollowing him is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who heads the Senate small business committee. He said\u00a0he wasn't aware that Burr was stepping aside and that the decision on who takes over the panel was up to McConnell.\nBurr's six-year term ends in 2023, and he does not plan to run for re-election.\nHe was first elected to the Senate in 2004 and chaired the Senate intelligence committee as the panel conducted its own investigation into Russian election interference in the 2016 presidential election. The committee recently issued a report supporting the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia had interfered on Donald Trump's behalf.\nThe Los Angeles Times first reported the search warrant.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Other factors to blame for rising meat prices, experts say", "description": "Climate change, sliding Canadian dollar also factors", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/beef-pork-price-canada-covid19-1.5575277", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5147717.1589915519!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/beef-steak-meat-deli-grocery-groceries-store-stock.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 20, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-05-20T08:00:00.580Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "There are factors other than COVID-19 behind the dramatic rise in Canadian beef and pork prices, experts say.\nAt his butcher shop in Gatineau, Que., Alain Bisson\u00a0said some cuts of steak have risen by as much as\u00a0$5 or $6 in just a couple weeks.\nBisson's meat comes from Cargill, which has suffered outbreaks of the respiratory illness at its packing plants in Ontario, Quebec and especially southern Alberta.\nGrocery chain Sobey's is also blaming higher prices on issues with the supply chain, including restrictions and even closures at\u00a0processing plants due to\u00a0coronavirus.\nBack in December, the researchers behind the annual\u00a0Canada's Food Price Report were already predicting a two to four per cent rise in grocery prices, with climate change as the main\u00a0culprit.\nDalhousie University's\u00a0Sylvain Charlebois,\u00a0one of that report's lead authors, said\u00a0in a French interview with Radio-Canada there are still other factors in play.\n\"We've been in an upward cycle since the start of the year.

That's a complicated-sounding\u00a0term for a fundamentally simple concept: how much banks set\u00a0aside to pay for loans on their books they think might\u00a0not get paid back.\nNot all those loans will turn into losses. But paying attention to how much the banks are setting aside just in case is an excellent proxy for how worried they are.\nCombined, Canada's\u00a0big five lenders set aside almost $11 billion last quarter to cover loans that aren't currently being paid off as planned. That's almost five times as much as they had set aside for bad loans in the same three-month period last year.\n\u00a0\nThat's the bad news. The good news? \"They were bad,\u00a0but not as bad as feared,\" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst with investment firm\u00a0Edward Jones who covers Canada's big banks.\nConsidering the massive number of layoffs, business closures and the glacial pace of trade flows across the Canada-U.S. border due to COVID-19, there were fears that loan losses could have been \"at levels that we would never have contemplated,\" Shanahan said.\nBut that didn't happen.\nIt's equally important to note that even in all this, the banks are still making money. Collectively, the banks raked in nearly $5\u00a0billion in profits over the\u00a0three months. That's well below their usual pace, but Shanahan said there was \"almost a collective sigh of relief\" that the banks were still profitable.\nArt Johnson, the founder of Calgary-based SmartBe Wealth, is one of the few money managers in Canada who doesn't think shares in Canadian bank stocks are always worth buying, but even he admits their week went a lot better than it could have gone.\n\"When I look at the numbers, they're bad,\" he said in an interview.\u00a0\"There's no two ways around it, these numbers are bad, [but] markets\u00a0don't look at bad or good, they look at better or worse.\"\nThat explains what the banks' stock prices did this week. Typically lower profits would have sent bank shares tumbling, but shares in all five were sharply up as investors breathed that\u00a0sigh of relief that Shanahan was talking about.\n\"People were expecting a lot worse, and they were better than worse in all facets,\" Johnson said.\nWhile he understands why the bank stocks rallied with relief, Johnson\u00a0thinks that exhale\u00a0may be premature as the real pain in the economy\u00a0may not show up on the banks' books for another few months, once mortgage payment deferrals run out, and massive government progams supplementing income to laid-off workers expire.\n\"We'll start to see the real impact of this three [or]\u00a0four months down the road, and that'll be where ... it'll be interesting for markets,\" he said.\nOne of the best ways of gauging how optimistic the banks are about their future is to look at their dividend payments.\nCanada's big banks are known as reliable dividend-paying machines, slowly and methodically nudging up\u00a0their payments to shareholders every few quarters\u00a0for more than a century. Those big bank dividends are so rock-solid that TD and Scotiabank\u00a0somehow\u00a0managed to hike theirs even in the middle of the financial crisis in 2009.\nThe banks love to hike their dividends because investors love that\u00a0extra income. But banks won't do it unless they are confident they'll be able to sustain the higher level in perpetuity\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 a harsh lesson that Quebec-focused\u00a0bank Laurentian learned this week when it cut its payout, the first dividend slash by a Canadian lender that big in almost 30 years.\nIf dividend payouts are the best barometer of the financial health of Canada's big banks\u00a0\u2014 and, by extension, the economy\u00a0\u2014 then the fact that none of them saw the need to cut this time around is\u00a0an encouraging sign.\nThose quarterly payouts look as rock-solid as ever, but even the banks admit the future still looks uncertain.\nThe CEO of National Bank, a distant sixth in the five-horse race atop Canadian banking, phrased it in a, well, enterprising fashion.\n\"This is Star Trek finance,\"\u00a0Louis Vachon said on\u00a0a conference call with analysts to discuss the bank's quarter, in which it booked one-third less profit and set aside five times more money for bad loans.\u00a0\n\"We would describe the current environment as going where no one has gone before.\"\nCanada's economy has managed to live long and prosper for decades on the backs of its biggest lenders, but Vachon makes it clear that those same\u00a0banks are still keeping their shields up for now.\n\"We're still watching for the Klingons [because] we're not out of this crisis yet.\"\n"},

given low oil prices and refinery cutbacks as the COVID-19 pandemic reduces fuel demand throughout North America.\nIn its 20th consecutive annual increase, the company raised the investor payouts by 13 per cent just two months ago.\nOn Wednesday, fellow oilsands giant Suncor Energy Inc. cut its quarterly dividend by 55 per cent to 21 cents per share after 18 years of consecutive annual

his company's break-even point is already between $30 and $31 US per barrel.\nMaintaining the dividend will cost the company about $2 billion this year and it likely should have been reduced, noted National Bank analyst Travis Wood in a report.\nAnalyst Phil Skolnick of Eight Capital, however, pointed out that Suncor outspent first-quarter cash flow after paying its dividend and Canadian Natural didn't, making the latter's dividend more affordable.\nCanadian Natural shares rose by about four per cent to $22.60 in early trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange but drifted lower, up 0.6 per cent at $21.86, at noon EDT.\nProduction in the first quarter reached a record 1.18 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, the maximum allowed under ongoing Alberta government oil curtailments, Canadian Natural said, adding it maximized its output of upgraded crude from its oilsands mining operations.\nOil production will fall this month by about 120,000 barrels per day through a combination of shutting down thermal oilsands and conventional oil wells to avoid low oil prices, and maintenance shutdowns at certain facilities, it added.\nThe company officially withdrew its 2020 production guidance but said it still could meet its previous target range of 1.137 to 1.207 million boe/d under current commodity futures pricing.\nOn the call, McKay estimated total volume reductions by the oil industry in Western Canada due to low prices likely add up to about one million barrels per day.\nAfter avoiding natural gas investments for several years, Canadian Natural said it will drill wells to add about 60 million cubic feet per day this year in response to strengthening prices as production falls in the United States.\nThe company said it will cut its operating costs this year by $745 million compared with last year and will eliminate another $280 million from capital costs on top of its cut of more than $1 billion announced in March.\nIt now expects capital spending to total $2.68 billion this year, down from its original budget of $4.05 billion.\nThe company announced a first-quarter loss of $1.28 billion on lower commodity prices, compared with a profit of $961 million in the same period of 2019.\nOn an adjusted basis, it lost $295 million, compared with an adjusted profit of $838 million a year ago.\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "TSX falls by 12%, now back

So we have to adapt what we're doing to meet the landscape now.\"\nWilliams said she has\u00a0rented out two of the five units she operates to tenants who will stay for the entire summer, and possibly longer.\nTwo other units are still booked by tourists who had planned to visit from the mainland, but \"unless things change they're all going to cancel,\" said Williams.\nHer fifth short-term rental is her home, which she normally vacates for the summer months, to make extra money renting it out to tourists. But this summer she's decided to stay put.\n\"That one was fully booked for the whole summer, and so that was a tough pill to swallow,\" she said.\nTourism is the second-biggest industry on P.E.I. behind agriculture, but prospects for the coming season are dismal. The province is currently closed to non-essential visitors, with no specific timeline\u00a0as to when that will change.\nWilliams said she does hold out some hope\u00a0in the prospect of opening up the province to visitors from New Brunswick and possibly Nova Scotia.\nBut in the meantime Williams, who's part of a Facebook group of Charlottetown-area short-term rental operators, says many are doing the same thing she is \u2014 trying to fill properties with longer-term tenants until next summer, when they once again plan to open up to tourists.\nWilliams said there are also some who are simply removing short-term listings for their properties and putting them on the long-term market, seeking permanent tenants, \"which is going to put some of the housing stock back.\"\nAccording to the most recent statistics from\u00a0Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, P.E.I. has the lowest vacancy rate in the country at 1.2 per cent.\nExperts, including David Wachsmuth,\u00a0a professor with the School of Urban Planning at McGill University, say a significant factor in P.E.I.'s housing crunch has been the rise of the short-term rental market.\nThe City of Charlottetown consulted with Wachsmuth\u00a0on a study released in March that\u00a0found there were 635 active short-term rental units in the city, of which 193 would otherwise have been part of the long-term housing market.\nPutting those units back on the market would more than double Charlottetown's vacancy rate, the city concluded, pushing it from 1.2 to 2.9 per cent.\nThe study also found short-term rentals had helped drive\u00a0up rental costs in the city by 17.7 per cent since 2017.\nAimee Power, with the advocacy group P.E.I. Fight for Affordable Housing, said her group has been noticing rental properties coming back on the market \u2014 in some cases the listings are discovered by the tenants who lived there before the units were turned into short-term rentals.\n\"I think we're seeing some impact that those short-term rentals had on the long-term market, by seeing all of these units come back,\" said Power.\n\"I think it'll have a short-term positive impact on those looking for a place to live,\" said Power, but she questioned whether there would be a lasting improvement in the vacancy rate.\n\"A lot of those, it could be presumed they would go back to being a short-term rental as soon as our restrictions are lifted.\"\nBut Williams said it won't be so easy for those who lease their units out on a full-time basis to turn them back into short-term rentals.\n\"I don't think you can just, you know, ask them to leave because you want to revert to short-term rentals,\" said Williams, \"so when you make that decision to go long-term \u2026 I think it's pretty final until that tenant moves out.\"\nThe P.E.I. government has developed a draft of a new Residential Tenancy Act which would make it harder for landlords to evict tenants under false pretences. Some of the changes are meant to target renovictions, where landlords evict someone while claiming to be making major repairs.\nPublic consultations on that legislation were scheduled to be held in March.\nThe City of Charlottetown has also been moving toward new regulations for short-term rentals.\nA public meeting was tentatively scheduled for March 31 to present options, but Councillor Greg Rivard, chair of Charlottetown's planning committee, said that meeting has been postponed indefinitely.\nHe said the city is \"waiting for the province to lift restrictions for large gatherings.\"\nRivard said the meeting is expected to draw upwards of 200 people and the city doesn't want to risk having \"anything lost in translation or messed up\" by trying to hold the meeting online.\nBut Power said she'd like to see consultations move forward in some capacity, with the city providing the public with updated information through its website.\n\"There's just been so many delays with this process to date,\" she said.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "TSX shut down for 'technical halt' as stock markets sell off", "description": "Company that owns and operates exchange says systems will be ready for Friday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-thursday-1.5477966", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5478023.1582832345!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/anxious-stock-trader.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Feb 27, 2020 11:40 AM ET", "2020-02-28T05:58:51.741Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The company that owns and operates the Toronto Stock Exchange ordered a \"technical halt\"\u00a0to all trading on Canada's largest stock exchange on Thursday, a day when stock markets around the world saw heavy losses.\nTMX Corp. ordered the halt a little before\u00a02 p.m. ET on Thursday, citing a \"problem with order entry\" on the main index, the TSX Venture Exchange and the alternative Alpha Exchange.

We do know that in the short term it's going to have a negative impact on\u00a0our budget and on our economy.\"\nNDP Leader\u00a0Rachel Notley\u00a0said it's true that coronavirus is slowing the economy but the government's plan to balance the budget within three years was never achievable in any case.\n\"Jason's Kenney's plan to balance the budget by 2022/23 was always based on a collection of fantasyland numbers,\" Notley said. \"It was never real. It looks to me like he's going to try to use this particular set of circumstances as cover for the fact that he introduced a budget that was absolutely not attainable, with fictional numbers.\"\nOn an annualized basis, every dollar reduction in the price of West Texas Intermediate oil, which traded at about $42\u00a0US on Friday, takes about $200 million out of provincial revenues, Kenney said.\n\"This just underscores the importance of getting our fiscal house in order,\" he said. \"Because if indeed we do end up in a prolonged global downturn, [the province's] deficit will go back up, and we need to be prepared for the future.\"\nIf the downturn does continue for months, the province could be forced to reassess it's fiscal plans later this year, Kenney said.\nKenney and Infrastructure Minister Prasad Panda held a news conference Friday to announce the government's 2020\u00a0capital\u00a0plan, which called $19.3 billion in spending over the next three years.\nAfter the announcement, however, most of the questions from the media centred on the global economic situation well beyond Alberta's boundaries.\nKenney said his government is doing all it can\u00a0to create the right conditions to grow the province's economy.\n\"But I think all Albertans see what's going on with the global economy because of the coronavirus,\" he said. \"Markets are again going down today.

He said he relied solely on news reports to guide decisions on stock sales, amid reports that he and other senators sold shares after private briefings on the risks of the coronavirus crisis.\nHe told reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday he decided to step aside because he did not want the investigation to distract the intelligence committee from its work.\n\"I thought this was the best thing to do,\" Burr said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House before travelling to Pennsylvania on Thursday, said he was unaware that Burr was leaving his intelligence post.\n\"I know nothing about it \u2014 never discussed it with anybody,\" Trump said. \"That's too bad.\"\nFBI officials showed up at Burr's home with the warrant on Wednesday, two people familiar with the investigation said Thursday, marking a significant escalation into the Justice Department's investigation into whether Burr broke the law with a well-timed sale of stocks before the coronavirus caused markets to plummet. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation.\nThe search warrant was served on Burr's lawyers, and FBI agents went to Burr's home in the Washington area to retrieve the cellphone, a senior Justice Department official said. The decision to obtain the warrant, which must be authorized by a judge, was approved at the highest levels of the department, the official said.\nThe official could not discuss the ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment. Burr's attorney did not respond to phone and email messages, but said in a statement last month that the law is clear that any senator can participate in stock market trading based on public information \"as Sen. Burr did.\" Attorney\u00a0Alice Fisher\u00a0said that Burr welcomed a review of the stock sales, \"which will establish that his actions were appropriate.\"\nBurr has denied wrongdoing but has also requested an ethics review of the stock sales. Burr is an amiable member of the Senate, and his quick call for an ethics investigation and willingness to co-operate with authorities appears to have bought him some goodwill among colleagues tapping down immediate calls for him to step aside.\nSenate records show that Burr and his wife sold between roughly $600,000 US and $1.7 million\u00a0in more than 30 transactions in late January and mid-February, just before the market began to nosedive and government health officials began to sound alarms about the virus. Several of the stocks were in companies that own hotels.\nBurr was not the only lawmaker to sell off stocks before the market slide.\nSen. Kelly Loeffler, a new senator from Georgia up for re-election this year, sold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in late January and February, as senators began to get briefings on the virus, according to records. So did fellow Georgia Sen. David Perdue, another Republican lawmaker running for re-election,\u00a0and also Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California.\nSenators did receive a closed-door briefing on the virus on Jan. 24, which was public knowledge. A separate briefing was held Feb. 12 by the Senate health, education, labour and pensions committee, which Burr is a member of. It's unclear if he attended either session.\nIt's unclear who will take Burr's place. The next several Republican members in seniority are already chairs of other committees, though they could choose to switch.\nNext in seniority is Idaho Sen. James Risch, who told reporters on Thursday that he didn't know if he would keep his current perch as chair\u00a0of the Senate foreign relations committee or move to the intelligence panel.\nFollowing him is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who heads the Senate small business committee. He said\u00a0he wasn't aware that Burr was stepping aside and that the decision on who takes over the panel was up to McConnell.\nBurr's six-year term ends in 2023, and he does not plan to run for re-election.\nHe was first elected to the Senate in 2004 and chaired the Senate intelligence committee as the panel conducted its own investigation into Russian election interference in the 2016 presidential election. The committee recently issued a report supporting the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia had interfered on Donald Trump's behalf.\nThe Los Angeles Times first reported the search warrant.\n"}, {"author": "Tori Weldon", "title": "Farmers, butchers going 'full-tilt' to keep up with growing demand for local meat", "description": "Point de Bute farmer says she's seen 300% increase in demand for beef since isolation started ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/beef-local-cattle-new-brunswick-demand-1.5564987", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5565016.1589303200!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/shelley-dixon.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 13, 2020 7:00 AM AT", "2020-05-13T10:51:00.693Z"], "source": "CBC", "content": "Shelley Dixon's\u00a0freezer is normally full to the brim with roasts, steaks and ground beef, but today it's nearly empty.\u00a0Since New Brunswick's isolation measures were enacted, the beef farmer is selling her stock as quickly as she can have it butchered.\nThe Dixon farm is in Point de Bute, where Shelley and her husband, Roy, have spent the last 40-plus\u00a0years growing a handful of cows into a herd of about 400.

It followed that up with a small rebound the next day.\u00a0\nLarge swings up and down have been the norm of late, as investors react to the uncertainty that this worldwide pandemic presents for the economy.\n"}, {"author": "Shane Magee", "title": "Pandemic pushes Moncton toward multi-million deficit, staff aim to avoid tax hike", "description": "City forecasts deficit of at least $1.7 million if measures to control the pandemic remain until June", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-pandemic-budget-1.5523627", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5524228.1586220230!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/marc-landry-moncton.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 07, 2020 7:25 AM AT", "2020-04-07T10:52:40.335Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Moncton's city manager says municipal staff feel \"very strongly\" that they should avoid a tax rate increase\u00a0as a result of the pandemic.\nMarc Landry said city staff will spend the coming weeks combing through the 2020 budget looking at what can be cut or deferred from the\u00a0city's $161.8 operations and $47.3 million capital budget. Those proposals will then go to city council for approval.\n\"We're going to do everything in our power to make sure we go through all the items in the budget and come as close as possible to a balanced budget,\" Landry said.\nThat will likely mean shaving millions in spending, according to two financial projections outlined at a city council meeting\u00a0held by video conference Monday.\u00a0\nUnder the first scenario\u00a0with measures to control the pandemic\u00a0lifted by June 1, the city forecasts a deficit of $1.7 million. If the measures remain until Sept. 1, that deficit climbs to $3.5 million.\nCoun. Brian Hicks said the last thing residents or businesses need is a tax increase. He suggested millions put into reserve accounts from a surplus last year and higher than budgeted\u00a0assessment growth could be tapped.\u00a0\n\"We do have a bit of cushioning through reserves and good budgeting,\" Coun. Blair Lawrence said.\u00a0\nA one cent change in the tax rate generates about $800,000, Landry said.\u00a0\nThe projections estimate short-term losses related to revenue from the Magnetic Hill Zoo, trade shows at the Coliseum\u00a0and bus fare, but savings from things like cheaper fuel.\nLonger-term losses are anticipated to assessment growth, which reflects the pace of new construction, industrial park land sales, and changes to the value of the city's pension plan because of the stock market.\u00a0\nAsked by reporters about budget items the city could look at cutting, Landry declined to elaborate.\u00a0\nHe said reducing spending on things like repairing potholes wouldn't make sense because the cost would likely be higher to repair the street in the long-term.\nLandry said the city has already laid off 15 casual staff at parks, the Coliseum\u00a0and rinks. He said the city would need to be at\u00a0a \"full complement\" of staff before considering taking on summer students.\nThe city continues to issue development and building permits, but Landry said it's not clear yet how the booming construction market in the region could be affected over the coming years.\u00a0\nCity council also approved eight\u00a0financial relief measures for residents or businesses:\nThe measures are estimated to cost the city\u00a0$387,109 in lost revenue,\u00a0which rises\u00a0to\u00a0$615,918 if the various parking changes continue through May. The lost revenue was included in the deficit projections.\u00a0\nJack MacDonald, the city's general manager engineering and environmental services, told council the Moncton Hospital garage with more than 100 spaces, is closed.

The technology-focused Nasdaq\u00a0was off by almost as much, 255 points or\u00a02.7\u00a0per cent, while in Toronto the TSX/S&P Composite Index was off by 385\u00a0points or just over two per cent to 17,177. In terms of points, it was the worst day for the TSX since August 2015.\nThe sell-off came a day after an even worse swoon on Monday, as investors digest the possibility that the virus that causes COVID-19 has the potential to disrupt the global economy by knocking out supply chains and reducing\u00a0consumer demand for a\u00a0range\u00a0of goods and services.\nOn Tuesday, Iran reported 95 new cases and 15 new deaths from the coronavirus that started in China, while Italy is also seeing a growing cluster of new cases.\u00a0\n\"For the first time in a while we're finally waking up to the fact that this issue could go on for a while, and have a significant impact on Chinese and global economic growth and potentially the United States,\" said Randy Frederick, vice-president of trading and derivatives for money manager Charles Schwab.\n\"When people react to it because they don't travel or go to restaurants or go shopping, that'll have an immediate impact on the economy. It depends how long it goes and how wide the spread.\"\nYung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management, said each new country's outbreak adds to the fear. \"It's the combination of South Korea, Japan, Italy and even Iran\" reporting virus cases, Ma said.\n\"That really woke up the market, that these four places in different places around the globe can go from low concern to high concern in a matter of days, and that we could potentially wake up a week from now and it could be five to 10 additional places.\"\nThe two day sell-off on the Dow Jones is the worst two-day performance for the Dow since 2015.\nAfter a multi-year bull run, the sell-off has pushed almost every major stock index in the world into negative territory for the year.\nJust about every sector is down this week.\u00a0\n\"It's a case of which ones went down more, and which ones that went down less,\" said\u00a0Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management in Toronto.\nCompanies tied to travel and tourism are especially hard hit. Air Canada, for example, was down six per cent to $36.45 a share\u00a0on Tuesday and down 27 per cent since the middle of January. The airline announced Tuesday it has cancelled all of its flights to China until April 10.\nShares in cruise lines are sharply lower. Norwegian Cruise Lines lost seven per cent of its value on Tuesday and is down by more than a third since the middle of January. Its rival, Carnival Cruise Lines, lost another six per cent on Tuesday and it, too, is down by more than 30 per cent in barely more than a month.\n\"With travel slowing down we've seen an impact on the airline sector, on the hotels and casinos, on cruise lines and ...\u00a0where people would gather in a public place,\"\u00a0Cieszynski\u00a0said.\nOil prices have plunged as the virus has prompted fears that the global economy will require less energy to run as it slows down.\nThe benchmark\u00a0oil price, known as West Texas Intermediate, dipped below $50 US a barrel on Tuesday, a level it hasn't dropped to\u00a0since late 2018.\nThat hit Toronto's stock exchange hard as the TSX is home to a lot of energy names.\nConversely, Canada's main stock index was buoyed by rising prices in gold mining companies.\u00a0The price of gold has risen to more than $1,600 US an ounce this month, a level it hasn't topped since 2013, because gold is seen as a safe haven in times of uncertainty.\n\"In Canada we will often see on days when\u00a0the broader markets are taking a big hit, we'll often see strength in the gold price and gold stocks,\"\u00a0Cieszynski\u00a0said.\n\"That often will help to cushion the blow a little bit in Canada relative to the United States.\"\u00a0\nWhile most industries have been hit hard by virus fears, there are some bright spots moving in the opposite direction because of the flip side of those same fears.\nDrug companies working on possible vaccines are seeing their share prices rise, including one called Moderna that is up by almost 17 per cent on Tuesday because it has sent a possible coronavirus vaccine to a clinical trial to be tested on humans.\nThe fears of the coronavirus derailing the world's economy come\u00a0at a time when another closely watched economic indicator\u00a0\u2014 earnings at Canadian banks \u2014 suggest\u00a0that Canada's economy is doing well.\nRoyal Bank of Canada\u00a0reported strong earnings on Monday, and rivals BMO and Scotiabank\u00a0followed that up with higher profits of their own on Tuesday.

Overworked staff. Understaffed residences. Grieving families. There are serious, underlying challenges facing these facilities. And in the coming months, the federal government will be there to help the provinces find lasting solutions,\" he said.\nThe novel\u00a0coronavirus has spread quickly through many long-term care facilities. About 80 per cent of all COVID-19 related deaths have taken place in those facilities.\nHalifax senior Joan McDougall\u00a0called the situation \"heartbreaking\" and said it\u00a0makes her more determined than ever\u00a0to keep living independently for as long as possible.\n\"I hope I can put that decision off as long as I can,\" she told the CBC's Rosemary Barton.\nAs for today's announcement, McDougall said \"every little bit counts\" when someone is on a fixed income, but she hopes the government comes through with other measures to help seniors.\nWith instability in the markets, she said she would welcome any measures to help protect investments without penalties.\n\"With that instability that we're seeing now, that's what causes me the stress and I'm hoping that will be addressed to some extent,\" she said.\nThe government is also investing another $20 million on the New Horizons for Seniors Program, which funds various community projects for seniors. Schulte said that money will help\u00a0to mitigate the impacts of isolation with things like\u00a0virtual exercise programs and tablet laptops.\nTreasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos said the measures announced today will not require parliamentary authority and the supports are expected to flow within weeks.\nConservative seniors critic Alice Wong accused the government of \"letting our seniors down\" during the pandemic, saying the help is arriving late.\n\u00a0\"We have heard that Canadians are looking for penalty-free access to their savings during this crisis.\u00a0Conservatives put forward constructive proposals to help, including allowing Canadians to make a special one-time tax-free withdrawal from their RRSPs and waiving mandatory RRIF withdrawal,\" she said in a statement.\n\u00a0\"Conservatives will continue to help Canadians who are falling through the cracks.\"\nNDP seniors critic Scott Duvall said he is \"largely disappointed\" with the emergency aid plan for seniors.\n\"Providing a one-time payment indicates the government has decided the pandemic will only last for a month. How are seniors going to meet their increased costs in the following months?\" he said in a statement.\n\"The government should help seniors with an ongoing increase in their OAS and GIS. We are happy the government listened to us in ensuring that no one is cut off GIS come July. Allowing GIS recipients until October 1\u00a0to file their taxes will certainly help seniors who are struggling right now.\"\nMarissa Lennox, chief policy officer at the seniors\u00a0advocacy group CARP, said in addition to added grocery and prescription costs, seniors also are\u00a0seeing free or discounted community services\u00a0\u2014 such as laundry services, meals at community centres and\u00a0volunteer tax preparation \u2014 dry up because of the global pandemic.\nShe welcomed today's announcement\u00a0but urged the government to do more to address the retirement security crisis caused by COVID-19.\n\"The one-time tax-free payments of $300 and $200 for those who qualify for OAS and GIS, respectively, will serve to support immediate needs around grocery delivery and additional prescription medication costs, but are not\u00a0solutions for beyond the short term.\u00a0It's unclear how long this will last,\" she said.\nLennox said many seniors also have\u00a0seen their\u00a0retirement savings shrink because of a drop in the stock market.\nCARP had\u00a0asked the federal government to waive mandatory registered retirement income fund (RRIF) withdrawals in 2020. CARP says the mandatory withdrawals increase\u00a0the tax liability for the year as seniors struggle with added costs related to the pandemic.\n\"Anything that is withdrawn from a RRIF is fully taxable, and in this unpredictable time, seniors are looking to maximize their cash, reduce their tax liability\u00a0and maximize their flexibility in arranging their affairs,\" Lennox said.\nCARP also has\u00a0urged the government to eliminate withholding tax on RRSP withdrawals for the 2020 tax year and allow two years to repay taxes owed.\nThe group is asking the government to follow through on an\u00a0election promise to increase Old Age Security (OAS) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payments.\nDuring the 2019 campaign,\u00a0Trudeau said a re-elected government would provide a 10 per cent boost to OAS at age 75 and a 25 per cent increase to the Canada Pension Plan\u00a0for widows or widowers.\nAt the time, the Liberal Party said the OAS increase would give Canadians aged 75 and older\u00a0an extra $729 each year and lift 20,000 seniors out of poverty, while widows or widowers would receive up to $2,080 in additional benefits every year with the increased survivor's benefit under the CPP and Quebec Pension Plan (QPP).\nThose changes were to take effect in July, 2020.\nAsked about those promised benefits today, Duclos said Tuesday's announcement is meant to provide \"quick, solid support\" for seniors during the health crisis, and that the government will also deal with financial security for seniors more generally.\nSchulte's spokesperson Scott Bardsley\u00a0said the government has taken steps to support all seniors \u2013 especially those who are most financially vulnerable\u00a0\u2013 and that it has more than doubled the financial assistance promised in the election platform ($3.8 billion, instead of\u00a0$1.56 billion.)\n\"While the government remains committed to implementing the policies in our platform, at this time we are focused on managing the COVID-19 public health crisis,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url":

Almost simultaneously, the venerable Canadian fashion chain Reitmans went into bankruptcy protection.\nThose are just some on\u00a0the list of famous names that are in financial trouble during this COVID-19 lockdown, including J.Crew, JCPenney and Cirque du Soleil.\nAs people stop flying, the head of Boeing has suggested a major U.S. airline may fail, and globally, many smaller carriers are at death's door.\nAs the CMHC worries Canadian real estate prices\u00a0will crash by as much as 18 per cent, the oil industry struggles to recover from negative pricing and unemployment rises toward Depression levels, it is hard to see the bright side.\nBut according to the theory of creative destruction derived by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1942 from ideas proposed by Karl Marx, economic and technological progress demands that businesses must die and\u00a0industries and paradigms must be swept away\u00a0to make room for new ones.\u00a0\nCanadian economist Peter Howitt, recent winner of the Frontiers of Knowledge Award for his work proving Schumpeter's principles in the real world, said that while the creative destruction process is happening all the time, economic crises speed the process along.\n\"When old firms or technology or skills or whatever are hanging on, they can last a long time until things get really bad,\" said Howitt. \"It's typically during a recession that a lot of the destruction takes place.\"\nThe implication is that while those in retail or the oil business or the real estate industry may insist that the COVID-19 lockdown has been the cause of their failure, the economic crisis may instead be a trigger, a catalyst for a process already underway.\nWe already knew traditional retail was being challenged by tech giants Shopify and Amazon or by big-box discounters like Costco, but it was the downturn that pushed struggling companies like Pier 1 over the edge.\nMany have suggested in the past that the overleveraged housing market was an accident waiting to happen. In a broader sense, some economic thinkers say the current backlash against China and against globalization\u00a0or even against the social structure of rich and poor is part of a reset for which pressure was already building.\nAccording to Stephen Williamson, an economist at Western University, it may be dangerous for governments to try to push too hard against the economic forces at work in dying industries such as the fossil fuel sector.\nCoronavirus pandemic hastens decline of US coal industry <a href=\"https://t.co/f3MLTb5jii\">https://t.co/f3MLTb5jii</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FinancialTimes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@financialtimes</a>\n\"It doesn't look like, at least the exploration and extraction part of the industry, is really viable a long time into the future,\" said Williamson. \"It seems hard to justify a huge bailout for those guys.\"\nFrom the smallest businesses to the largest, the rigours of recession can act as a torture test.\nFor businesses like that of Sean Davey, who after losing his job with the Royal Bank as a stock analyst in 2016\u00a0turned his mathematical skills to founding Rithmetic Math Club, surviving recession can mean prosperity afterwards.\nSlipping into the language of his former job,\u00a0Davey said his idea was to create \"a cash-flow positive, low-risk business\" that could grow slowly.\nBy converting his after-school sessions\u00a0to Zoom, Davey said the vast majority of his 100-odd clients remain on board and he expects business to grow despite the disruption.\n\"What is in little doubt is that the COVID-19 crisis, which has turned so many people's lives upside down, will eventually produce a wealth of new business opportunities,\" The Economist magazine said\u00a0earlier this month in its Schumpeter column, named after the famous Austrian.\nResponding to a complaint from some critics that creative destruction is merely a way of putting a smiley face on economic destruction, even as a proponent of the idea, Howitt does not minimize the notion that economic change is a painful process.\n\"Since the industrial revolution, people's lives have been destroyed by new technologies,\" he said, and while there are winners, workers and investors in the so-called \"sunset industries\" such as dying retail pay a price.\nBoth Williamson and Howitt say that even while it may pave the way to future innovation, a recession hurts innovators, too, as investment capital dries up and lenders withdraw from risk.\nAt the University of Toronto's Creative Destruction Lab, that gloomy view cannot stand in the way of Mara Lederman, who is firmly focused on the creation side of the creative destruction dichotomy.\nFounded by artificial intelligence pioneer Ajay Agrawal at U of T's Rotman School of Management, CDL has been\u00a0turning \"deep science\" generated by university scholars into businesses that help transform the economy.\nLederman said\u00a0a motivation for the non-profit lab was that Canadian universities were doing incredible science that only other scientists would see.\n\"What we need to do is take the science that's being discovered and turn it into businesses, products and services for the betterment of humankind,\" she said.\nAs an economics professor, Lederman is well-versed in Schumpeter's ideas but she sees the current volatile times as an incentive to develop new ones. That's why the group founded a new division called CDL Recovery\u00a0to\u00a0address health or economic recovery challenges created by the global COVID-19 crisis.\nThe group has already helped accelerate projects, including a wristband to determine if employees fail to maintain physical distancing, a system to monitor long-term care in a time of pandemic\u00a0and a technology that uses artificial intelligence vision to keep track of care residents with a tendency to wander, to mention just a few, said Lederman.\n\"Are we in the kind of situation that is going to unleash creative destruction? I think the answer is yes.\"\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1704430147875", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/financial-impact-of-covid-19-business-panel-1.5481331", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1708802115593", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Stock markets sell off as coronavirus spread threatens global economy", "description": "Dow Jones loses almost 1000 points at open, price of oil sells off too", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/markets-monday-coronavirus-1.5473520", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5473538.1582552992!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/stock-market-board.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Feb 24, 2020 9:18 AM ET", "2020-02-24T21:06:56.765Z"], "source": null, "content": "Stocks fell sharply Monday, following a sell-off in overseas markets, as a surge in virus cases and a worrisome spread of the disease outside China sent investors running for safety.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1030 points or 3.5 per cent to close 27,961. That's the worst day for the Dow in more than two years and enough to push the closely watched group of shares in\u00a030 U.S. companies into negative territory for the year.\u00a0\nThe S&P 500 index fared slightly better, down 2.9 per cent or almost 100 points.\u00a0The tech-heavy\u00a0Nasdaq fell 3.7 per cent or 355 points.\nIn Toronto, the S&P/TSX Composite Index lost 276\u00a0points or roughly 1.5 per cent as the resource sector slumped because of concerns of a global economic slowdown.\nMore than 79,000 people worldwide have been infected by the new coronavirus. China, where the virus originated, still has the majority of cases and deaths. But, the rapid spread to other countries is raising anxiety about the threat the outbreak poses to the global economy.\nSouth Korea is now on its highest alert for infectious diseases after cases there spiked. Italy reported a sharp rise in cases and a dozen towns in the northern, more industrial part of that country are under quarantine. The nation now has the biggest outbreak in Europe, prompting officials to cancel Venice's famed Carnival, along with soccer matches and other public gatherings.\nThere are also more cases of the virus being reported in the Middle East as it spreads to Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait, among others.\nGermany's DAX slid 4\u00a0and Italy's benchmark index dropped 5.9 per cent. South Korea's Kospi shed 3.8 per cent\u00a0and markets in Asia fell broadly.\nInvestors looking for safe harbours bid up prices for U.S. government bonds and gold. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell sharply, to 1.37 per cent\u00a0from 1.47 per cent\u00a0late Friday. Gold prices jumped 1.8 per cent.\n\"Stock markets around the world are beginning to price in what bond markets have been telling us for weeks \u2014 that global growth is likely to be impacted in a meaningful way due to fears of the coronavirus,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.\nThe viral outbreak threatens to crimp global economic growth and hurt profits and revenue for a wide range of businesses. Companies from technology giant Apple to athletic gear maker Nike have already warned about a hit to their bottom lines. Airlines and other companies that depend on travellers are facing pain from cancelled plans and shuttered locations.\nCrude oil prices plunged 4.4 per cent. Aside from air travel, the virus poses an economic threat to global shipping.\nTechnology companies were among the worst hit by the sell-off. Apple, which depends on China for a lot of business, slid 4.3 per cent. Microsoft slumped 3.3 per cent.\nBanks were also big losers. JPMorgan Chase fell 2.7 per cent\u00a0and Bank of America fell 3.9 per cent.\nUtilities and real estate companies held up better than most sectors. Investors tend to favour those industries, which carry high dividends and hold up relatively well during period of turmoil, when they're feeling fearful.\nGilead Sciences rose 4.4 per cent\u00a0and was among the few bright spots. The biotechnology company is testing a potential drug to treat the new coronavirus. Bleach-maker Clorox was also a standout, rising 2 per cent\nThe sell-off is hitting the market as companies near the finish of what has been a surprisingly good round of earnings. About 87 per cent\u00a0of companies in the S&P 500 have reported financial results and profits are expected to grow by more than a half-percentage point when all the reports are in, according to FactSet.\nIn the eyes of some analysts, Monday's tank job for stocks means they're just catching up to the bond market, where fear has been dominant for months.\nU.S. government bonds are seen as some of the safest possible investments, and investors have been piling into them throughout 2020, even as stocks overcame stumbles to set more record highs. A bond's yield falls when its price rises, and the 10-year Treasury has been in such demand that its yield has plunged to 1.36 per cent\u00a0from roughly 1.90 per cent\u00a0at the start of the year.\nThe 10-year yield on Monday touched its lowest point in three years, falling from 1.47 per cent\u00a0late Friday, and it's close to its intraday record low of 1.325 per cent\u00a0set in July 2016, according to Tradeweb. The 30-year Treasury yield fell further after setting its own record low, down to 1.82 per cent\u00a0from 1.92 per cent\u00a0late Friday.\nTraders are increasingly certain that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least once in 2020 to help prop up the economy. They're pricing in a nearly 95% probability of a cut this year, according to CME Group. A month ago, they saw only a 68% probability.\nOf course, some analysts say stocks have been rising in recent weeks precisely because of the drop in yields. Bonds are offering less in interest after the Federal Reserve lowered rates three times last year \u2014 the first such cuts in more than a decade \u2014 and amid low inflation. When bonds are paying such meagre amounts, many investors say there's little real competition other than stocks for their money.\nThe view has become so hardened that \"There Is No Alternative,\" or TINA, has become a popular acronym on Wall Street. Even with Monday's sharp drops, the S&P 500 is still within 4.2 per cent\u00a0of its record set earlier this month.\n"}, {"author": "Meera Bains", "title": "Retired Delta lawyer charged in stem cell company investigation", "description": "RCMP say victims in Canada and U.S. lost thousands of dollars in stem cell therapy company ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/retired-delta-lawyer-charged-in-stem-cell-company-investigation-1.5493135", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4225327.1583892727!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/lhsc-stem-cell-expansion.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 7:17 PM PT", "2020-03-11T02:17:24.702Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A retired lawyer from Delta, B.C., is facing three criminal charges related\u00a0to an investigation into a multi-million dollar stock market scheme which dates back to 2013 when Life Stem Genetics, Inc. began trading on the stock market.\nPolice say Peter John Merry,\u00a073, the central figure at the\u00a0stem cell therapy company based in Beverly Hills,\u00a0allegedly made false statements to potential investors in the United States and Canada who lost thousands of dollars.\nThe B.C.

On Monday, oil prices closed a little above\u00a0$47 US a barrel.\nMembers of OPEC and their allies are meeting this week at the group's headquarters in Vienna, Austria.\nOPEC,\u00a0Russia and other producers already have a deal in place to cut\u00a0output from Jan. 1 by 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd), a\u00a0figure that includes additional voluntary cuts by Saudi Arabia.\nBut that has not been enough to counter the impact of the\u00a0virus on China, the world's biggest oil importer, and on the\u00a0 global economy, as factories are disrupted, fewer people travel and other business slows, curbing oil demand.\n\"China is the front line for impact in the first quarter [of the year],\" Dwarkin said.\u00a0\n\"We estimate roughly 900,000 barrels per day has probably been sliced out of China's oil demand. So the need to make a decision to deepen cuts is important.\"\u00a0\nOn Tuesday, officials indicated\u00a0they were considering deeper cuts in a bid to lift crude prices.\nReuters reported a\u00a0panel of OPEC and its allies\u00a0recommended cutting oil output by an extra one\u00a0million bpd\u00a0on Tuesday signalling that Russia and Saudi Arabia\u00a0were moving closer to a deal to prop up prices.\nLeading into this week's meetings,\u00a0some experts anticipated the cartel's cut might amount to only 600,000 bpd\u00a0\u2014 a figure that\u00a0might have underwhelmed the market given current uncertainty.\nIndeed, things are moving quickly and analysts are trying to understand just how the virus' spread will\u00a0impact\u00a0economic activity, especially\u00a0consumer activity.\nDenton\u00a0Cinquegrana,\u00a0chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service by IHS Markit, said it seems like China may be turning a corner, but the virus is only beginning to impact people in the U.S.\n\"Here, in the United States, you're starting to see a little bit of the panic and spread of the virus start to take place and have an impact on demand,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"The demand impact we may not know for really a couple months down the road.\"\nCinquegrana\u00a0said if OPEC agreed\u00a0to just the 600,000 bpd cut, Saudi Arabia may go \"a little bit on their own\" to bring the number closer to one\u00a0million bpd.\n\"That may be enough to get it back close to the $50-a-barrel level,\" he said. \"But, again, there's some real concerns about demand going forward.\"\u00a0\nA cut in U.S. interest rates on Tuesday offered only limited\u00a0support for crude ahead of the OPEC meetings on Thursday and Friday.\nThe price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the North American benchmark, closed up 43 cents at $47.18 US per barrel on Tuesday.\u00a0Brent crude, the global benchmark,\u00a0fell four cents a barrel to settle at $51.86 US a barrel.\nDwarkin\u00a0said COVID-19 has made OPEC's work an even heavier lift this week.\n\"But as one former Saudi oil minister said, OPEC is like a teabag,\" Dwarkin added.\n\"It works best when it's plunged into hot water.\u00a0Well, it's definitely in hot water right now.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Uber mulls buying GrubHub in major consolidation of U.S. food delivery business", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/uber-grubhub-takeover-1.5566338", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5566345.1589306358!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/grubhub.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 12, 2020 2:00 PM ET", "2020-05-12T18:00:57.570Z"], "source": null, "content": "Uber is considering acquiring Grubhub in a deal that would give the companies control over a majority of the U.S. food delivery business, according to published reports.\nRide-sharing and food delivery giant Uber Technologies Inc. approached Grubhub Inc. earlier this year with an all-stock takeover offer, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing sources.

Again, as I say, we will get through this. We just have to make decisions in a very organized manner versus being too reactive.\"\nLike its peers around the sector, Whitecap is being challenged on two fronts: the crude price war that's broken out between\u00a0Russia and Saudi Arabia, and the spread of the virus, which is rattling markets to the core.\nBut companies must also manage the practical\u00a0health concerns of staff\u00a0\u2014 a situation highlighted by news a daycare in\u00a0Suncor Energy's downtown headquarters has\u00a0been closed after a child tested positive for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus.\n\"There's two priorities we have to look at,\"\u00a0Fagerheim\u00a0said.\u00a0\n\"And, firstly, we have to ensure the health and safety of our employees.\"\nStill, on the business side of the ledger, companies are busy adjusting plans and preparing for a long financial storm.\nHusky Energy announced Thursday\u00a0it would cut\u00a0its capital program by\u00a0$900 million \u2014 representing a one-third reduction\u00a0in upstream spending \u2014\u00a0and taking steps to save an additional $100 million.\n\"Given current market conditions, Husky will commence the safe and orderly reduction, or shut-in, of production where it is cash negative on a variable cost basis at current prices,\" the company said.\nStock markets and oil prices both fell on Thursday, with the benchmark price for North American crude closing at $31.50 US per barrel, down $1.48 US.\u00a0And there's no clear signal yet as to how long oil prices will stay low.\u00a0\nSaudi Arabia is poised\u00a0to open the taps from April 1,\u00a0releasing 12 million barrels of oil per day\u00a0into markets.\u00a0\n\"These are extraordinary times,\" said Frances Donald, chief economist at Manulife\u00a0Investment Management.\u00a0\"There's also an element of it that feels like you are really experiencing something new for the first time.\"\nIn the days since crude prices began tumbling, companies have started to announce cuts to their capital spending plans. Analysts expect companies to throttle back, or even shut-in, some production.\u00a0\nThis week, oilsands giant Cenovus Energy announced it was cutting its capital spending by 32 per cent to\u00a0between $900 million and $1 billion, down from\u00a0between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion.\nAs companies pull back, there are worries about job losses, with Alberta's premier saying he expects layoff announcements from the oil and gas sector in the next two to three weeks.\nBalance sheets are under close scrutiny and market watchers have already warned\u00a0the most vulnerable companies will be those carrying too much debt, have high operating costs and\u00a0limited access to funding.\nApril Read, a senior analyst with Wood Mackenzie, said in an interview Wednesday she doesn't expect capital spending to be the only thing companies put under the microscope.\u00a0\n\"I also think that companies will choose to spend less money on things like [share] buy-backs, we might see dividends cut,\" she said. \"I think you'll see companies hunker down.\"\nAlberta's oilpatch has had to do it before, most recently following the price slide that began in 2014. In the past five years,\u00a0analysts say, the industry has become leaner, more efficient and more innovative.\nFagerheim said Whitecap is setting priorities and working through them. One of those, he said,\u00a0is to\u00a0make decisions that protect value\u00a0and do \"not destroy what is there for the\u00a0longer term.\"\nFortuitously, he said, Canada's oilpatch is entering the spring breakup period, a shoulder season for drilling activity, when generally a limited amount of capital is spent between mid-March and mid-June.\n\"It's a natural break in the capital spending profile, which is a good thing,\" he said.\u00a0\"It gives us a little bit of time to think more, in a more relaxed manner, if you can call it relaxed, in a more organized fashion.\"\nThe market shakeup has spurred speculation the oilpatch could see more consolidation within the sector, but Fagerheim said that's way down the list of things to worry about right now.\nSayer Energy Advisors president Tom Pavic, an expert on merger and acquisition activity, said in an interview earlier this week that he expects CEOs will still be assessing what's happening in the market and how long it will last.\n\"I don't see anyone calling, 'OK, let's do a deal right now,' because it's so chaotic,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Why the TSX lost 1,500 points in just one week and what coronavirus has to do with it", "description": "China could set example for what happens after an economic pause due to COVID-19", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/bourse-anarchy-what-fear-of-the-coronavirus-is-doing-to-markets-1.5478665/why-the-tsx-lost-1-500-points-in-just-one-week-and-what-coronavirus-has-to-do-with-it-1.5480348", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5479444.1582900878!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/us-stocks-traders.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 29, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-02-29T09:00:00.812Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "North American stock markets just had their worst week since the 2008 market crash.

The deal\u00a0closed last Tuesday.\nThe purchase means PARC now owns four buildings\u00a0and operates 110 affordable housing units in South Parkdale. PARC helps Parkdale residents who live with poverty, mental health and addiction issues.\nWillis said the purchase is significant because it means PARC is expanding its role as a charity\u00a0that aims to provide \"safe, adequate, well-maintained, dignified homes\" in Parkdale, a neighbourhood where the charity estimates 90 per cent of residents are renters and more than 30 per cent of people live in poverty.\nThe building's tenants, who pay below market rent, will be allowed to stay. Many use PARC's services and are low income.\n\"We saw this as a really important opportunity to secure this housing so that it would stay affordable and below market in perpetuity,\" Willis told CBC Toronto on the weekend.\n\"We think\u00a0this is\u00a0an example of what needs to be done again and again. There are very few purchases like this happening now. There's an enormous trend towards buying up what was affordable housing and converting\u00a0it into unaffordable housing,\" he added.\nWillis said PARC\u00a0bought the building from a husband and wife who own a handful of properties in Toronto's west end. The two\u00a0sold because they\u00a0had to liquidate some of their\u00a0holdings.\nIn the building, which needs\u00a0about $500,000 worth of capital improvements, 35 out of 38 units are occupied. Rent ranges from just under $600 to just under $1,100. There are an estimated 36 tenants in the building, which has bachelor and one-bedroom apartments.\nWillis said the\u00a0fabric of Parkdale\u00a0is changing through gentrification.\u00a0Development pressures are increasing, there are stories of renovictions and people being priced out, and\u00a0landlords\u00a0are selling to developers and international investors.\n\"This is a very different response. It's a community based one,\" he said. \"Anybody who is living there can stay there as long as they wish. And their rents won't go up in any kind of dramatic fashion.\"\nPARC said in a news release: \"With the acquisition of this building, PARC intends to prevent the displacement of tenants out of the existing affordable housing stock, and to preserve and protect affordable housing for low-income residents.\"\nAs part of the deal with the city, rents have to remain affordable and nobody will\u00a0pay more than 80 per cent of average market rent.\u00a0Any vacancies that come up will be made available to people on the city's affordable housing wait lists.\nThe building itself at 1501 Queen Street West was constructed in 1912, has operated as an apartment building since it opened and is a mirror image of a nearby property, Edmond Place, 194 Dowling Ave., also owned and managed by PARC as supportive housing. These buildings, which are like book ends, were once called the Parkdale Mansions.\nIn the 1920s, before the great crash of October 1929, Parkdale was a posh neighbourhood with stately homes. Many of the\u00a0mansions then became guest and rooming homes. In the 1970s, some of the houses\u00a0became homes\u00a0for people who had been institutionalized in psychiatric hospitals.\n\"What's interesting about this is these buildings reflect some of the history of the old days of Parkdale,\" Willis said.\nLast September, when water from 1501 Queen Street West migrated into the basement of 1499 Queen Street West, representatives from both buildings went to investigate and the conversation about the sale and purchase of the building began, he said. The owners indicated they were getting ready to sell and PARC officials asked if they could buy.\nThe owners decided that selling to the charity\u00a0next door, which means rent would be kept stable, was the right thing to do.\nNow, Willis said the building is in need of upgrades\u00a0to heating and security systems, but the city has provided money for that as well. \"There's some work that needs to be done.\"\nFor Peter Martin, treasurer of the PARC board and a former lawyer,\u00a0the purchase makes a difference to the charity. Martin is an Ontario Disability Support Program recipient and once lived on the streets.\n\"We will be able to maintain affordable housing stock in Parkdale. We are going to be able to improve the quality of life within those buildings through making sure they are kept up to a decent standard.\u00a0We can integrate the tenants in those\u00a0buildings into the super structure of PARC's programming policies so that we can provide social supports as well as\u00a0safe spaces\u00a0for people to live in,\" Martin said.\n\"Those are\u00a0really good things,\" he said. \"A place like PARC can give you the supports. They can provide you with meals, counselling and\u00a0a social network of support with your peers.\"\nMartin said the purchase gives PARC a larger profile in the community.\n\"We are now a little bigger in the neighbourhood in terms of being a landlord. And that provides us with a bit more influence and weight when we speak to government about the problems with\u00a0affordable housing, We are becoming a bigger player in Parkdale\u00a0in terms of our role as a provider of affordable housing and it makes easier for us for our voice to be heard.\"\nMartin said Toronto's\u00a0current housing market pushes low income people to the margins. He said he knows about the importance of stable housing because, when he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder years ago, he had to move to\u00a0Toronto from northern Ontario to get the help\u00a0he needed. He had stopped working.\n\"I have had to live in places where no one should have to live in order to stay in Toronto to get the medical support\u00a0I needed as I went through my crisis,\" he said. \"The system itself\u00a0is not designed to help people like us.\"\nAs for financing of the building, the charity received a $4.5 million, 49-year forgivable loan from the city and donations\u00a0from the ECHO Foundation and the Sheila Koffman fund, individual donors and the Parkdale Neighbourhood Land Trust. The fund of the late Sheila Koffman, former owner of Another Story bookstore and chair of the PARC board, donated\u00a0$200,000.\nThe ECHO Foundation, a family foundation that supports charities that help people with mental health histories, has loaned $3 million to the organization.\nFounded in 1977, PARC provides a drop-in centre as well as\u00a0supportive housing and peer-support program and outreach programs. About 20 years ago, it began operating units of affordable housing for low-income adults who are experiencing mental health issues or addiction challenges in South Parkdale. \u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Rachel Ward", "title": "Gasoline prices dip below 80\u00a2 a litre at some Calgary pumps", "description": "Most city fuel stations selling regular gas for around 85\u00a2, tracker shows", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/gas-prices-low-calgary-1.5195434", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5495363.1584034440!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/driver-nayyer-azam.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 12, 2020 11:46 AM MT", "2020-03-12T17:46:14.920Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Gas prices at the pump are getting low \u2014 with a few stations\u00a0in Calgary selling fuel at just under 80 cents/litre.\nBy Saturday afternoon, prices could drop down toward 70 cents/litre, analyst\u00a0Dan McTeague\u00a0says.\nThese prices haven't been seen in Calgary since February 2016, says McTeague, president of\u00a0Canadians for Affordable Energy, an advocacy group.

They are kicking the can down the road by printing more money and throwing it at the economy \u2014 conditions that\u00a0are positive for stocks and stave off recessions.\u00a0\nForecast:\u00a0No recession in 2020.\nStock market investors were treated very well in 2019 with both North American and international markets experiencing double digit gains.\u00a0U.S. stocks were up by almost 30 per cent while Canadian, Chinese and European stock indices returned approximately 20 per cent.\u00a0\u00a0\nForecast:\u00a0Stock markets will be higher than they are today, but returns will be less then they were in 2019.\u00a0Mid to high single digit returns for the North American markets.\nDuring a U.S. election year, markets typically trend higher and finish the year with high single digit gains. They also tend to\u00a0be quite volatile so I'm expecting a couple of inter-year market corrections of at least 10 per cent. These corrections often occur when the political mud-slinging intensifies during the summer months leading up to the election. However, once a winner is declared \u2014 markets typically stabilize before finishing the year strong.\u00a0\nForecast:\u00a0Increased market volatility with several inter-year corrections, which I would treat as buying opportunities.\nEntering 2020, investors were feeling comfortable but that all changed when a U.S. drone killed a senior Iranian military figure and Iran vowed to retaliate. Following the attack, oil prices, the Canadian dollar and gold rose while stocks sold off. Since the attack, markets have recovered most of their losses and some (i.e. the Toronto Stock Exchange) are at new all-time highs.\nForecast: While the Middle East conflict is upsetting and worth monitoring,\u00a0I believe that other international factors such as\u00a0U.S.-China trade negotiations, Brexit and the U.S. and China's central banks' willingness to stimulate their economies will have more of an impact on global stock markets and economies.\nSince 2019 was a great year for global stock markets, now is a good\u00a0time to trim some profits and re-allocate them to investments that\u00a0are more defensive.\u00a0As 2020 is expected to be quite volatile, speak to your advisor about your portfolio's downside protection strategy as well as how it is positioned to benefit from an increase in market gyrations.\u00a0\nConsider tweaking the geographic asset allocation of your portfolio.\u00a0Do not be afraid to add to U.S. and international positions.\nForecast:\u00a0Canada will under-perform compared to the U.S. and international stock markets.\nOverall, I'm expecting slow growth to continue for most of the world economies and I believe that stocks will outperform bonds.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

The U.S. benchmark known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also fell to below $22\u00a0a barrel, a level it has not hit since 2003.\nThat was bad news for shares in oil companies, many of which\u00a0trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Selling on the TSX\u00a0was so heavy that automatic circuit breakers designed to give markets a pause during times of turmoil kicked in. When the decline hit seven per cent, markets were automatically shut down for a breather.\nWhen they reopened the selling continued, with the TSX closing down 963 points or almost eight per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared almost as bad, closing\u00a0below the 20,000-point level.\nThe TSX was mostly dragged down by shares in oil companies, which were themselves responding to a plunge in the price of crude. Oil is being walloped by too much supply\u00a0in a time of reduced demand\u00a0because of the coronavirus\u00a0pandemic.\nAfter more than a year of an uneasy collaboration to limit supply and try to keep prices up,\u00a0Saudi Arabia and Russia started a price war\u00a0earlier this month, flooding the market with their cheap oil that\u00a0kicked\u00a0off\u00a0a race to the bottom in terms of oil prices.\nCanadian oilsands oil always trades at a discount to lighter blends, such as Brent and WTI, because it is more difficult to transport and process. So\u00a0the oversupply has hit the price of WCS\u00a0even more than other types of oil.\n\"Russia and Saudi Arabia are having this pissing match,\" said Canoe Financial portfolio manager Rafi Tahmazian in an interview with CBC News. \"And we're just living with it.\"\nThe two oil giants are essentially staring each other down, daring the other to blink. And they're forcing\u00a0higher-cost producers out of business in the process.\n\"They're going to try to stick it out as long as they can to create maximum damage for the rest of the oil producers out there, for sure,\" he said.\nOil prices across the board have lost more than half of their value in a matter of weeks, but investment bank Goldman Sachs said\u00a0there's room to fall more because the coronavirus is eating into demand for oil at a time when there's too much of it to begin with.\n\"The oil demand collapse from the spreading coronavirus looks increasingly sharp,\" the bank said, predicting Brent crude could go as low as $20\u00a0a barrel later this year.\nIt's taking a hit on the demand side, too, however, as the coronavirus has taken a huge bite out of demand for energy as quarantines and shutdowns drastically reduce the need for oil.\n\"While the supply war continues between OPEC, Russia and others, demand expectations continue to decline with air and other travel being curtailed,\" said\u00a0Colin\u00a0Cieszynski, market strategist at SIA Wealth Management in Toronto.\nGoldman Sachs predicts the global demand for oil will decline by eight\u00a0million barrels a day this year.

Such measures may help the economy to withstand the impact of the coronavirus, but they will do very little to\u00a0put a bottom under the price of oil, which is subject to global forces outside of Canada's control.\n\"This virus is shutting down the world,\" Tahmazian said. \"Canada [has] a world of hurt ahead of it, and the U.S. has even more.\"\n"}, {"author": "Brooks DeCillia", "title": "CBC News Poll: In experts we trust (at least, more than we used to)", "description": "Poll suggests rising levels of trust for experts amongst Albertans, even before COVID-19 struck", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/cbc-news-poll-alberta-rising-trust-experts-1.5524722", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5506220.1586290264!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hinshaw-hero.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 08, 2020 5:00 AM MT", "2020-04-08T12:07:34.923Z"], "source": null, "content": "Editor's note: CBC News commissioned this public opinion research before concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic mounted. About half of the total survey of 1,200 respondents was conducted before stock markets and oil prices plunged (March 2-8).\u00a0 The other half of the interviews took place after this economic shock (March 9-18). Our analysis found no real difference in public opinion about experts between the two periods. Growing concerns about the pandemic continue to shape public attitudes.\nAs with all polls, this one is a snapshot in time. CBC News \u2014\u00a0and the public opinion experts consulted on this survey research \u2014\u00a0believe the data offers some valuable insights into Albertans'\u00a0attitudes about the economy and politics just at the moment when COVID-19 changed everything.\nThis is the fourth article to come out of this research. Read the previous articles here:\nAlison Van Rosendaal's eureka moment about experts came while tossing and turning in bed at 2:30 in the morning, unable to sleep.\u00a0\nThat's when she snapped a screen capture of Alberta's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw.\nLater, she traced the photo of the public health official with a felt pen, creating a T-shirt with the slogan \"What would Dr. Hinshaw do?\" The shirt eventually raised thousands of dollars for children and food banks across the province.\nVan Rosendaal wanted to publicly extol Hinshaw's calm, reassuring and expert delivery of lifesaving information in her daily briefings from the provincial capital about the coronavirus sweeping across the globe.\u00a0\n\"When people have more trust in experts, we have more in common with one another,\" she said.\nThe Calgary assistant school principal believes Alberta needs experts and scientists more than ever in this moment of profound uncertainty.\u00a0\nThere has long been a tension in Alberta between \"grassroots\" thinking and the opinions of those who are referred to (often pejoratively) as \"elites.\" This tension has been leveraged politically and socially to make arguments about whom to trust, but trust is more complicated than that.\nIn the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, being an expert is suddenly cool; people are tuning in to their press conferences, heeding their advice. And a new poll for CBC News suggests that even before cases of COVID-19 swelled worldwide, Albertans' trust in experts was on the rise.\u00a0\nThe poll found that 38 per cent of Albertans believe it's better to trust the down-to-earth thinking of ordinary people than the opinions of experts. That's a decline of seven percentage points from the last time CBC asked the same question, two years ago.\u00a0\nRemember, a poll is only a snapshot in time, and this is a very particular time in our society. But there could be longer-term implications for Alberta politics and society as we, and our politicians, rely on expert counsel during these troubled times.\nCOVID-19 has concentrated Canadians' minds. We are increasingly turning to medical experts and scientists for information to keep us and our families safe.\n\"We're in a period right now where we're relying heavily on our experts to see us through,\" said\u00a0Calgary-based pollster Janet Brown, who conducted the poll for CBC News.\nBrown thinks that trust will likely rise amongst Albertans as they look for reassuring, credible leaders to help explain the social and economic upheaval sparked by the global pandemic.\u00a0\n\"When you go through a crisis like this, it shouldn't be the majority rule,\" Brown said.\n\"It should be the smartest people in the room taking control. And it's interesting to see that Albertans are thinking less in a grassroots way and thinking more about making smarter, strategic decisions and being driven by what experts tell us.\"\u00a0\nTrust in government appears to be on the rise since self-isolating became the new normal.\u00a0\u00a0\nAn Angus Reid online poll of nearly 1,600 Canadians recently found that trust in all government officials \u2014 local, provincial and federal \u2014 has risen over the course of the pandemic.\u00a0\nBy our nature, Canadians tend to defer to authority, says Duane Bratt, who heads the department of economics, justice\u00a0and policy studies at Mount Royal University.\n\"I would say governments across Canada, no matter what their political affiliation is, have been fairly responsible, and have listened to the people who are experts in health pandemics,\" said\u00a0Bratt.\u00a0\nStill, partisanship and ideology play a role in which Albertans\u00a0trust experts.\nExactly half of United Conservative Party (UCP) supporters (50 per cent) say it's better to trust the down-to-earth thinking of ordinary people than experts. Only 24 per cent of New Democratic Party supporters agree with that sentiment. In fact, 72 per cent of NDP supporters disagree or strongly disagree with the idea of trusting down-to-earth thinking over experts.\u00a0\nSelf-identified left-of-centre voters across Alberta prefer experts at 76 per cent; compared with 52 per cent of voters who describe themselves as either centrist or right of centre.\nPoliticians sometimes leverage the concept of \"out-of-touch elites\" \u2014 portraying themselves as \"grassroots\"\u00a0or \"common sense\"\u00a0to win votes.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt plays well for some voters, especially those with more traditional values, as we can see in the graph above.\nWhen it comes to religion, 48 per cent of those who say religion is important or somewhat important in their life\u00a0trust experts over down-to-earth thinking. That number jumps to 67 per cent for non-religious voters.\nEducation also makes a difference. While 70 per cent of people with a university degree would rather trust experts, just 33 per cent of Albertans with a high school education feel the same way.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere's also an age divide in Alberta. Fifty-one per cent of seniors are more likely to place their trust in down-to-earth thinking, versus only 30 per cent of those aged 18-24.\nBut trust, it turns out, is a different story when it comes to political elites.\nIt can be argued that politicians, too, are experts and elites. We trust them to make deeply informed, substantive decisions about our lives, the economy and the law.\nBut the CBC News Road Ahead 2020 survey suggests Albertans' distrust in politicians of all stripes remains high.\nA full 78 per cent think politicians lose touch after they get elected. This has declined only slightly \u2014 by four percentage points \u2014 since CBC News asked the same question in 2018.\n\"I think the big story here is the lack of change,\" said data scientist John Santos, with Janet Brown Opinion Research.\n\"There's a slight drop between 2018 and 2020, and that's likely due to the UCP being in power and the fact that they have more partisans than the NDP does.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThere are simply more UCP supporters in Alberta than NDP partisans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBroadly, though, this shows that disaffection and cynicism toward politicians continues to be high in Alberta.\u00a0\nWeeks and months of watching public health and scientific experts on our TV screens, and seeing them quoted in the articles we read, could have an impact on how Albertans trust experts down the road.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"People might be thinking, experts like doctors and epidemiologists and statisticians, those are the people that are really important right now and they're going to help us through this crisis,\" said Santos.\u00a0\nAlison Van Rosendaal, for her part, is heartened by the growing faith in experts amongst Albertans.\nShe hopes this growing trust can help foster more collective action.\n\"To live in a world where people lean into the experts\u00a0\u2026\u00a0means that more of us are on the same side,\" she said. \"So that gives me hope.\"\nTo track that, CBC News intends to repeat some aspects of the Road Ahead 2020 survey later in the year.\nMethodology:\nThe CBC News\u00a0random survey of 1,200 Albertans was conducted using a hybrid method between March 2 and March 18, 2020, by Edmonton-based Trend Research under the direction of Janet Brown Opinion Research. The sample is representative along regional, age and gender factors. The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For subsets, the margin of error is larger.\nThe survey used a hybrid methodology that involved contacting survey respondents by telephone and giving them the option of completing the survey at that time, at another more convenient time, or receiving an email link and completing the survey online. Trend Research contacted people using a random list of numbers, consisting of half land lines and half cellphone numbers. Telephone numbers were dialled up to five times at five different times of day before another telephone number was added to the sample. The response rate among valid numbers (i.e. residential and personal) was 13.2 per cent.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Murray Street stabbing now homicide investigation", "description": "58-year-old man died in hospital Saturday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/stabbing-homicide-murray-street-1.5505893", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4036810.1548207786!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ottawa-police-stock-image.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 21, 2020 7:57 PM ET", "2020-03-21T23:57:29.774Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Ottawa police say an investigation into a daylight stabbing in the ByWard Market is now a murder investigation.\nA 58-year-old man was stabbed in\u00a0the 200 block of Murray Street\u00a0Thursday afternoon.\nHe died in hospital Saturday morning, police said.\nTwo men were taken into custody.

We're doing that.\"\nQuebec is expected to have a surplus of between $1.5 and $2 billion heading into the coming financial year.

But in recent years, central banks in Europe and Asia have gone as far as making their interest rates go below zero in an attempt to counter unprecedented economic situations.\n\"As long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates, the USA should also accept the 'GIFT',\" Trump tweeted.\nAs long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates, the USA should also accept the \u201cGIFT\u201d.

economy\u00a0by raising precautionary savings rates and reducing incentives to lend.\n\"As the euro area, Japan, Sweden\u00a0and Switzerland have shown, there's no conclusive evidence to suggest that negative rates lift lending, growth\u00a0or inflation,\" Schamotta said.\nWhile pouring cold water on the idea of negative rates, Powell didn't suggest the Fed planned to stay on the sidelines while the U.S. economy goes through what he described as an experience \"significantly worse\" than any recession seen since the Second World War.\nPowell cautioned that widespread bankruptcies among small businesses and extended unemployment for many people remain a serious risk.\n\"We ought to do what we can to avoid these outcomes,\" Powell said.\nBank of Montreal economist Michael Gregory said there's a lot that the Fed can still do besides negative savings rates.\n\"The Fed has more policy cards up its sleeve, and is more than willing to play them to promote economic recovery,\" he said. \"And it won't be taking these cards off the table for a while.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Wealth of billionaires falls for 1st time since 2015 as uncertainty hits the super-wealthy",

reduced the wealth of billionaires for the first time since 2015.\nBillionaires' wealth fell by 4.3 per cent\u00a0globally to $8.5 trillion US last year, the joint UBS-PwC report found, with a sharp decline in China, including Hong Kong, and the Asia-Pacific region more broadly.\nPrivate wealth in Hong Kong fell four\u00a0per cent\u00a0in 2018 to $319.8 billion US, the report showed, with months of anti-government protests in the Chinese-ruled city and an economic recession clouding the outlook this year.\nSome Hong Kong tycoons have begun moving personal wealth offshore, Reuters reported in June, as concerns deepen over the protests.\n\"We haven't seen any significant outflows;\u00a0we have been tracking some of these numbers on a regular basis,\" said Amy Lo, UBS's co-head of Asia Pacific wealth management. \"Our clients have been diversifying all along;\u00a0it's not in the last one year.\"\nPrivate banks, including the world's largest wealth manager UBS, have felt the effects of U.S.-China trade tensions and global political uncertainties, as clients last year shied away from trading and taking on debt in favour of hoarding cash.\nThe net worth of China's richest dropped 12.8 per cent\u00a0in dollar terms on the back of tumbling stock markets, a weaker local currency and a slowdown in growth, the report found, knocking dozens off the billionaires list.\nDespite the drop, China still produces a new billionaire every two to 2.5 days, UBS's head of ultra-high net worth clients, Josef Stadler, said in the report released\u00a0Friday.\nWorldwide, the number of billionaires fell everywhere except in the Americas, where tech entrepreneurs continued to buoy the ranks of the United States'\u00a0wealthiest.\n\"This report shows the resilience of the U.S. economy,\" where there were 749 billionaires at the end of 2018, said John Matthews, head of private wealth management and ultra-high net worth business for UBS in the U.S.\nWhile a stock market recovery from a steep drop in late 2018 has helped wealth managers increase their assets, the world's richest families remain concerned about global affairs\u00a0\u2014\u00a0from trade tensions and Brexit, to populism and climate change \u2014 and are keeping more of their money in cash.\n\"It is likely that billionaire wealth will go up again this year,\" said Simon Smiles, UBS's chief investment officer for ultra-wealthy clients, adding it would likely be a more muted increase than the wider financial market rally might suggest.\n"}, {"author": "Peter Zimonjic, Vassy Kapelos",

program, the stores don't qualify for that, that have the federal government as their landlord,\" Barrett told CBC News Network's Power & Politics Friday.\u00a0\nThe Canada emergency commercial rent

The landlord is responsible for 25 per cent while the tenant is responsible for the remaining 25 per cent.\u00a0\nTo be eligible, property owners must cut the rent they collect by 75 per cent and promise not to evict their tenant. If they can follow those rules, the government will forgive the loans.\u00a0\nTo qualify, small business tenants must pay less than $50,000 a month in rent. They also must have experienced a revenue decline of at least 70 per cent from pre-COVID-19 levels, or must have been forced to close down because of pandemic restrictions.\nBarrett said\u00a0she wants to be supportive of the federal government's efforts because she realizes the enormity of the challenge it is facing;\u00a0but for duty free shop owners, time is running out.\u00a0\n\"What we're asking for is for them to get this aligned ...\u00a0they need to do (this) quickly because the stores are on the brink,\" she said.\u00a0\nFor Simon Resch, the owner of Emerson Duty Free in Emerson, Man., rent is not the\u00a0issue.

Until then, markets have been grasping at guesses about how long businesses will remain shut down, layoffs will soar and flights remain cancelled due to measures meant to slow the spread of the virus.\nThat's why the number of infections and deaths will likely dominate markets more than anything else, particularly this upcoming week, which is relatively light on economic reports, Frederick said.\n\"The virus is not everything, it's the only thing, and nothing else really matters,\" he said.\nThe S&P 500 climbed 175.03, or 7 per cent, to 2,663.68, and nearly all the stocks in the index were higher.

It would be Japan's largest-ever package for the economy and nearly twice as much as expected.\nJapan's economy was already shrinking late last year before the outbreak forced the global economy into a protective coma induced by health authorities.\nThe announcement pushed Japan's Nikkei 225 index to surge 4.2 per cent. Elsewhere in Asia, South Kora's Kospi jumped 3.9 per cent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 2.2 per cent\nIn Europe, Germany's DAX returned 4.9 per cent\u00a0and France's CAC 40 jumped 3.8 per cent.

A meeting between OPEC, Russia and other producers initially planned for Monday, though, was reportedly pushed back to Thursday.\nBenchmark\u00a0U.S. crude fell $1.01 to $27.33 per barrel.

But even now, with rare exceptions, predictions for the economy range from moderately gloomy to what may be wishful thinking.\nThe often-bleak David Rosenberg, who now runs his own independent research company, concedes U.S. Federal Reserve's\u00a0massive cash injection may avert an economic depression. For Rosenberg, that's positively cheery.\nThe current index of economic policy uncertainty is like nothing we have ever seen before and we have to say that in a strong sense: not like 2008, not like 9/11, not like 1997/8 or 87. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SoberLook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SoberLook</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jI162Fm0hn\">pic.twitter.com/jI162Fm0hn</a>\nBut uncertainty remains extraordinarily high and with such a range of views each of us must either pick among the forecasts or make up our own. With that in mind, here are a few considerations to help you think about what the future may hold.\nWhile a new round of emergency rate cuts, income support and mortgage deferment plans should help heavily indebted Canadians from hitting rock bottom, it is inevitable that many will go further into the hole. There are reports that credit card companies are already worried as consumers are using plastic to replace lost income.\nAll that raises questions about whether, once the illness is past, consumers can resume their role as debt-fuelled motors of the North American economy. Meanwhile, governments are accumulating\u00a0massive new debts of their own. Highly leveraged businesses also face strain.\nOverall, recessions hurt people, but some economic theory says that capitalism actually needs periodic downturns to refresh itself through creative destruction. Weak \"zombie\" businesses and sunset industries are finally killed off, clearing the way for healthier, younger or more efficient firms, making the whole economy stronger in the aftermath. But the adjustment process is far from instant and can be painful for displaced workers.\nOne of the recent bright spots in the economy has been low unemployment, but a sharp rise in U.S. jobless claims made headlines last week, and this week's upcoming U.S. job numbers will tell us more. Canada's come on the Thursday before Easter.\nTravel restrictions have already stopped immigration and despite objections from refugee advocates, the border has also closed to asylum seekers. Restrictions of weeks or months will lead to a backlog of immigration cases and as the economy works through its recovery, governments may face pressure to limit the total flow of immigrants.\nOne reason for real estate fears in Alberta is that few parts of the Canadian economy have been as battered by the COVID-19 crisis as the oil and gas sector, where the cost of a barrel of oil sands crude has fallen below price for the\u00a0Barrel of Monkeys childrens' game. Despite low gasoline prices partly caused by a global price war led by Saudi Arabia, sales have plummeted as people stay home. Storage capacity has reached its limits meaning that even with federal and provincial help producers are shutting down. For incurable optimists, one positive effect could be the redirection of investment toward diversification.\u00a0\nIt seems almost certain that as low prices slow exploration and drive some producers out of business, oil prices will bounce back. Of course, the question is when. Spending on COVID-19 testing may yield surprising results as they did in places like Singapore. It is also almost certain that as soon as they are released, commerce-starved shut-ins who do have money to shop will rush out to spend it on goods and services. That one-time burst of spending could act in a similar way to Keynesian stimulation, kick-starting the economy and sending businesses that have survived to new heights. In post-war kind of mood, perhaps we will experience post-war solidarity and goodwill based on shared experience to help solve our economic problems. And while some doubt it, another lingering effect may be a baby boom from couples who were just looking for a way to keep busy.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "Will COVID-19 cause the next North American recession?", "description": "Finance columnist Mark Ting answers questions about the financial impact of coronavirus", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-recession-mark-ting-1.5489238", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5482127.1583167370!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus-italy.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 08, 2020 1:00 PM PT", "2020-03-08T20:00:00.911Z"], "source": null, "content": "I have recently received several emails from concerned investors asking for my perspective on COVID-19's\u00a0effects on the global economy.\u00a0Bear in mind that I'm a portfolio manager\u00a0who isn't clairvoyant nor a virologist, and who doesn't know the ultimate financial impact of the novel coronavirus.\u00a0\nBelow are the answers to some frequently asked questions:\nWhy did the stock markets react so negatively to the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interests rates by half a per cent?\nCentral banks cut interest rates in order to stimulate the economy. A rate cut is an admission that an economy is struggling and many saw the size of this cut (half a per cent) as a \"desperate\" move by a panicked central bank. As a result, the markets sold off.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWill the half point cut in interest rates have the desired effect and help stabilize the economy and stock market?\nA drop in interest rates normally encourages people to borrow and spend, thus benefiting an economy and encouraging growth. However, with the coronavirus \u2014\u00a0unless it's toilet paper\u00a0\u2014 people don't seem to be in a buying mood and that likely won't change until the virus is contained,\u00a0regardless of how low rates go.\nI do believe the rate cut will help stabilize the economy, but not until the coronavirus peaks and begins declining. That's when we should see an uptick in economic activity as global economies recover, demand picks up and businesses increase production.\u00a0\nHow long will the coronavirus disrupt global economies?\nIt depends on the economy. In China, the virus appears to have peaked and is declining (see chart below), and their economy is normalizing.\u00a0For example, 85 per cent of Starbucks\u00a0stores\u00a0have re-opened and Foxcomm, the company that\u00a0manufactures the iPhone, expects to resume normal production by the end of March.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile the Chinese are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, North America is just entering the tunnel.\u00a0However, if we follow a trajectory similar to China's, the virus should run its course in a month or\u00a0two, but as I said at the outset \u2014 nobody knows with any certainty.\nDo you think the impact of the coronavirus will push our economy into a recession?\nWe will likely experience a technical recession in 2020. The definition of a recession is a decline in gross domestic product for two or more consecutive quarters.\u00a0That's just six months of declining growth \u2014 which seems plausible given all the slow downs we are experiencing.\u00a0\nIf I'm right, when the word \"recession\" starts trending \u2014 I will take that as a good sign as it often means we are on the road to recovery. In terms of timing, my estimate would be mid-summer when viruses are less prevalent.\u00a0\u00a0\nFollowing a shock-type disruption like a viral outbreak or natural disaster, there is often an uptick in economic activity that helps an economy recover and lifts it out of recession.\u00a0It is at this point where the stimulus created by the interest rate cuts would take effect.\nWhile I do expect a technical recession \u2014 I don't expect it to last long or be as severe as the one we experienced in 2008.\nWith stock markets down over 10 per cent for the year \u2014 is now a good time to invest?\nYou might be surprised to hear that the Shanghai Stock Exchange has fully recovered since experiencing their big drop on Feb 3.\u00a0The China Shenzhen Small/Medium index is faring even better, nearing all-time highs. It only took a month for the Chinese markets to recover.\nIt would be great if the North American markets followed a similar path, but I'm not sure they will.\u00a0I'm adjusting my portfolio and preparing for the recovery. The volatility will continue for a while so I'm in no rush.\u00a0\nIf \u2014 when \u2014\u00a0the coronavirus officially becomes a \"pandemic\" or officially causes a \"recession,\" that will likely cause\u00a0what Baron Rothschild called \"blood on the streets,\" which usually means great buying opportunities.\u00a0For now, I'll be patient, but I don't think it will be too long before I start bargain hunting.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

They spent the mandatory two weeks in quarantine.\n\"It wasn't bad. I made up my mind and said, 'I have to do what I have to do,'\" he said Friday.\nHe and his coworkers all emerged with no signs of COVID-19 and started working Thursday. Ellin said he's farmed in Nova Scotia for a few years and was happy to be back, despite the pandemic.\n\"I like it here and the people that I work with show me love. Love is everything. It don't make sense to be somewhere and there's no love. These people show me love and respect,\" he said.\nEllin said Canadian dollars pack a lot of buying power in Jamaica and he sends most of his earnings home to support his wife and their three teenagers. \"We just have to be safe, do what we're supposed to do, and stay away from this virus,\" he said.\nEvery year,\u00a0the Canadian agricultural industry employs about 60,000 temporary foreign workers. When Canada closed its border on March 21 to non-essential travel, it initially included such\u00a0workers. They were subsequently granted an exemption, but had to quarantine following their arrival.\nJosh Oulton operates TapRoot Farms and spent much of the last two weeks shopping for the farmers and checking on their health. Everyone emerged with no signs of the virus, he said Friday.\nHe said they've got a physical-distancing system set up that should keep everyone apart and they're spacing trips to town out like everyone else. \"We're trying our best,\" Oulton said.\nThe early spring meant they could have started a few weeks ago, but he said they're in good shape now.\nOver at Charles Keddy Farms in Lakeville, N.S., 14 Jamaican farmers have also safely served their mandatory quarantine\u00a0and started work planting and harvesting strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, asparagus, rhubarb and sweet potato. They also sell nursery stock.\n\"During that two-week period, we went and brought in the groceries they required so they didn't leave the property,\" Charles Keddy said Friday.\nThe temporary foreign workers are living in two bunk houses, rather than sharing one as usual, so that everyone can live and work with physical distancing.\n\"We wouldn't be in business without temporary foreign workers,\" Keddy said.\nHe's about a month behind because of the pandemic restrictions.\n\"It's a hard job to catch up when you get behind, particularly on an early spring growing season that we have right now, but we're transplanting as fast as we can and we're shipping orders all over North America. We're behind, but we hope to gradually catch up,\" he said.\nThe Jamaican farmers are mostly staying on the farm, he said. Usually, they head into town on a Friday night to meet up with their compatriots. That won't happen until the lockdown eases.\n\"They know it's the 'new normal' condition of not being able to leave the bunkhouse. They're just glad to be here and glad to be able to earn some wages to support their families,\" Keddy said.\n\"They just want to earn some money so they can send it home to their families. Without these temporary foreign workers, food would be much more expensive, and there\u00a0would be a much smaller selection of horticultural products on the supermarket shelves in Canada.\"\n"}, {"author": "Kelda Yuen, Muriel Draaisma", "title": "Some Toronto workers 'left out' of federal financial support amid COVID-19", "description": "Canada Emergency Response Benefit has gaps that need to be fixed, workers say", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canada-emergency-response-benefit-workers-left-out-federal-income-support-1.5522856", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5522901.1586131596!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/stock-markets-covid-19.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 06, 2020 5:00 AM ET", "2020-04-06T09:00:00.796Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Toronto Mayor John Tory says a federal emergency benefit rolling out on Monday will provide \"a lot of help to a lot of people\" out of work due to COVID-19, but some city residents say the temporary income support has gaps that need to be fixed.\nThe measure is called the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and it will provide those who are eligible with $2,000 a month for up to four months.\u00a0\nSome health-care workers interviewed by CBC Toronto say they are being left out even though they are doing important work.\nJustin Vanderleest, owner of a physiotherapy clinic with two locations in Etobicoke, said the eight practitioners at the clinic have moved to serving patients online through Telehealth, but there are far fewer patients these days. At first, revenues dropped by 99 per cent, he said.\nThe clinic, Citrus Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation, has six physiotherapists and two chiropractors. Three of its four administrators were laid off right away. The locations were closed on March 15. One administrator is working at home, while the physiotherapists may have a few appointments a week and are making maybe a couple of hundred dollars a month.\n\"Our business is going to go bankrupt in a month if the government doesn't change the CERB to allow physiotherapists to collect it while continuing to try to build a virtual caseload through Telehealth and video conferencing,\" Vanderleest said on Sunday.\n\"Really, we have to generate some revenue,\" he said. \"What the government needs to do is make the CERB available to people who are trying to build some sort of a Telehealth market.\"\nHis practitioners are not eligible for the CERB because they are continuing to work. The benefit is offered only to those who have lost all income. The practitioners are also not eligible for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) because they are contractors.\nAccording to the government, the subsidy would cover 75 per cent of salaries for qualifying businesses, for up to 3 months, retroactive to March 15.\nVanderleest said the work done by his clinic can keep people who are getting injured in vehicle crashes and in workplace accidents out of hospitals. He said the work is clearly worthwhile during a pandemic.\nLinda Hochstetler, a registered social worker and psychotherapist at the Village Healing Centre, said the benefit and wage subsidy will not help her either.\u00a0\nShe is making 25 per cent of her usual pay and thus ineligible for the benefit. As a social worker, she is not allowed to charge the HST and thus ineligible for the wage subsidy. She is not eligible for Employment Insurance because she doesn't pay into it.\nShe has closed her office but is still serving a few clients over the phone and through video conference.\n\"Because we are doing small amounts of work to keep our most at-risk clients serviced, we are being left out of the federal money,\" Hochstetler said.\n\"I'm working double as hard and I'm earning a quarter of the money,\" she added. \"If I wanted to, I could see nobody and then qualify for the CERB, but that's ethically not a great choice.\"\nDavid Whitten, a partner at\u00a0the law firm Whitten and Lublin Employment Lawyers, said the benefit\u00a0is designed to help people who cannot work, not for people who have chosen not to work, due to COVID-19. People who cannot work due to the virus include those diagnosed as having it, or whose employer has shut down and temporarily laid them off, or people who have been exposed to the virus and may be infected.\nHe said the benefit\u00a0is not there for any leave associated with COVID-19.\u00a0\n\"People appear to be of the opinion that [it's for those who]\u00a0just don't want to go into work, because they have an irrational belief perhaps that their workplace may expose them to COVID-19 when\u00a0there is no reason for believing\u00a0that, no objective evidence to suggest\u00a0that. They are not eligible for it,\" Whitten.\n\"You have to have some evidence that you either were exposed\u00a0and are now self-isolating, your employer can't continue to employ you because they have been shut down, or you have been diagnosed yourself.\"\nHe urges people to apply for EI\u00a0to top up their income if they are working reduced hours and are eligible.\nWhitten said people also need to think about the post-pandemic economy and where they are going to find work when the curve flattens.\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged there are gaps in the benefit.\n\"We hear these concerns and we're seeking solutions and we will continue to work on them.\"\nFor his part, Tory said he strongly supports the introduction of the CERB by the federal government. He described it as \"an incredibly welcome measure\" that will put money in the pockets of Canadians.\n\"It will provide a lot of help to a lot of people very quickly,\" Tory said in a statement.\n\"It is a timely and substantive response to the crisis many individual Canadians find themselves in through no fault of their own and will help relieve some of the anxiety they are experiencing,\" he added.\n\"I hope Canadians follow the registration regime set out by the government, which has set ambitious rollout plans in place and needs co-operation to make them work.\"\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said in a statement on Sunday that the federal benefit will help Ontario residents.\n\"Our government has been in constant contact with our federal counterparts and we have been working hard to coordinate a response that will provide immediate support to the health system and direct supports to businesses and workers,\" Ford said.\n\"The reality is the issues we face today will not be the issues we face tomorrow so we are counting on the federal government to continue to work with us to ensure the health and wellbeing of every Ontarian and their family.\" \u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Shell cuts dividend for first time since Second World War", "description": "Oil company worried that global recession could extend to 2023", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/shell-dividend-profit-1.5550695", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3610373.1464787107!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/russia-shell-oil-barrel.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 30, 2020 12:17 PM ET", "2020-04-30T16:17:45.300Z"], "source": null, "content": "Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend for the first time since the Second World War on Thursday, in a drastic step to preserve cash as it prepares for a protracted slump in demand for oil because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Anglo-Dutch energy company also suspended share buybacks and said it would reduce oil and gas output by about a quarter after its net profit almost halved in the first three months of 2020 to $2.9 billion US.\nThe new measures combined with cuts in capital spending and planned cost reductions announced last month could save Shell almost $30 billion this year to help it weather the crisis and prepare for the transition to low-carbon energy.\n\"We are living through a crisis of uncertainty,\" CEO Ben van Beurden said. \"If we had not cut the dividend ... we would have been left without options to reposition the company for the recovery and the future.\"\nShares in Shell had slumped 8.2 per cent\u00a0in London, underperforming rival BP,which said on Tuesday it was maintaining its first-quarter dividend.\nFor years, Shell has taken pride in having never cut its dividend since the 1940s, resisting such a move even during the deep downturns in the oil market of the 1980s.\nSome investors had called on major oil firms to break the industry taboo around dividends because of the fallout from the health crisis, rather than taking on more debt to maintain payouts.\nShell said it would reduce its quarterly dividend to 16 cents per share from 47 cents, which would save the company\u00a0about $10 billion this year if it stays at that level. Shell last changed its dividend at the start of 2014, raising it from 45 cents.\nShell is the first of the five so-called Oil Majors to cut its dividend because of the coronavirus crisis. Besides BP, Exxon Mobil has also said it will maintain its first-quarter dividend while Total and Chevron have yet to report first-quarter results.\n\"Shell's dividend cut has thrown down the gauntlet to the supermajors. BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total are due to pay out $41 billion of dividends in 2020,\" said Tom Ellacott, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie.\nVan Beurden said the dividend cut was part of a long-term resetting of the company that would also play a core part in Shell's shift away from fossil fuels.\nOil and gas companies have come under increasing pressure from investors worried about climate change and Shell this month laid out the sector's most extensive strategy yet to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.\n\"Ripping off the Band-Aid always hurts, but if Royal Dutch Shell's move today allows more room for alternative energy investments, and facilitates a lower cost of equity, it could be just what the company needs to ensure its long-term health,\" said Tal Lomnitzer, a senior investment manager at Janus Henderson Investors.\nWood Mackenzie said the cut meant Shell would be able to generate cash with oil at $36 a barrel, down from $51 previously. Brent crude has fallen 65 per cent so far this year and was trading at about $25 a barrel on Thursday.\nShell paid about $15 billion in dividends last year, making it the world's biggest payer of dividends after Saudi Arabia's national oil company, Saudi Aramco. Dividends paid by Shell and BP last year make up almost one quarter of all the dividend income paid out by companies on London's benchmark stock index, the FTSE 100.\nFollowing years of deep cost cuts after its acquisition of BG Group for $53 billion in 2016, Shell had previously planned to boost payouts through dividends and share buybacks to $125 billion between 2021 and 2025.\nGlobal energy demand could slump by six\u00a0per cent\u00a0in 2020 due to coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions in what would be the largest contraction in absolute terms on record, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.\nShell last month said it would reduce capital expenditure this year to $20 billion US at most from a planned level of about $25 billion US\u00a0and cut an additional $3 billion to $4 billion off operating costs over the next 12 months.\nVan Beurden said he expected the impact of the drop in oil demand to be more severe in the second quarter, while chief financial officer Jessica Uhl said the company was bracing for a deeper and longer recession that would extend into 2023.\nShell's first-quarter net income attributable to shareholders based on a current cost of supplies and excluding identified items fell 46 per cent\u00a0from a year earlier to $2.9 billion, above the consensus in an analyst survey provided by Shell.\nThe company said it cut activity at its refining business by up to 40 per cent\u00a0and expected to cut oil and gas production in the second quarter to between 1.75 million and 2.25 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) from 2.7 million boed in the first quarter. Shell said it did not expect the cuts to be permanent and it would still invest in oil and gas projects.\nShell, the world's largest fuel retailer with 45,000 filling stations, said its fuel sales could fall up to 54 per cent\u00a0in the second quarter.\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "Will COVID-19 affect the spring real estate market?", "description": "Mark Ting, On the Coast's finance columnist, on what you should do if you're looking to buy \u2014 or sell", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-spring-real-estate-1.5497726", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5488430.1583513444!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/downtown-vancouver-towers-real-estate-condos.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 14, 2020 7:00 AM PT", "2020-03-15T21:54:29.996Z"], "source": null, "content": "Unlike the stock market, COVID-19 hasn't affected the Lower Mainland real estate market \u2014 at least, not in a negative way.\nA friend of mine just closed on an apartment for $500,000 where she had to deal with a bidding war and ended up paying over asking. Open houses are still well-attended and quality properties are being snapped up quickly.

Anyone with an existing variable mortgage, or someone looking to get one,\u00a0can expect their borrowing costs to decrease.\u00a0The Bank of Canada cut rates by a full percentage point\u00a0since the beginning of\u00a0March.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe are also seeing investors flee the stock market and park their money in investment grade bonds. A result of this flight to safety is that fixed-term mortgage rates are dropping. Lower mortgage rates increase the amount a home buyer can borrow, which pushes up prices as borrowers are able to make higher offers.\u00a0\nWe also cannot forget about the mortgage stress test. On Feb.\u00a018, the federal government announced that the hurdle rate of the stress test would be lowered effective April 6.\u00a0 In anticipation of this change, many buyers re-entered the housing market, increasing demand on a real estate market with limited inventory.\u00a0 However, as of last Friday, the Department of Finance announced that changes to the stress test have been put on hold.\u00a0\nAll these factors are fuelling the housing market and not even COVID-19 appears to be able to slow it down\u00a0\u2014 yet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIt was just a month ago when stock markets were at an all-time high, largely due to the fear of missing out, whereas today it's\u00a0the opposite:\u00a0many people are panic selling.\nThe same could happen,\u00a0but to a lesser degree, with real estate, as buying psychology is fickle.\nIt's important to also keep in mind that, since all financial markets are interconnected, a stock market drop should affect the housing market. For example, many new buyers turn to the bank of mom and dad to help with their down payment. However, after experiencing a drop in their investment portfolio many parents will be less inclined, or no longer able, to help their children fund a down payment.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother important factor to consider is the potential loss of income that COVID-19 may cause. Some lenders might be hesitant to lend to applicants working in areas affected by the pandemic such as the travel or oil and gas industries.\u00a0\u00a0\nAll these variables can affect demand.\nIf I were a buyer, I would be cautious. Don't underestimate COVID-19's negative impacts on the economy, jobs and buyers' sentiment and avoid overstretching your budget \u2014 something that tends to happen when buying in a seller's market.\nMy advice to sellers who are looking to cash out or downsize\u00a0is to list their properties right away. Momentum is on your side and there is limited inventory, so sellers of quality homes are getting top dollar. The demand is currently high, but I wouldn't be complacent and assume that it will last.

There are signs that the outbreak has begun to ebb in China.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1703880259993", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Markets up sharply, rebounding from 7-day, coronavirus-driven decline", "description": "Rally comes amid hope central banks will cut rates to shore up economies ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/markets-virus-concerns-1.5482163", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5480488.1582924437!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tsx-sign-bmo-february-28-2020.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 02, 2020 10:31 AM ET", "2020-03-03T14:05:45.755Z"], "source": null, "content": "Stocks rose sharply on Wall Street Monday, clawing back some of the losses they took in a seven-day rout brought on by worries that the coronavirus outbreak will stunt the global economy.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 700 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 climbed 2.3 per cent, placing in on track for its best day since January 2019. The S&P 500 is coming off a weekly loss of 11.5 per cent, its worst since October 2008 during the global financial crisis.\nDespite the pickup in stocks, the bond market signalled that investors are still worried. Bond prices climbed, pushing yields to more record lows. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.08 per cent from 1.12 per cent late Friday. Gold, another traditional safe-haven asset, rose 1.7 per cent.\nThe big bounce in stocks came after an especially wild day of trading on Friday in which the Dow sank more than 1,000 points before a late wave of buying left it down 350.\nInvestors are increasingly anticipating that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks around the world will lower interest rates or take other steps to shield the global economy from the effects of the outbreak.\n\"Investors have convinced themselves that global central banks will likely be even more accommodative in order to short-circuit any psychological damage,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\nThe Dow climbed 1,293.96 points, or 5.09\u00a0per cent, to\u00a026,703.32 by market close. The S&P 500 index rose 4.6\u00a0per cent and the Nasdaq gained 4.49 per cent. European benchmarks were mostly higher, and Asian markets rose broadly.\u00a0\nCanada's main stock index, the\u00a0S&P/TSX Composite Index, dipped at opening but was up\u00a0290.21, or 1.8 per cent, to\u00a016,553.26 by day's end.\nThe International Monetary Fund and World Bank announced simultaneously Monday that they are ready to help countries affected by the coronavirus through their emergency lending programs and other tools.\n\"We will use our available instruments to the fullest extent possible,\" the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, and World Bank President David Malpass said in a joint statement. \"International co-operation is essential.\"\nThe statement echoed similar promises to act if necessary from the Federal Reserve on Friday and the Bank of Japan over the weekend. Some analysts now speculate that the Fed could cut rates sometime this week, before its next formal meeting March 17-18. Traders have priced in a 100 per cent probability that the Fed will cut rates by a half-percentage point during or before its March meeting.\nThere were signs that the economic impact was continuing to mount. A measure of China's manufacturing output plunged last month to its lowest level on record, as the viral outbreak closed factories and disrupted supply chains.\nSeparately, economists at Goldman Sachs slashed their forecasts for U.S. growth to just 0.9 per cent in the first quarter and to zero for the April-June quarter.\nThe Organization for Economic Development, a research organization made up of mostly advanced economies, cut its world growth forecast in a report Monday. The OECD said that even if there are only limited outbreaks outside China, the global economy will grow just 2.4 per cent this year, the weakest since the financial crisis in 2009. That forecast matches several private estimates.\nIf other countries are hit with outbreaks similar to China's, growth could fall as low as 1.5 per cent, the OECD said.\nFor investors, the great amount of uncertainty over how consumer behaviour and spending will be affected has been unsettling.\n\"It's not a typical economic blow,\" said Bill Strazzullo of Bell Curve Trading. \"What if major cities are on some kind of a lockdown? What will that do to restaurants, entertainment, shopping, travel? It's almost impossible to game this out.\"\nLast week's rout knocked every major index into what market watchers call a \"correction,\" or a fall of 10 per cent or more from a peak. Market watchers have said for months that stocks were overpriced and long overdue for another pullback. The last time the market had a drop of that size was in late 2018, when the trade war with China was escalating and investors were worried about rising interest rates.\nThe virus outbreak that began in central China has been shutting down industrial centres, emptying shops and severely crimping travel all over the world. More companies are warning investors that their finances will take a hit because of disruptions to supply chains and sales.\nAs fear over the coronavirus' spread hits consumers, shoppers stocking up on everyday goods helped lift shares in household goods companies. Costco jumped 8.1 per cent. Walmart rose 6 per cent. Procter & Gamble gained 3.5 per cent.\nStocks in travel-related companies have been among the hardest-hit as the outbreak has led to cancelled flights and disrupted vacation plans. Cruise operators continued to pile up losses Monday. Royal Caribbean Cruises fell 2.5 per cent, Norwegian Cruise Line dropped eight\u00a0per cent and Carnival fell 4.7 per cent.\nTechnology and health-care stocks accounted for a big share of the gains. Apple climbed 5.9 per cent and Gilead Sciences rose 6.4 per cent. The biotechnology company has been testing one of its drugs as a potential treatment for the coronavirus.\nGiven that the main economic impact so far of the virus outbreak is on the supply side of economies rather than on the demand side, questions are being asked as to whether looser monetary policy will have any meaningful impact.\n\"For all the talk of lower rates the one thing a rate cut can't do is get people back to work and supply chains back running again,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.\nStimulus hopes nevertheless helped shore up markets in Asia earlier. The Nikkei 225 index closed 1 per cent higher, while the Shanghai Composite index rose 3.2 per cent. The benchmark for the smaller exchange, in Shenzhen, jumped 3.8 per cent, while South Korea's Kospi climbed 0.8 per cent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 0.6 per cent.\nChina has seen most of the 90,000 or so virus cases worldwide. In the United States, authorities have counted at least 80 cases of the virus, two fatal, and concern was driving some to wipe store shelves clean of bottled water, hand sanitizer and other necessities. Both deaths were men with existing health problems who were hospitalized in Washington state.\nOil prices have also slumped as traders price in the prospect of lower demand as a result of the virus outbreak. Last week, oil prices tanked by around 15 per cent. On Monday, benchmark U.S. crude was up $2.07 to $46.83 per barrel. Brent, the international standard, rose $2.28 to $51.95.\n"}, {"author": "Mike Crawley", "title": "How COVID-19 could hit the Doug Ford government's budget", "description": "Forecasting COVID-19 impact on Ontario's economic growth a challenge as budget looms on March 25", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-doug-ford-coronavirus-budget-economy-1.5491299", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5490900.1583764467!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ontario-premier-doug-ford-fireside-chat-communitech-kitchener.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 5:00 AM ET", "2020-03-10T15:42:29.365Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As COVID-19 sends\u00a0global stock markets and oil prices plunging,\u00a0the Doug Ford government is bracing for the effects on Ontario's economy and the impact on the provincial budget, to be delivered in just two weeks.\nThe spread of the new coronavirus\u00a0around the world has brought just 36\u00a0cases to Ontario so far, according to public health authorities, a far lower number than other more hard-hit jurisdictions.\nStill, the\u00a0premier is expressing worry about the potential economic fallout from COVID-19 as some countries restrict\u00a0movement of large parts of the population, travellers decide\u00a0against international trips, large gatherings such as conferences and sporting events are cancelled, and employees take precautionary sick days to avoid infection.\u00a0\n\"The area that I'm concerned is our economy with COVID-19,\" Ford said Monday in an unscripted comment\u00a0at an event in Kitchener.\n\"The worst thing to do is put a scare out there,\" Ford added. \"But we have to be cautious and we're all over this.\"\u00a0He did not offer details of his economic concerns and was not available to take questions from reporters after the event.\u00a0\n\"Clearly,\u00a0COVID-19 is having economic impacts in Ontario,\" Finance Minister Rod Phillips told reporters at the Legislature later Monday. \"We are working diligently to be aware of its impacts and respond to them as required.\"\u00a0\nPhillips is sticking with his timetable for delivering his first budget on March 25. With the novel\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0casting doubt on recent forecasts for economic growth, predicting government revenues for the coming fiscal year will be a challenge.\u00a0\n\"We're in a very dynamic environment,\" Phillips said. \"Obviously, we'll have to look to what the economic\u00a0impacts are.\u00a0We don't really know at this time exactly what that is going to be.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nA one percentage point drop in growth for Ontario's GDP knocks some $700 million out of the government's annual revenues.\u00a0\nOntario's economy grew by 1.7 per cent in 2019 and the average growth forecast for 2020 by private sector economists has been sitting at\u00a01.7 per cent. But those 2020 forecasts could be revised downward.\u00a0\n\"Ontario is in a strong position,\"\u00a0said Phillips, pointing to strong job growth over the past year.\u00a0\"One of the reasons that we've put in place the balanced, prudent plan we have is so that we could make adjustments if they were necessary,\" \u00a0\nHe said the government remains committed to balancing the budget in 2023.\u00a0\nThe novel coronavirus is \"likely to dampen economic activity in Canada including in Ontario, but at this stage we're not quite sure the degree\u00a0to which we'll be hit here,\" said Robert Hogue, senior economist with RBC, in an interview Monday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It really drives home the point that governments should have some wiggle room embedded into their budget,\" said Hogue.\u00a0\n\"It's always difficult to forecast with precision what the economy is going to be like and as well how much revenue the government can generate, Hogue said.\n\"But also there's always\u00a0the potential for some kind of unexpected hit to the economy like we are potentially witnessing right now with the coronavirus.\"\u00a0\nRBC's 2020 economic outlook for Ontario \u2014 issued in December before the new\u00a0coronavirus had spread beyond\u00a0China, \u2014\u00a0suggested \"the souring of the global trade environment\" would be the chief drag on the province's economy.\u00a0\nA year ago, Ford said in a speech: \"The risk of a carbon tax recession is very, very real.\"\u00a0\nThat didn't happen in 2019. But in 2020, the global economy may face\u00a0the\u00a0risk of a coronavirus recession, and Ontario could get swept along with it.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/u-s-federal-reserve-slashes-interest-rate-near-zero-amid-covid-19-volatility-1.5498875", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Lessons from the Great Crash of 1929 for investing in an ever-rising market: Don Pittis", "description": "Having escaped an October crash, can we finally talk about irrational markets?", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stocks-market-doom-1.5351368", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5351544.1573146824!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/brooklyn-daily-eagle-stock-crash-1929.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 11, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-11-11T09:00:00.843Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Phew. The dangerous\u00a0month is safely behind us, so it finally feels less risky to talk about stock market panics without being accused\u00a0of helping to precipitate another October crash.\nFor mysterious reasons October really is crash month, though in most years\u00a0markets do perfectly well during the month,\u00a0 and most analysis shows\u00a0that September is the worst overall month for stocks. But October's ominous\u00a0reputation comes well earned.\nThe bear market that stretched from 2007 to 2009 began in October, though the initial\u00a0one-day decline was moderate.\u00a0The Panic of 1907,\u00a0a three-week plunge in markets that fell by half, certainly began in October.\u00a0Indisputably, 1987's Black Monday, the largest one-day percentage market\u00a0drop and one that seemed to come out of the blue, was an October\u00a0phenomenon.\nHistorically, the Great Crash of 1929 remains the apocalyptic\u00a0touchstone of October market crashes not just for its suddenness and unexpectedness but because of what came after, namely\u00a0the crumbling of the financial system that led to the Great Depression.\nOf course getting October out of the way is no proof against sudden market plunges. A list of global market panics\u00a0shows sharp market declines can come in any month, especially when there is an external cause\u00a0that shocks investors into running for the exits.\nOne of the most disturbing parallels between now and the time of the\u00a0Great Crash is that it came in what seemed like a period of economic health. Unemployment had declined. The auto industry, a key driver of the North American economy, was still going strong.\n\"There was no reason for expecting disaster,\" wrote Canadian economist\u00a0John Kenneth Galbraith in his 1954 history of the time,\u00a0The Great Crash 1929. \"A depression, serious or otherwise, could not be foreseen when the market fell.\"\nIn his book, which I remember gobbling up in my youth, Galbraith was contradicting the conventional view that the stock market was reacting to a slowdown in the economy.\nThat's not to say that as the markets rose to dizzying heights there wasn't plenty of fear that they would eventually have to come down again. But greed had won out and\u00a0there was no special reason a crash should\u00a0happen on those particular days.\nIn a recently published extract titled What We Talk about When We Talk about Stock Market Crashes from his most recent book, Yale economist Robert Shiller, who has noted similarities between current markets and those of the 1920s, observes that the market conflagration did not have an obvious spark.\n\"Economists still puzzle over the stock market crash of Oct.\u00a028, 1929, a date on which no sudden important news occurred other than the crash itself,\" writes Shiller.\nOne interesting explanation proposed for the sudden crash was technology. Shiller himself has described the\u00a0Trans-Lux Movie Ticker, a newfangled method of projecting changing share prices\u00a0that brought awareness of rising\u00a0stocks to the masses.\nBut according to Joe Janes from the University of Washington, the real trigger for the crash was that during the initial day of declines on Oct.\u00a024, unprecedented trade volumes\u00a0due to the increased popularity of stocks meant the ticker could not keep up.\nJanes says it was well known the technology\u00a0was not up the task, but when markets were rising no one really cared.\u00a0\n\"When it started to fall, and the ticker fell behind, and then when it became clear that things were getting worse fast, it was the not knowing \u2014 and moreover not knowing what you didn't know \u2014 that helped to fuel the panic,\" says Janes in his podcast\u00a0Stock Market Ticker Tape, 1929.\nCertainly there are plenty of reasons technology could once again help destabilize the stock market. Already the proliferation of online discount trading has shown ordinary traders they have trouble exiting when markets fall suddenly.\u00a0\nAutomated trading that contributed to the Flash Crash of 2010 where markets fell 1,000 points in minutes and the market lost $1\u00a0trillion in value before bouncing back, could have a much worse effect if traders had been fearing a\u00a0wider crash. Certainly the growth of trading by artificial intelligence means people aren't really sure how the AIs will react in the next sharp market decline.\nAnother lesson from 1929 that may not have been learned is the growth of investment trusts, tradable collections of stocks that turned out not to be liquid when traders decided they wanted out. While modern exchange traded funds are not the same thing, the democratizing of share holding through ETFs that faced selling pressure on a market panic could compound market disruptions, as nervousness grows.\nOf course those are just structural reasons for a market decline. If traders decide they are flying too close to the sun, external shocks could initiate a tumble. For example, a\u00a0new and sudden outbreak of conflict in the Middle East, while good for Canadian oil producers, could destabilize markets.\nAn attack on demonstrators in Hong Kong could have an effect similar to the Tiananmen\u00a0Square crisis of 1989\u00a0that caused a sharp slide\u00a0in\u00a0Chinese GDP growth. With China's new global clout any shock to its economy would likely have a worldwide impact on markets.\nAs Edward Yardeni, chief economist and investment strategist at Yardeni Research,\u00a0has said,\u00a0\"Crashes usually happen when people are not expecting them.\"\nThe trouble is of course that one of the other lessons of 1929 is\u00a0that even after many wise people have\u00a0suggested\u00a0the market has risen too high, what Galbraith called\u00a0\"the mass escape into make-believe\" can continue to carry it much higher.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1703679555783", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Sophia Harris", "title": "Is the coronavirus ravaging your investment portfolio?

Many people's hard-earned investment portfolios have already taken\u00a0a\u00a0beating as stock markets plummeted this week over concerns of the virus's impact on the\u00a0economy.\u00a0\n\"This is nuts,\" said Jim Allen of Toronto, a 74-year-old retired IT consultant who relies on his investments for the majority of his income. Even so, he's decided not to worry about the spiralling stock market\n\"Keep your head in the sand and hope it'll go by,\" said Allen about his current coping strategy. \"I'm not going to panic and start selling things, because that's when you do take a loss.\"\nInvestment strategists would say Allen is smart not to panic.\n\"I don't think worrying helps one make sound, logical decisions,\" said financial planner\u00a0Rona Birenbaum.\u00a0\nBut is Allen making the right decision by holding onto his investments? Financial experts CBC News interviewed said that all depends on your immediate needs, your long-term plans and your ability to stomach volatile markets while the coronavirus continues to wreak havoc.\u00a0\nFor people who hope to sit out the current economic crisis until their investments recover, the question remains: How long can you wait?\nBirenbaum said that during the 2008 financial crisis, investors who sat on the sidelines waited about four\u00a0years to recoup their losses. But she said they fared much better than people who panicked and sold their stocks at low prices during the downturn.\n\"The people that sold, they've probably still not recovered, quite frankly,\" said Birenbaum, of\u00a0the Toronto firm\u00a0Caring for Clients.\nDoug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, agrees that now isn't the time to start dumping stocks \u2014\u00a0as long as you don't immediately need the cash.\n\"It really doesn't make sense at this point to be an aggressive seller\u00a0if you have a longer-term time frame.\"\nPorter notes the current market dive was\u00a0triggered\u00a0by an intense Wednesday\u00a0that saw the World Health Organization declare the coronvirus a pandemic,\u00a0the NBA\u00a0suspend\u00a0its\u00a0season, and U.S. President Donald Trump announce\u00a0a confusing European travel ban\u00a0that failed\u00a0to calm the concerns of investors, who were hoping to hear about a plan to steady the economy.\u00a0\n\"That's a lot for any investor to absorb in a 24-hour period,\" he said. More cancellations followed Thursday, including the NHL and the Juno Awards.\nDespite the coronavirus's continued spread, Porter believes its toll on the economy will be short-lived. He predicts the recovery will reflect the shape of a V\u00a0or a U, meaning the\u00a0economy will stabilize by the end of the year.\n\"Hopefully, a lot of the bad news is now out there and absorbed,\" he said. \"We continue to believe that when the storm passes, things will revert to some kind of normality relatively quickly.\"\nBirenbaum agrees that the economy will eventually recover and estimates it could take one to two years.\u00a0\nBut\u00a0in the meantime\u00a0she suggests the coronavirus fallout could send markets down another 20 to 25 per cent.\n\"Remember, this virus is just getting wound up here in North America,\" she said.\u00a0\"There's very little travel, nobody's going to restaurants, universities are being shut down\u00a0\u2014 I mean, the whole economic engine has just gone from sixth gear into first gear.\"\nFor those who\u00a0feel they can't stomach the wild ride and want to sell some stocks, Birenbaum suggests they consider acting\u00a0now rather than when the market takes what she expects will be another hit.\u00a0\n\"You don't want to be making your situation worse than it is.\"\nShe also suggests that investors consider re-balancing their portfolios to focus on strong companies with healthy balance sheets that can weather the current coronavirus storm.\n\"You want to make sure that your portfolio is comprised of the strongest, most dominant companies,\" she said. \"Smaller and weaker companies will either potentially go bankrupt, be bought out at a discount by the stronger players\u00a0or simply limp along for a number of years.\"\nWhile nobody relishes profiting from a pandemic, investors who have cash or can liquidate some fixed-income investments may see this moment as an\u00a0opportunity.\nFinancial expert Robb Engen warns potential investors to first evaluate how long they're willing to wait for a financial recovery before they start pouring cash into the markets.\u00a0\n\"Young investors in their accumulation years, they can certainly view these types of corrections as a real buying opportunity,\" said Engen, a financial writer and fee-only investment adviser based in Lethbridge, Alberta.\nBut he said the same strategy may not work for an older investor\u00a0\u2014 someone who can't afford to wait for the anticipated recovery.\n\"What if things don't work out the way I planned? Now we'll have to be selling stocks at a loss just to fund my retirement.\"\nThat's exactly what retired\u00a0investor\u00a0Allen plans to avoid.

Other equally credible voices are suggesting we have only seen the beginning of a bear market, triggered by the sudden realization that the world's corporations are seriously overborrowed.\nMeanwhile, just like in the 2008 market crisis, critics from all sides are demanding hasty\u00a0action from governments and central banks, asking them to wave a magic wand\u00a0to solve private-sector symptoms that have been repeatedly diagnosed \u2014 and repeatedly ignored.\nBut among that diversity of voices, a common thread seems to be emerging: A period of crisis may actually be a time for change.\nWhile Calgary-based stock analyst Martin Pelletier\u00a0wants Canadian taxpayers to help out the country's oil-producing regions during a period\u00a0of incredible volatility, speaking on CBC's\u00a0The Current,\u00a0he also suggested government assistance\u00a0could\u00a0ultimately be an opportunity to stimulate\u00a0diversification.\n\"This is the time\u00a0that Ottawa needs to step in with some fiscal stimulus for the western provinces, and then, you know, maybe use that stimulus to not only to try to ... slow down the impact of this oil crisis, but also, you know,\u00a0help diversify and maximize your dollars that you're spending,\" he said.\nIf stimulus is needed, certainly Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u00a0will be thinking about lessons learned from the last big market meltdown, caused by reckless investments by giant banks in a bubble of U.S. subprime mortgages and the insurance policies that backed them.\nSince the Great Recession, an enormous taxpayer bailout and a sharp cut in interest rates have sent stock markets soaring, with\u00a0companies borrowing money in the\u00a0bond market\u00a0to buy their own shares, creating a new bubble that has largely\u00a0benefited the better off.\nCritics have suggested such a bubble might have\u00a0been prevented\u00a0if the handouts instead had been introduced by way of consumers, who would have circulated the cash\u00a0in the economy from the bottom.\nFor those who foresee\u00a0a long bear market rather than a quick rebound, it is the end of that process of bidding up stocks they\u00a0fear, where \"elevated asset\u00a0prices have begun to fall back to where fundamentals suggest they should trade,\" as\u00a0Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to financial giant Allianz\u00a0suggested this week.\u00a0\nThe energy sector\u00a0is also now a victim of past cheap borrowing.\nA fall in demand for oil, combined with an oversupply, means lenders are suddenly less willing to risk their money, especially on smaller U.S.\u00a0shale producers who need it to keep drilling and pumping.\nThis week's decision by Saudi Arabia to open its\u00a0taps, rather than restrict supply, feels like a special\u00a0case.\u00a0But it may actually be part of a pattern.\nNow, especially with Saudi Aramco\u00a0trading as a\u00a0public company, the Saudis may want to keep the oil flowing until it damages the competition enough to allow it to reap the rewards of a\u00a0rebound in prices.\nIf that is so, it\u00a0is pretty clear that oil will bounce back, just as it did after the 2014 oil price crash. But if\u00a0global demand for oil begins to decline over the long term, as some predict, like a bouncing ball, each rebound will not be as high.\nThe federal government has\u00a0announced a $1-billion spending plan for the coronavirus\u00a0crisis, one that will include income support for workers and businesses affected by\u00a0COVID-19.\nMany market observers, including Andrey Pavlov, a risk-management expert at Simon Fraser University's Beedie School of Business, suggest the best way to help an already-battered Alberta\u00a0economy\u00a0is to invest more in getting oilsands crude to world markets, allowing it to\u00a0go head to head with Saudi Arabia.\nOthers, including Dan Woynillowicz, deputy director of\u00a0Clean Energy Canada, say this is an opportunity to\u00a0stimulate the economies of\u00a0Alberta and Saskatchewan by encouraging change at the same time.\u00a0\nIt may be a message many in the oil and gas industry don't want to hear\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but it's not a new one.\nWoynillowicz\u00a0points to a blue chip panel set up\u00a0a decade ago by Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach, which ultimately declared that province's reliance\u00a0on energy\u00a0was an accident waiting to happen\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something shown to be true in 2014 and again today.\nRather than just a cyclical swing, there is increasing evidence that climate change means there will be a structural decline in the demand for fossil fuels.\n\"This requires a fundamental reimagining of Alberta's economy,\" said\u00a0Woynillowicz.\nAnd while there will no doubt be another bounce in crude prices for companies that survive the Saudi-led price war, any injection of\u00a0taxpayer cash still might be most usefully\u00a0directed toward a low-carbon\u00a0energy transition.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "TSX closes at record high as oil rally continues", "description": "Strength of banks and oil companies driving recent gains", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tsx-markets-friday-1.5291110", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4604408.1522851005!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tsx-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 20, 2019 10:42 AM ET", "2019-09-20T20:34:36.822Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark stock index closed at an all-time high of 16,899 on Friday as strong oil prices buoyed the market.\nThe S&P/TSX Composite Index pushed as high as 16,947 on Friday, within striking distance of 17,000 points.\nWhile it hasn't made as many of the large jumps\u00a0that other stock indexes have made in recent months, Canada's benchmark stock index has quietly put together a solid rally by stacking small gains on top of each other.

By noon, shares had settled to $730.31, about 11.5 per cent higher than Tuesday's close of $655.46.\nThe jump came after Shopify, which keeps its books in U.S. dollars, reporting that its sales totalled nearly $505.2 million US for the three-month period that ended Dec. 31, up from about $343.9 million a year earlier.\nShopify executives said on a call with analysts that the revenue lift was courtesy of holiday sales, new currency and payment features and a slew of new merchants using its software, including entertainment giant Cirque du Soleil, apparel retailer Mark's, rapper Travis Scott and footwear brand Toms.\nIt came as the company has been busy getting ready to go head-to-head with Amazon.com Inc. with a network of fulfillment centres Shopify is building in the U.S. to help merchants lower shipping costs and ensure quick deliveries.\nShopify chief financial officer Amy Shapero said Wednesday that the company has set aside \"small portion\" of a $1 billion pool of cash allocated for the network for a research and development centre it will open in Ottawa.\nThe centre will allow employees to trial new warehousing, robotics and fulfilment technology, but will only be staffed by a \"minimal number of employees,\" a Shopify spokesperson told The Canadian Press later.\nDespite only rolling out the network in the U.S., the company said that it will be using the new centre for fulfilling a \"limited\" number of orders in Canada later this summer.\n\"We don't just want to make plans from the periphery,\" said Harley Finkelstein, Shopify's chief operating officer.\n\"We actually want to get into it and really figure out what we need to do, and so the best way for us to do that, as Shopify's always has always done is get our hands dirty and get into the trenches.\"\nTo help with such research and development, Shopify acquired 6 River Systems Inc., a Massachusetts-based company that specializes in warehouse automation powered by robots and artificial intelligence.\n\"Even though we are happy with our initial progress, it's important to remember that we are in the early stages of a five-year plan for the Shopify Fulfillment Network. Our merchants need us to get this right and that will take time,\" Finkelstein said.\nAside from the centre, Shopify is planning to hire 1,000 people in Vancouver and open its first permanent office there. It has also announced that it will lease space at the Well complex under construction in at Front Street and Spadina Avenue in Toronto.\nBoth are signs of the immense growth that Shopify \u2014 long considered Canada's tech darling \u2014 has undergone in recent years. The company has racked up more than one million merchants using its offering.\nIn 2019, the number of merchants on the Shopify platform achieving over $1 million in gross merchandise value \u2014 a term used to measure sales \u2014 grew by 44 per cent and the number of consumers buying from its merchants shot up by 37 per cent to hit nearly 300 million.\nIn its last quarter, the company reported a profit of $771,000, compared with a loss of $1.5 million. That amounts to a penny per share compared with a loss of a penny for the last three months of 2018.\nShopify also said its adjusted net income for the quarter amounted to $50.0 million or 43 cents per share, compared with adjusted net income of $29.4 million or 27 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2018.\nAnalysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of 24 cents per share, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nShopify now expects a first-quarter revenue between $440 million and $446 million and full-year revenue in a range of $2.13 billion to $2.16 billion.\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "How coronavirus fears could impact your investment portfolio", "description": "Finance columnist Mark Ting expects more short term volatility with further drops in the Chinese stock markets", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-stocks-mark-ting-1.5448645", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5445589.1580381553!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-health-usa.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Feb 02, 2020 5:00 AM PT", "2020-02-02T13:00:00.111Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Global stock markets are experiencing an uptick in volatility as investors speculate on whether\u00a0the coronavirus\u00a0outbreak will have long-term effects on the global economy.\u00a0\nSo far, the North American markets are holding up well considering all the negative headlines, as both the TSX and S&P 500 remain positive for the year.\nThere were a couple days when we saw triple digit drops, but the selling pressure was short-lived. The indexes recovered over the next few days thanks to several high-profile companies exceeding their earning expectations.\nThe Chinese markets aren't faring nearly as well with China's stock market off by nearly 10 per cent\u00a0since the virus took off.\nI'm often asked about the economic effects of the coronavirus and how it might compare to past outbreaks such as SARS.\nIt took six months before SARS was fully contained and during that time 8,000 people were infected in 29 countries, killing\u00a0 774 people. From an economic standpoint the outbreak significantly impacted Asian economies, especially tourism, air travel, retail, real estate and food and\u00a0drink industries.\nSurprisingly the markets performed well following the SARS outbreak.\u00a0The S&P 500 was up 20 per cent in the 12 months following SARS, and other outbreaks have experienced similar results. For example, the S&P 500 was up 18 per cent one year\u00a0after the avian flu epidemic and 38 per cent after the\u00a0swine flu epidemic.\u00a0\nThat said, I don't believe there is a correlation between an epidemic and higher stock valuations.\u00a0 I think it was lucky timing more than anything else. As an example, SARS occurred in 2003 soon after the tech bubble burst which caused the S&P 500 to drop by 49 per cent, so markets were extremely oversold and due for a bounce.\u00a0\nIn looking at the historical epidemics \u2014 including Ebola, Zika, H5N1, H1N1, HIV, the pneumonic plague and\u00a0MERS \u2014 on average the S&P 500 was up 8.5 per cent in the six-months following an outbreak.\u00a0\nHopefully history repeats itself and a year from now we can say that the coronavirus' economic effect on the North American's stock markets was short-lived.\u00a0\u00a0\nOver the short term, I expect more volatility with further drops in the Chinese stock markets, lower oil prices and a lower Canadian dollar as the epidemic will negatively impact global economic growth and commodity prices.\nMoney will continue to flow into traditional \"safe-haven\" investments like gold, bonds, the U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen.\u00a0\nOnce the virus is contained and life goes back to \"normal,\" financial markets have typically stabilized and areas of the market that might have been oversold due to\u00a0panic selling\u00a0recover.\nWith every crisis there are also opportunities. For those needing to apply for, or renew, a mortgage we are seeing mortgage rates drop as money floods to the safety of the bond market.\u00a0\nAs the coronavirus is bound to slow down global growth,\u00a0the Bank of Canada might have to cut the benchmark\u00a0interest\u00a0rate to stimulate our economy. This will benefit those with variable rate mortgages.\nIf you have a long-term horizon and a well diversified portfolio,\u00a0which should include some \"safe-haven\" assets to dampen your portfolio's overall volatility, you should be fine over the long run.\u00a0\nRather than stressing over things that are completely out of your control, you would be better served focusing on areas that are in your control, such as updating your will, reducing debt, implementing tax-saving strategies or\u00a0earning extra money.

Stock markets are panicked. A global recession is possible.\nIt is too early to know where this is headed, but it does not feel great.\n\"Obviously, people are quite anxious, looking at the changes in the stock market today,\" Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u00a0said\u00a0Monday afternoon, stating the obvious in his usual unexcitable manner. \"We're seeing a good deal of anxiety because of the issues that we're seeing in terms of the potential economic impacts of COVID-19.\"\nShortly afterward, Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau appeared before the cameras to offer his condolences to the family of the first Canadian to die from the virus, and also to \"reassure Canadians\" that this country's \"top medical experts\" and \"top scientists\" are on the job and everything is being done to align with the World Health Organization's guidelines.\nIt's a clich\u00e9 now to say that Justin Trudeau, his agenda or his government are being \"tested.\" There have been any number of great \"tests\" over the last five years. But the test it faces now might be new \u2014 a test of whether he can soothe Canadians' anxiety when they have abundant reasons to be anxious and the threats are not easily contained.\nThe opposition parties are eager to establish that the Trudeau government might share some kind of blame for whatever is about to happen.\nIn question period, the Conservatives were determined to argue that the Trudeau government had put Canada in a bad spot long before COVID-19 began to spread \u2014 that \"six years of eroding Canada's economic foundation\" had left this country \"weak and vulnerable.\" They also poked and prodded the government's outbreak response\u00a0\u2014 vaguely suggesting that Canada's borders should be tighter or that coordination with the provinces should be smoother.\nFor their part, the NDP\u00a0alleged that provincial health care systems have suffered from \"cuts\" in federal funding\u00a0\u2014 federal transfers have increased in each of the last four years, but New Democrats argue\u00a0the rate of the increase should have been higher.\nThe Liberals have counter-arguments to such charges, but Monday's questions and critiques underline the political risks of this moment.\nOn the federal budget, in particular, the Liberals still have room to spend, at least technically. According to the parliamentary budget officer, the Trudeau government could increase the current annual deficit by another $41 billion before federal finances would be fiscally unsustainable.\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Morneau\u00a0was adamant that the federal government is in a \"strong\" fiscal position.\nBut a deficit might become a real political liability long before it hits the point where it's fiscally unsustainable.\nThe most recent point of comparison for the current moment could end up being the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. But\u00a0as difficult as the global banking crisis was, a global health emergency might be something else entirely.\nOne important difference is already apparent.\u00a0In 2008, the American government's response managed to limit the damage. In 2020, the American government's response seems to be making the situation worse. For at least as long as Donald Trump is president, the Trudeau government cannot take for granted that the United States will be a predictable or reliable actor, particularly at times of global unrest.\nStephen Harper famously fumbled his government's initial response to the Great Recession\u00a0\u2014 and nearly lost his government in the process.\nGiven a month to recalibrate, Harper's Conservatives came back with \"Canada's Economic Action Plan\"\u00a0\u2014 a plan to spend billions of dollars building and doing things, and then to spend millions advertising what was being built and done.\nThe exact degree to which the fiscal stimulus worked to enhance the Canadian economy can be debated.\u00a0But the success of the marketing effort is unquestionable\u00a0\u2014 Canadians were assured there was a plan and\u00a0that action was being taken. Harper successfully held himself up as a source of stability in the election that followed, in\u00a0contrast\u00a0with the supposed instability of an opposition coalition.\nMillions in ad spending wouldn't have worked in the absence of\u00a0an articulated plan, and if the economy hadn't seemed to recover well. But the lesson still seems to be\u00a0that crisis leadership is nearly as much about communication as it is about policy and governance.\nFor Trudeau\u00a0in this moment, there is the added challenge of opposition claims that his leadership is \"weak.\" The Liberals also have vowed to not engage in the sort of self-promotion that the Harper government indulged in.\nBut Morneau's appearance on Monday seemed designed to offer reassurance.\nThe finance minister assured Canadians that they had a strong health system and a strong balance sheet. He said the government's efforts would be focused on supporting the health care system and those businesses and individuals affected. New measures, he said, would be announced later this week.\nAsked about the possibility of a recession or stimulus spending, Morneau hedged.\n\"What we do will be very much about the facts,\" he said. \"We're going to look at the facts of the situation to determine the right response.\"\nIt's usually a good idea to avoid getting ahead of yourself \u2014 particularly when you're\u00a0responsible for managing a G7 economy.\nBut the facts don't seem likely to become comforting anytime soon.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "The market battle for climate supremacy heats up: Don Pittis", "description": "While politicians may choose to ignore climate science, money managers cannot", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/climate-stocks-investment-1.5348282", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5348372.1572972652!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-energy.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 06, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-11-06T16:01:41.982Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord moved to its next step just after a Canadian election fought on green issues,\u00a0you might think the battle over how or whether to address climate change was all politics.\nBut this week there have been renewed reminders that\u00a0the real battle over decarbonizing the atmosphere may be\u00a0happening in the world of money.\nInvestors, led by giant money management funds that invest for the long term, must make crucial decisions about the future of energy. And while inevitably politics plays a role in what they decide, there is only one important issue.\nThe essential concern for those betting their own and their clients'\u00a0money is whether the investment will make more money in the long run. In other words, will\u00a0the oil and gas industry continue to be a cash cow\u00a0or,\u00a0as some have suggested, is the sector in its sunset years?\nClearly Canadian bank RBC\u00a0thinks oil still has a big financial future. The bank is one of the underwriters for the launch of Saudi Arabia's giant government oil corporation Saudi Aramco, which is finally going ahead with its sale of shares onto world stock markets.\nOther investors have been more reluctant, as Encana relocates to the United States saying it is having trouble raising funds. But that is not just a Canadian complaint. U.S. shale drillers have reported\u00a0similar shortages of money.\nNow a new report from the business news service Bloomberg says some big funds have decided they can make money by betting that companies doing nothing to fight climate change\u00a0are going to get weaker.\nCalled short selling, the widely used investment technique involves renting the stocks from another investor who's planning to hold for the long term and then selling the shares in the hope of buying them back at a lower price before the rental contract is up, and profiting from the difference.\n\"In an unusual move, they're not only buying stakes in the companies favoured by green investors, but also shorting firms that are failing to make the shift to sustainability,\" says the Bloomberg report.\nApparently the technique is spreading, as green fund managers have adopted\u00a0the \"long-short\" strategy traditionally used by hedge funds\u00a0to select their investment mix. The money-making idea is to go long, in other words buy and hold for the longer term, on companies that have figured\u00a0out ways to adapt to the market rigours of a changing climate and go short on those companies that have not yet got on board.\nFollowing data showing that green energy firms have outperformed energy firms of all kinds, now there are reports that regular\u00a0hedge funds are planning to adopt the strategy.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne of those investment funds decidedly going long on climate change investment is the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the body that invests the billions of dollars that most Canadians pay into the fund in the expectation the money will still be there when they retire.\nThis week the fund announced it was investing\u00a0$2.63 billion to buy Canada's biggest producer of wind power, San Francisco-based Pattern Energy. The CPPIB's\u00a0investment strategy\u00a0is to scoop up companies it believes are\u00a0undervalued that it expects to grow and prosper over the long run.\nIn what seems like a sudden flurry of activity, the battle is definitely not one-sided. As the New York Times reported\u00a0on Sunday, countries around the world including\u00a0Brazil, Canada, Norway and Guyana\u00a0are looking to expand production, something the\u00a0paper claims will drive down prices and make people want to burn more oil and gas.\nOf course low prices are not good for investors. The North Dakota\u00a0leak in the Keystone pipeline\u00a0pushed the gap between Alberta and U.S. crude prices to about $22 US a barrel, a blow to Canadian producers.\nDeciding where to invest is not just a choice between green energy and fossil fuels, but a choice about which fossil fuel companies will continue to prosper while others decline.\nSome analysts have suggested that\u00a0Saudi Aramco's vast reserves of light sweet crude will still be profitable even as more expensive sources of oil get squeezed out of the market. Of course that assumes governments and consumers will ultimately take climate change seriously enough to reduce the total demand for\u00a0oil and gas. Many are sceptical people will be willing to make the necessary sacrifices.\nCertainly boomers are attached to their gas-guzzling cars, and it is unlikely they will stop buying gasoline at least until those cars begin to need replacement. In recent decades oil-producing giants have used their economic clout to get people like\u00a0Trump on side.\u00a0But two other tidbits of news this\u00a0week show it's possible the longer-term trend may favour the short sellers\u00a0and the CPPIB.\nAutomaker\u00a0Volkswagen\u00a0announced it is launching a campaign to build hundreds of thousands of electric cars with the aim of using mass production and economies of scale to bring the price of a battery electric car below $30,000\u00a0Cdn. It is hard to imagine Toyota is not planning to compete with its global rival on price when it bring out its line of all-electrics, which will soon make replacing\u00a0a gas-burner with another fossil fuel vehicle\u00a0a losing proposition.\nThe other instructive story was an Economist magazine report on the importance of demographics in political change. Rather than politics changing people's views, the magazine said, it is the changing views of a new generation that\u00a0matter. For example, fear of communism faded only because an older red-under-the-bed\u00a0generation\u00a0died off.\u00a0\n\"Demographic shifts accounted for a bigger share of overall movement in public opinion than changes in beliefs within cohorts,\" reported the magazine.\nNo doubt wise long-term investors are beginning to take into account that in 20 years or so, it won't be Donald Trump's generation in charge, but Greta Thunberg's.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Chris Hall: Bill Morneau's keeping his pandemic focus firmly on the near-term", "description": "He knows Canadians want to be told when to expect a return to 'normal' \u2014 but he's got bigger problems", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chris-hall-bill-morneau-s-keeping-his-pandemic-focus-firmly-on-the-near-term-1.5536357", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5503854.1584659454!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/coronavirus-bill-morneau.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 18, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-04-18T08:00:51.745Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Canada's finance minister says there was a point early in the progress of the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic when he realized\u00a0this crisis was going to be different \u2014 and far more trying than\u00a0most people were expecting.\nAt that point, said\u00a0Bill Morneau,\u00a0Italy had just imposed a national quarantine. The stock market had tumbled. It was clear Canada wouldn't be immune.\nIn an interview with CBC Radio's The House airing today,\u00a0Morneau recalled the famous metaphor of the frog placed in a pot of water \u2014 heat the water slowly enough and the frog stays\u00a0put until it boils\u00a0to death.\n\"This is one of those moments when you're like the proverbial frog in the pot and it's getting hotter and hotter and hotter, Luckily, I think we jumped out before it got to boiling,\" he said. \"But there were a few days when I wasn't so sure.\"\nIn the past month,\u00a0Morneau's department has rolled out emergency benefits for people who have lost their jobs due to the continuing economic shutdown, interest-free loans for small businesses and a 75 per cent wage subsidy program meant to encourage employers to keep people on the payroll.\nThe program design and delivery hasn't been perfect. Those wage subsidies have yet to be delivered, and the government's been forced to adjust eligibility for the other measures to ensure people who need help can get it.\n\"We tried to be aggressive in getting measures out to support people and recognize that perfect was going to be the enemy of the good. We're actually ahead of most people in the implementation of those measures ... in terms of getting money into people's pockets,\" Morneau said in an interview airing today.\n\"Now we're trying to make sure for those people\u00a0who \u2014 not by design but because we moved fast \u2014 aren't properly supported,\u00a0that we're coming out to support them, too.\"\nIt's been an intense challenge, he said \u2014 but that's not the point.\n\"We need\u00a0to remember there are a whole host of families out there who are dealing with someone in the family who's died. There are people in [their]\u00a080s who you and I know who are terrified,\" he said.\n\"So intense as it is for me, it's worse for a lot of people.\"\nThe numbers are staggering, especially when they offer only the most rudimentary snapshot of what Canadians are really going through.\nA million jobs lost in March alone. More than 31,400 confirmed and presumptive cases as of Friday \u2014\u00a0and 1,250 deaths.\nWorse still, many\u00a0of those dying are older Canadians who were living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Those deaths could have been prevented, said Margaret Gillis, president of the International Longevity Centre Canada, which advocates for the human rights of older people.\n\"It wasn't like we were without warning,\" she said in a separate interview on The House. \"There have been issues with long-term care in our country for many years.\"\nThe good news is that the rate of infection appears to be slowing, at least in some parts of the country. That's led\u00a0to calls for\u00a0governments to begin easing some of the restrictions now in place that have slowed the economy to a standstill.\nMorneau said he\u00a0isn't even considering that yet.\nThe finance minister used the word \"crisis\" six times in the interview \u2014 underscoring his pre-occupation with the short-term challenges of assisting people who are struggling financially because of the pandemic.\nWhich explains why Morneau is reluctant to say how long he thinks these programs will need to continue, and why he's unwilling to join the governor of the Bank of Canada, Stephen Poloz, in predicting\u00a0when the economy will rebound.\nPoloz told the Commons finance committee on Thursday that in a best-case scenario, it would take the economy roughly\u00a0a year to regain what it lost. Even then, the recovery is expected to be uneven as resource-intensive sectors await a rebound in other parts of the world.\n\"We are obviously hopeful that the impacts of the crisis are temporary,\" Morneau said. \"What I don't know, what no one can know, is exactly how long that will be.\"\nCaution. Prudence. These are things every finance minister wants to be known for.\u00a0Morneau's not disagreeing with Poloz. He's not agreeing with him either.\n\"Right now, what I'm doing is making sure we don't tell people things we can't know well enough to be sure,\" he said. \"So I don't have enough information at this stage to inform people what exactly the economy will look like in six months or in 12 months.\"\nFor now, Morneau\u00a0said, he'll continue to look at ways to support jobs and carry on refining\u00a0those income support programs for those who can't work. He'll continue \u2014 as he did Friday for the energy and cultural industries \u2014 to offer assistance to sectors of the economy that have been disproportionately harmed by the downturn.\nAnd Morneau and the government are giving every impression\u00a0they're going to maintain\u00a0that focus for many weeks \u2014\u00a0if not months \u2014\u00a0into the future.\nAlso on this week's show:\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "CPP adds $17B to assets now worth more than $409B despite pandemic", "description": "Canada Pension Plan manager says national retirement fund remains secure", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cppib-annual-earnings-1.5584730", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5521335.1585945019!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cppib-canada-pension-20200214.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 26, 2020 10:12 AM ET", "2020-05-28T18:15:56.401Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Canada Pension Plan\u00a0earned a return of 3.1 per cent after expenses during the financial year ended March 31, the board that manages the fund's money reported Tuesday.\nNet assets for Canada's national pension plan\u00a0totalled $409.6 billion as of the end of March, up from $392 billion at the end of the previous financial year.\nThe $17.6-billion year-over-year increase included $12.1 billion in net income from its investments.

The fund's long-term returns continue to help ensure the security of Canadians' retirement benefits.\"\nThat annual return of $12 billion\u00a0implies the fund lost about $16 billion during the pandemic, since at the end of December CPPIB\u00a0reported nearly $28 billion worth of investment gains in the first nine months of the fiscal year.\nA three per cent annual return may not sound impressive, but Michel Leduc, a senior investment executive with the fund, said in an interview that the fund's financial performance in the middle of a serious economic crisis is a testament to its strategy.\nThe CPP measures its own performance against a series of market-based benchmarks, the main one being the Reference Portfolio. That reference portfolio declined by 3.1 per cent in the past year, the same amount that CPP increased by.\nLeduc noted that\u00a0\u00a0the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 23 per cent in the first three months of this year, its worst quarterly performance in its 135-year history.\nIf the CPP were just to have matched the stock market, \"the fund would be would be $23 billion smaller today,\" he said. \"You've got to look at in the context of going through an economic shock which we know we're going to go through from time to time\u2026. To preserve $23 billion \u2026 I would say to Canadians that their fund is quite resilient and the active management put the fund in that safe harbour.\"\nThe Chief Actuary of Canada audits the CPP every three years to assess its ability to cover its obligations. At the last review in December 2018, the chief actuary deemed the CPP was on track to meet its obligations for the next 75 years at least, assuming the fund can earn a return of\u00a03.95 per cent above inflation.\nThe CPPIB has achieved a real return of eight per cent, on average, over the past 10 years, and 6.1 per cent over the past five.\nLeduc said the current downturn could lead to some attractive buying opportunities for CPP, but that doesn't mean the fund is running off on a buying spree without making sure that any investments fit the long-term objectives.\n\"We're one of the few institutional investors around the world that can pretty much acquire anything,\" he said.\u00a0\"We will look at opportunities, very carefully, but it's not the Wild West \u2026 we're not going out and buying everything.\"\nWhile on track in terms of performance, the CPP has faced some criticism for the amount of money it spends on costs\u00a0as it has grown and expanded over the years.\nWhile its total value has quadrupled from $96 billion to $409 billion since 2006, that growth has come with added costs, as CPPIB now employs\u00a01,824 employees around the world\u00a0\u2014 11 times more than the 164 it did back then. It only had one office then; today it has nine, including two in the U.S., two in Europe, two in Asia, one in Brazil and one in Australia.\nThat growth has come at a cost: CPPIB incurred more than $1.2 billion in expenses last year. That's about 30 cents out of every $100 invested, a slightly lower ratio than the previous year's level of 32 cents.\nAll told, CPP racked up\u00a0$3.4 billion in expenses, management fees and transaction costs last year. That's up from $3.2 billion the year before.\nCPP said it is \"committed to maintaining cost discipline as we continue to build a globally competitive platform that will enhance our ability to invest over the long term.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Shares in drug company Gilead rise Friday on hopeful signs remdesivir helps with COVID-19", "description": "Patients using the drug in a clinical trial showed rapid recovery in fever and respiratory symptoms.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gilead-coronavirus-remdesivir-1.5535832", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5535846.1588197103!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/remdesivir-gilead.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 17, 2020 10:56 AM ET", "2020-04-17T14:56:27.838Z"], "source": null, "content": "Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc rose 10 per cent\u00a0in early trading on Friday after a report that patients with COVID-19 treated with the company's experimental drug, remdesivir, in a clinical trial showed rapid recovery in fever and respiratory symptoms.\nThere are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for the coronavirus, which has infected 2.14 million globally, according to a Reuters tally, and remdesivir is one of the treatments that has captured investor's attention.\nBut analysts and the company urged caution on drawing conclusions from the report by medical news website Stat that also helped buoy the broader markets.\nGilead said the totality of the data from the trial needed to be analyzed, and expects to report results from a study in severe COVID-19 patients at the end of the month, and data from other trials in May.\nThe report said the University of Chicago Medicine Hospital was seeing rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms in patients with severe COVID-19 in a trial of the drug it was participating.\n\"While the article paints a pretty picture, we think the ensuing exuberance shows a lack of critical analysis,\" said Baird analyst Brian Skorney.\nSkorney added investors looking for a definitive conclusion when the severe study reads out will likely be disappointed as the study offers no control, \"just five days of remdesivir vs. 10 days of remdesivir.\"\nStock markets were broadly higher\u00a0on Friday, boosted by President Donald Trump's new guidelines to reopen the economy and Boeing's plans to resume production.\n\"There will no doubt be cautionary announcements by various scientific bodies about the validity of a partial set of results from a tiny trial,\" said Jeffrey Halley, a markets analyst at OANDA.\n\"Markets, though, will likely do their very best to ignore those, preferring to concentrate on ... a potential treatment for COVID-19 symptoms.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Markets up as retailers rise with holiday shopping", "description": "Amazon, other retailers had last-minute surge in online holiday shopping", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/markets-up-boxing-day-1.5408772", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5408781.1577380652!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-financial-markets.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 26, 2019 12:29 PM ET", "2019-12-26T22:04:05.601Z"], "source": null, "content": "Retailers and technology companies drove modest gains for stocks on Wall Street Thursday, extending the market's record-setting run.\nTechnology stocks accounted for a big slice of the gains, which helped to briefly push the Nasdaq composite above the 9,000 mark for the first time.\nFinancial stocks rose along with bond yields, while Amazon and other retailers climbed after data showed a last-minute surge in online shopping helped holiday sales.\nEnergy stocks rose as crude oil prices headed higher.

For 10 years in this apartment, he's tended to dozens of vines that have climbed up walls and now drape overhead. With his pending eviction, he said\u00a0he's been thinking about how to disentangle them for the move.\nBut first, Hatfield has to find a new place to live, and he, like many of his neighbours, is struggling to find something he can afford. He currently pays $550 per month, all-in. The average rent for a bachelor apartment in Halifax is $812.\nEvery tenant at 23 Crystal Dr. is being evicted this spring so the property owners can renovate the building and raise the rent. The owners have told tenants they want to keep the building \"affordable,\" and tenants can reapply after renovations.\nBut the proposed new rent, $875 per month, is too high for many people currently living there.\nIn a notice dated Jan. 30, 2020, the owners told tenants they would have to move out by the end of April for \"extensive demolition, repairs and renovations.\"\nIt's signed by Central East Developments,\u00a0a company co-owned by Spencer Meens and Adam Barrett, according to the Nova Scotia Registry of Joint Stocks. They did not respond to interview requests from CBC\u00a0News.\n\"It's what has been, I guess nicknamed, or phrased as 'renovictions,'\" said\u00a0Hatfield.\nIt's a scenario the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) described in its latest report on the Halifax rental market. It said\u00a0a record-low vacancy rate, coupled with record-high new development, is driving rents up and making housing less affordable.\nIn January, CMHC reported rental vacancy had dropped to one per cent,\u00a0which is\u00a0the fifth annual drop in as many years,\u00a0and the lowest number since it started reporting rental vacancy data in Halifax in 1990.\nMore than 4,000 new rental units have entered the rental market since 2017, but \"new apartment supply is not coming onto the rental market fast enough to offset increased demand,\" the report said. CMHC attributes growing demand to high rates of immigration and interprovincial migration.\nThe new construction has created what CMHC called a \"very high\" proportion of newer units on the Halifax market, compared to other Canadian cities.\n\"This has increased the quality of rental stock, incentivized older buildings to upgrade in order to compete and affected affordability, because rents have increased faster than disposable income,\" the report said.\nThe one per cent vacancy rate is top of mind for tenants in the building.\n\"That's really, really, really daunting when you're looking for a place,\" Hatfield said.\nProspective rentals have either been \"too gross\" or too expensive, so Hatfield is trying to find a roommate. But, he said\u00a0he worries about splitting living expenses.\n\"You're depending on other people to pay their bills, and you can't always do that,\" he said.\nIn the January eviction notice, Central East Developments listed five companies \"with apartments currently for rent.\"\nHatfield's downstairs neighbour, Daniel Kearley, said he's looked for apartments with each of the suggested companies. In some instances, he said he applied and was rejected.\u00a0In others, the prices were too high.\nKearley and Hatfield are both on fixed incomes, paid for by the province's disability support program.\n\"I'm having extreme difficulties finding anything,\" Kearley said.\nAfter 10 years working around housing and homelessness, Darcy Gillis has seen cases like the one at 23 Crystal Dr. before, but he said\u00a0they're becoming more common.\nGillis is a housing support worker at Dartmouth Housing Help, a non-profit that works with individuals who have challenges finding and keeping stable housing.\nGillis said\u00a0many apartment buildings in North Dartmouth are around the same age as 23 Crystal Dr.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which was built in 1976\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and renovations are to be expected.\nThere have been five recent complaints filed against 23 Crystal Drive's\u00a0owners under bylaw M-200, which sets minimum living standards for all residences, said a spokesperson for the Halifax Regional Municipality.\nThe spokesperson would not divulge the specifics of the complaints, but said HRM responded to each of them and closed the files.\nCentral East Developments bought the building in December, and Gillis said he respects the new owners for taking on deferred maintenance, but evicting tenants leaves them \"in a lurch.\"\n\"It's really unfortunate,\" Gillis said. \"There's no plan for individuals who are being mass evicted for building renovations.\"\nGillis is currently trying to help six tenants at 23 Crystal Dr. find new housing, but he said it's challenging.\n\"Really, there's just nothing available,\" he said.\n\"Low income is always going to be a barrier. And with the vacancy rates so low, the landlords aren't really considering people who don't have as much money.\"\nThe Nova Scotia government added more than 500 new rent supplements \u2014 which are meant to close the gap between what renters can afford and what the market is charging \u2014 to the 2020-21 budget.\nBut Gillis said additional rent supplements can become redundant in a tight rental market.\nSome tenants have already moved out of 23 Crystal Dr. The doors on six units hang open and renovations are well underway.\nIn empty units and common hallways, the floors have been stripped down to plywood\u00a0and construction crews are putting up walls to turn the bachelor apartments into one-bedrooms.\nIf any tenants remain come May 1, Gillis said\u00a0they have a few options.\nIf they're on income assistance, the province could move them into a hotel, temporarily. If not, Gillis said\u00a0he would usually refer them to a shelter. But lately, many Halifax shelters have been full.\n\"So... if the individual doesn't have family or friends, most of them would have to go out onto the streets, which is scary,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Struggling with nightmares and sleepless nights?

In keeping with recommendations to\u00a0avoid spreading the virus, the meeting is expected to be by conference call.\nAnd while a V-shaped recovery seems\u00a0off the table, the OECD\u00a0says\u00a0acting to prevent serious financial damage will mean the economy has every chance of bouncing back to very close to expected levels within two\u00a0years. It's a sign of the times that this counts as optimism.\nAs of yesterday, markets were predicting that the Bank of Canada would cut rates by at least one-quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, with a smaller chance of a half-percentage-point cut.\nA rate cut would be unusual but not unprecedented, since the bank is scheduled to make its policy statement with\u00a0a written release only. In the normal course of events the bank tends to make rate changes on the occasions when the governor, Stephen Poloz, holds a media\u00a0conference to explain his actions.\nBut this may well be a time when even the most staid central banker will err on the side of haste.\nAs well as plenty of pressure from\u00a0investors for rate\u00a0cuts as a measure to stop\u00a0stock market declines, OECD\u00a0chief economist Laurence Boone yesterday called on governments, including central banks, to act quickly to prevent damage to the wider economy.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> presents the \ud83c\udf0d economy with its greatest danger since the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FinancialCrisis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FinancialCrisis</a>, raising the risk of:<br><br>\ud83d\udd39 Restrictions on movement (people, goods &amp; services)<br>\ud83d\udd39 Lower business &amp; consumer confidence<br>\ud83d\udd39 Slowing production<br><br>\ud83c\udd95 Interim <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EconomicOutlook?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EconomicOutlook</a> \u27a1\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/Ur8AjvAzzy\">https://t.co/Ur8AjvAzzy</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kD2dWTXQUz\">pic.twitter.com/kD2dWTXQUz</a>\nIn the past, markets have responded to rate cuts with a pop up in share prices, something traders would relish after seven long days of declines. But according to Boone, there is much more at stake.\nIn a new report titled\u00a0Coronavirus: The world economy at risk the Paris-based think-tank laid out some worrying scenarios.\n\"The main question for the economic outlook is how long and how widely the virus will spread, and with it the containment measures,\" said Boone.\nAs others have said, the illness caused by the coronavirus\u00a0is only the indirect cause of economic damage. Instead,\u00a0it is the methods governments have used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 that have led to simultaneous\u00a0supply\u00a0and demand shocks to the economy.\nOn the supply side, a quarantined workforce means factories stop production, an effect that can spread around the world as unique parts become unavailable, leading to a shortage of some goods.\nOn the demand side, inactive factories mean they don't need things like aluminum and copper. Also, people who stay home to avoid the virus cut back on\u00a0purchases like airline tickets, movies and restaurant meals.\nIf the effects were short term, the money not spent now would merely be spent later. But for central bank economists one of the concerns will be that a synchronized decline in supply and demand will mean the economy operates far below capacity. The value that should have been produced by that unused labour and capital is gone for good.\nIt is not a sure thing rate cuts will fix that problem. If someone does not\u00a0want\u00a0to borrow at all, it is not clear lower rates will convince them. Others have worried cuts at this stage, especially by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, will mean it will be almost impossible to lift rates\u00a0again during this\u00a0U.S.\u00a0election year.\nBut there may be worse things to worry about. As Boone described it, there were three scenarios in the OECD analysis, each gloomier than the next. Essentially the 0.5 per cent decline in global growth, which Boone described as \"the base case,\" would occur if the impacts of the disease were largely limited to China.\nBut if COVID-19 and its resulting containment measures were to spread to most of Asia, to Europe and to North America, the decline in global growth would be closer to 1.5 per cent, cutting world growth in half. But that is still not the\u00a0worst of it.\n\"I think what I should stress at this stage is that this is not a worst-case scenario,\" warned Boone.\nThere could be a much bleaker result if the wider coronavirus impact led to dangers such as damage to the financial system\u00a0and a liquidity crisis, where corporate borrowers desperately search for cash and simply cannot find it.\nTo try to avoid the bleakest\u00a0case, the OECD proposes that governments must be prepared to take co-ordinated action including such measures\u00a0as helping\u00a0ordinary people with health-care spending and cash, delaying tax demands on companies and supporting the broader financial system with increased bank liquidity, public investment and cuts in interest rates.\nBoone\u00a0called for a joint statement by governments on those actions that would reassure all the participants in the global economy, leading to a medium-term recovery.\n\"I think that would help, with two years, the recovery of nearly all the losses from the downside scenario,\" she said.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Tony Seskus", "title": "'Agonizing': The prospect of a historic oil glut weighs on crude prices", "description": "North American benchmark price drops below $30 US per barrel", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-prices-fall-below-thirty-1.5499208", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5499663.1584394857!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/financial-markets-wall-street.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 16, 2020 7:21 PM ET", "2020-03-16T23:21:01.561Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The North American price for a barrel of oil dropped below\u00a0$30 US on Monday as the prospect of a historic glut of crude weighed heavily on energy markets.\n\"At these prices, I think most operators would find this agonizing, or eye-wateringly painful,\"\u00a0said Ian\u00a0Nieboer, managing director of RS Energy Group.\nOn Monday, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the North American benchmark, dropped to $28.70 US per barrel, down $3.03.\nA number of Canadian players also saw their stock price take a hit, including\u00a0Canadian Natural Resources, which was down $5.41, or 27 per cent, to $14.44 per share.\nFalling oil prices will add to the financial strain on many Canadian\u00a0oil producers \u2014 and governments\u00a0\u2014 that had built their fiscal\u00a0plans around\u00a0much higher prices.\nPrices have been dealt a double blow: concern about the economic impact of the novel coronavirus\u00a0and an oil price war involving Russia and Saudi Arabia.\nCrude\u00a0prices sank Monday as oil markets again weighed the impact of growing crude supplies at a time when demand is pulling back.\u00a0Steps by governments to limit travel, for example, are\u00a0expected to have a significant effect.\nSince the start of the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia earlier this month, the WTI price has fallen 23 per cent, while Brent Crude, the global benchmark price,\u00a0has declined 25 per cent.\u00a0\nThe world is looking at the\u00a0\"possible buildup of the most extreme global oil supply surplus\u00a0ever recorded,\" IHS Markit said in a report on Monday.\nIt estimates the surplus could range from 800 million to 1.3 billion barrels\u00a0in the first six months of 2020 if the price war continues amidst\u00a0a global recession and coronavirus\u00a0pandemic. \u00a0 That would exceed the six-month global supply surplus of 2015-16,\u00a0which was a cumulative 360 million barrels.\n\"Extraordinary conditions can lead to startling outcomes,\" IHS Markit said.\u00a0\n\"That is where the oil market now finds itself: in a truly extraordinary situation in what has been a transformative week for the global industry.\"\nIn recent days, the situation has spurred a number of Canadian\u00a0producers to cut their spending plans for 2020, including Calgary-based Husky Energy, Cenovus Energy and MEG Energy.\nAnalysts expect to hear about more cuts in capital spending and production in the Canadian oilpatch\u00a0due to low prices.\nOilfield services analyst Tim Monachello of AltaCorp Capital is forecasting a 31 per cent decline in the average working rig count in Canada for the rest of 2020 even if the U.S. oil price rebounds to an average of $41.50 US per barrel.\nAlberta Premier Jason Kenney\u00a0has said he expects oil companies to make layoff announcements in the next couple of weeks.\nAmerican shale oil producers are also being punished by the low crude prices, with a number of those companies announcing they will be cutting drilling activity this year.\nNieboer of RS Energy Group, now part of Enverus, pointed to a couple of factors that likely contributed to falling crude prices on Monday.\nHe said state-backed Saudi Aramco, which released its latest financial results, sounded committed to its plans to raise oil production. Also, the \"extraordinary\" decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to slash interest rates to zero per cent may have rattled the broader market,\u00a0Nieboer said.\n\"That certainly has shaken, I think, a lot of people's confidence about how quickly we might recover from [novel coronavirus] and the depth of impact that's having on the real economy,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"The combination of those two things, plus probably 50 other little pieces of information, makes today a difficult day in the markets broadly, and certainly for oil markets, a tough one as well.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Bourse anarchy \u2014 what fear of the coronavirus is doing to markets", "description": "Plus how regulatory flip-flops makes balancing environment and economics harder", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/bourse-anarchy-what-fear-of-the-coronavirus-is-doing-to-markets-1.5478665", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5480332.1582921309!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tcol-ep-26.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 28, 2020 3:30 PM ET", "2020-02-28T20:30:00.769Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "A week of massive selloffs in North American stock markets comes days\u00a0after record highs.\nInvestors both in Canada and around the world decided to head for the exits\u00a0en masse, as the TSX, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have all lost value.\nClick here to listen as Paul Haavardsrud and producer Tracy Johnson explore the specific worries around COVID-19 that are driving the current market plunge.\nAlso, how do we actually balance the economy with our climate change goals?\nIn the midst of blockades over the Coastal GasLink project, and Teck withdrawing its application for a $20-billion oilsands project we ask the question \u2014 can Canada have its cake and eat it too?\nPaul Haavardsrud asks economist Andrew Leach for context.\u00a0Click here to listen.\nWhen government flip flops on green policies, what you end up with is uncertainty.\nProducer Tracy Fuller looks at some of the job losses in Alberta and Ontario as a result of those provinces reversing course on climate change strategies.\nClick here to listen as we ask whether\u00a0those jobs matter, when skeptics might point out they were artificially created in the first place?\nClick 'Listen' at the top of this page to hear the whole episode or download\u00a0the\u00a0CBC Listen\u00a0app.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Negotiators close on nearly $2 trillion virus aid package", "description": "Top Democrat Chuck Schumer says despite differences with Republicans, aid deal could be reached today", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/united-states-coronavirus-congress-rescue-1.5506420", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5506856.1584982376!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus-usa.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 23, 2020 10:04 AM ET", "2020-03-24T06:40:12.081Z"], "source": null, "content": "Top congressional and White House officials emerged from gruelling negotiations at the Capitol over the nearly $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package saying they expected to reach a deal Tuesday.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said they had spoken by phone with President Donald Trump during the long night of negotiations. While the two sides have resolved many issues in the sweeping package, some remain.\nAt midnight Monday, they emerged separately to say talks would continue into the night.\n\"We look forward to having a deal tomorrow,\" Mnuchin told reporters after exiting Schumer's office.\n\"The president is giving us direction,\" Mnuhcin said. \"The president would like to have a deal and he's hopeful we can conclude this.\"\nMoments later, Schumer agreed that a deal was almost within reach. \"That's the expectation \u2014 that we finish it tomorrow and hopefully vote on it tomorrow evening,\" he said.\nThe long evening of shuttle negotiations came after a long day trying to close the deal. The massive package is a far-reaching effort to prop up the U.S. economy, help American households and bolster the health care system amid the growing crisis. Mnuchin said talks were expected to resume at 9:30 a.m. EDT.\nTensions flared Monday as Washington strained to respond to the worsening coronavirus outbreak, with Congress arguing over a nearly $2 trillion economic rescue package and an impatient President Donald Trump musing openly about letting the 15-day shutdown expire next Monday, March 30.\nAs the U.S. braces for an onslaught of sick Americans, and millions are forced indoors to avert a spike that risks overwhelming hospitals, the most ambitious federal intervention in modern times is testing whether Washington can act swiftly to deal with the pandemic on the home front.\n\"It's time to get with the program, time to pass historic relief,\" said an angry Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier in the day as he opened the chamber after a nonstop weekend session that failed to produce a deal. \"This is a national emergency.\"\nFuming, McConnell warned Democrats \u2014 pointedly House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 to quit stalling on \"political games,\" as he described Democratic efforts to steer more of the aid toward public health and workers, and push other priorities.\nTrump, who has largely been hands off from the negotiations, weighed in late Monday from the White House briefing room, declaring that Congress should vote \"for the Senate bill as written,\" dismissing any Democratic proposal.\n\"It must go quickly,\" Trump said. \"This is not the time for political agendas.\"\nThe president also sounded a note of frustration about the unprecedented modern-day effort to halt the virus's march by essentially shutting down public activities in ways that now threaten the U.S. economy.\nEven though Trump's administration recommended Americans curtail activities starting a week ago, the president said: \"We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself. At the end of the 15-day period, we will make a decision as to which way we want to go.\"\n\"Let's go to work,\" he said. \"This country was not built to be shut down. This is not a county that was built for this.\"\nTrump said that he may soon allow parts of the nation's economy, in regions less badly hit by the virus, to begin reopening, contradicting the advice of medical and public health experts across the country, if not the globe, to hunker down even more firmly.\nPelosi assailed Trump's idea and fluctuating response to the crisis.\n\"He's a notion-monger, just tossing out things that have no relationship to a well co-ordinated, science-based, government-wide response to this,\" Pelosi said on a health-care conference call. \"Thank God for the governors who are taking the lead in their state. Thank God for some of the people in the administration who speak truth to power.\"\nThe White House team led by Mnuchin worked on Capitol Hill for a fourth straight day of talks as negotiators narrowed on a bipartisan accord.\nIn the nearly empty building, the virus continued to strike close. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who announced he tested positive for coronavirus, is now among five senators under self-quarantine. Several other lawmakers have cycled in and out of isolation. And the husband of Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., is in a hospital with pneumonia after testing positive, she said Monday.\nFirst lady Melania Trump, meanwhile, has tested negative for the coronavirus, Trump said.\nWith a wary population watching and waiting, Washington laboured under the size and scope of a rescue package \u2014 larger than the 2008 bank bailout and 2009 recovery act combined.\nDemocrats are holding out as they argue the package is tilted toward corporations and should do more to help suddenly jobless workers and health care providers with dire needs.\nIn particular, Schumer, D-N.Y., wants constraints on the largely Republican-led effort to provide $500 billion for corporations, which Democrats have called a \"slush fund.\" Schumer wants the bill to limit stock buy-backs, CEO pay and layoffs.\nYet, he said, \"We're very close to reaching a deal.\" Even so, another attempt to move the package forward snagged, blocked as Democrats refused to quit negotiating.\nDemocrats won one concession \u2014 to provide four months of expanded unemployment benefits, rather than just three as proposed, according to an official granted anonymity to discuss the private talks. The jobless pay also would extend to self-employed and so-called gig workers.\nBut Republicans complained Democrats were holding out for more labour protections for workers, wanting assurances that corporations taking federal aid will commit to retaining their employees.\nPelosi came out with the House Democrats' own sweeping $2.5 trillion bill, which would provide $1,500 directly to the public and $200 billion to the states, as governors are pleading for aid. She urged Senate negotiators \"to move closer to the values\" in it.\nTrump has balked at using his authority under the recently invoked Defence Protection Act to compel the private sector to manufacture needed medical supplies like masks and ventilators, even as he encourages them to spur production. \"We are a country not based on nationalizing our business,\" said Trump, who has repeatedly railed against socialism overseas and among Democrats.\nFrom his home, Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden criticized Trump for stopping short of using the full force of emergency federal authority .\n\"Trump keeps saying he's a wartime president,\" Biden said in an online address. \"Well, start acting like one.\"\nOn the economic front, the Federal Reserve announced Monday it will lend to small and large businesses and local governments as well as extend its bond-buying programs as part of a series of sweeping steps to support the flow of credit through an economy ravaged by the viral outbreak.\nCentral to the emerging rescue package is as much as $350 billion for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. The package also proposes a one-time rebate of about $1,200 per person, or $3,000 for a family of four, as well as extended unemployment benefits.\nHospitals would get about $110 billion for the expected influx of sick patients, said Mnuchin. But Democrats are pushing for more health-care dollars for the front-line hospitals and workers.\nThe urgency to act is mounting, as jobless claims skyrocket and financial markets are eager for signs that Washington can soften the blow of the health-care crisis and what experts say is a looming recession.\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\nThe vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "90 years young: Family owned and operated Freeds celebrates", "description": "Sam Freed spoke 11 languages when he opened the store in 1929", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/freeds-90-anniversary-1.5363265", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5363390.1574092779!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/wdr-freeds.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 18, 2019 11:49 AM ET", "2019-11-18T16:49:52.833Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Not many locally-owned and operated retail establishments make it past a decade, but one Windsor business is celebrating 90 years.\u00a0\nFreeds \u2014 an Ottawa Street clothing store \u2014 opened in 1929, just a few months before the stock market crashed.\u00a0\nSam Freed started it all, but the store is now co-owned by grandson Dan and great grandson Evan.\u00a0\n\"He was a man of the people ... he spoke 11 different languages and opened a store that at that time was very much a melting pot,\" said Dan.\u00a0\nGrowing up in the family business means Dan has seen staff stick around for decades.\u00a0\n\"We have staff that have been working with us for 50 years,\" said Dan. \"I didn't know what I was getting into and the people that are there taught me how to be really good at what I do.\"\nIt wasn't Evan's plan to join the family business.

His company spent more than $10 billion US ($13 billion Cdn) to bail out the startup after an IPO (initial public offering) attempt flopped.\nHowever, the billionaire boss stressed that several companies from the fund's portfolio would go public in both 2020 and the year after. SoftBank is counting on new listings to raise cash for its recently announced second Vision Fund, to which it has committed to invest $38 billion US ($50 billion Cdn).\nThe slower IPO approach is likely to increase SoftBank Group's reliance on its telecoms unit SoftBank Corp, according to analysts. The business accounted for nearly a third of the conglomerate's operating income in the last financial year.\nWhile the telecom firm's income has helped insulate the group from losses at the Vision Fund, the unit is the smallest of the three main wireless operators in Japan, a rapidly aging market with limited prospects for growth.\nSo despite being a globe-spanning business with ties to Saudi Arabia, Silicon Valley and Wall Street, SoftBank's fortune rests to large degree on a Japanese base of 23 million mobile subscribers, plus retail investors who snap up its junk-rated bonds aimed at fans of its SoftBank Hawks baseball team.\nSon's comments about office-sharing firm WeWork were remarkable admissions for an executive well known for his optimistic outlook.\n\"My investment judgment was poor in many ways,\" the 62-year-old said after SoftBank Group plunged to its first quarterly loss in 14 years on Wednesday, adding he had turned a blind eye to problems with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann.\nWeWork was not the first setback involving SoftBank investments and stock market debuts.\nShares in ride-hailing app Uber have fallen by more than a third since its listing. Shares of Slack Technologies, which develops productivity software, have tumbled by almost half.\nDan Baker, a director of equity research at global financial services firm Morningstar, said there was a gap between what private markets were willing to pay for these businesses and what the public market would pay.\n\"If they are to delay IPOs then the company will be relying on the dividends from SoftBank Corp,\" Baker said.\nSoftBank Corp has committed to paying out 85 per cent\u00a0of its profits as dividends. As such, the telecom company is closely watched by investors as an indicator of the health of its parent.\nSoftBank Group is also cushioned by a 26 per cent\u00a0stake in China's Alibaba Group, worth about $120 billion US ($158 billion Cdn), which could be sold off if it needs to raise cash in a hurry.\nSoftBank Group has 5.5 trillion yen ($66 billion Cdn) in outstanding bonds and another 4 trillion yen ($48 billion Cdn) in bank loans, according to Refinitiv data. Its weighted average cost of debt is 3.7 per cent, the seventh-highest among all companies on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.\nMoody's calculations show the conglomerate's interest coverage ratio is 1.3, meaning group income is enough to service its debt, with some left over.\nThe telecom unit was a rare bright spot in SoftBank's earnings this week, reporting a 9 per cent\u00a0increase in second-quarter operating profit. In that July-September period, it contributed 284 billion yen ($3.4\u00a0billion Cdn) in operating income to SoftBank Group.\nThe wider group itself posted an operating loss of 704 billion yen ($8.4 billion Cdn), with its Vision Fund losing 970 billion yen ($11.6 billion Cdn).\nIn the year to March 2019, the telecom unit contributed 725 billion yen ($8.7 billion Cdn) in operating income, accounting for 30 per cent of the group's operating income. Much of the rest of the operating income was from largely paper gains from the Vision Fund.\nIt was unclear precisely how SoftBank Group's listings timeline would now be governed, but Son stressed that portfolio companies would remain active in the IPO market.\n\"There are companies in our group that have started making money or are about to make money soon,\" he said. \"For those companies, they make decisions, and we will support them. That's the case. So next year and the year after that, several portfolio companies every year should go public.\n\"That's the direction that we will keep.\"\nTesturo Ii, president of Commons Asset Management, which does not hold SoftBank shares, sounded a note of caution.\n\"Including Uber and WeWork, there are now many unicorns which have done IPOs but are struggling to make profits and whose valuations are being questioned,\" he added.\n\"So it is hard to see rapid improvements in the Vision Fund.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "What's happened in Canada since WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic", "description": "Canada had more than 100 confirmed cases on March 11 when pandemic declared", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/covid-19-timeline-canada-who-pandemic-1.5529920", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5529964.1586632836!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-test-kits.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 11, 2020 3:48 PM ET", "2020-04-11T20:17:48.312Z"], "source": null, "content": "Saturday marks one month since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.\nHere are some key developments for Canada since then:\nMarch 11: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promises $1 billion for COVID-19 to help the health-care system and workers force to self-isolate ...

It said Thursday it is now in negotiations with Uniper to extend the investment decision deadline to June 2021.\nOn the call, Sorensen compared Goldboro LNG's short-term financial needs with TC Energy Corp.'s Keystone XL pipeline, which was approved to be built last month after the Alberta government agreed to inject $1.5 billion in equity and provide a loan guarantee.\n\"When we look at what Alberta just did with Keystone, we face a lot of similar issues,\" he said, adding Pieridae needs a much smaller injection of about $1 billion to ensure the project is built.\nHe said he wouldn't sell the project to government.\n\"We're looking for a hand up, not a hand out,\" he said.\nIn a report, analyst Darrell Bishop of Haywood Securities said the LNG delay was expected, adding Pieridae's current stock price doesn't include any value for the proposed project.\n\"News of the delay should not come as a huge surprise in light of global events, and the current glut of global LNG [and hence low prices],\" he said.\nAt mid-afternoon, the stock was down about 8.8 per cent at 36 cents a share.\nCanada's LNG industry has had a difficult time getting off the ground.\nThe $40-billion Royal Dutch Shell-led LNG Canada project on the West Coast is the only one in full construction mode \u2014 although it has reduced the size of its construction workforce at Kitimat, B.C., by more than half to help local communities deal with COVID-19.\nIn March, Woodfibre LNG developer Pacific Oil & Gas Ltd. said it would delay construction expected this summer on the much smaller project southwest of Squamish, B.C., for a year due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPieridae reported a net loss attributable to equity holders of $25.9 million or 18 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with a net loss of $8.8 million or 17 cents in the same period of 2018.\nRevenue net of royalties jumped to $60 million from $2.4 million as it added 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day through its $190-million purchase in October of southern Alberta natural gas assets from Royal Dutch Shell.\nThe purchase has been panned by landowners and environmentalists who fear Pieridae doesn't have the financial strength to safely operate and reclaim the almost 300 sour gas wells, dozens of pipelines and three gas processing plants it bought.\nBut Sorenson said he's confident the transfer of licences from Shell will be approved by the Alberta Energy Regulator in the few weeks, adding Pieridae has already agreed to a well abandonment program.\nHe said the regulator may require a joint cash deposit by Shell and Pieridae, which his company is prepared to pay.\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "Is the North American economy heading for a recession?", "description": "Financial contributor Mark Ting predicts there won't be a recession until 2021 or later", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/is-north-american-economy-heading-for-a-recession-united-states-market-dow-1.5242677", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4860362.1539354929!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/aptopix-financial-markets-wall-street.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 11, 2019 6:00 AM PT", "2019-08-11T13:00:00.737Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average, one of the\u00a0main stock indexes\u00a0in the U.S., experienced its\u00a0worst day of the year on Monday dropping by 760 points or 2.9 per cent. \u00a0After such a dramatic drop, many investors wonder: is is a recession or bear market coming?\nBefore answering this question, I thought I would explain what caused the 760-point drop.\u00a0Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a new 10 per cent\u00a0tariff on certain goods that the U.S. buys from China. In response China has allowed its currency, the yuan, to depreciate against the dollar.\nWhen the US imposes a new 10 per cent\u00a0tariff against China, it essentially raises the costs of Chinese goods by 10 per cent. However, by China allowing its\u00a0currency to devalue by 10 per cent, it negates the impact of the U.S. tariffs.\nHistorically, China has pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar.\u00a0Now, that is no longer the case so global markets reacted negatively. This is why the Dow\u00a0experienced the dramatic price drop on Monday.\nSince then, the Dow\u00a0has rebounded and much of Monday's losses have been erased.\nRecessions and bear markets are inevitable (as are recoveries and bull markets) so there is always one on the way.\n\u00a0A better question might be: what conditions cause a recession and are those conditions present in the current economic environment?\nThe last 11 recessions were caused by one of three events: a spike in commodity prices, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) aggressively raising interest rates or\u00a0excessively high stock prices. Currently, commodity prices are range bound which means they are not spiking. The Fed is lowering, not raising interest rates.\nThe stock market valuation of the S&P 500,\u00a0Wall Street's benchmark stock index, is trading at a 25-year average of 16 times price/earnings; this indicates that the market is neither cheap nor expensive.\u00a0So that's the good news, based on historical data, a recession in North America doesn't appear to be imminent.\nBut then there is the inverted yield curve, while not a perfect predictor of a recession, it has a solid predictive track record.\u00a0Inverted yield curve occurs when long term interest rates are lower than short term interest rates. This usually only happens if investors believe that economic growth is likely to slow.\nOver the past six decades, whenever the yield curve inverted and stayed inverted for at least 3 months, the economy entered a recession a year or two later.\nThe yield curve is currently inverted and has been since March.\nWhile recessions are inevitable as they are part of a normal market cycle, I do not believe we will experience one until after the U.S. presidential race.\nHistorically, elections years are favourable for the stock market. Over the past 21 elections, there has only been three years where the S&P 500\u00a0had negative returns.\nThe last thing\u00a0Trump wants during an election year is a struggling economy. \u00a0As such, his government will be quick to implement strategies to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession. It is also in his interest to get a trade deal done with China as he will want to bolster his image as a \"great deal maker\" and take credit for growing the global economy.\nMy \"crystal ball\" prediction is that we won't see a recession until 2021 or later.\nIt is a guess and I reserve the right the change my prediction as new information comes to light.\u00a0For now I'm basing my decision on the current economic data and the predictive power of the inverted yield curve. \u00a0\nThis column is part of\u00a0CBC's\u00a0Opinion section.\u00a0For more information about this section, please read this\u00a0editor's\u00a0blog\u00a0and\u00a0our\u00a0FAQ.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-17-edmonton-am/clip/15764978-stock-market-drop-impacts-on-alberta", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Kevin Yarr", "title": "P.E.I. oyster sales dropped to zero when pandemic hit", "description": "\u2018The first two weeks were nothing\u2019", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-oysters-covid-19-pandemic-1.5540728", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5391060.1576005252!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/oysters-on-platter.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 22, 2020 8:42 AM AT", "2020-04-22T11:42:31.322Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The blow from the COVID-19 pandemic was hard and fast for some oyster producers on P.E.I., but in recent weeks they have found ways to make a partial recovery.\n\"The first few weeks, especially, our sales actually were zero,\" said James Power of Raspberry Point Oyster Company.\n\"It was pretty devastating at first. As time went on we managed to find a few ways to sell a few oysters.\"\nThe trend was similar for Martin O'Brien at Cascumpec Bay Oyster Company.\n\"The first two weeks were nothing,\" said O'Brien.\n\"And then I had one customer in Montreal, they have a fish market there. They started taking an order a week, which has turned into two orders a week now. So that's been very good.\"\nO'Brien has also started a local delivery service, which has his company running at a little over half of what sales would normally be. Raspberry Point is operating at just five to 10 per cent of normal sales.\nIn order to drive sales, Raspberry Point has turned a sideline of online orders across the continent via FedEx into a more major focus of the business.\nO'Brien said Cascumpec Bay is lucky to have an employee with the marketing savvy to help launch an online store, and he was pleasantly surprised by the strength of demand on the Island. He said there has also been a side benefit of getting into the delivery business.\n\"I've seen lots of places on the Island that I've never been to before and it's been fun,\" he said.\nThe big problem for both companies has been the closure of restaurant dining rooms across the country.\n\"Without restaurants operating \u2014 who are really the funnel, how we get our product to the customer \u2014 without those running we don't see selling anything like we have done before,\" said Power.\nThe oyster growers are fortunate, however, to not have to worry about their stock spoiling while they wait for markets to reopen.\nThe oysters can just stay in the water, where they will continue to thrive and grow, until the market is ready for them.\n\"I'll just have an abundance of bigger oysters so hopefully there's somebody out there that really likes those,\" said O'Brien.\nThere are some storage issues, they both said, but it is an easier problem than trying to hold on to vegetables that might spoil.\nWith future markets uncertain, both companies are considering how much oyster spat to spread this year. It's a difficult proposition, given that it will be several years before oysters started today will be ready for market.\n"}, {"author": "Tony Seskus", "title": "Help for Canadian oilpatch coming in 'hours, possibly days,' finance minister promises", "description": "'The energy sector is in a particularly challenging situation,' Bill Morneau tells senators", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/morneau-addresses-help-for-oilpatch-1.5509478", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5503854.1584659454!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/coronavirus-bill-morneau.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 25, 2020 1:05 PM ET", "2020-03-25T21:17:37.178Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Help for Canada's oil and gas sector is \"hours, possibly days\" away, federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u00a0said Wednesday, as the industry continues to slash spending plans by the billions of dollars.\nAddressing a Senate\u00a0committee meeting, Morneau said the energy sector has been hit by a combination of an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, tumultuous stock\u00a0markets and COVID-19.\n\"The energy sector is in a particularly challenging situation,\" Morneau said.\nThe minister said Ottawa has been in daily contact with provincial governments to discuss those issues and how it is impacting provincial revenues.\n\"We're\u00a0also in hourly contact with the energy sector to think about how we can bridge the time by providing some sort of appropriate credit opportunities for them \u2014 and that is work that is going on right now,\" he said.\n\"I don't have the final answer on the exact hour that that will be delivered, but I'm not talking about weeks.

And that means even if it never happens.\nThe inability of households to get the goods they need represents a fundamental breakdown of the\u00a0economic system, but it is merely a visible sign of trouble in the supply chain that applies across the economy, says Amin Mawani, who teaches at York University's Schulich School of Business in Toronto.\n\"When you see empty store shelves, you often think\u00a0about consumers,\" said Mawani, whose research includes how companies cope with employee absenteeism. \"Corporations and business also find a lack of similar supplies.\"\nHe says\u00a0that the masks considered most effective against the virus are already unavailable from Canadian retailers, and that in the 2003\u00a0SARS epidemic, hand sanitizer was sold out for months.\n\"We have to prepare across governments, across communities\u00a0and as families and individuals\u00a0in the event of more widespread transmission in our community,\" said Canada's chief public health officer,\u00a0Theresa Tam, on Monday.\nMawani says that when consumers and businesses prepare ahead of time, it really makes an economic difference.\nWhile so far, there\u00a0has been at least one\u00a0report\u00a0of COVID-19\u00a0spreading from person to person among close contacts in this country, outbreaks in Italy, South Korea and Iran are an early warning of what the World Health Organization director general recently referred to as \"the spark that begins the bigger fire.\"\nA friend sent me a picture from a supermarket in Milan\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19italia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19italia</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ooC0uCLKch\">pic.twitter.com/ooC0uCLKch</a>\nThat bigger fire is the moment when an epidemic in a few countries becomes a worldwide pandemic. But even if the virus never comes to your town, there are good economic reasons for consumers and businesses not to wait until it does.\n\"Absolutely, they should be thinking ahead,\" said Darryl Culley, president of the consultancy\u00a0Emergency Management & Training.\nBased in Barrie, Ont., the company has a team of experts to help businesses and public sector groups plan for the unknown.\n\"In the event of a major emergency, regardless of the type\u00a0\u2014 here in Canada it could be an ice storm, on the West Coast it could be an earthquake, it could be a pandemic\u00a0\u2014 people need to be prepared to be self-sufficient for a period of time,\"\u00a0said Culley.\nPreparing for an emergency should not be confused with \"prepper\" culture, the survivalist outlook that saw Saskatoon's Iris Sparrow die at 79\u00a0with an accumulated $20,000 worth of dried food in her basement.\nEven if the current virus were to spread around\u00a0the world, previous experience, including the 1918\u00a0flu pandemic,\u00a0shows that\u00a0eventually, the overall economy will adapt and bounce back, although Mawani notes that some businesses, including restaurants, did not survive in 2003.\nHe says parts of the\u00a0economy may also change. As an\u00a0example\u00a0he cites an increase in telecommuting in China that may become permanent once it has been tried for several months and found effective.\nDisasters in the news elsewhere can help remind people to plan ahead, including stocking up on essentials. But the example of\u00a0hurricane season on the eastern seaboard, when shoppers strip the shelves of everything from dog food to toilet paper, shows people tend to ignore warnings until the last minute.\n\"That's why you see shelves going bare very quickly,\" said Culley.\nAnd that's economically inefficient. Gradually stocking up on things you might need to get you through a hypothetical quarantine means grocery\u00a0stores will have time to adjust supplies, reducing the chances of empty shelves later.\u00a0\nCulley said\u00a0that since\u00a0power and water should not be a\u00a0problem during a disease outbreak,\u00a0ready-to-eat canned goods could be supplemented with grain and beans as a longer-term safety net. As long as it is kept dry and safe from pests,\u00a0a bag of white rice will last for up to\u00a030 years and still taste good, says a report from Utah State University.\nWhile food and medicine are essential for household emergency preparation, plans for keeping the economy functioning while people are sick or in quarantine are\u00a0also essential.\u00a0\n\"Businesses need to have a pandemic plan, and it needs to be done in advance, not at the time of the threat,\" said Culley, who says he has been getting an increasing number of inquiries as\u00a0public concern over of the epidemic rises.\nAmong the strategies to keep operations running during a pandemic is imagining how to\u00a0make the organization\u00a0continue to function when\u00a0one-third of staff is sick or in quarantine. That involves creating a complex plan that includes\u00a0training people to do one another's jobs and thinking about how employees could work from home.\nThe primary goal for employers, said Mawani, is to keep employees healthy, because as well as potentially saving lives, workers\u00a0are essential to a company's financial health. And as SARS showed, even if the transmission of a disease is under control, the economic effect spreads much more widely.\n\"The financial contagion of an outbreak like this is always much\u00a0more significant than\u00a0the health contagion,\" he said.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Kyle Bakx", "title": "Morgan Stanley expanding further into Canada with new wealth management service", "description": "The company will hire for jobs in Calgary and Toronto", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/solium-morgan-stanley-shareworks-1.5576158", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2890116.1420480102!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/earns-morgan-stanley.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 20, 2020 9:00 AM ET", "2020-05-20T13:00:00.122Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "One year after Morgan Stanley acquired Calgary-based Solium Capital, the American financial giant is expanding further in Canada with the launch of a wealth management division.\nThe company is pushing ahead with the new venture despite the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic and expects to have regulatory approval for the new service by the end of the year.\nThe specific number of new jobs created was not provided, although they will include executive and financial advisor positions, among others.\n\"You will see new bodies and new roles in both Calgary\u00a0and\u00a0Toronto as of now and potentially other cities as well, as we continue to launch and ramp up the business,\" said Laura Adams, head of institutional distribution in Canada and the new wealth management service.\n\"We will absolutely be pursuing growth in the future and we will continue to build out the teams appropriately in their respective offices once we start executing.\"\nMorgan Stanley paid $1.1 billion to acquire Solium in May of last year.

I think the smartest thing would be for them to go ahead with it unless of course the proposals are wholly inadequate. We don't have any visibility there,\" said Brad Poulos, an instructor in the Ted Rogers School of Management at Ryerson University in Toronto.\nLast year, New Brunswick Finance Minister Ernie Steeves announced the province was looking to transfer cannabis retailing to the private sector following weak sales and multimillion-dollar losses by Cannabis NB in its first year.\n\"To say [I'm] disappointed would be an understatement,\" Steeves said in April 2019, before eventually announcing a plan to privatize retailing.\n\"I'm looking for a way to try and save some money for taxpayers, trying to make some money for taxpayers, and try and bring in some revenue for taxpayers and this (Cannabis NB) is not turning out to be one of those ways.\"\u00a0\nEight potential private operators were identified as being under consideration in January following a Request for Proposals (RFP) issued by the province.\u00a0\u00a0\nA selection was supposed to be made \"this spring\" and, although the COVID-19 pandemic has lengthened that timeline, a decision is still being worked on, according to the finance department's Vicky Desch\u00eanes.\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the RFP evaluation work over the past few weeks,\" said Desch\u00eanes in an email to CBC News. \"That being said we can confirm that the work has resumed.\"\nBut much has changed since last year, including better than expected sales and net income performances by Cannabis NB and struggles by a number of private retailers, some of which are bidding to take over the market in New Brunswick.\nLast week, the publicly traded cannabis retailer Fire & Flower saw its stock price drop after reporting operating losses of $35.7 million in its latest fiscal year ended Feb. 1.\u00a0\nFire & Flower operates 45 retail stores in Ontario, western Canada and the Yukon territory and is one of the eight operators in the running to take over from Cannabis NB.\nOn Friday, Fire & Flower's stock price was down to 56 cents, a 12.5 per cent decline since releasing its financial results.\nTwo weeks ago, YSS Corporation, another western Canadian cannabis retailer under consideration to take over from Cannabis NB, reported a full-year operating loss of $4.8 million in 2019 on sales of $8.5 million.\nIts stock price also slumped and closed Friday at 11.5 cents, down 28 per cent since its year end financials were released.\nIn a regulatory filing accompanying its results, YSS cited many of the same issues that plagued Cannabis NB in 2019 as the reason for the size of its losses, including supply shortages and unfettered illegal sellers.\n\"Progress was made in 2019, but the year is not representative of the ultimate potential of the cannabis industry in Canada,\" said the company in a press release.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Expectations, analyst forecasts and growth were muted by regulatory delays and uncertainty, supply chain issues, and competition from the black market.\"\nIn January, YSS President Theo Zunich said he was confident his company could make cannabis retailing profitable in New Brunswick, but in an unexpected plot twist Cannabis NB reports it has already done that.\nLast Wednesday, the Crown agency issued unaudited financial results for its fourth quarter, showing it made $500,000 on revenue of $14 million over 13 weeks ended March 29.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's the first quarterly profit for Cannabis NB since it began operation in October 2018 and largely unanticipated.\nCannabis NB had lost $17.3 million over its first five quarters and, according to budget papers tabled in the legislature by the finance minister on March 10, it was expected to lose another $2.2 million by the end of the fiscal year.\u00a0\u00a0\nInstead it made money.\nA year ago, Steeves said he wasn't sure that was even possible.\n\"It's hard to imagine that it would be sustainable at this point,\" he said last spring after Cannabis NB projected $12 million in losses over its first five and a half months in business.\nSince then, supply problems in the legal cannabis industry have resolved themselves and edible and other products were added to the legalized inventory.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn addition, Cannabis NB slashed its expenses and lowered prices to compete better with the black market, all aiding the turnaround\u00a0\nCannabis NB sales in the latest quarter were an average of $7,692 per store per day among its 20 locations, 54 per cent better than the fourth quarter last year.\nAccording to Poulos, early losses by all cannabis retailers who have been building businesses from the ground up were to be expected and should not be a concern.\u00a0\nHe also doubts the New Brunswick government would get any better offers for a profitable Cannabis NB today than it did for its unprofitable version when bids were solicited last fall.\n\"The companies that are interested in acquiring this asset very much understand the long-term value of it and that's the price that would be put on it\u00a0 \u2014 not based on today's operational profit. So I don't think timing is really a big issue,\" said Poulos.\nAccording to Desch\u00eanes, the province is prepared to keep Cannabis NB as a Crown corporation if the bids from private operators are found to be inadequate.\n\"The process is flexible in nature,\" the finance department spokesperson said. \"Should the negotiations fail, government can walk away and continue to seek efficiencies with the current public sector model or look at other alternative models.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "To boost beef industry, N.L. government invites farmers to have a cow", "description": "15 purebred Hereford cattle imported in past 3 years", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/purebred-beef-program-newfoundland-labrador-1.5314875", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5315188.1572547615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cow.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 09, 2019 5:37 PM NT", "2019-10-09T20:07:55.633Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The provincial government is betting that by spending a little cash to buy better cattle,\u00a0Newfoundland and Labrador's modest beef market may be able to grow.\nA research project\u00a0led by the Department of Fisheries and Land Resources has bought and transported 15 pregnant Hereford cows to three farms in western and central Newfoundland\u00a0in the last three years.\n\"This is the beginning stages of growing a beef industry, in our opinion,\u00a0so we got a ways to go,\" said Sabrina Ellsworth, a research manager with the department.\nLittle beef is produced in the province\u00a0\u2014 about 1,000 kilograms annually, a drop in the bucket compared with the 14 million kilograms imported in the same time frame\u00a0\u2014 and much of that local meat has come from breeds or crossbreeds ill-suited to end up as food, said Ellsworth.\nHerefords, however, are widely used across Canada for beef production, and can make the most of Newfoundland and Labrador's marginal pasture quality and cool climate.\n\"They're a very, very hardy breed.

In turn, Young is in charge of feed, vet bills and any other care required. Provincial researchers check in monthly to chart progress.\nWhile Young hopes to be able to produce enough beef to sell to grocery stores and restaurants, the entire research project is still in its early stages and little slaughtering has so far been done, as for the most part the cattle haven't reached maturity.\n\"The true test to the quality of the beef we are producing will be at time of slaughter,\" said Ellsworth.\n\"So when we actually compare the meat quality, the marbling, the cuts\u00a0\u2014 all of those components will be examined at that time.\"\u00a0\nSix steers are expected to be harvested this winter.\nEllsworth said the total government investment in the cattle\u00a0\u2014 which are also living on farms in Daniel's Harbour and Cormack\u00a0\u2014 is about $100,000 so far.\nBeef has been making headlines as of late for its large carbon footprint compared to other forms of protein, thanks to a combination of energy use in its production, as well as the methane the animals emit naturally.\u00a0A recent United Nations report stated both farming and eating habits need to change worldwide, including choosing more plant-based foods over meat.\nAccording to the province, most of the 13.8 kilograms of beef imported into Newfoundland and Labrador in 2018\u00a0came from elsewhere in Canada.\u00a0The minister of fisheries and land resources argued that cutting that transport would cut emissions, and is a more practical approach to the problem than asking people to change what's on their plates.\n\"The most practical step is to reduce the carbon footprint of the beef that we do eat, and the best way to do that? Produce it right here in Newfoundland\u00a0and Labrador. Don't ship it in,\" said Gerry Byrne.\nTwenty-five calves have been born since the research project began in 2016.\nRead more\u00a0from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title":

wrecking ball through most of its underlying financial assumptions.\nPremier Blaine Higgs is acknowledging the document is already obsolete.\n\"We know this is really going to mess up the books,\" Higgs\u00a0said during CBC's weekly Political Panel on Thursday about the far-reaching financial effects of the virus.\u00a0\n\"We had a budget that had some ability to manage through a crisis, but none of us expected a crisis\u00a0like this.\"\nHiggs declared a state of emergency in the province on Thursday to combat the spread of COVID-19, ordering an array of businesses that serve the public to close indefinitely.\u00a0That has constricted wide segments of the New Brunswick economy, put thousands of people out of work and shut down businesses that feed the province critical tax dollars daily.\nThat, added to the steep decline in worldwide\u00a0stock markets, promises to deliver a crushing one-two punch to next year's planned $92-million budget surplus unveiled a week ago Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut the economic effects are so immediate and significant it is not beyond possible for the virus, with 11 days left in the current fiscal year, to undo this\u00a0year's provincial budget surplus as well, projected just last week to be $97.8 million.\nHiggs said it is a financial calamity he will deal with later when the danger posed to people from the virus has passed.\n\"We're seeing some projections that, depending how long this goes on,\u00a0it's going to have a huge impact on not only employment\u00a0activities but on the finances of the province,\" said Higgs.\n\"But that's secondary at this point.\"\nLast week's budget, delivered by Finance Minister Ernie Steeves,\u00a0was built on an assumption of one per cent growth in the New Brunswick economy this year.\nBut private forecasters\u00a0are already casting doubt on that number.\nOn Wednesday, the TD Bank lowered its estimate of growth in New Brunswick for 2020 to a nearly stagnant 0.1 per cent, joining the Royal Bank, which cut its growth estimate for the province in half to 0.5 per cent.\n\"Like most of its provincial peers, New Brunswick's economy will take a hit this year as COVID-19 temporarily weighs on its business and consumer spending,\" said\u00a0the TD report.\nThe New Brunswick government has several revenue sources in harm's way.\u00a0It normally raises $4 million per day from the HST\u00a0being applied to goods and services sold in the province, but that has already been sagging under the weight of so many business closures.\u00a0\u00a0\nCorporate and personal income taxes which were budgeted to bring in another $2.3 billion this\u00a0year are also likely to be suppressed.\nThe decline in HST revenue is also something attacking this year's budget surplus even though the end of the fiscal year is\u00a0just 11 days away.\u00a0\nBut a larger threat is the sudden collapse in stock market values and the effect that may have on NB Power.\nMore than half of this year's expected provincial government budget surplus rests on NB Power's projected profit of $49.7 million.\u00a0\nBut the utility has significant financial exposure to financial markets\u00a0\u2014 mostly through $766 million in funds it has invested to pay for the\u00a0future decommissioning of the Point Lepreau nuclear generating station and the management of its spent radioactive fuel.\u00a0 \u00a0\nAccording to its last annual report,\u00a0nearly one-third of that money,\u00a0$237 million,\u00a0is invested in stock market-related equities.\u00a0Some of those market\u00a0have lost up to 30 per cent of their value in the last month.\nNB Power's Marc Belliveau could not say Thursday if the market slump will be enough to wipe out NB Power's expected profit for the year when its books close on March 31, but barring a significant rally the impact of the markets on the utility and the province will be noticeable.\n\"It's a completely reasonable question, but the COVID crisis is only a few weeks old,\" said Belliveau in an email.\n\"We have a team of workers at NB Power that are examining the effect that these unprecedented events may have, but it is too early to determine with any amount of precision what those effects will be.\"\nHiggs said the Finance Department is preparing an update on the province's finances\u00a0for the all-party cabinet committee that has been steering\u00a0the province through the current crisis, but he's not concerned with how grim the numbers might be.\n\"We're not watching day-to-day finances,\" said Higgs.\n\"I've committed\u00a0to [get] through this and what we've collectively committed to \u2014\u00a0we'll do what is necessary to protect the citizens.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\n"}, {"author": null,

were underway on how to address the virus outbreak and economic volatility and keep the government functioning.\nAfter Trump refused to answer reporter questions about whether he had been tested for the virus, the White House issued a statement late Monday evening saying he had not.\n\"The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms,\"\u00a0White House spokesperson\u00a0Stephanie Grisham said in a statement, referring to the disease caused by the

headline a fundraiser in Longwood, Fla., that raised approximately $4 million US for his re-election campaign and the Republican Party. He ignored shouted questions about the plunging stock market as he boarded Air Force One for the flight back to Washington.\nIn Monday morning tweets, Trump lashed out at the steep market drop and news that large public gatherings were being called off because of the virus.\n\"At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 22 deaths,\" Trump tweeted, comparing it to seasonal influenza and the thousands of deaths that it causes. \"Think about that!\"\nSo last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu.

On Monday, Defence Secretary Mark Esper's regular meeting with senior staff, which normally would be held face-to-face in a single room with 40 to 50 participants, was broken up into three rooms, with video-teleconferencing among the rooms, according to the Pentagon's chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman. He said Esper and the 15 to 20 people in his room, including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sat at least six feet apart, in line with health guidance.\nTrump has delegated much of the virus response to U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence, who joined Trump to give an update on the federal government's virus response Monday afternoon with the nation's governors.\u00a0\nOn Capitol Hill, where many lawmakers are older and have frequent constant contact with the public, leaders were fielding questions from members and staff about how the complex will be secured. Leaders have so far shown little willingness to close the Capitol, but meetings were scheduled throughout the day to discuss preparations.\nOn Monday, Republican Reps. Doug Collins\u00a0and Matt Gaetz\u00a0put themselves into voluntary quarantine after exposure to a person at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference who later tested positive for the virus.\nBoth said they did not have any symptoms but would wait out the remainder of the 14 days since the contact at home.\nGaetz\u00a0travelled to Washington with Trump on Air Force One on Monday. Collins met Trump on Tuesday night at the White House and shook hands with Trump on Friday when the president visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Atlanta headquarters.\nA day earlier, Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Paul Gosar\u00a0placed themselves in quarantine after coming in contact with the same person at the conservative conference.\nAs well, Democratic Rep. Julia Brownley\u00a0said she met last week with a person who has since been diagnosed with the virus. She closed her office and said she and her staff are \"self-monitoring and maintaining social distancing practices.\"\nVast numbers of visitors come to the Hill, especially at this time of year when advocacy groups arrange \"fly-in\" trips to lobby and speak to lawmakers, and school groups descend for tours.\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill had barely started to contemplate the economic implications of the spread of the virus and what might be needed to stimulate the economy as people started to cancel vacations and business trips and stay away from stores. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley is \"exploring the possibility of targeted tax relief measures that could provide a timely and effective response to the coronavirus,\" spokesman Michael Zona said Monday.\n\"Everything's on the table,\" Grassley told reporters.\nDemocrats indicated they preferred other responses, like passing legislation requiring employers to give their workers paid sick leave \u2014 a longtime policy priority of Democrats \u2014 and additional help for those with lower incomes.\n\"The best way to ensure economic security for the American people right now is to deal with the coronavirus itself, competent and full on,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. \"Something we haven't yet seen. Getting a handle on the crisis and containing the spread of the virus is by far the best way to address any effects on the economy.\"\nA day after saying it was \"proceeding as normal,\" Trump's campaign cancelled a three-day Women for Trump bus tour across Michigan that included Mercedes Schlapp, the former White House aide who is married to the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.\nSchlapp is under self-quarantine after he, too, was exposed to the infected person at CPAC. He introduced Trump and greeted him with a handshake on stage before the president\u00a0spoke on Feb. 29.\n\"The president of the United States, as we all know, is quite a hand washer,\"\u00a0Grisham told Fox News. \"He uses hand sanitizer all the time.

The bill now goes to the Senate, which meets Friday.\nAll parties supported the change. Most of the opposition criticism focused on how the government's help for the dairy sector to date wasn't enough.\nThe higher borrowing limit\u00a0would\u00a0take effect in the\u00a0dairy industry's current operating year, which ends July 31, 2020.\nBibeau told MPs\u00a0during debate in the House on Wednesday that the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC) had the borrowing room it needed to manage the milk supply so far this year, but it was asking for this extra room before the end of this month.\nThe CDC\u00a0uses its existing borrowing capacity in two ways. In partnership with a private lender, it deploys\u00a0$50 million of this credit to allow\u00a0farmers\u00a0from across\u00a0Canada to pool their revenues. The remaining $250 million of its current borrowing limit has been available for bulk purchases of surplus butter stocks.\nWhen dairy processors have more butter than the market requires at a given time, the commission makes bulk purchases that allow the surplus product\u00a0to be stored\u00a0until demand increases\u00a0and it can be re-sold back into the market.\nThe Crown corporation does not automatically use all its capacity every year. The total amount of its\u00a0annual purchases\u00a0is\u00a0subject to Treasury Board approval.\nIn a typical year, butter is purchased in the spring, when milk production from Canada's dairy herds can exceed consumer demand. The commission\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b then sells it back to dairy processors for sale\u00a0in the fall, when consumption rises \u2014 especially in the lead-up to the Christmas baking\u00a0season.\nThe amount of butter the CDC\u00a0purchases has increased\u00a0over the last five years. Because the market price for\u00a0butter has also gone up over time, more financing\u00a0is now required to purchase those higher volumes, Paul said.\nNow, the government is moving to expand its existing butter storage program to include cheese.\n\"The industry asked the CDC to temporarily purchase cheese,\" Bibeau\u00a0told the House, explaining how the Crown corporation will sign contracts with cheesemakers, who will\u00a0in turn \"commit to buying it back within two years.\"\nWith restaurants and other institutional food services closed, the Canadian dairy industry has been reeling from the collapse in demand for certain dairy products this spring. That has\u00a0forced\u00a0producers in some regions, such as Eastern Ontario,\u00a0to dump milk\u00a0that could no longer be used.\nThe CDC will now be able to support cheesemakers who currently\u00a0are not operating at full capacity\u00a0to transform future milk surpluses into cheese, which is easier to store. In addition to preventing waste, the bulk purchases also\u00a0help with the processors' cash flow issues until the market stabilizes again.\nMathieu Frigon, president and CEO of the Dairy Processors Association of Canada, told CBC News that farmers and processors asked the government to make this change last month\u00a0after being forced to dump milk.\nHe said that the total value of this borrowing limit does not represent a new annual expense on the federal books. With interest rates at record lows, taxpayers pay\u00a0only the relatively small cost of financing the storage of this butter and cheese until the stocks are re-sold.\n\"Never have we seen such fluctuation in demand for milk from one week to another,\" Pierre Lampron, the president of the Dairy Farmers of Canada, said last week when the farm aid package was announced. \"Despite the best efforts to manage production to align with consumer needs, bottlenecks resulted in milk having to be disposed at the farm, something no dairy farmer wants to see.\"\nWhile the industry is pleased to get this help, anxiety remains over what else this summer has in store for the dairy sector.\nThe timing of the implementation of the revised North American trade agreement, now set for July 1, does not align with the dairy industry's fiscal year, which begins on August 1.\nThe export limits on certain Canadian dairy products (such as\u00a0skim milk), and the new tariff-free market access provided to\u00a0 (chiefly American) dairy products, phase in gradually over several years.\nThe Canada Day start for the new NAFTA means that for the dairy sector, the first \"year\" of the agreement will be only one month long, before the concessions ramp up further\u00a0for the second (full) year the deal's implementation.\nDairy industry officials have estimated that the earlier date costs\u00a0the sector\u00a0tens of millions of dollars\u00a0at least, on top of the sizeable concessions for which they were already bracing.\nTalks to negotiate a compensation package for supply-managed agriculture sectors that are losing domestic market share under the new trade deal\u00a0have stalled, as both the government and the industry scramble\u00a0to manage the\u00a0pandemic.\nConservative MP John Barlow asked Bibeau in the Commons what had changed, such that the CDC suddenly needed this extra borrowing capacity.\n\"Is this to deal with COVID, or the additional imports allowed from the United States as a result of the USMCA?\" he said.\n\"It is directly related to COVID,\" the minister said.\u00a0\"With the closure of restaurants and hotels, the demand for milk and cheese has decreased significantly.\n\"The Canadian Dairy Commission will be using its normal tools, but will also have a higher capacity to buy milk and cheese to store them and resell them later when the demand comes back.\"\nCBC News asked\u00a0Bibeau\u00a0last week when the sector's NAFTA compensation package would be ready, now that the implementation date has been set in a way that adds to its harm.\nBibeau pointed out that the first compensation payments for losses resulting from the European Union and Pacific Rim trade deals arrived last winter\u00a0\u2014 but those payments were not calculated\u00a0to cover the future losses under the new NAFTA.\n\"Now we are focusing on the support we have to provide to counter the effect of COVID-19,\" the minister said. \"But our commitment towards the dairy sector and the poultry and egg sectors as well is very strong, and we will be moving forward later on.\"\n"}, {"author": "Kyle Bakx", "title": "Farmers concerned about disruptions to spring seeding, livestock operations amid COVID-19", "description": "Fuel, chemical and seed supply worries come as farmers are getting ready to plant", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/farmers-beef-prices-1.5513195", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5513220.1589034343!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/spring-seeding.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 30, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-30T16:20:29.472Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "While it may be easier for farmers to self-isolate than\u00a0for other professions, they, too, are unable to hide from the widespread impacts of the coronavirus.\nJust as stock markets have plunged, so, too, have\u00a0prices for many farm products.\u00a0\nWheat prices, for instance, fell by about 15 per cent in early March but have started bouncing back in the last two weeks.

Prices have since regained some of that value.\n\"That's incredible\u00a0volatility. We're talking about hundreds of dollars a head jumping around. Very dramatic,\" said Perillat.\nCanada's agriculture sector wants to be designated an essential service and allowed to do business as usual during the COVID-19 crisis.\u00a0\nThe federal government has already decided to exempt temporary foreign workers, including migrant farm workers, from some COVID-19 travel restrictions.

JBS executives told investors last week the company is screening the temperature of workers as they arrive, changing shifts, and hiring more workers, among other steps.\nStill, the facilities often have a few thousand workers and there's only so much physical distancing possible in the plants.\n\"It's a challenge and we will continue to face the challenge\u00a0as long as the virus continues,\" said Andre Nogueira, the chief executive of JBS USA, which oversees a beef facility in Brooks, Alta, which can process about 4,000 head of cattle a day.\n\"We need to balance that with our responsibility to continue to produce food.\u00a0 We can't\u00a0stop or it creates a big issue for the whole nation,\" he said.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nThe rush in grocery stores for meat products has yet to have an impact on retail prices.

About half of the total survey of 1,200 respondents was conducted before stock markets and oil prices plunged (March 2-8).\u00a0 The other half of the interviews took place after this economic shock (March 9-18). Growing concerns about the pandemic continue to shape public attitudes. \nAs with all polls, this one is a snapshot in time. CBC News \u2014\u00a0and the public opinion experts consulted on this survey research \u2014\u00a0believe the data offers some valuable insights into Albertans'\u00a0attitudes about the economy and politics just at the moment when COVID-19 changed everything.\nAlbertans were already anxious about the economy as oil prices hit historic lows in mid-March. Then, the floor fell out from under their feet in the wake of a worldwide pandemic.\u00a0\nCBC News was polling Albertans as the economic shock hit.\nOur telephone and online survey of 1,200 Albertans was conducted between March 2 and March 18. Half of the poll was completed before worldwide markets crashed and oil prices cratered after Saudia Arabia and Russia faced off in a war over oil prices on March 9. The remaining, roughly 600 respondents, were surveyed after oil prices plunged.\u00a0\u00a0\nEven before the market free fall, 63 per cent of Albertans said they expected the economy to get worse. After the oil crash, that number jumped to 79 per cent.\n\"Albertans were already extremely anxious about the economy,\" said Calgary-based pollster Janet Brown, who conducted the poll for CBC News. \"It's just logical to expect that Albertans are only feeling more anxious now.\"\nThe graph below shows the sudden impact of the oil price crash and COVID-19 concerns.\nThese are the most recent numbers, but we can compare them to a similar poll that CBC\u00a0News did in 2018, when we asked the same question.\nTwo years ago, 45 per cent of Albertans said they thought the economy was getting better. By March 18\u00a0this year, a mere four per cent of Albertans were optimistic about things improving.\u00a0\nIn the graph below, you can see the comparisons between the two polls, and the extent of the economic concerns, with confidence\u00a0already slipping because of economic woes before COVID-19.\n\"Two years ago,\" said Brown, \"most people thought the worst was behind us. And very few people were expecting \u2026\u00a0an even worse economic situation in the future.\"\n\"Now, fast forward two years and we actually have 71 per cent of people expecting\u00a0the economy to get worse.\"\nAnd that was before layoffs in the oilpatch began and the true ramifications of the pandemic became clear\u00a0\u2014 not that the depth of those ramifications are clear even yet.\nIn this latest poll from just weeks ago, we find (no surprise)\u00a0the economy was the single most important issue that was top of mind for Albertans, with 24 per cent of them mentioning it first.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe energy industry, pipelines (15 per cent) and jobs or employment (13 per cent) \u2014\u00a0which can be considered a proxy, or related to the economy \u2014\u00a0came second and third in mentions.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen you add those numbers up, CBC News' poll suggests that, as of March 18, economic issues topped the list of concerns for 52 per cent of Albertans.\u00a0\nOnce again, that was before cases of COVID-19 began to rise across the province \u2014 before the widespread layoffs began and self-isolation became a way of life. Those pressures will continue to change how Albertans feel.\n\"I'm expecting public opinion to change on just about every measure,\" said Brown.\n\"This is the kind of shock that really will get people thinking about all aspects of government.\"\nNotably, the CBC News\u00a0poll did detect growing concerns about COVID-19.\u00a0\nPeople were asked an open-ended question: What's the most important issue facing Alberta?\nIn the first half of the survey (before March 9), only four per cent of respondents mentioned concerns about the coronavirus.\u00a0In the latter half of polling, mentions of COVID-19 rose substantially, with 17 per cent of respondents saying it is an issue of concern for Alberta.\nConcern about health care is also up from two years ago.\u00a0More than a quarter of the Albertans surveyed mentioned health care as an important issue facing the province in the most recent poll.\u00a0\nOnly 20 per cent of Albertans mentioned health care when asked the same question in 2018. Concerns about government spending and education have also risen over the past two years.\u00a0\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic testing Alberta's health-care system like it's never been before, concerns about the public medical system are likely to grow, predicts Brown.\u00a0\n\"We're going to be focused on our health-care system and how to keep that strong \u2026\u00a0get it back into shape after the shock of COVID,\" she said.\nBut at the same time, Brown notes\u00a0Albertans will also be worried about the economy and how they are going to pay their bills.\n\"We're going to be looking for our \u2026\u00a0leaders to show both leadership, when it comes to the social agenda and social policies, but also leadership when it comes to the economy,\" Brown said.\u00a0\nFixing this won't be easy. There is no roadmap.\u00a0\u00a0\nAlready, Premier Jason Kenney has warned Albertans to prepare for economic adversity not seen since the 1930s.\u00a0\nAs he said in a recent press conference, \"Let me be blunt with Albertans. We are facing what will likely be the largest single contraction in our economy in our history.\"\nThat's echoed by others.\n\"We're dealing with a combination of a health crisis and an economic crisis simultaneously. It would be as if you had the Spanish flu and the Great Depression happening at the same time,\" said Duane Bratt, head of the department of economics, justice, and policy studies at Mount Royal University.\nWith the collapse of oil prices, and the subsequent royalty shortfall, along with the billions the province is spending to support individuals and businesses during the COVID-19 outbreak, our province is facing serious debt problems.\nOur survey data shows, when the poll was conducted, a slight majority (52 per cent) of people in Alberta thought it was OK to run a deficit. That's up 14 percentage points since CBC News asked the same question in 2018.\u00a0\u00a0\nHistorically, polls have suggested that Albertans are debt averse when it comes to public finances.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Here in Alberta, we don't like debt,\" said Brown. \"So it's the question that all Albertans will have to ask themselves: how much debt are they comfortable with their government taking on in order to \u2026\u00a0get the economy back on track?\"\n\"But what's more important to voters is that the government is making the right decision in the right circumstances. And Albertans will understand that circumstances have changed,\" Brown added.\u00a0\nPremier Kenney has already announced the creation of an economic recovery panel to help plan for the province's future, although until the economic consequences are apparent, through the passage of time, that will be difficult.\nThe CBC News\u00a0poll captures Albertans' feelings only up to the end of the survey period.\u00a0\u00a0\nUndoubtedly, concern about the economy, health care\u00a0and many other issues has increased in the days since.\u00a0\nStill, this poll shows how Albertans were feeling in the face of\u00a0troubling economic headwinds.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe poll offers a sense of where Albertans were before the pandemic crisis took hold.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We now know the starting point. I don't know the ending point. I don't know when this ball is going to quit bouncing. But this survey gives us a good insight into where Albertans were when the floor dropped out,\" said Brown.\nAnd to find out how COVID-19 may be shaping and changing how Albertans feel about the economy and politics, CBC News plans to conduct another survey in the coming months.\u00a0\n\"I want to check in again with how people are feeling about the economy. I also want to know how they're feeling about their own personal circumstances and how the pandemic might be changing their attitudes,\" said Brown.\nMethodology:\nThe CBC News\u00a0random survey of 1,200 Albertans was conducted using a hybrid method between March 2 and March 18, 2020, by Edmonton-based Trend Research under the direction of Janet Brown Opinion Research. The sample is representative along regional, age and gender factors. The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For subsets, the margin of error is larger.\nThe survey used a hybrid methodology that involved contacting survey respondents by telephone and giving them the option of completing the survey at that time, at another more convenient time, or receiving an email link and completing the survey online. Trend Research contacted people using a random list of numbers, consisting of half land lines and half cellphone numbers. Telephone numbers were dialled up to five times at five different times of day before another telephone number was added to the sample. The response rate among valid numbers (i.e. residential and personal) was 13.2 per cent.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1693662787770", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "China-U.S. trade and Hong Kong uncertainty weigh on global stocks", "description": "This comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had not agreed to gradually lift tariffs on Chinese goods", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/china-us-trade-uncertainty-global-stocks-1.5355347", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5355357.1573481785!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-financial-markets.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 11, 2019 9:23 AM ET", "2019-11-11T19:59:46.502Z"], "source": null, "content": "Shares around the world fell Monday as hopes for a breakthrough in the trade war between the United States and China diminished after President Donald Trump said Washington had not agreed to gradually roll back tariffs as negotiations progress.\nHopes were shaken when Trump on Friday dismissed a Chinese official's assertion that the U.S. side had agreed to gradually lift tariffs on Chinese goods that it has imposed in the conflict over trade and technology policies.\nA Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman had said Thursday that the two sides had agreed to a phased cancellation of their tariff hikes as part of an agreement now under negotiation.\n\"They'd like to have a rollback,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"I haven't agreed to anything.\"\nThat raised doubts in the markets that some sort of agreement is imminent.\n\"Market participants have become more cautious over the potential positive impact for global growth from a partial US-China trade deal,\" said Lee Hardman, an analyst at MUFG Bank.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 100.58 points, or 0.36 per cent, at the open to 27,580.66.\nThe S&P 500 opened lower by 12.75 points, or 0.41 per cent, at 3,080.33.

And anyone trying to buy a Harley Davidson in Hungary was likely also keenly aware that there was some\u00a0funny business afoot.\nBut unless you happened to be a Canadian exporter of steel and aluminum\u00a0or a Mexican avocado farmer, it was perhaps easy to think the world of international trade was largely business as usual.\nNot anymore. Markets were whipsawed this week by the slow realization that the outlook for the world's economy isn't getting better\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it's getting worse. And while 800-point drops for the Dow Jones index tend to generate a lot of headlines, it's what's happening in some far more under-the-radar indicators that are the best signs of just how wacky the economy is getting.\nBond yields don't tend to get a lot of attention outside of the financial press, but their behaviour in recent weeks is perhaps the surest sign of just how topsy-turvy the global economy has gotten. Bonds are debt, issued by governments and companies, that come with an interest rate attached so that the people loaning out the money get a return over time.\nGenerally speaking, bonds are seen as safe investments, which is why investors only expect a few percentage points of return from holding them at the best of times. But the fog over the economic outlook is so thick at the moment that many borrowers are getting away with selling bonds offering a negative yield.\nAnyone buying that bond is willingly buying an investment that's guaranteed to lose money, but\u00a0investors are more than happy to buy it up \u2014\u00a0because the fear is that alternative investments will fare even worse.\nThat may sound great for anyone looking to buy a home in Copenhagen, but it's very bad news for the world's economy, says Paul Gardner, partner and portfolio manager of Avenue Investment Management.\n\"There's something around $16 trillion of bonds around the world dealing with negative interest rates,\" he said in an interview with CBC News this week. \"That's very\u00a0unhealthy ... just because it has\u00a0a feel of instability.\"\n\"You always want to have positive interest rates,\" he said. \"You want low, but you don't want negative.\"\nThose negative yields are filtering down into the economy in some truly jaw-dropping ways. A Danish bank this week started offering a negative yielding mortgage \u2014 meaning anyone who signs up will get money to buy a home, and then get a tiny interest payment in their account every month to help pay down the principal.\nAs much as one-quarter of all the government debt in the world is currently upside down. And\u00a0even the bonds that still eke out a tiny return are flashing red warning signs of their own.\nUnder normal circumstances, long-term bonds tend to pay out more than short-term ones simply because it's a lot easier to forecast the short term than the long, so a bond buyer demands a higher rate for a long term to offset the risk of that uncertainty.\nBut a funny thing has happened of late, in that yields have flipped \u2014 long-term rates are even lower than short-term ones, \u2014 which suggests investors have more confidence in the short term than they do over the long term.\nThat's historically been a portent of bad things to come.\u00a0Specifically, the yield on the U.S. government's 10-year bond briefly dipped below the yield on the two-year. And every time that has happened since the Second World War, a recession has soon followed.\nIt may be rare, but to\u00a0Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for R.W. Baird & Co., the yield curve inverting\u00a0makes perfect sense.\n\"I\u00a0don't think there's any mystery,\" he said in an interview.\u00a0\"It's because interest rates all over the world are plummeting.\"\n\"The Federal Reserve is going to have to come in and lower rates again, so the bond market is anticipating that.\"\nIf investors think the world's economy is lurching\u00a0towards\u00a0recession, it makes perfect sense that interest rate predictions are following suit. And so, too, does what's happening in the\u00a0investment that investors often run to in times of fear: gold.\nThe glittering metal touched a six-year high this week above $1,500 US as fearful buyers poured money into what's perceived as a safe haven.\n\"When investors are looking for somewhere to run, many view gold as an attractive option, particularly when the world's central banks also seem to believe the same,\" the analysts at RBC Capital Markets\u00a0wrote this week. \"Rate cuts are back in style and ...\u00a0global monetary policy is indeed gold positive.\"\nIt would be\u00a0ironic if central bankers' desire to stimulate the economy caused investors to park their money in an asset like gold that does nothing for the economy. But that's just par for the course in today's uncertain times, according to\u00a0author and portfolio adviser\u00a0Hilliard MacBeth.\n\"Moving into cash and gold is not what central bankers were anticipating when they pushed for zero rates,\" he said in a note to clients on Friday.\u00a0\"But in the strange world we live in today, expect the unexpected.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Oil price jump boosts Canadian energy stocks", "description": "Higher fuel prices for consumers expected", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/energy-markets-oil-stocks-1.5285560", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5194423.1561746355!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/oilpatch-spending-20180904.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 16, 2019 1:33 PM MT", "2019-09-16T21:30:45.986Z"], "source": null, "content": "Higher oil prices spurred by an attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities boosted the Canadian energy sector on Monday but are expected to result in higher fuel prices for consumers.\nThe index that tracks leading energy company share prices on the Toronto Stock Exchange closed up 9.25 per cent at 147.91 \u2014 but still down by 25 per cent compared with its 52-week high set last October \u2014 as U.S. benchmark oil prices finished the day ahead by more than 12 per cent.\nDouble-digit increases were posted by energy firms including Baytex Energy Corp.

What we're seeing now is a movement in the oil price, not just at the front end of the curve but also really out through calendar '20 and '21, which really just means we're seeing a bit of risk premium creep into the oil price,\" said Randy Ollenberger, managing director of oil and gas equity research at BMO Capital Markets.\nStronger global oil prices are expected to continue to be supported even if the Saudis are able to restore production quickly, translating into more cash flow for energy companies to invest going forward, he said.\nHigher oil prices could raise average gasoline prices in Canada by between five and 12 cents per litre over the next two weeks, depending on how long Saudi Arabia production is affected, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy.\nLast week, eight energy companies were dropped from the main Toronto Stock Exchange index because their market valuation had fallen below the minimum level for inclusion.\nThe cuts included Canada's two largest drilling companies \u2014 Ensign Energy Services Inc. and Precision Drilling Corp. \u2014 as lower producer spending has translated into fewer wells being drilled.\nAnalysts blame the lack of investor interest in Canadian energy companies on the uncertain future of pipeline access to markets, a factor cited by the Alberta government to continue to constrain crude production this year.\n\"Part of the irony is we could be producing a million barrels a day more by now had we had some of these pipelines, and that certainly would have helped deal with some of the lost volumes here with the outage,\" said Ollenberger.\nThe Saudi outage serves as a reminder to oil customers around the world of the political uncertainties in Middle Eastern countries, said Bob Schulz, a business professor with the Haskayne School of Business at the University of Calgary.\nThe situation will enhance the reputation of Canadian oil, he said, and may spur Canada's main customer, the United States, to redouble efforts to ensure stalled cross-border pipelines like Keystone XL are approved and completed.\nIn Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump said he had approved the release of U.S. strategic petroleum reserves \"if needed\" to stabilize energy markets. He later said expanding domestic energy output meant the U.S. doesn't need Middle East oil.\nIt remained unknown on Monday how long it will take Saudi Arabia to bring production back.\n\"A worst case scenario \u2014 with profound implications for the global economy \u2014 is a broader regional conflict that puts Gulf oil production, processing and transport in the crosshairs,\" said Bill Farren-Price, director of RS Energy Group, in an emailed statement.\nShort-term affects in Canada will likely be muted, said CEO Allan Fogwill of the Canadian Energy Research Institute, noting that other OPEC countries have surplus capacity they can bring on and oil will be brought out of storage.\nMore pipeline or rail access to markets is needed to allow growth in the Canadian energy sector, said Richard Masson, an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy.\n\"Higher prices are a good thing but most of what companies have been doing with their cash flow these days is paying down debt or buying back equity,\" he said.\n\"It should strengthen balance sheets and is probably good in terms of tax and royalty (revenue) but I don't think it has a meaningful change to investment levels or jobs.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Global shares hit record highs in festive cheer", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/global-markets-record-high-1.5409026", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5409031.1577453763!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/global-markets.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 27, 2019 8:38 AM ET", "2019-12-27T16:49:59.031Z"], "source": null, "content": "World stocks scaled record highs on Friday and oil prices stayed buoyant in a holiday-shortened week, as optimism grew that a U.S.-China trade deal would soon be signed.\nTraders returned from their Christmas and Boxing Day break to digest comments from Beijing that it was in close contact with Washington about an initial trade agreement.

And anyone trying to buy a Harley Davidson in Hungary was likely also keenly aware that there was some\u00a0funny business afoot.\nBut unless you happened to be a Canadian exporter of steel and aluminum\u00a0or a Mexican avocado farmer, it was perhaps easy to think the world of international trade was largely business as usual.\nNot anymore. Markets were whipsawed this week by the slow realization that the outlook for the world's economy isn't getting better\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it's getting worse. And while 800-point drops for the Dow Jones index tend to generate a lot of headlines, it's what's happening in some far more under-the-radar indicators that are the best signs of just how wacky the economy is getting.\nBond yields don't tend to get a lot of attention outside of the financial press, but their behaviour in recent weeks is perhaps the surest sign of just how topsy-turvy the global economy has gotten. Bonds are debt, issued by governments and companies, that come with an interest rate attached so that the people loaning out the money get a return over time.\nGenerally speaking, bonds are seen as safe investments, which is why investors only expect a few percentage points of return from holding them at the best of times. But the fog over the economic outlook is so thick at the moment that many borrowers are getting away with selling bonds offering a negative yield.\nAnyone buying that bond is willingly buying an investment that's guaranteed to lose money, but\u00a0investors are more than happy to buy it up \u2014\u00a0because the fear is that alternative investments will fare even worse.\nThat may sound great for anyone looking to buy a home in Copenhagen, but it's very bad news for the world's economy, says Paul Gardner, partner and portfolio manager of Avenue Investment Management.\n\"There's something around $16 trillion of bonds around the world dealing with negative interest rates,\" he said in an interview with CBC News this week. \"That's very\u00a0unhealthy ... just because it has\u00a0a feel of instability.\"\n\"You always want to have positive interest rates,\" he said. \"You want low, but you don't want negative.\"\nThose negative yields are filtering down into the economy in some truly jaw-dropping ways. A Danish bank this week started offering a negative yielding mortgage \u2014 meaning anyone who signs up will get money to buy a home, and then get a tiny interest payment in their account every month to help pay down the principal.\nAs much as one-quarter of all the government debt in the world is currently upside down. And\u00a0even the bonds that still eke out a tiny return are flashing red warning signs of their own.\nUnder normal circumstances, long-term bonds tend to pay out more than short-term ones simply because it's a lot easier to forecast the short term than the long, so a bond buyer demands a higher rate for a long term to offset the risk of that uncertainty.\nBut a funny thing has happened of late, in that yields have flipped \u2014 long-term rates are even lower than short-term ones, \u2014 which suggests investors have more confidence in the short term than they do over the long term.\nThat's historically been a portent of bad things to come.\u00a0Specifically, the yield on the U.S. government's 10-year bond briefly dipped below the yield on the two-year. And every time that has happened since the Second World War, a recession has soon followed.\nIt may be rare, but to\u00a0Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for R.W. Baird & Co., the yield curve inverting\u00a0makes perfect sense.\n\"I\u00a0don't think there's any mystery,\" he said in an interview.\u00a0\"It's because interest rates all over the world are plummeting.\"\n\"The Federal Reserve is going to have to come in and lower rates again, so the bond market is anticipating that.\"\nIf investors think the world's economy is lurching\u00a0towards\u00a0recession, it makes perfect sense that interest rate predictions are following suit. And so, too, does what's happening in the\u00a0investment that investors often run to in times of fear: gold.\nThe glittering metal touched a six-year high this week above $1,500 US as fearful buyers poured money into what's perceived as a safe haven.\n\"When investors are looking for somewhere to run, many view gold as an attractive option, particularly when the world's central banks also seem to believe the same,\" the analysts at RBC Capital Markets\u00a0wrote this week. \"Rate cuts are back in style and ...\u00a0global monetary policy is indeed gold positive.\"\nIt would be\u00a0ironic if central bankers' desire to stimulate the economy caused investors to park their money in an asset like gold that does nothing for the economy. But that's just par for the course in today's uncertain times, according to\u00a0author and portfolio adviser\u00a0Hilliard MacBeth.\n\"Moving into cash and gold is not what central bankers were anticipating when they pushed for zero rates,\" he said in a note to clients on Friday.\u00a0\"But in the strange world we live in today, expect the unexpected.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "When we were talking a lot about 'e-business' stocks 20 years ago", "description": "In 1999, some internet-related companies saw sharp drops in their stock prices", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/archives/when-we-were-talking-a-lot-about-e-business-stocks-20-years-ago-1.5237227", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Aug 06, 2019 1:08 PM ET", "2019-08-06T17:10:42.805Z"], "source": "CBC Archives", "content": "A roller-coaster analogy for the stock market?\nAn obvious pick, perhaps, but it's what The National went with when trying to describe what was happening in a certain segment of the stock market 20 years ago.\n\"Getting on the stock market can be a roller-coaster ride at the best of times.

The region has allowed residents to waive late payment charges on water and wastewater utility bills, as well as all other residential and non-residential accounts.\n\"There's no doubt that we are experiencing a significant shock right now,\" Regier told councillors, admitting the 2019 numbers might seem \"out of context\" given the current situation.\nBut, he said, the news going forward appears to be good.\u00a0\n\"Our historic performance through the last decade illustrates that Waterloo region is actually much better positioned than many other regions, similar regions, to recover in the years following the resolution of the COVID-19 situation,\" Regier said.\nNot so fast, warns Harry Kitchen.\nThat optimism might come from a good place, but doesn't have a strong foundation, cautions Kitchen who is a\u00a0professor emeritus of economics at Trent University.\u00a0\nHe says while things do look good for the region, it's unclear what the future will bring and it's much too soon to predict what Waterloo region will look like once COVID-19 passes.\n\"I don't think anybody really has a very strong idea of what is going to happen. This is totally unprecedented. We're facing changes that we simply can't predict and I don't think we've got any basis for projecting exactly what's going to happen,\" he said.\nMunicipalities are not allowed to budget for an operating deficit, Kitchen noted. To fund their budgets, they charge property taxes and user fees to generate revenue.\n\"Property taxes and user fees are the backbone of municipal finance,\" he noted.\nThe revenue stream from user fees has mostly dried up. When it comes to property taxes, he said in general about 20 per cent are from businesses while 70 to 75 per cent is from residential and the rest is from industrial. The tax rate of businesses tends to be higher than residential, so that means if businesses close or go bankrupt, that's a significant drop in tax revenue for the region.\n\"The same thing could happen for some residential properties where there's defaults on properties,\" he said, as people\u00a0ask\u00a0for financial forgiveness or deferrals.\u00a0\nHe said the region could dip into reserves, similar to a savings account, to make up shortfalls but\u00a0he notes reserves are not slush funds and are usually earmarked for particular purposes.\nWhat might happen in the coming weeks, Kitchen said, is the province may relax the rule that municipalities can't budget for a deficit. He said some critics say that shouldn't happen, but he thinks it would be a good idea, at least for a year or two.\nWhen asked if that could be a possibility, Ontario's Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Clark said the provincial government is willing to listen to the needs of municipalities as they deal with the impact of COVID-19.\n\"We understand that municipal revenues are impacted by the current situation. In addition to tracking response costs related to healthcare, we are encouraging municipalities to track other incremental costs related to COVID-19,\" Clark said in an emailed statement.\n\"We are monitoring the situation and will be working with [Association of Municipalities of Ontario] and our federal partners over the coming weeks and months to better understand the fiscal impacts on municipalities\u00a0and identify possible steps we can take to support our municipal partners.\"\nGenerally, Kitchen\u00a0says he believes Waterloo region is on good footing right now.\n\"There's no question that the Region of Waterloo and that entire area is one of the more prosperous regions and areas in Canada and it has been for some time,\" he said.\n\"Will they come through it? Well, Waterloo region, of course they will. They're one of the strongest regions in the province, or in the country, and they've got a tax base. How they use it is up to them. But they'll come through it.\"\nMary W. Rowe is president and CEO of Canadian Urban Institute in Toronto, which normally facilitates conversations between municipalities about best practices and is currently trying\u00a0to help them weather COVID-19. Part of that has been setting up websites to gather information about how cities are responding to the pandemic and encourage conversations about what's working and what isn't.\n\"Municipalities are the level of government that absorbs all of the direct impacts of this kind of a challenge,\" Rowe said. \"They are absolutely the front line.\"\n\"I think that what we're seeing, the phrase that I've been using, is that COVID has acted as a particle accelerator,\" she said. \"Where there was any kind of disconnection or dysfunction, that has just been exacerbated.\"\nWaterloo region, she noted, has a good group of key ingredients to help them through the pandemic, including strong anchor institutions like the universities and college, services including the LRT and local libraries and a tech sector that's adapting to the changing workplace landscape.\n\"[Waterloo region has] a lot of tacit knowledge as a result of having invested for years in post-secondary infrastructure,\" she said, adding the regional chair and local mayors \"have aligned seamlessly\" and are adapting to \"harness all the ingredients of your region.\"\nBut while the region may come away from COVID-19 in a good position, she says it doesn't mean things should return to normal.

There's still a lot that they \u2014 and we \u2014 don't know. But the picture they're painting for Canada's financial future\u00a0is already bleak.\nAt a minimum, the Conference Board of Canada is assuming that most industries across the country will be essentially shut down for at least six weeks.\nIf they take an optimistic view and assume that's enough to contain the outbreak, even that short term pain will make a major dent in the country's total output, a metric known as the Gross Domestic\u00a0Product, or GDP.\nShould this relatively mild scenario come to pass, Canada's economy would eke out a tiny 0.3 per cent growth for 2020\u00a0as a whole as things ramp up in the latter half of the year.

The economy shrank at an annual pace of 8.7 per cent at its worst stage, in early 2009 before rebounding starting in the spring.\n\"Brace yourself for some horrible data in the near-term, as there's little doubt that the second quarter will produce some painful and likely historic figures on ... economic contraction,\"\u00a0the economics team at TD Bank said in a note to investors.\nEconomists tend to focus on GDP in their modelling, but when you ask Canadian workers how they think the economy is doing, they tend to focus on whether they have jobs that pay the bills.\nIt already looks like the recession caused by COVID-19 will be one for the record books when it comes to joblessness.\nIn any given week, Canada gets about 45,000 claims for jobless benefits, according to the economics team at TD Bank.\nBut the numbers for\u00a0March 16-22 came in at more than 20 times that, with 927,000 Canadians tossed out of work in a single week.\nDavid MacDonald, an economist with Ottawa think-tank the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said those numbers are likely just the start.\n\"The situation is still moving rapidly: people who may have been employed and surveyed on Monday could easily have been laid off by Wednesday,\" he said. \"It's likely not until the April data is collected and released at the start of May that we will see the full picture of what happened in the second half of March.\"\nBy the time all is said and done, MacDonald thinks roughly two\u00a0million Canadians will at least temporarily lose their jobs in the current panic. That would cause the jobless rate to spike to more than 13 per cent.\nTD's forecast is only slightly more positive, predicting the rate to rise to nearly 12 per cent before hopefully levelling off to about half that by the end of the year.\u00a0\nBut that's only if the unprecedented steps being taken now do any good.\n\"If fiscal and monetary policies prove successful, and social distancing tactics gradually ease, the unemployment rate should level off after one to two months and quite possibly fall just as fast if workers are called back to work,\" the bank said.\nThe cure for the disease may be widespread shutdowns and social distancing efforts, but that underlines a fundamental paradox of the disease: the cure for the virus is precisely what makes the economy even sicker.\nAt least Canada's jobless rate was close to a record low before all this started.\nEven officials in Ottawa are willing to admit they're expecting a record-setting flood of job losses to hit home, and soon.\n\"We have enormous job losses right now,\" Finance Minister Bill Morneau told the Senate on Wednesday. \"We hope and expect it will be temporary.\"\nNot everyone is sure they will be.\nThe Canadian Federation Of Independent Business says its monthly measure of small business confidence fell to the lowest level in its\u00a032-year history\u00a0this week. Normally, a reading of 65 suggests an economy that's basically operating close to its full potential. But the CFIB's gauge fell\u00a0to a record low of 30.8 in March. That's lower than the 39 it hit in the depths of the 2009 financial crisis.\nRoughly 50 per cent of small businesses say they expect to lose workers this year. Only five per cent are planning to expand, according to the CFIB's\u00a0small business barometer.\n\"March 2020 has turned out to be a month like no other in Canada's economic history,\" said Ted Mallett, CFIB's chief economist.\nIf there's good news in these bleak numbers, it may be that the depth and breadth of the slowdown may be so sharp and sudden that it can't help but spur a big rebound.\nThis\u00a0recession is looking to be what economists described as \"V-shaped\" \u2014 meaning one that plunges quickly down and then quickly back up the other side. That differs from a \"U-shaped,\" which is slower and less dramatic in both directions, or even a dreaded \"L-shaped\" recession where the economy falls off a sudden cliff and never bounces back to its previous level.\nDoug Porter at Bank of Montreal notes that numerous countries have been through economic shocks as bad as the Canadian economy's current one. And they all emerged stronger on the other side.\nMexico's peso crisis of 1995, Russia's debt default in 1998 and South Korea the previous year during the Asian currency crisis all saw those economies shrink by more than 20 per cent.\u00a0\n\"In all three cases, activity bounced and forcefully within two quarters,\" Porter says.\n\"All different conditions, true,\" Porter said. \"But very rapid rebounds from hard stops have and can be done.\"\nIf a rebound is coming, it's likely to be fast. And stock market investors are tentatively showing signs of believing that could be the case. Since falling to its lowest level in more than a decade on March 23, the TSX has quietly jumped back up almost 20 per cent since then, including its best day in more than 43 years on Tuesday.\u00a0\nStock markets tend to peak before recessions start but they also tend to bottom before they end, Manulife\u00a0Investment Management said in a note to clients on Thursday. Which means anyone willing to buy in when things look this gloomy could be getting in on the buying opportunity of a lifetime.\n\"The economic data will get precipitously worse over the next month\u00a0but don't bother looking at that, it will only confirm what we already know,\" the money manager said. \"Rather, we believe now is the time to focus on the market fundamentals and start to take advantage of the valuation opportunities across asset classes as they present themselves.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/the-roaring-20s-1.5425427", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Lyft continues to post losses despite revenue growth", "description": "The ride-hailing company lost $664.2 million US despite posting revenue of $867.3 million", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/lyft-second-quarter-revenue-growth-1.5234685", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5039396.1551467091!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sask-ride-hailing-regulations-20181206.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 07, 2019 4:47 PM ET", "2019-08-07T20:47:30.295Z"], "source": null, "content": "Lyft is reporting strong revenue growth but deep losses in its second quarter, a trend that it has so far been unable to reverse.\nThe ride-hailing company on Wednesday posted revenue of $867.3 million US, up 72 per cent\u00a0from the same time last year.\nBut the San Francisco-based company lost $664.2 million in the quarter, which was worse than the $445 million loss that analysts polled by FactSet expected.\nMore than a third of the loss, or $296.6 million, came from stock-based compensation Lyft paid out after its IPO in March.

Not everyone believes it's a sure thing, but the probability goes up as the illness spreads.\nAt the start of the year, the odds of Canada cutting its rate\u00a0at the March meeting were barely one in 20. Even a\u00a0week ago, the odds of a cut were barely\u00a0one in six. But that was before the virus that causes COVID-19 started its spread around the world, infecting markets everywhere with something almost as dangerous as the pathogen itself: fear.\nBoth Canadian and U.S. stock markets are in correction territory, meaning declines of more than 10 per cent. Supply chains at technology companies like Apple\u00a0have been disrupted as Chinese factories shut down, making it impossible for manufacturers to get finished products to market.\u00a0\nAirlines have seen their ticket sales plunge\u00a0as consumers decide to stay home. Businesses around the world are cancelling conferences and other events that require people to meet face to face. And if coronavirus\u00a0becomes widespread here, many businesses will struggle with shortages of workers and supplies.\nAll things being equal, central banks raise interest rates when they want to cool down overheated economies. They cut when they want to stimulate an economy that needs a little warming up.\nFaced with the potential of a sickly economy because of coronavirus, central banks around the world are expected to try to flood the system with cheap\u00a0money in the hope that it's the shot in the arm the economy needs to get better.\u00a0\nChina, Brazil, Russia, the EU, Indonesia, India and Mexico have all cut in recent months.\nTypically in times of uncertainty, investors flock to the relative safety of the U.S. economy. But\u00a0the world's largest economy also is going to be dealing with the spread of coronavirus. And despite lowering rates three times in the past year, it's\u00a0not immune to the\u00a0trend toward lower rates.\u00a0\nTraders are pricing in effectively a 100\u00a0per cent chance of a U.S rate cut next month, and there's a 50/50 chance of up to two more cuts after that.\u00a0\nThose odds are three times\u00a0as high as they were as recently as Wednesday, before U.S. President Donald Trump appointed vice-president Mike Pence to head public health efforts to contain the virus' spread.\nThe U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve,\u00a0has been signalling for months that it thinks the\u00a0underlying numbers in the U.S. economy are strong, and telling investors not to expect any more rate cuts unless something drastic happens.\nReaction to the coronavirus suggests something certainly has. Even if the Fed is inclined to sit tight, it is under pressure to do something for the sake of looking like it is doing something.\n\"The Fed's desire to be data-dependent may capitulate to market sentiment,\" as Jon Hill, an interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets put it.\nThat goes for Canada, too. While most economists who study trends at the Bank of Canada expect the bank to stand pat next week, almost half of them think the bank should cut, according to a survey by rate comparison site Finder.com.\nBrett House at Scotiabank is among them. \"Our call\u00a0is for two cuts in 2020, which we've been saying since August of last year,\" he said in an interview. That call was based on underlying weaknesses in the economy, something that was borne out by Friday's GDP release that showed economic growth slowed to its slowest annual pace in almost four years at the end of 2019.\n\"And that was\u00a0all before the coronavirus,\" he said.\nSince that call, more than 40 major central banks around the world have moved to cut rates, he notes. \"If anything Canada has\u00a0been one of the tardiest to the [rate cut] party.\"\nOthers aren't sure the coronavirus will be enough to compel the bank to take action \u2014 yet. \"Although we think a certain degree of easing is warranted, two cuts priced by the end of 2020 seems somewhat unrealistic,\" CIBC's economics team said in a note this week.\u00a0\nThe bank thinks a cut is coming, but possibly not until the next meeting in\u00a0April.\n\"We are reluctant to pencil-in an additional cut as we don't know how long the associated uncertainty will last,\" CIBC said.\nSherry Cooper, chief economist with Dominion Lending Centres, says the panic in the stock market right now shows the central bank is under pressure to do something, even if it's just for the sake of doing something.\n\"None of this is good for psychology or the economy,\" she said.  \"The Bank of Canada meets next Wednesday, and clearly, their press release will address these issues. It's unlikely the bank will cut rates in response on March 4, but if the economic disruption continues, rate cuts could be coming by mid-year.\"\n"}, {"author": "Tony Seskus", "title": "Alberta's economic decline will be the 'most severe' the province has ever seen: RBC", "description": "Research firm says Western Canada will need to cut oil production by more than 10%", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/rbc-alberta-economic-forecast-severe-decline-1.5511032", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5194423.1561746355!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/oilpatch-spending-20180904.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 26, 2020 1:51 PM MT", "2020-03-27T00:39:17.243Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Alberta is poised to suffer the largest economic decline in Canada this year\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0most severe that the province has ever seen\u00a0in a single year, according to a new forecast from RBC Economics.\nIt says the collapse in oil prices has been a \"massive blow\"\u00a0for oil-producing regions of the country, including Alberta.

That portends diminished consumer confidence and likely lower auto sales.\n\"People aren't rushing out and saying, `Now is a good time to buy a car,'\" said Brian Collie, global leader for automotive with Boston Consulting Group. \"They're saying, `Let's wait. On hold.'\"\nEarlier this month, the consulting firm LMC Automotive lopped nearly four-million vehicles off its forecast for 2020 global sales \u2014\u00a0a 4.4\u00a0per cent decline to 86.4 million. For the U.S., the forecast dropped three\u00a0per cent\u00a0to 16.5 million.\nOthers see a gloomier outlook. Adam Jonas, a veteran analyst at Morgan Stanley, expects about a nine\u00a0per cent\u00a0decline in the U.S.\u00a0In an investor note, Jones warned that sales for the year could go as low as 14.5 million, \"driven by the potential demand shock that could stem from coronavirus fears.\" Last year's sales were above 17 million.\nJeff Schuster, a senior vice-president at LMC, noted that his firm's forecast was made early in the month and that conditions have worsened since then. It's likely, Schuster said, that LMC's forecast could be downgraded in the U.S. and globally.\nGarrett Nelson, senior equity analyst with CFRA, said auto sales in China are a good harbinger of what would happen as the virus spreads further in the U.S. and other countries. Sales in China fell 44 per cent\u00a0during the first two months of the year, including an 82 per cent\u00a0plunge in February, with much of the country on lockdown.\nKeeping factories open may also be a problem. Carmakers PSA and Fiat Chrysler are closing factories in Europe until March 27 due to COVID-19. PSA noted serious cases near its factories and said it has experienced parts supply disruptions and \"the sudden decline in the automobile markets.\"\nFord closed a plant in Valencia, Spain, for a week after three workers came down with the virus in a single day. Volkswagen also shuttered factories in Spain and Italy.\nFiat Chrysler said last week that a transmission factory worker in Kokomo, Indiana, had tested positive for the virus. His work area was scrubbed, and workers who had come in contact with him were sent home, but production continued.\nThe United Auto Workers union and the three Detroit automakers set up a task force to protect workers.\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.\nInitially, when the virus was just in China, it looked as though the auto industry would face a formidable parts supply problem. The area around Wuhan, the epicentre for COVID-19, is home to many auto plants with substantial parts exports.\nBut automakers had stocked up on parts in the fourth quarter ahead of a U.S.-China trade deal and before the Chinese New Year holiday in January, said Kristin Dziczek, a vice-president at the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think-tank in Michigan.\nIt's not clear yet whether that stockpile will help delay production halts or mitigate them until factories restart once the virus eventually ebbs, she said.\nDziczek cautioned that even a disruption of one part could depress some U.S. auto production.\n\"We need all the parts to make a car,\" she said. \"We can't do it with 99.9 per cent.\"\nOnce it became clear in January that the virus would be a serious threat, auto and parts makers established task forces and war rooms to locate other parts sources; ship parts quickly on airplanes; and conserve parts by limiting production to the more popular versions of each model. Continental, a German parts supplier, said it had more than 100 people working on coronavirus logistics.\nStill, factories were halted sporadically. Hyundai lost three days of production in South Korea in late February.\nAt an event early this month, General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the company was prepared to manage parts shortages in the U.S.\u00a0into late March. Since then, spokesman Jim Cain has noted since then that auto and parts plants in China have started to come back on line.\nBut Dziczek said that while production is starting to return in China, the virus is now affecting other countries that also make parts.\nAnalysts say some parts suppliers could face cash-flow problems if the virus continues to spread and sales and production fall.

The collapse of oil prices, however, presents a third crisis that is partly of our own making.\n\"Alberta's budget deficit this year may triple from $7 billion to almost $20 billion,\" the premier said, adding that we will soon face \"a great fiscal reckoning.\"\nThis isn't an exaggeration.\nWhile there remains a uniquely high degree of uncertainty right now, and both the premier's statement and my high-level analysis in this article should be seen in that light, there is no getting around the significant challenge that awaits.\nBut there are options. Alberta's economy and our budget can recover, but it will require hard choices and cross-party compromises that we too often resist.\nFirst, we should appreciate our current predicament. A $20-billion deficit is plausible.\nConsider three major sources of Alberta government revenue:\nIncome and Other Taxes: We were hoping for $23 billion this year. But a contracting economy and income losses from low oil prices together suggests nominal GDP may fall by 15 to 20 per cent. This means lower revenues \u2014 possibly $4 billion lower.\nInvestment Income: Alberta has large savings that generate returns. We were hoping for $2.6 billion this year, but\u00a0as anyone who has checked their RRSP recently knows, we're more likely to lose money this year. During the financial crisis we lost $1.9 billion. Today, losing $1 billion is possible, which would lower government revenue by $3- to $4-billion relative to our previous estimates. (Of course, how the market will perform\u00a0over the coming months is not known, and the government might book recent losses in 2019/20 instead.)\nResource Revenues: Alberta chooses to rely heavily on resource revenues to fund public services. And when energy prices fall, so do revenues. The government was hoping oil would fetch $58 per barrel this year; today it's less than $20. So instead of the $5.1 billion we were hoping for, we might see $2 billion (or less).\nWe could keep going, but these three items alone put us on track for a revenue hit of $11 billion. Add additional health-care spending of at least $500 million (possibly more) and other costs, and we're almost at a $20 billion deficit already, up from the original $6.8 billion.\nCombined with borrowing for capital projects and a smaller economy, we could be looking at a 20 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio \u2014 double our current level.\nThis short-term challenge is manageable, to be sure, and Alberta would remain the lowest-debt province.\u00a0\nThe trouble is, these fiscal challenges will continue for many years.\nOil prices are not projected to bounce back anytime soon.\nCurrent futures prices are roughly $20 to $30 per barrel lower than government forecasts by 2022-23. And to balance the books that year, the government was hoping for $8.5 billion in resource revenues. This is no longer in the cards. Not even close.\nBudget 2020 provides some clues of how bad it might be.\nThe budget reported \"high\" and \"low\" economic scenarios for 2022-23 that, roughly, corresponded to a $20 per barrel swing in oil prices (see page 73 of the budget). Such a swing may lower income tax and resource revenues by nearly $9 billion, they report.\u00a0\nThe shock we're facing today is slightly larger, so instead of a modest surplus by 2022, we may see a deficit of more than $9 billion.\nLet that sink in. After four years of significant spending restraint, we're on track for a larger deficit than the one we started with.\nThis is our fiscal reckoning. But, luckily, there are options.\nLet's start with the government's current policy: a freeze in program spending.\nWithout going into details, I updated\u00a0my own model of Alberta's budget to reflect most of what we know today from publicly available sources and display the results below.\nThe government's current fiscal policy suggests we'll balance four years later than planned: 2026 instead of 2022.\nThis is less than ideal.\u00a0\nAlberta would see $140 billion in taxpayer-supported debt, with interest costs of nearly $6 billion per year \u2014 or roughly triple our current amount. And, since prices and population will continue to grow, a freeze is effectively a nearly 30 per cent reduction in the inflation-adjusted per person level of spending. This would require a deeper reinvention of public services and is roughly double the government's previously planned restraint.\nBut there is\u00a0another side to the budget: Revenue.\nConsider a broad-based and efficient source of revenue like the sales tax. Alberta already has one, of course: it's called the GST. Except the federal government gets all of the revenue.\nAlberta could, if it wanted, raise the GST from its current five per cent and keep the incremental revenue (this is known as a harmonized sales tax, or \"HST\").\u00a0\nIf, starting next year, Alberta gradually phased in a four-point increase to the GST (which would be lower than any other province), then we'd be on track to balance the books by 2024. That would mean only two additional years of frozen spending, and would avoid roughly $20 billion in additional debt.\u00a0\nOf course, there are other revenue options.\nSome might prefer higher income taxes. Adding one point to all income tax brackets could add around $1.5 billion to revenues.\nSome might prefer pausing the corporate tax cut. This would add around $500 million.\nOthers might suggest Alberta take back carbon tax revenues from Ottawa. Once it reaches $50 per tonne, that would be $2.2 billion to Alberta \u2014 and if we kept rebates to lower income households, it might net $1.5 billion.\nWhatever the tool, to balance by 2024 with frozen spending requires we raise total revenue by roughly eight per cent. And if, after 2022, we allow spending to keep pace with population and inflation, revenue would have to rise by 15 per cent.\nEven with such increases, Alberta would still enjoy the lowest taxes in the country \u2014 by an extremely wide margin \u2014 but it would be challenging nonetheless.\nAll provinces are facing revenue shortfalls and spending pressures. And Ottawa will likely offer support. But it matters less than you might think.\nOttawa could cover some (or even most) of the direct COVID-19 related expenditures by extending the disaster assistance program to cover pandemics (it currently does not). If Canada supported provinces with funding in line with what the United States delivered for states, for example, Alberta might see over $2.5 billion this year.\nOttawa could also cover a share of revenue declines through a reformed Fiscal Stabilization Program (which Alberta has long demanded). If it fully acceded to Alberta's request for reform, Alberta might see $3 billion more this year.\nThere's a strong case to be made for such support, since it's cheaper and easier for the federal government to borrow and smooth out shocks like COVID-19 than it is for provinces. There are also many options for reform, from removing the current cap on payments to more fundamental reform.\u00a0\nBut even though these dollar amounts are large, and helpful for provincial balance sheets, such federal support would barely nudge Alberta's daunting longer-term trajectory.\nAlberta's fiscal reckoning is of our own making. We cannot look to Ottawa to fix it.\nThere are real political challenges with spending restraint and new taxes, to be sure. And there's no easy option. But cross-party compromise and a whole-of-budget approach to tackling this challenge is the best way forward.\nGovernment and opposition parties must both re-evaluate their approach to fiscal policy. And Albertans must give them space to do so.\u00a0\nAfter the dust from the health crisis settles, we'll need to have an open and honest discussion about our budget and our future. Our fiscal reckoning may look bleak, but we have options. We just need to choose wisely from among them.\nThis column is an opinion.

Governments are pushing out a lot of money\u00a0as markets remain volatile, and every day brings something new.\nBut for now \u2014 at least until things change \u2014\u00a0Cost of Living\u00a0wants to try and answer some of your questions about what's happening, money-wise.\nQuestions came in via social media and email about topics ranging from gas prices to government debt.\nMultiple listeners wrote and called into the show asking about increased government spending. While many experts consider a jump in spending\u00a0necessary right now, a question that comes up is: how worried should we be about all the extra debt being taken on?\nThere are aspects to the current financial situation that could be considered good news in the midst of a crisis.\nCanada is going into this situation with the lowest amount of debt, relative to the size of our economy, of any G7 country right now. This means there is capacity to borrow and spend right now.\u00a0\nAdditionally, with interest rates low right now, the cost to service debt is lower than, say, 1990 when interest rates were around 13 to 14 per cent. Interest payments in the 1990s were much higher, leading to political decisions to cut spending to address debt.\nEconomists such as Ron Kneebone caution that while deficit spending is necessary right now, it shouldn't last any longer than it needs to.\n\"It's quite possible that [if] the deficit will be $180 billion next year, the year after that it might be $90 billlion. And we might be saying, 'Oh, that's great they cut it in half,'\" said the economist\u00a0with the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy. \"But it's still a $90 billion deficit.\"\nKneebone told\u00a0Cost of Living\u00a0host Paul Haavardsrud\u00a0it may take three or four years to unwind all the deficit spending that results from the COVID-19 crisis.\nOne listener wrote in asking\u00a0what could happen to public sector pension plans, given the beating that markets have taken in the past few weeks.\n\"Given the governmental-defined benefit pension plans, backed by taxpayers, what does the future look like for both pensioners and taxpayers for the short and medium term?\" asked Martin from Calgary.\nOne of the biggest public sector plans in Canada, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, was fully funded coming into 2020, which means its assets either matched or were greater than its liabilities.\nThe Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, or OMERS, was almost\u00a0fully funded at 97 per cent.\nBut as for whether public sector pensions, generally speaking, will need a taxpayer bailout due to the current crisis \u2014 it all depends on the economy in the coming months and years.\nPension expert\u00a0Keith Ambachtsheer told\u00a0Cost of Living\u00a0executive producer Tracy Johnson that while markets are volatile right now, that will eventually end.\n\"It isn't going to be next month, but hopefully it is next year,\"\u00a0said Ambachtsheer. \"If that actually happens, the prices will come back. That 20 per cent that's lost, it'll come back.\"\nAccording to\u00a0Ambachtsheer, money flooding into the economy from the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve will need somewhere to go. That could mean it goes into the stock market, which could buoy pension investments.\n\"A good stock, with a dividend yield \u2026 that looks pretty good to me longer term,\" said\u00a0Ambachtsheer, who is predicting the current volatility will be about a one-year phenomenon.\nWhy aren't gas prices matching the drop in oil prices\u00a0commensurately, Tige\u00a0of Edmonton asked us on\u00a0Twitter.\nWhy is the price of gas at the pumps not following the proportional downward trend of WCS or similar commodities?\nGas prices are hitting very low points right now. Gas prices in Edmonton, at the time of Tige's tweet, were around 58 cents per litre. A steep drop, to be sure, but perhaps not proportionate to the fall in oil prices.\nBroadly speaking, taxes and sales margins make up the difference. Wholesale prices for gasoline in Edmonton, for example, were around 25 cents per litre at the time. Add another 23 cents in taxes, plus about a dime in margin for the gas retailer.\nAnd, perhaps bear in mind, an Edmontonian wondering about 58 cents per litre of gas could result in cries of anguish from coastal neighbours in Vancouver.\nSolange in New Brunswick wrote to Cost of Living\u00a0asking whether the money in her savings and chequing accounts is safe.\nOn the one hand, there is a simple answer to this question. In Canada,\u00a0deposits in most personal savings and chequing accounts are protected under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation. Up to $100,000 per account in most scenarios is protected in the event of a bank failure.\nOn the other hand, if Solange is concerned about the overall viability of Canadian banks, that is trickier to answer given current economic turmoil. However, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the Bank of Canada watch\u00a0and monitor\u00a0the chartered banks in this country carefully, and when the pandemic began, Canadians did not see a \"run\" on the banks.\nIf the kind of financial chaos that the coronavirus situation caused for markets did not result in bank upheaval, Canadians could be reasonably confident that banks should remain stable.\nClick \"listen\" at the top of the page to hear this\u00a0segment, or\u00a0download\u00a0the\u00a0Cost of Living\u00a0podcast.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Barrick to pay Tanzanian government $300M to settle mining dispute", "description": "Deal marks end of long impasse between Tanzania and Acacia Mining, which firm took over", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/tanzania-barrick-mining-1.5328975", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5328985.1571676576!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/barrick-tanzania-20191021.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 21, 2019 1:28 PM ET", "2019-10-21T17:28:30.586Z"], "source": null, "content": "Barrick Gold Corp. announced a deal with the government of Tanzania that will see the gold miner pay $300 million US to settle all outstanding tax and other disputes over its mines in the African country.\nThe Toronto company and Tanzania are also to share the future economic benefits from the mines on an equal basis and create a dispute resolution framework.\nOn the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday, Barrick fell as low as $21.95 Cdn, down 63 cents or 2.8 per cent from a close of $22.58 on Friday.\nThe slide came despite the deal announced on Sunday matching the company's key expectations as revealed in an announcement in July, analysts pointed out.\n\"The announcement \u2026 by Barrick is not too dissimilar to the prior release and provides incremental details on the path forward,\" said Andrew Kaip, of BMO Capital Markets in a report.\n\"Though we see the transaction as slightly dilutive to Barrick, it brings with it clarity and the potential to add value over time.

And in some cases, they're actually rising.\n\"Usually\u00a0when the Bank of Canada cuts rates like they have, by 1.5 percentage points in a month, you can expect all rates to fall,\" said\u00a0James Laird, president of mortgage brokerage CanWise Financial and\u00a0co-founder of\u00a0Ratehub.ca.\n\"At first they did ...\u00a0but a week and a half ago, we started to see a shift [and] now we are seeing our\u00a0lenders increase rates. Every two days, we get a different lender saying we are going up by point one, point two.\"\nMortgage rates tend to move up and down based on a number of factors, but one of the main ones is the costs borne by the lenders themselves.\nPeople tend to think that when someone walks into a bank to ask for a home loan, if they are approved, the bank just takes the cash out of some safe at the back, hands it over to the borrower and charges them interest over time to make a profit.\nBut, in fact, banks don't keep that much money just lying around either \u2014\u00a0they typically borrow it themselves\u00a0and make money on the spread between how much they're charged for it\u00a0and how much they turn around and charge the borrower for it.\nThe cost of financing a variable rate loan is strongly influenced by the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, because banks tend to set their own prime lending rates based on whatever the central bank's rate is.\nThe bank has cut that rate by 150 basis points \u2014 1.5 percentage points \u2014\u00a0in the past month\u00a0to try to make it as easy and cheap as possible for people to borrow, spend and invest to stimulate the economy that has been waylaid by COVID-19.\nA few short weeks ago, it wasn't hard to find a variable rate mortgage for something around prime minus one \u2014 a full percentage point below whatever a bank's prime lending rate was at the time.\nBut a funny thing has happened since then. Prime lending rates have gone down more or less in lockstep with the Bank of Canada's moves, but those discount rates for mortgages have evaporated.\n\"About half of the savings have been passed along and half kept by banks for a higher margin,\" Laird said.\nThe reason they're doing that is the same as why\u00a0stock markets plunged\u00a0and governments rushed to\u00a0implement lockdowns on millions of people: fear.\n\"Lenders are saying, 'Hold on a second,'\" Laird said. \"If a million people are going to lose their jobs and unemployment is going to rise, maybe we should build in a bit of a risk premium to our\u00a0pricing to account for possible defaults for this new money we are lending.\"\nWhen the economic outlook was more clear, banks were happy to cut rates as low as possible to try to gobble up market share. But now, they're saying \"We better earn a bit more of a spread on this money because these things might default at a higher rate than we're used to,\" Laird said.\nThe impact isn't dramatic. Laird says a few weeks ago, the best mortgage rates were something in the range of between two and 2.5 per cent. Today, they're between 2.5 and three per cent because, as he puts it, \"they are demanding a higher risk premium than what they typically do.\"\nOthers aren't quite so diplomatic.\n\"It's total garbage,\" Marcus Tzaferis with mortage brokerage Cannect said. \"It's complete profit taking.\"\nWhile banks borrow at a rate slightly above that government rate,\u00a0Tzaferis says \"the spread between their cost of borrowing and some of their five-year fixed mortgage rates is still around 250 points, which is highly profitable for them.\"\nFixed-rate loans aren't pegged to the Bank of Canada's rate and are instead more influenced by the bond market. And there, too, Tzaferis says what's happening in the market doesn't reflect what's happening behind the scenes.\nLenders finance fixed-rate loans on the bond market, where yields have fallen to record lows in the current COVID-19 crisis. The yield on a five-year government of Canada bond bottomed out at around 0.37 per cent this month and is currently hovering just over 0.5 per cent.\u00a0\nThough banks must pay a credit spread on bond yield and that may be widening, Tzaferis says they are also widening their profit margins. Most fixed-rate mortgages are currently going for around three per cent, he points out.\nThe difference for borrowers adds up fast. Laird calculates that a theoretical buyer who put down a 10 per cent deposit on a house costing $500,000 before this crisis would likely have been able to get a mortgage rate of 2.6 per cent, which would make their payment $2,102 a month.\nIf all three rate cuts since then were to be fully factored into that loan, that borrower's monthly payment would fall\u00a0as low as $1,769 a month\u00a0\u2014 that's\u00a0$333 per month or $3,996 per year on their mortgage payments, compared to what they were paying less than a month ago.\nThe overwhelming majority of first-time buyers opt for fixed-rate loans because they like the security of knowing that their monthly payment is guaranteed to not increase.\u00a0The banks know this, Tzaferis says, and it could soon have a heavy cost for borrowers.\n\"They're using this as an opportunity to lock people into big fat juicy\u00a0and profitable five-year mortgages,\" he said. \"When their rates drop those consumers are going to have massive penalties to break them ...\u00a0tens of thousands of dollars.\"\n\"It's absolutely insanity,\" Tzaferis\u00a0said. \"This is a totally manufactured crisis to profit.\"\nLaird and Tzferis both say that the current situation can't last forever. Economists are already predicting that the COVID-19 recession is likely to be incredibly sharp, but it's anyone's guess\u00a0how long it will go on for.\nLaird says the best sign that things are getting back to normal will be when the big banks start to act in a way that seems paradoxical.\nBanks are raising their rates right now because they feel just as uncertain about the future as Canadians do. Once that cloud lifts, they'll want to start lowering rates again, and \"they won't build in that uncertainty premium like they are now,\" said Laird.\n\"As confidence returns, you'll see rates fall.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Bombardier joint venture lands $427 million US contract to build high-speed trains in China", "description": "Montreal-based company holds 50% stake in Bombardier Sifang Transportation Ltd.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bombardier-high-speed-trains-china-1.5413003", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5119652.1556797263!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bombardier-20190502.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 02, 2020 12:58 PM ET", "2020-01-02T18:24:01.359Z"], "source": null, "content": "Bombardier Inc. says its joint venture in China has won a US$427-million contract to build train cars for the world's longest high-speed rail network.\nThe successful bid by Bombardier Sifang Transportation Ltd.

Especially when rates are already so low.\nThe bigger the loan, the bigger the difference it makes.\nIn the wake of Tuesday's surprise rate cut by Jerome Powell at the U.S. Federal Reserve, the equally large cut by Stephen Poloz at the Bank of Canada yesterday was not as astonishing as it would have been if Canada had moved first.\nAs BMO Chief Economist\u00a0Douglas Porter said yesterday, just\u00a0after the Bank of Canada cut, the world has changed in a very short time.\n\"As recently as 10 days ago, any move by the bank today would have been seen as a long shot,\" said\u00a0Porter.\nWhile generally approving of\u00a0new monetary stimulus, especially in light of the economic effects of recent rail blockades and the struggling oil and gas sector, the BMO economist\u00a0noted the dangers to Canadians already mired in debt.\nThough\u00a0it is hard to dispute that making money cheap has the effect of boosting the value of assets, whether houses or stocks, many economists worry that monetary policy may be\u00a0too\u00a0blunt an instrument to try to solve an economic problem that\u00a0requires finesse.\nCanadian monetary policy specialist Louis-Philippe Rochon\u00a0is one of those economists who worries that rate cuts now are not an effective solution to the economic problems created by the global outbreak of COVID-19.\nRochon said\u00a0he knows he's part of the economic problem as he considers whether, as a diabetic, he can afford to travel to Rome next month where he is supposed to be visiting professor.\n\"It's a tough decision to make,\" he said.\nBut he has trouble seeing how lower interest rates will fill empty planes, replace parts cut off by factory shutdowns or convince people to go\u00a0out to restaurants or\u00a0theatres and feel comfortable taking public transit. Cheap money\u00a0will not stop people from getting sick.\nMaking such a hefty cut in rates may create other problems, he said, including reducing the capacity to reduce rates in the future should the continuing impact of coronavirus\u00a0lead to the kind of serious\u00a0financial\u00a0breakdown\u00a0warned of by OECD chief economist Laurence Boone.\nJust about everything about the coronavirus and its economic impact remains up in the air, from how long the disruption will last, to how profoundly it will affect the global economy.\nCertainly,\u00a0businesses are being hurt. A glance at the headlines in business newspapers and wire services yesterday showed\u00a0many economic problems were virus-related. The lumber market threatened by falling demand, the virus pushing the aviation industry toward crisis, worries over how many employees could work remotely if the virus worsens, to name\u00a0 just a few.\nBut as Rochon points out, an across the board interest rate cut\u00a0is a handout to everyone who has borrowed money;\u00a0among U.S. corporations or Canadian consumers, that's just about everyone.\nThat's why, everything else being equal, a cut in interest rates has an immediate positive effect on stock prices and real estate. When the carrying cost of loans declines, assets are worth more.\nCommentators have suggested that Tuesday's sharp decline in stocks despite the Fed cut showed everything else was not equal. Lower rates, they said,\u00a0were not enough to save the economy from coronavirus shocks and the sudden move by the Fed only increased financial\u00a0worries.\nThe\u00a0sudden rise in stocks on Wednesday, a day after the Fed cuts,\u00a0may have more to do with Joe Biden's wins on Super Tuesday,\u00a0reassuring shareholders that the previous left-leaning\u00a0leader of the Democratic pack, Bernie Sanders, was not going to take some of their wealth and give it to the poor.\nWhile strapped Canadians burdened by loans and mortgages may be thrilled by the prospect of lower interest payments, there may be negative consequences. Yesterday, fresh indicators showed the Canadian real estate market may be\u00a0once again overheating, as the Toronto Real Estate Board reported a sharp increase in sales and prices.\nThe cut in borrowing costs both here and in the U.S. may be merely storing up problems for an eventual reckoning.\nWhile Poloz is usually\u00a0reluctant to say he is following the Fed, perhaps one of the best reasons for yesterday's\u00a0move is that the impact of a large and sudden\u00a0asymmetry in rates between Canada and its biggest trading partner would have only added to the economic impact of the coronavirus.\nLater today, the Bank of Canada governor will have a chance to explain why he decided a cut in interest rates was essential in a Toronto speech\u00a0followed by questions.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Bombardier joint venture lands $427 million US contract to build high-speed trains in China", "description": "Montreal-based company holds 50% stake in Bombardier Sifang Transportation Ltd.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bombardier-high-speed-trains-china-1.5413003", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5119652.1556797263!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bombardier-20190502.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 02, 2020 12:58 PM ET", "2020-01-02T18:24:01.359Z"], "source": null, "content": "Bombardier Inc. says its joint venture in China has won a US$427-million contract to build train cars for the world's longest high-speed rail network.\nThe successful bid by Bombardier Sifang Transportation Ltd.

[that] they don't necessarily believe that fossil fuels are the future of energy.\u00a0\nAnother component is also the Saudi government itself, and fears that the Saudi government may make decisions about the company that could negatively impact its profitability. So it's hard to necessarily know why people might choose not to invest in it.\nAramco, as you said, has been privately held by the Saudi royal family. But now when it becomes a public company, should we expect that there'll be a level of transparency now that wasn't available to people before?\nThere's definitely going to have to be more transparency.\u00a0\nThe Saudi royal family and Aramco as a company were notoriously opaque \u2014 to the extent that people really wondered how much oil did this country and this company even have?\u00a0\nThey were very, very close-lipped ... about how much oil was in their reserves. And in fact, in the early 2000s, there was a book written which questioned the Saudi's entire statements about their oil reserves and said, you know, the Saudis are lying about this, and they really have a lot less oil than they're letting on.\nThat has been proven to be not true, but it still had a big impact on the mindset of people who are interested in oil and gas companies. And a lot of people are very circumspect about the Saudis.\u00a0\nSo what's interesting is when Aramco reveals the IPO prospectus, people are interested to see what this prospectus is going to show and just how open they're going to be about their finances and the oil reserves and how they spend their money.\nIt's only two per cent of the company's valuation, but is there any reason for human rights activists to believe that investors might be able to leverage their shares to force the royal family to improve human rights in the kingdom?\u00a0\nI don't think there's any possibility of that happening at all. Particularly because the way that this company is structured, investors will really have absolutely no say over how the company acts.\u00a0\nSo it's highly unlikely that this will change the Saudi royal family's behaviour towards its citizens at all.\nThat's an important point for investors to consider because people should be aware that if a financial institution that they are engaged in invests in this IPO, that the money is going to support the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and whatever decisions that kingdom makes \u2014 and they're not going to have any say over it.\u00a0\nDo you think that'll be pressure put on the financial institutions, like [Royal Bank of Canada] here in Canada, because of environmental or human rights concerns when they invest in Aramco?\nAbsolutely, on both respects.\u00a0\nThere are a lot of banks that are involved in this IPO because it's so large and there's so much money involved. They need to have a lot of banks involved, and yes, RBC is one of those banks that is involved in the IPO.\u00a0\nIn the political climate today, with climate change taking up such a big portion of political activism today, I would not be surprised to see people really reacting very strongly to this.\u00a0\nPeople are reacting to companies like Exxon and Chevron and Total and these other big oil companies. Well, Aramco is even that much larger than these companies and pumps that much more oil.\nAramco is going public. Why is this happening right now?\nThat's a really good question. And it's not something that the CEO or the chairman really answered fully.\u00a0\nI believe that this is happening right now because there is political pressure on the shareholder, or the Saudi government, to deliver this for its citizens.\u00a0\n[It's] also because they want the money to make investments in other areas, and until they IPO Aramco, they can't monetize those shares.\nThis Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.

Confirmed infections globally have reached about 3.2 million, including one\u00a0million in the U.S., but the true numbers are likely much higher because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.\nThe latest figures on Americans applying for unemployment benefits come out Thursday, with economists estimating perhaps one in six workers, or nearly 30 million people, have lost their jobs over the past six weeks.\nMario Franco, who worked at a McDonald's at a highway rest stop in Darien, Conn., for 26 years, rising to night manager, was laid off in late March. The 50-year-old said he has little savings and now relies on a food bank and union donations.\n\"They didn't give us any notice,\" he said. \"They didn't tell us about it.

That is nearly half the global workforce of 3.3 billion.\nIt expects the equivalent of 305 million full-time jobs to be wiped out in April-June.\nMoves toward reopening economies are progressing in fits and starts. China and South Korea, early epicentres of the pandemic, both reported only four new cases on Thursday. The tiny island of the Maldives reported its first death.\nPushing to reopen the country, U.S. President Donald Trump was allowing federal physical distancing guidelines to expire Thursday and even saying that he plans to travel to Arizona next week.\nMany economists are skeptical that the U.S. economy will bounce back quickly later in the year, noting that the virus could flare up again or consumers and employees might be too worried to return to business as usual.\n\"The virus has done a lot of damage to the economy, and there is just so much uncertainty now,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Dispatches from the small businesses struggling with COVID-19 and the economics of creating a vaccine", "description": "Hear first-hand from Canadians facing economic problems due to the outbreak", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/dispatches-from-the-small-businesses-struggling-with-covid-19-and-the-economics-of-creating-a-vaccine-1.5503847", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5504636.1584724554!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vaccines-and-small-businesses.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 20, 2020 1:17 PM ET", "2020-03-20T17:17:31.341Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "As jurisdictions across Canada and around the world impose restrictions to try and curb the spread of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, small businesses are also feeling an impact.\nWith Canadians staying home to either self-isolate or practice social distancing, many businesses cannot or should not keep their doors open.

Instead, verbal briefings were the standard. (With the notable exception of Jerome Kennedy, personal note-taking was also not common.)\u00a0\nThese were people who were charged with making decisions \u2014 critical decisions, with billions of dollars at stake \u2014 and yet some were not as prepared as one might assume, or expect.\nWe don't know what lessons are being learned at Confederation Building, but it did seem striking, then, that Premier Dwight Ball\u00a0and Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady assembled the media Tuesday to release the Muskrat Falls commission's final report, without giving journalists so much as a few minutes to read it first.\u00a0\nThis may not strike many readers as particularly unusual, but it is. On budget day, for instance, reporters have several hours to sift through a collection of documents to makes sense of it, while also being able to ask technical questions of experts. (More and more, however, journalists covering the budget are doing this while a cascade of politicians come before them to spin what they want the coverage to be about.)\nTechnical briefings are also common when, say, a new government policy is unveiled, or something like a new report on crab stocks. DFO did one of those just last week.\nWith the damning Muskrat Falls report, though, that kind of prepared rollout of information did not happen.\u00a0Instead, journalists were given a report that is highly complex, and which takes time to digest, while two politicians made verbal comments ahead of their reading. Right away, Ball and Coady set the narrative \u2014 noting, in particular, that the matter was being referred to the police.\nNo surprise, then, that this comment was a highlight of media coverage on announcement day. It's a classic bit of political framing.\nThe report itself (you can read all six volumes here) is captivating, sobering reading (as of this writing, I'm still reading it), and not at all likely to soothe the nerves of anyone nervous about Newfoundland and Labrador's economic future.\nMuskrat Falls is entwined with a dismal and worsening fiscal picture for the provincial treasury.\nThe latest report from the auditor general's office, in December, put the government's net debt at $15.4 billion. Julia Mullaley, who just this week moved from the auditor general's office to run Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corp., noted that works out to $29,250 per person, a new record high.\nIt's not just Muskrat Falls that has been racking up the debt. For every single year for the last seven years, we've been putting more debt on the proverbial provincial credit card. Those consecutive deficits add up to $6.4 billion of extra debt.\nMullaley's last report came out just a week after a delayed provincial fiscal update that revealed\u00a0government revenues had fallen sharply, to the tune of an extra $392 million.\n\"Dumpster fire\" is a metaphor that's being used frequently to describe the state of things with the government's finances.\nWhat's concerning is that latest news about the current shortfall and the cumulative debt were both revealed before two crises that emerged in the new year: a collapse in oil prices and COVID-19.\nJudge determines $12.7-billion dollar hydro mega-project was a misguided mistake; oil slightly above $35.00 per barrel; schools run out of hand sanitizer\u2026 and we might be headed to the polls before July. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlpoli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#nlpoli</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ukD2qRyNKU\">pic.twitter.com/ukD2qRyNKU</a>\nThey're not unrelated, although the cliff-like drop in oil prices involves OPEC and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. (If you ever want to get a sense of how comparatively insignificant N.L.'s production is, reading about games that oil giants play will do the trick.)\nThe day before the Muskrat Falls commission report was released, oil prices took their single biggest jump since the Gulf War.\nThe day after the report was released, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. There were signposts of the impact of the novel coronavirus everywhere: all of Italy basically shuts down, Dublin cancels its St. Patrick's celebration, the NBA suspends its season, Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson are diagnosed \u2026 the list goes on.\nAs for oil prices \u2026 well, now. The downward pressure on oil is inextricably linked to the roaring bear that has dominated the stock market for the last three weeks, culminating in what's already been tagged as \"Black Monday\" earlier this week: the biggest single-day drop since the 2008 banking crisis.\nBrent crude, the type of oil that Newfoundland and Labrador uses for budgeting purposes, dropped like a rock going over a cliff. In last April's budget, the government picked $65 as the average price per barrel of Brent crude. (The December update knocked that down to $63.20.)\nWhat will this year's budget put oil at?\nWell \u2026 we're not going to know for a while. The governing Liberals are focused now on electing a new leader, and we won't know whether it will be Andrew Furey or John Abbott until May 9. The budget was pushed back until a new leader, premier and possibly cabinet are in place.\nGiven how many things are being cancelled this week, maybe that's not entirely a bad thing.\nBut in an alley full of dumpster fires, it feels odd that we don't have a plan, at least for now, on how to handle a cluster of crises.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "SNC-Lavalin shares fall to lowest since 2005 as company announces plans to exit many lines of work", "description": "Firm withdraws previous guidance for earnings because of uncertainty", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/snc-lavalin-shakeup-1.5219969", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5119826.1556806112!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/snc-lavalin.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 22, 2019 9:53 AM ET", "2019-07-22T21:59:16.158Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canadian engineering giant SNC-Lavalin announced a major organizational change on Monday, one that will see the company possibly get out of the oil and gas business and stop pursuing one kind of contracting work entirely.\nBefore stock markets opened on Monday, the company announced it will take a $1.9 billion writedown on its quarterly earnings to reflect the changes it plans to make, including a pivot back toward the kind engineering work that it sees as key to its future.\nSNC says it plans to get out of the business of what it calls \"lump-sum turnkey contracting,\" which is work that a contractor such as SNC would do for a fixed cost to a customer, with the company on the hook for delays and cost overruns. That made up about 43 per cent of its revenue last year.\nIn light of the overhaul, the company says it has withdrawn all of its previous guidance for its earnings this year, because of the uncertainty of the new strategy.\nSNC shares fell to just over $23.55 a share in early trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange Monday, the lowest price in 14 years. When markets closed, shares were trading at $23.80, down 6.7 per cent.\nAn example of such a contract would be the\u00a0R\u00e9seau express m\u00e9tropolitain\u00a0transit system currently under construction around Montreal. SNC says it will live up to the obligations of that deal, but plans to pursue fewer contracts like that in the future.\nAnother such contract would be a $260 million deal at the world's largest open-pit copper mine in Chile, a deal that the mine's owner Codelco\u00a0recently tore up, accusing SNC of failing to live up to its obligations.\n\"Lump-sum, turnkey projects have been the root cause of the company's performance issues,\" the company's interim chief executive officer Ian L.

We will continue to follow closely the company's decisions over the coming weeks.\"\nThe investment community was split on the news.\nDesjardins analyst\u00a0Benoit Poirier said he thinks \"the negatives more than offset the positives.\"\nHe doubts a sale of the oil and gas business would fetch\u00a0much, since it has fallen so far.\n\"We question the value that it could unlock from a potential divestiture given the division's disappointing performance,\" he said in a note to clients.\u00a0\"Bottom line, we would not be buyers of the stock this [Monday] morning as we prefer to wait for further improvements in the company's financial results.\"\nTD analyst\u00a0Michael Tupholme, however, is among the optimists.

But even then it wasn't a done deal. Musyj says just when\u00a0the Chinese connection would think he had a deal\u00a0it would\u00a0fall through. Sometimes he would discover\u00a0a person at a company he was dealing with was trying to sell stolen masks.

Musyj said the Chinese government kept changing the rules governing procurement of the items, at one point demanding\u00a0a letter from the federal government proving they were buying for a hospital.\n\"[Liberal Windsor-Tecumseh MP] Irek Kusmierczyk\u00a0gave us his signature on his letterhead and that worked,\" said Musyj.\nBut the man was trying to buy quantities that were too small. Musyj\u00a0eventually made a connection that would bring his global efforts closer to home.\u00a0He happened to be talking to a lawyer in Toronto, who, when he found out where the Chinese connection was, connected\u00a0Musyj\u00a0with an Ontario company \u2014\u00a0his client \u2014\u00a0that\u00a0was also purchasing large\u00a0quantities of masks at the same company.\nWATCH | What you need to know before wearing a mask:\nMusyj had his connection in China give the $5 million to the company \u2014\u00a0SteriPro \u2014\u00a0who WRH\u00a0also deals with to sterlize equipment.\nSteriPro then brokered the deal which resulted in the purchase of 500,000 masks.

About half of the total survey of 1,200 respondents was conducted before stock markets and oil prices plunged (March 2-8).\u00a0 The other half of the interviews took place after this economic shock (March 9-18). Growing concerns about the pandemic continue to shape public attitudes. As with all polls, this one is a snapshot in time. CBC News \u2014 and the public opinion experts consulted on this survey research \u2014 believe the data offers some valuable insights into Albertans'\u00a0attitudes about the economy and politics just at the moment when COVID-19 changed everything.\nThis is the second article to come out of this research. Read the previous article here:\nCBC News poll: Albertans were already anxious. Then, the floor dropped out\nMass layoffs, closed offices, shuttered shops, plunging oil prices and the need for the federal and provincial governments to implement aggressive supports for businesses and individuals \u2014\u00a0COVID-19 has sparked mass economic upheaval.\nBut even before all that, Albertans were hurting financially.\nJanet Brown Opinion Research, on behalf of CBC News, was polling Albertans just as the economic reality of the coronavirus was becoming apparent.\nIt's an interesting snapshot in time of how people in our province were feeling.\nAnd, when it comes to their finances, many were already feeling worried, even before the worst of the pandemic had hit.\nThe poll found 51 per cent of people believed their household's financial situation was worse now than it was last year, while 35 per cent felt things were about the same. Just 13 per cent said their finances had improved.\nBack in 2018, we asked the same question. At that time, 37 per cent of Albertans had said their financial situation had worsened, while 44 per cent said it was about the same and 18 per cent said things had improved.\nCompare the two polls, taken two years apart, and you see a 14-percentage point increase in the proportion of people who feel their finances are worsening.\nThese personal finance findings mirror the concerns Albertans have for the wider provincial economy, which also showed increased pessimism.\nThe new survey results also show that people in this province are finding it harder to pay their bills, with 48 per cent of Albertans saying it is either very or somewhat difficult to meet their monthly expenses.\u00a0\nThis is an increase of six percentage points from the 2018 survey.\nThose numbers are disquieting to see in a province that is used to leading the country in wage earnings. The pain, however, is not being felt evenly across Alberta.\nIn the chart below, you'll see only very slight regional differences. Albertans living outside the two major cities are just a little more likely to say they are worse off and having more difficulty with their expenses than people in Calgary and Edmonton.\nThere is also only a slight gender gap, when it comes to expenses.\nBut it is in age, income, and education where the differences are most stark.\u00a0\nOf those whose household income is less than $60,000 a year, 61 per cent say their financial situation has gotten worse over the past year.\nFor those with household incomes of $120,000 or more, only 44 per cent say it's gotten worse.\u00a0\nThat's a 17-point difference.\nThis gap jumps to 43 points when you look at the proportions of those same two groups who say they are having difficulty meeting their monthly expenses (71 per cent of households making less than $60,000, versus 28 per cent of those making $120,000 or more).\u00a0\nIn terms of education, there is a big gap in financial concerns between those with and without a university degree.\u00a0\nFifty-six per cent of those without a university degree (people holding either a high school diploma or less, or only some post-secondary education), say their financial situation has worsened.\u00a0\u00a0\nCompare that to 46 per cent of those with a bachelor's degree and 41 per cent of those with a graduate or professional degree.\u00a0\nThe patterns are also complex when it comes to age.\u00a0\nOlder Albertans are more likely to say their financial situation has gotten worse than younger Albertans \u2014 59 per cent of those aged 45 to 64, and 54 per cent of seniors. Compare this with only 41 per cent of those aged 18 to 24.\u00a0\nHowever, college-age Albertans are more likely than any other age group to say they are having trouble meeting their monthly expenses.\u00a0\nSixty per cent of those aged 18 to 24 are having difficulty getting through the month. Compare that to 46 per cent of those aged 25 to 44. It's 49 per cent for those aged 45 to 64. For seniors, it's 44 per cent.\nThis difference could be explained by life-cycle effects.\u00a0\nCollege-aged Albertans are either in school or just starting their careers. They do not have much purchasing power or savings to begin with, and one cannot lose what one doesn't have. That also means they have fewer financial resources to fall back on when they lose their job or cannot find a job \u2014 a familiar refrain in Alberta over the last few months.\nConversely, even if older Albertans are earning less, or have lost value in their investment portfolios, they likely have more savings that can shore up lost income, at least for now.\nThe poll also asked Albertans how they expect their household\u00a0financial situation to change over the next year.\u00a0\nForty per cent expect it to get worse. Thirty-seven per cent expect it to stay the same, and twenty per cent actually expect it to get better.\nRemember, this is data from early to mid-March, before social distancing, before restaurants and bars started closing their doors, and before the oil patch began laying off workers.\u00a0\nIt was already a pretty bleak picture\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the proportion who have negative expectations now (40 per cent) is almost twice the proportion that had negative expectations in 2018 (22 per cent).\nIt has been two weeks since Albertans answered our questions.\u00a0\nSince then, the global economy has received an epic shock, oil prices have dropped to historic lows, and over two million Canadians have applied for employment insurance.\nWe expect the answers to these questions will continue to change as the economic repercussions of COVID-19 on businesses and individuals evolve. We will explore that in follow-up research we plan on conducting in the coming months.\nMethodology:\nCBC News' random survey of 1,200 Albertans was conducted using a hybrid method between March 2 and March 18, 2020 by Edmonton-based Trend Research under the direction of Janet Brown Opinion Research. The sample is representative along regional, age, and gender factors. The margin of error is +/-2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For subsets, the margin of error is larger.\nThe survey used a hybrid methodology that involved contacting survey respondents by telephone and giving them the option of completing the survey at that time, at another more convenient time, or receiving an email link and completing the survey online. Trend Research contacted people using a random list of numbers, consisting of half land lines and half cellphone numbers. Telephone numbers were dialled up to five times at five different times of day before another telephone number was added to the sample. The response rate among valid numbers (i.e. residential and personal) was 13.2 per cent.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Cargojet Inc. shares surge on deal with Amazon to grow partnership", "description": "The company's shares were up $14.88 at $105.55 in morning trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cargojet-signs-deal-with-amazon-1.5257547", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5257551.1566572272!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cargojet-amazon-20180823.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 23, 2019 11:01 AM ET", "2019-08-23T20:29:13.983Z"], "source": null, "content": "Shares in Cargojet Inc. shot to a record high Friday after the company announced a new deal with Amazon.com that could see the online retailer acquire a stake in the company that provides overnight air cargo services.\nThe company's shares opened up more than 20 per cent before closing up $11.66, or 12.86 per cent, at $102.33 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\nAmazon already uses Cargojet's charter aircraft services to move packages from Amazon warehouses to distribution centres for final delivery, but the deal announced Friday is designed to encourage it to use the network even more.\n\"The commercial relationship the Cargojet team continues to build with Amazon has now allowed us to further strengthen and align our long-term strategic commercial interests,\" Cargojet chief executive Ajay Virmani said in a statement.\n\"Our continuous commitment to provide value-added services enables us to earn all of our customers' trust as the leading overnight air-network operator.\"\nUnder the agreement, Mississauga, Ont.-based Cargojet will issue warrants to Amazon for variable voting shares that will vest based on milestones of business that Amazon gives Cargojet.\nThe first tranche will allow Amazon to buy up to 9.9 per cent of Cargojet's variable voting shares at an exercise price of $91.78 per share.

The loonie was worth about 70.5 cents compared to the US dollar after falling by more than one per cent on Tuesday.\nA month ago, North American oil prices were above $50 US per barrel for West Texas Intermediate (WTI), but those same barrels are\u00a0now changing hands at around $27\u00a0US each, after falling about six per cent on Tuesday. That's a direct hit on the loonie because of the size and importance of Canada's oil industry to Canada's economy\u00a0and the amount of the commodity that is exported daily.\nThe plunge in crude prices may not be over, either.\n\u00a0\"We're expecting a fall in the price of WTI to around $23 per barrel and we expect it to stay there until the second half of this year,\" said Stephen Brown, Canada economist with Capital Economics.\u00a0\"That will push the loonie down a bit more.\"\nBrown anticipates the Canadian dollar will fluctuate around 67 or 68 cents until the middle of the year, unless major oil producing countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia decide to restrict the amount of oil supplied to the market.\nThe amount of uncertainty around the globe has lead to a rush by investors and borrowers to get their hands on American dollars. The amount of available greenbacks internationally has tightened recently, which is increasing its value. That's yet another reason for the loonie losing value to its neighbour currency south of the border.\n\"We could certainly see the Canadian dollar soften a little bit more in the short run,\" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank.\n\"It's very difficult to predict exactly what is going to happen in these markets because fundamentals don't typically matter an awful lot. The volatility and other considerations are really driving markets generally and currency markets specifically,\" he said.\nThe loonie actually seems a bit undervalued right now, according to Osborne,\u00a0but until there is a better sense of the economic damage within Canada and internationally from the coronavirus, it's difficult to predict.\n\"The run of events we've had recently with emergency rate cuts from the [U.S] Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada ... it is not a particularly kind for forecasters at the moment.\"\nThere is one group of Canadians, however, for whom the falling loonie is good news: farmers\nThat's because most Canadian farmers sell crops priced in U.S. dollars. Many of those prices have fallen over the last few months because of the coronavirus, so the corresponding drop in the loonie will mitigate that somewhat once their harvests are converting back into Canadian dollars.\u00a0That's especially helpful right now because\u00a0many farmers are still struggling to transport their fall harvest to market because of backlogs with the railways.\n\"The lower dollar does help offset some of the negatives in the marketplace,\" said Tom Steve, general manager with Alberta Barley. \"It does make Canadian wheat or\u00a0canola or any other commodity a little bit more attractive financially for the buyer.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "U.S. corporate insiders selling shares at fastest pace since financial crisis a decade ago", "description": "Investors watch for signs of whether insiders put more or less money into their own companies", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/insider-selling-1.5269918", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5270367.1567621297!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/facebook-trading.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 09, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-09T09:14:33.815Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Insiders at U.S. corporations are selling shares at a pace not seen since before the financial crisis a decade ago.\nInsiders are people who work as directors or senior officers of companies, whose compensation often includes things like stock options and common shares\u00a0so they have a vested financial interest in the companies for which\u00a0they play key roles.\nBecause they are so fully invested and have access to data about how their companies are\u00a0performing before the general public does, some investors believe valuable insights can be gleaned by watching whether insiders are putting more or less of their own money into them.\nIf that theory holds water, one message has been\u00a0coming in loud and clear of late: sell.\nAccording to research firm TrimTabs, in the month of August insiders at American companies were\u00a0selling, on average, about $600 million worth of shares in their own companies a\u00a0day (all figures US).\nFive times this year already they've sold more than $10 billion worth of stock\u00a0in a single\u00a0month. The last time the markets saw that much selling that many times in a year\u00a0was in 2006 and then again in 2007 \u2014 right before the stock market imploded in late 2008.\nAnalyst Winston Chua with TrimTabs says there's nothing necessarily alarming about insiders cashing in, but it's certainly \"not a very positive sign.\"\n\"It can be a bad sign of lack of corporate confidence.\"\nIt's also quite telling to note where much of the selling is taking place: tech stocks.\nInsiders at technology companies, including the so-called FAANG\u00a0stocks \u2014 an acronym\u00a0for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google \u2014 have been some of the biggest sellers. That could be a sign they think\u00a0the impressive years-long run-up in the share prices of those companies\u00a0is over.\nData from Canadian investment firm INK Research shows that Amazon insiders have sold $2,862,703,598 worth of shares in the company through July and August \u2014 three times the amount of any other company.\nA good chunk of that was by founder Jeff Bezos, who was possibly selling shares to abide by the terms of his divorce agreement with wife\u00a0MacKenzie, from whom he split earlier this year.\nBut other Amazon insiders have also been selling. And while the company may comfortably sit\u00a0atop the insider selling leaderboard, other tech companies are on the podium.\nFacebook insiders have sold a net of $377,471,675 worth of their company's stock;\u00a0Apple insiders\u00a0$61,942,104; and Netflix insiders $31,264,279, all since Canada Day.\nINK president Ted Dixon tabulates that U.S. firms are seeing, on average, 55 net buys by insiders for every 100 sells at the moment. That's\u00a0not as low as the 30-per-100 seen earlier in the year\u00a0but still considered low by experts \u2014 suggestive of an insiders'\u00a0market that is, on the whole, getting out.\n\"You're seeing a lot of profit-taking in the U.S.,\" Dixon said in an interview.\nDixon says it's not necessarily\u00a0a broad-based sell-off, since a number of sectors are actually seeing a lot of buying \u2014 particularly the hard-hit industrial and energy sectors\u00a0in both the U.S. and Canada.\n\"We've seen a significant amount of insider [buying] activity\u00a0in the oilpatch, which suggests\u00a0we are nearing the worst of it for the sector,\" he said. \"Stock valuations have priced in a lot of bad news.\"\nBut buyers trying to time the market bottom of those sectors\u00a0are masking brisk selling activity in other areas.\u00a0\nStill, Dixon isn't among those who thinks insider selling is a surefire predictor of bad things to come, since insiders may sell\u00a0stock for all sorts of non-calamitous reasons \u2014 from paying taxes, to settling estates, as\u00a0Bezos is doing, to calling in some cash to put to work in other investments.\nWhich is why he pays more attention to\u00a0the buying, rarer though it may be at the moment.\n\"There can be many reasons insiders sell,\" he said, \"but usually when they buy it's for one reason: they think they can make some money.\"\nInstead of being a warning of a major stock slump about to happen, Dixon views the current surge in insider selling as a sign that the rules have changed.\nTechnology stocks had a great run:\u00a0investors did well to simply buy and hold them regardless of performance.

Canada will serve as its financial adviser and notes that it has not set a timeframe for completion of its strategic review.\n\"The nature, timing and outcome of the strategic review process will be influenced by, among other things, the resolution of the Company's regulatory compliance issues with Heath Canada,\" CannTrust said in a statement on Wednesday.\nShares of CannTrust on the Toronto Stock Exchange closed up 8.8 per cent to $3.04 on Wednesday. Still, even with the uptick, the company's stock has shed more than 50 per cent of its value since CannTrust first disclosed Health Canada's findings on July 8.\nThe announcement comes about a week after the Vaughan, Ont.-based company terminated its chief executive Peter Aceto with cause and demanded the resignation of board chair Eric Paul after a board committee's investigation into unlicensed growing at its Pelham, Ont.-facility unearthed new information.\nRobert Marcovitch, board member and chair of its special committee tasked with determining what transpired, was appointed as interim CEO of CannTrust.\nWhen asked about potential asset sales, the former U.S. sports executive said in an interview on Tuesday that CannTrust is \"exploring all options\" for the company.\n\"There are a broad range of scenarios that we are reviewing in every aspect of the business,\" Marcovitch said. \"And as we continue to evolve, and upon completion of our investigation and when advised by Health Canada, we will be prepared to move forward with whatever scenario is best suited.\"\nHealth Canada discovered during an unannounced inspection in late June that the pot firm was growing cannabis in several rooms before receiving the appropriate government licences to do so and seized several thousand kilograms of cannabis from those rooms.\nCannTrust disclosed the regulator's findings in early July and has since voluntarily halted all sales and shipments as the federal health regulator continues its probe, the outcomes of which could include suspension or termination of its cannabis licences and fines up to $1 million. It has also said the production in five unlicensed rooms took place between October 2018 and March 2019, before it received licences for those rooms in April 2019.\nThe company submitted its official response to Health Canada's finding of non-compliance on July 17, and the regulator has said it \"will thoroughly review the information submitted and will take it into account in its decision making process.\"\nTamy Chen, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said it is unclear whether CannTrust's review of strategic options will result in a sale of the company given the ongoing potential legal liabilities, which also includes several class action lawsuits.\n\"We believe the Niagara greenhouse would provide value to LPs that are relatively behind on their production ramps,\" she said in a note to clients.\n\"The Vaughan facility would provide processing capacity that includes extraction and packaging. However, if Health Canada ultimately revokes the licences at these facilities, the sale of these assets would likely be expedited at a deep discount.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Google parent, Alphabet, just became trillion-dollar company", "description": "Some fund managers say they're wondering if now is the time to cash in", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-trillion-dollar-company-1.5429960", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5225501.1564087921!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/earns-alphabet.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 16, 2020 5:00 PM ET", "2020-01-17T13:51:28.665Z"], "source": null, "content": "As Google-parent Alphabet Inc became on Thursday the fourth U.S. company to top a market value of more than $1 trillion, some fund managers\u00a0holding its shares are wondering whether now is the time to cash in on the stock's extraordinary gains.\nShares of the Internet search giant are up nearly 17 per cent over the last three months, outpacing a broader rally in the S&P 500 index over the same period by 6 percentage points.\nShort interest in the stock, a measure of how many investors are betting on a price decline, is at 1 per cent, near a 52-week high for the company and higher than competitors such as Microsoft and Facebook, according to Refinitv data.\nAlphabet joins Apple, Amazon.com and Microsoft as the only U.S. companies to hit $1 trillion in market value.\n\"Google is a stock that won't get you fired,\" said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds who hasn't added to his current Alphabet position since the first quarter of 2019. \"Will I be able to double my money in this stock from here? I'm not sure about that.\"\nAlphabet's shares are among a small group of stocks found in the top holdings of both mutual funds and hedge funds, two types of institutions whose investing styles tend to be markedly different, a Goldman Sachs analysis showed. That could leave it exposed to volatile price swings if sentiment suddenly changes.\nDespite those concerns, many investors are finding it hard to say goodbye. The 28 per cent climb in Alphabet and the performance of other technology and tech-related stocks helped money managers post big gains in 2019, making it difficult for many to justify cutting their exposure even as they fret over the implications of its run-up.\nErnesto Ramos, portfolio manager of the BMO Large-Cap Growth Fund, has held onto his shares, betting that Alphabet's exposure to online advertising will eventually justify its above-average valuation. Alphabet trades at 26.6 times future earnings, compared with 18.5 for the S&P 500.\nScott Goginsky, a portfolio manager of the Biondo Focus fund, has held off adding to a longstanding position over the last year, concerned that the company's costs are likely to increase due to its efforts to pre-empt any additional regulatory measures from Washington. That could cut into the margins of businesses like YouTube if it needs to hire additional workers to vet user-posted content, he said.\nAlphabet is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 3. In its latest report, the company missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue expectations. That news did little to dent investors' bullishness on the company: Alphabet's stock retreated briefly on the report, only to resume its climb several days later.\nBearish investors, however, can point to Amazon.com, which saw its market value fall below $1 trillion after its streak of record profits ended in July. Shares of the company are down nearly seven\u00a0per cent over the last six months, compared with a 10 per cent gain in the S&P 500 overall.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null,

year, including $902,438\u00a0to its president\u00a0after the province's investments managed to post a two\u00a0per cent gain, despite significant declines in global stock markets.\nVestcor is the Fredericton-based investment firm set up by the province to manage what has become $16.9 billion in funds, including retirement savings for provincial civil servants, teachers and most hospital workers.\nVestcor also invests pension money for the University of New Brunswick and the City of Fredericton and handles hundreds of millions of dollars set aside by NB Power to deal with the eventual decommissioning of the Point Lepreau nuclear generating station\u00a0and its stockpile of nuclear waste.\nAccording to its latest annual report,\u00a0Vestcor posted a 2.08 per cent gain on investments in 2018 \u2014\u00a0less than the rate of inflation \u2014\u00a0but significantly better than pension plans across the country, many of which bled money during the year thanks to turbulent stock prices.\nIn a letter attached to the annual report, Vestcor's chairman Michael Walton said it was \"gratifying\" that the organization was able to post gains in what he called \"the generally negative financial market environment\" of 2018.\nIn February, the Royal Bank's Investor and Treasury Services division reported that Canadian defined benefit pension plans overall lost 0.7 per cent of their value in 2018, placing Vestcor's result in the top tier of performances nationwide.\nThat helped fuel another boost in employee performance bonuses, which have grown significantly at Vestcor in recent years.\nVestcor's long-time president John Sinclair saw his pay package in 2018 hit a new high of $1.39 million, a 9.5 per cent increase over 2017.\nSinclair's base salary is $351,389 and, although Vestcor guidelines show the upper target for executive bonuses allows for another 130 per cent on top of that, Sinclair's bonus was once again well above that upper range.\nHe earned $902,438 in bonuses in 2018 \u2014 what Vestcor calls \"incentive pay\" \u2014\u00a0 just under 257 per cent of his base salary.\nIt's at least the fourth year in a row Sinclair's bonuses have exceeded his salary by 200 per cent or more.\nOther Vestcor executives earning bonuses in excess of 130 per cent of their base pay in 2018 include chief investment officer Jonathan Spinney, who was awarded bonuses of $466,628 (190 per cent of his salary), vice-president Daniel Goguen, who earned $344,476 on top of his base pay (161 per cent), and vice-president James Scott, whose bonuses totalled $328,891 (143 per cent).\nBonus payments at Vestcor have doubled over the last four years and, in 2018, were expanded to cover all employees\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not just those involved in making investment decisions.\n\"This change provides further alignment with the performance of our clients and ensures we continue to be able to attract and retain talent while competitively keeping pace with other similar service providers in our industry,\" wrote Walton in the annual report.\nVestcor defended\u00a0bonus payments as a way to reward strong performance and attract and retain\u00a0talented employees.\u00a0It also noted\u00a0the practice is common in the investment field.\nHowever,\u00a0Vestcor has never explained why the range it sets for employee bonuses of between 30 and 130 per cent of base pay is routinely exceeded by its top executives.\nVestcor does claim that its senior executives have beaten their investment targets by a combined $567.1 million over the last four years, including by $171.6 million in 2018 \u2014\u00a0the basis of the elevated bonuses.\n"}, {"author": "David Thurton ", "title": "'Secret' memo outlines tools the finance department and Bank of Canada

"source": "CBC News", "content": "An internal memo addressed to federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau in August outlined a range of fiscal and monetary policies the Liberals and the Bank of Canada could employ in the event of \"economic shocks\" \u2014 a range that includes\u00a0lowering interest rates even further and relying on Employment Insurance.\nThe August memo, marked \"secret,\" was released to CBC last month through the federal Access to Information Act. It's leading some economists to call on the government to prioritize some tools over others, and to consider at least one unprecedented economic strategy.\nThe unredacted portions of the memo don't cite any specific recession warning signs\u00a0\u2014 but the document does note that, since the 1970s, Canada has experienced four significant recessions, one per decade. Canada's last recession happened in 2008-09, triggered by the U.S. housing bubble.\n\"Of note, Canada has never experienced a significant recession that was not also suffered by the United States,\" the briefing note says.\n\"On average, since the 1970s, recessions in Canada resulted in the equivalent of 550,000 job losses and a 4 per cent decline in real GDP.\"\nNow, the fallout from the United Kingdom's protracted political brawl over leaving the European Union, trade disputes between the U.S and other countries and the ongoing protests in Hong Kong have some business analysts\u00a0predicting economic turmoil.\nThe\u00a0latest GDP figures\u00a0show Canada's economic growth in the third quarter slowed due to a drop in exports. Statistics Canada reported last week that Canada's real gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 1.3 per cent in the last three months, compared with 3.7\u00a0per cent in the previous quarter.\nThe briefing note gives Morneau an overview of\u00a0the tools he and Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz could use in the event of an economic downturn. They include\u00a0reducing interest rates below zero\u00a0\u2014 so-called \"negative\" interest rates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0increasing government spending, offering more grants to businesses and households and increasing the money supply through quantitative and credit easing.\nThe memo outlines the \"proposed sequencing of policy tools should Canada experience a recession.\" The details are blanked out in the document obtained by CBC News because, since they contain advice by or for\u00a0a government institution or cabinet minister, they are exempted from access laws.\nEconomists who spoke with\u00a0CBC News said the Department of Finance and the Bank of Canada can't expect the playbook they used the 2008-09 recession to work next time.\nConference Board of Canada Chief Economist Pedro Antunes said strategies such as lowering interest rates (already at record lows) and quantitative easing weren't as effective as expected during the last downturn \u2014 and won't help pull Canada out of the next economic downturn, either.\n'Quantitative easing' involves\u00a0central banks buying assets\u00a0such as government and corporate bonds from commercial banks and financial institutions, increasing the supply of money in the system. The goal is to lower interest rates and leave financial institutions flush\u00a0with cash, which (in theory)\u00a0should allow them to lend more to stimulate economic activity.\n\"We really didn't see that having a big impact globally or in Canada, in terms of driving investment,\" Antunes said. \"It was more of a consumer-led kind of recovery.\"\nAntunes and other economists said stimulus backfired in the last recession: instead of expanding their businesses and hiring more people, businesses seemed to hoard the injection of new money created through the monetary policy of central banks.\nAlthough the briefing note touches on this point, Antunes\u00a0said he would have liked to see infrastructure investment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which spurs private sector\u00a0spending and job creation\u00a0\u2014 play a more prominent role in the government's recession toolkit.\nThe Fraser Institute, however, argues that since it takes years for infrastructure projects to get built, they're not that useful\u00a0in fighting recessions. The centre-right think tank points out that, before workers are hired and the first shovel hits the ground, such projects have to go through feasibility studies, design changes, legislative funding allocations\u00a0and consultations with Indigenous communities, provinces, territories and municipalities before they even make it to tender.\n\"I think the evidence is overwhelmingly clear that it's almost impossible to do that in a short period of time,\" said Jason Clemens, the Fraser Institute's executive vice president. \"And so, by the time those projects get shovels in the ground, the recession is over.\"\nThe Liberal government isn't helping matters by racking up back-to-back deficits, which could tie its hands when the next recession hits, Clemens said.\nThe sections of the briefing note that are not blacked out say nothing about how\u00a0the Liberals would manage deficits and debt during a recession.\nClemens said the government should rely on automatic stabilizers like Employment Insurance \u2014 which ramps up spending when the number of jobless Canadians increases\u00a0\u2014 to keep the economy on an even keel.\nBut David Macdonald, an economist with the\u00a0Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives,\u00a0said EI doesn't always help the people who need it most because some Canadians \u2014 the self-employed and workers who don't receive enough hours \u2014 don't qualify for benefits.\nThat's why he and at least one European economic think tank are calling for an \"unprecedented\" response to the next recession: central banks, working with finance ministers, giving money directly to businesses or citizens. Governments typically deliver such benefits to citizens, not the Bank of Canada.\n\"Everyone gets $100 or $200 a month, or lower-income families get more and upper-income families get less,\" Macdonald said.\nEconomists acknowledge this \"helicopter money\" concept is an extreme form of economic stimulus. Still, it's been suggested by former U.S. Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke as a strategy to fight deflation.\n\"This is something that's starting to be discussed but hasn't been implemented,\" Macdonald said. \"But I think these are the types of things that the Bank of Canada is certainly thinking about going into the next recession.\"\nEconomist and columnist Erica Ifill\u00a0notes the toolkit doesn't seem to have anything to say about the sorts of\u00a0targeted regional strategies the government or the Bank of Canada could undertake to stimulate regional economies.\n\"I don't see in the briefing note the economic position of the West and any analysis around that,\" Ifill said. \"I'm really concerned with the West suffering, as they are right now, that the federal government is not looking at them as a specific case.\"\nIfill is calling on both the federal government and the Bank of Canada to consider economic stimulus packages tailored for Canada's regions.\nA Department of Finance spokesperson downplayed the significance of the memo, saying that economic growth in Canada remains stable\u00a0and unemployment is low.\n\"This note provides an update on the department's work on the general mechanics of the federal government toolkit to respond to potential slowdowns in the economy,\" said ministerial spokesperson Pierre-Olivier Herbert.\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Tesla shares soar 40% in 2 days as euphoria sets in \u2014 and short sellers get squeezed", "description": "Company has quadrupled in value since summer of 2019", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-shares-tuesday-1.5451222", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5357632.1580843101!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/germany-tesla.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 04, 2020 2:07 PM ET", "2020-02-05T15:41:59.862Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Tesla shares are soaring for the second day in a row after the electric car maker sold more cars than analysts thought it would, prompting investors to pour money into the stock at a record pace.\nTesla shares closed at $887\u00a0US apiece on Tuesday, a level that means the company has more than doubled in value since the start of 2020.\nInvestor enthusiasm over the company's prospects began last week, when on Wednesday the company said it\u00a0expects to sell 500,000 vehicles this year, an increase of about 50 per cent from last year's level.\nThe company closed out January with its stock price at just over $650 a share. But exuberance kicked in this week as the stock has since gone up by 20 per cent on Monday and another 13 per cent on Tuesday. The buying appears to have been prompted in part by news in last week's earnings report that the company has now turned a profit for two quarters in a row.\nProfitability is nice to see, but Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management in Toronto, says there's nothing in Tesla's underlying numbers that can justify the current market price.\n\"I wish we owned the stock but we don't participate in manias,\" he said in an interview. \"People are only buying this stock because it's going up in price \u2014 there's no way to justify the valuation.\"\n\"It reminds me of the dot-com boom,\" he said.\nAt current prices, Tesla is worth roughly $150 billion. That's more than U.S. automakers GM, Chrysler and Ford are worth combined, even though that trio sells more cars in two weeks\u00a0than Tesla does in an entire year.\nTesla may well be a \"great\" company with \"amazing\" products that people want to buy, but that doesn't mean the stock isn't wildly overvalued before the current run, and even more so now.\n\"Hype and momentum have taken over,\" he said. \"You're buying it with your eyes closed and your brain turned off.\"\nThe shares may be being gobbled up by investors who are big believers in the company's prospects.

He's said in the past that\u00a0short selling should be \"illegal\"\u00a0and urged stock regulator the SEC to crack down on the practice.\nOn Monday, with the short squeeze already underway, he tweeted three fire emojis\u00a0\u2014 a veiled reference to his glee at his critics getting burned.\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\nA short squeeze is definitely a factor in the company's meteoric journey this week, but the effect of that should be temporary.\nA prolonged move higher requires more than just temporary reasons, and it's not difficult to find analysts who are convinced the company's rise is just the start of a long journey higher.\nLast week's earnings show the company\u00a0has now posted a small profit for two quarters in a row, which is causing some investors to think the hyped-up company is finally starting to live up to its promise.\n\"Investors are now starting to believe that Tesla can make mass-volume electric vehicles, and automakers, battery makers and suppliers can make money from electric vehicles,\" Samsung Securities analyst Cho Hyung-ryul said in a note to clients Tuesday.\nBillionaire investor Ron Baron, whose firm holds a nearly 1 per cent stake in Tesla, says the company is on its way to $1 trillion in sales within the next decade. That would be about 50 times\u00a0the roughly $20 billion in revenue it took in last year, a figure that would turn Tesla into \"one of the largest companies in the whole world,\" he told financial news channel CNBC on Tuesday.\nBut Baskin's Schwartz is still unconvinced. \"You can't come up with a valuation on Tesla right now that makes any sense,\" he said. \"It's pricing in every single thing that may go well in the future without pricing in anything that could go wrong.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Dow at record above 27,000 as U.S. rate cuts look likely", "description": "Powell's testimony to Congress indicates key rate could be cut in July", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stocks-thursday-powell-1.5208175", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5208205.1562859992!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/off-the-charts-earnings-preview.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 11, 2019 11:54 AM ET", "2019-07-11T21:09:35.619Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Dow Jones industrial stock index hit record territory above 27,000 points Thursday, as U.S. Federal Reserve\u00a0chair Jerome Powell reiterated\u00a0the central bank is prepared to cut interest rates to support the economy.\nIn testimony before the Senate banking committee on Thursday, Powell pointed to the U.S.-China trade war and signs of a global slowdown as reasons the Fed might have to cut rates at the end of July.\nThe Dow closed at 27,088, up 227\u00a0points, mainly on the strength of tech stocks.\nThe broader Standard & Poor\u00a0also flirted with record territory above 3,000, before closing at 2,999, up from 2,993 at the end of\u00a0Wednesday.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 6.48\u00a0points\u00a0after sinking from near its technical high.

But exuberance kicked in this week as the stock has since gone up by 20 per cent on Monday and another 13 per cent on Tuesday. The buying appears to have been prompted in part by news in last week's earnings report that the company has now turned a profit for two quarters in a row.\nProfitability is nice to see, but Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management in Toronto, says there's nothing in Tesla's underlying numbers that can justify the current market price.\n\"I wish we owned the stock but we don't participate in manias,\" he said in an interview. \"People are only buying this stock because it's going up in price \u2014 there's no way to justify the valuation.\"\n\"It reminds me of the dot-com boom,\" he said.\nAt current prices, Tesla is worth roughly $150 billion. That's more than U.S. automakers GM, Chrysler and Ford are worth combined, even though that trio sells more cars in two weeks\u00a0than Tesla does in an entire year.\nTesla may well be a \"great\" company with \"amazing\" products that people want to buy, but that doesn't mean the stock isn't wildly overvalued before the current run, and even more so now.\n\"Hype and momentum have taken over,\" he said. \"You're buying it with your eyes closed and your brain turned off.\"\nThe shares may be being gobbled up by investors who are big believers in the company's prospects. But at least some of the buyers are people who, not too long ago, believed the company was overdue for a crash.\nSo-called short sellers are investors who make money by betting against companies they think are poised to go down in value, and almost 18\u00a0per cent of Tesla shares right now are in the hands of short sellers \u2014 more than any other U.S. company, according to research firm S3 Partners.\nWatch this animation for a brief explainer of what short selling is and how it can sometimes lead to such a squeeze:\nWhen their bets go wrong and targeted companies increase in value, short sellers have to rush to cover their bets, which can cause those shares to quickly go up in value in a process known as a \"short squeeze.\"\nThe shorts are buying up billions of dollars in Tesla shares at least in part because that's better than waiting longer and having to buy them for even more.\n\"Tesla shorts were down $2.89 billion in ... losses in 2019 and are down $8.31 billion in ... losses so far in 2020, including $2.47 billion on today's price move,\" S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky said in a research note.\nShort sellers have targeted Tesla for years, and the company's controversial CEO Elon Musk is no fan of them, either. He's said in the past that\u00a0short selling should be \"illegal\"\u00a0and urged stock regulator the SEC to crack down on the practice.\nOn Monday, with the short squeeze already underway, he tweeted three fire emojis\u00a0\u2014 a veiled reference to his glee at his critics getting burned.\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\nA short squeeze is definitely a factor in the company's meteoric journey this week, but the effect of that should be temporary.\nA prolonged move higher requires more than just temporary reasons, and it's not difficult to find analysts who are convinced the company's rise is just the start of a long journey higher.\nLast week's earnings show the company\u00a0has now posted a small profit for two quarters in a row, which is causing some investors to think the hyped-up company is finally starting to live up to its promise.\n\"Investors are now starting to believe that Tesla can make mass-volume electric vehicles, and automakers, battery makers and suppliers can make money from electric vehicles,\" Samsung Securities analyst Cho Hyung-ryul said in a note to clients Tuesday.\nBillionaire investor Ron Baron, whose firm holds a nearly 1 per cent stake in Tesla, says the company is on its way to $1 trillion in sales within the next decade. That would be about 50 times\u00a0the roughly $20 billion in revenue it took in last year, a figure that would turn Tesla into \"one of the largest companies in the whole world,\" he told financial news channel CNBC on Tuesday.\nBut Baskin's Schwartz is still unconvinced. \"You can't come up with a valuation on Tesla right now that makes any sense,\" he said. \"It's pricing in every single thing that may go well in the future without pricing in anything that could go wrong.\"\n"}, {"author": "Dianne Buckner", "title": "Divesting from U.S. gun industry is not so easy if you pay into Canada Pension Plan", "description": "Companies that make assault rifles, handguns, bullets among CPP investments", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cpp-owns-gun-stocks-1.5264497", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3633807.1568923463!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ar-15.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 04, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-04T14:29:56.368Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canadians who want to steer clear of investing in gun companies are out of luck if they pay into the Canada Pension Plan.\u00a0\nCPP owns shares in American firearm manufacturers, including the parent company of handgun manufacturer Smith & Wesson, assault rifle maker Ruger and Olin Corp., which produces ammunition\u00a0for the AR-15, the weapon of choice for many perpetrators of mass shootings.\nThe holdings are highlighted in a new report coming from Corporate Knights, a Canadian magazine focused on ethical investing,\u00a0and come after another bloody weekend in the U.S., where seven people were killed and 25 injured in a mass shooting in west Texas.\n\"CPP does have systems in place to weed out some ethically egregious stocks,\" said Toby Heaps, who publishes Corporate Knights. \"But I think they've made a call that there's not necessarily a consensus on gun stocks.\"\nHeaps pointed\u00a0out that CPP's holdings in firearms firms are small\u00a0relative to the overall size of the plan \u2014 about $37 million Cdn worth of stock out of the $400 billion it manages.

Oil prices tumbled\u00a0again this morning,\u00a0with\u00a0concerns about storage capacity making headlines.\n\"Demand is disappearing overnight, but oil production is going to take longer to react,\" Aaron Brady, vice president of energy oil market services at IHS Markit, told CBC News.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe size of this global\u00a0imbalance is large enough, Brady said, that he thinks most of the storage could fill up over the coming weeks and months.\u00a0\n\"It's happening at lightspeed,\" Brady said.\nThe implications\u00a0of storage reaching\u00a0tank tops would be significant. Producers that couldn't sell their oil because of crashing demand \u2014 and are unable to find places to store it \u2014 would have to slam the brakes.\u00a0\n\"This lack of storage is going to cause shut-ins of production,\" Brady said.\nFor operators in Canada's oilsands, the situation would be particularly painful should\u00a0they be faced with\u00a0shutting in\u00a0some of their\u00a0complex production. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney noted last week that, in some cases, shutting down oilsands\u00a0operations can cause permanent damage to the\u00a0reservoirs,\u00a0jeopardizing\u00a0billions of dollars of assets.\nMuch of the focus today is on what's happening in the U.S., the primary destination for Canada's oil.\nTotal commercial storage\u00a0in the U.S. stands at about 653 million barrels, or some 780 million barrels including pipeline fills and crude-in-transit.\u00a0\nNet stocks of crude held at refineries and tank farms amounted to 375 million barrels a little more than a week ago, implying storage facilities were about 57 per cent\u00a0full, according to Reuters.\nIt's believed\u00a0the system could absorb\u00a0crude at the current rate for a few more weeks, and longer if the inflow is slowed by production cuts from OPEC and its allies as well as U.S. and Canadian producers.\nBut some market watchers say if the global oil market remains oversupplied into summer,\u00a0storage could start to become a more significant problem.\nAnalysts believe storage in western Canada is feeling the pressure, too.\u00a0\nConsultants\u00a0Rystad Energy forecast last month that\u00a0storage in the region stood a good chance of running out by the end of March, but the pressure eased somewhat as oil companies began ratcheting back production.\n\"It had days away from being filled up,\" said Thomas Liles, Rystad senior analyst, in an interview Friday. \"I generally do think it tends to be a days-away kind of situation, perpetually, at this point in western Canada.\"\nLiles says that from the beginning of April, there's been a noticeable decoupling in the price of some synthetic grades of oil from the region and the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate.\u00a0\n\"That's a pretty clear indication of the storage pressure building,\" he said.\nHowever, Liles said there are a lot of moving parts, like upstream production levels and how much crude finds its way into the American market.\nUnlike the U.S., official information about storage levels in\u00a0Alberta\u00a0is not released on a weekly basis, so people looking for timely updates often turn to private firms that use some creative means to gather the data.\nGenscape, for example, completes\u00a0weekly flyovers around key energy hubs, using\u00a0infrared and visual spectrum imagery of individual storage tanks to measure how full they are.\nGenscape said Western Canada inventories were\u00a0at 30\u00a0million\u00a0barrels in the final week of March, utilizing\u00a047 percent of operational capacity.\u00a0\n\"Capacity utilization in Western Canada has not exceeded 67 per cent or dipped lower than 30 per cent since [2011],\" it said. \"Given this utilization maximum, only 13 million\u00a0barrels\u00a0of space remained as of March 27.\"\u00a0\nHampered U.S. refinery demand could lead to storage builds in Western Canada in April, the firm\u00a0added.\n\"Many refineries have cut runs, which cuts demand for Canadian barrels, and that potentially backs into terminals in Western Canada,\" said Genscape analyst Dylan White.\nGlobally, the situation is also a concern.\nThe International Energy Agency said last week that the build-up in oil stocks in the first half of the year threatens to overwhelm the logistics of the oil industry \u2014 ships, pipelines and storage tanks \u2014 in the coming weeks.\n\"We estimate that available capacity could be saturated in mid-year, based on our market balances,\" the IEA said.\u00a0\nThe agency said floating storage is becoming more expensive as traders compete for ships. Chartering costs for Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) have more than doubled since February.\n\"Never before has the oil industry come this close to testing its logistics capacity to the limit,\" the agency said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Stelco cites 'unprecedented' drop in steel prices while reporting Q4 loss", "description": "Steelmaker working to diversify offerings and add higher value-added products", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/stelco-quarter-four-loss-1.5469188", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5248346.1565891618!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/stelco-stock-steel.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 19, 2020 5:55 PM ET", "2020-02-19T22:55:40.194Z"], "source": null, "content": "Stelco Holdings Inc. swung to a loss in its fourth quarter after challenging market conditions including an \"unprecedented\" drop in prices.\nThe Hamilton-based steel producer said Wednesday that it lost $24 million or 27 cents per diluted share for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with net income of $110 million or $1.23 per diluted for final quarter of 2018.\nRevenue totalled $435 million, down from $648 million a year earlier.\n\"We faced a continuation of the headwinds we experienced in Q3, highlighted by continued price depression,\" company CEO David Cheney told a conference call with financial analysts.\nThe company said its average steel selling price for the quarter was down 28 per cent compared with last year and steel shipping volumes were down six per cent.

But mostly, a nervous Republican Party\u00a0is hoping administration actions will reverse the stock market's nosedive, avert a recession and overcome the coronavirus in just a few months.\nThat could allow time to prevent the problems from becoming Trump's Hurricane Katrina and defining November's election battles for the White House and Congress. Then-president George W. Bush was harshly criticized for his administration's belated handling of the deadly 2005 storm, which battered New Orleans, damaged his presidency and contributed to the Republicans'\u00a0loss of House control the following year.\n\"The economy has been his whole schtick,\" said former Rep. Tom Davis, a Republican from Vermont, who once headed the House Republicans'\u00a0campaign committee. \"If the market tanks and the economy goes down, I think Trump's whole reason for being in office goes away.\"\n\"The way you respond to crises can be make-or-break moments for elected officials,\" said Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster.\nPeople in both parties say a recession and a rampant disease outbreak would cripple Trump's re-election and Republican efforts to capture House control and defend their Senate majority. That's an edge Democrats are primed to exploit.\n\"Every elected @GOP official owns this moment,\" Rep. Sean Casten, a Democrat from Wisconsin, tweeted this week after Trump delivered a prime time national address that erroneously described several steps he's taking to try containing the virus. \"They elected him. They coddled him. They cowered before him.\"\nDemocrats' first ads on the theme have only started trickling out. Yet they point to GOP soft spots Democrats detect and the emotional appeals they'll make.\nBefore exiting the Democratic presidential race this month, Mike Bloomberg ran two ads that implicitly challenged Trump's ability to manage the crisis by citing his own efforts as New York City mayor right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. \"Trust is essential,\" Bloomberg said.\nThe Democratic-backed group Protect Our Care began airing a spot this week in Montana asserting that the state's Republican\u00a0senator, Steve Daines, \"doesn't worry\" about families' health concerns including coronavirus. It depicts a concerned mom hovering over her daughter, who lies bedridden in a hospital.\nDaines, who faces a competitive reelection race this November, has favoured repealing former President Barack Obama's health-care law but there's no evidence he is unconcerned about coronavirus. Jesse Hunt, spokesperson\u00a0for the Senate GOP's campaign committee, said Democrats are running \"disgusting attack ads that politicize a disease that knows no party.\"\nShort of campaign ads, both sides have used press releases and emails to duel over the virus.\nChristy Smith, a Democrat battling for an open House seat from Los Angeles, emailed supporters accusing Republicans of \"legislative malpractice\" for blocking a Democratic bill addressing the virus.\nAnd an email from the Great America PAC, a group that supports Trump, says while Trump has been \"working around the clock to keep Americans safe and healthy,\" he's been blamed by \"the Left and Fake News media\" for the outbreak.\nSuch emails are often used to generate lists of potential voters, volunteers and donors. Trump has repeatedly referred to criticisms of his administration's coronavirus performance as a \"hoax.\"\nRepublicans say there is still time for Trump to tame the coronavirus and the economy and consign them to background noise before Election Day.\n\"If we do this right, in the mid-summer the economy and stocks will come roaring back,\" said Rep. Steve Stivers of Ohio, a recent chairman of his party's House political arm.\nA quick turnabout will be crucial for Trump, whose presidency has featured frequent high-profile clashes that often drown each other out. That includes his House impeachment and his acquittal just five weeks ago by the Senate, which have already been overshadowed by the latest crisis.\nAbove all issues, a feeble economy can spell an incumbent president's downfall, and things currently look grim. Plummeting financial markets, withering 401k accounts, growing layoffs, slowed consumer spending and travel and the shutdown of sports leagues and entertainment venues are hardly the stuff that lures voters.\nTrump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency Friday, saying that would provide $50 billion US to state and local governments for the outbreak. The Dow Jones average rose over 1,900 points Friday but was still in bear market territory, down over 20 per cent from its all-time last month.\nBut in an example of his tendency to downplay the virus and his defensiveness about the administration's slow-footed reaction to it, he said, \"I don't take responsibility at all\" for the plodding roll-out of testing in the U.S.\nThat left the wounded economy and the virus irresistible targets for Democrats, who are tying them to criticism of Trump as incompetent.\n\"You wouldn't have had a massive fluctuation in the stock market this week if he wasn't really disturbing the confidence of investors,\" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida,\u00a0a former Democratic Party chair. She said Trump's \"fly by the seat of his pants, cover his own tuchus approach does not inspire confidence.\"\n\"President Trump has taken kind of malicious pride in asserting that he alone can make things happen,\" said Rep. Peter Welch a Democrat from Vermont.. \"And he's run into his match with a coronavirus that simply doesn't respond to his tweets and insults.\"\nDemocrats on the presidential campaign trail have struck similar themes.\nJoe Biden said \"a pervasive lack of trust in this president\" had hindered the response to virus, compounded by Trump's leaving the country \"woefully unprepared.\" Biden's remaining rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said the administration's \"incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people.\"\nStill, Republicans are watching to see if Democrats overstep in converting a virus that has killed thousands around the world into a political weapon.\nThe risk for Democrats is if they \"look like they are cheering for a worsening of a very serious situation,\" said Ayres, the GOP pollster.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1587270211569", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Tony Seskus", "title": "Crude storage is filling fast as demand tumbles, piling pressure on oilpatch", "description": "'It's happening at lightspeed,' market watcher says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-storage-filling-quickly-1.5537326", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2981543.1425491914!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/oil-glut-full-tanks.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 20, 2020 11:56 AM ET", "2020-04-21T18:46:13.533Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "From Oklahoma to Alberta and around the globe, oil storage is filling quickly \u2014 flowing into tank farms, tanker ships and salt caverns.\n\"Or swimming pools,\" as one analyst\u00a0joked last\u00a0week.\nThe laughs are rare\u00a0these days.\nOil prices have plunged, companies are slashing spending and demand for fuel is being crushed\u00a0by an epic economic lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNow, analysts warn the meltdown in crude demand could also test the limits of storage capacity worldwide, further damaging prices and forcing companies to\u00a0halt\u00a0production.\nThe situation hit home again this past week when the United States reported its biggest weekly inventory build on record. Oil prices tumbled\u00a0again this morning,\u00a0with\u00a0concerns about storage capacity making headlines.\n\"Demand is disappearing overnight, but oil production is going to take longer to react,\" Aaron Brady, vice president of energy oil market services at IHS Markit, told CBC News.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe size of this global\u00a0imbalance is large enough, Brady said, that he thinks most of the storage could fill up over the coming weeks and months.\u00a0\n\"It's happening at lightspeed,\" Brady said.\nThe implications\u00a0of storage reaching\u00a0tank tops would be significant. Producers that couldn't sell their oil because of crashing demand \u2014 and are unable to find places to store it \u2014 would have to slam the brakes.\u00a0\n\"This lack of storage is going to cause shut-ins of production,\" Brady said.\nFor operators in Canada's oilsands, the situation would be particularly painful should\u00a0they be faced with\u00a0shutting in\u00a0some of their\u00a0complex production. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney noted last week that, in some cases, shutting down oilsands\u00a0operations can cause permanent damage to the\u00a0reservoirs,\u00a0jeopardizing\u00a0billions of dollars of assets.\nMuch of the focus today is on what's happening in the U.S., the primary destination for Canada's oil.\nTotal commercial storage\u00a0in the U.S. stands at about 653 million barrels, or some 780 million barrels including pipeline fills and crude-in-transit.\u00a0\nNet stocks of crude held at refineries and tank farms amounted to 375 million barrels a little more than a week ago, implying storage facilities were about 57 per cent\u00a0full, according to Reuters.\nIt's believed\u00a0the system could absorb\u00a0crude at the current rate for a few more weeks, and longer if the inflow is slowed by production cuts from OPEC and its allies as well as U.S. and Canadian producers.\nBut some market watchers say if the global oil market remains oversupplied into summer,\u00a0storage could start to become a more significant problem.\nAnalysts believe storage in western Canada is feeling the pressure, too.\u00a0\nConsultants\u00a0Rystad Energy forecast last month that\u00a0storage in the region stood a good chance of running out by the end of March, but the pressure eased somewhat as oil companies began ratcheting back production.\n\"It had days away from being filled up,\" said Thomas Liles, Rystad senior analyst, in an interview Friday. \"I generally do think it tends to be a days-away kind of situation, perpetually, at this point in western Canada.\"\nLiles says that from the beginning of April, there's been a noticeable decoupling in the price of some synthetic grades of oil from the region and the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate.\u00a0\n\"That's a pretty clear indication of the storage pressure building,\" he said.\nHowever, Liles said there are a lot of moving parts, like upstream production levels and how much crude finds its way into the American market.\nUnlike the U.S., official information about storage levels in\u00a0Alberta\u00a0is not released on a weekly basis, so people looking for timely updates often turn to private firms that use some creative means to gather the data.\nGenscape, for example, completes\u00a0weekly flyovers around key energy hubs, using\u00a0infrared and visual spectrum imagery of individual storage tanks to measure how full they are.\nGenscape said Western Canada inventories were\u00a0at 30\u00a0million\u00a0barrels in the final week of March, utilizing\u00a047 percent of operational capacity.\u00a0\n\"Capacity utilization in Western Canada has not exceeded 67 per cent or dipped lower than 30 per cent since [2011],\" it said. \"Given this utilization maximum, only 13 million\u00a0barrels\u00a0of space remained as of March 27.\"\u00a0\nHampered U.S. refinery demand could lead to storage builds in Western Canada in April, the firm\u00a0added.\n\"Many refineries have cut runs, which cuts demand for Canadian barrels, and that potentially backs into terminals in Western Canada,\" said Genscape analyst Dylan White.\nGlobally, the situation is also a concern.\nThe International Energy Agency said last week that the build-up in oil stocks in the first half of the year threatens to overwhelm the logistics of the oil industry \u2014 ships, pipelines and storage tanks \u2014 in the coming weeks.\n\"We estimate that available capacity could be saturated in mid-year, based on our market balances,\" the IEA said.\u00a0\nThe agency said floating storage is becoming more expensive as traders compete for ships. Chartering costs for Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) have more than doubled since February.\n\"Never before has the oil industry come this close to testing its logistics capacity to the limit,\" the agency said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Oilpatch buyers expected to stay on the sidelines in 2020, analysts say", "description": "'Canadian guys are facing more country risk and currency risk and regulatory risk'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/oilpatch-oil-gas-markets-alberta-mergers-acquisitions-1.5407215", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4592283.1577134739!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/oil-sands-future-20150410.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 23, 2019 2:04 PM MT", "2019-12-23T21:10:17.626Z"], "source": null, "content": "A mindset of \"hunkering down\" in the face of persistent headwinds means mergers and acquisitions activity in Canada's oilpatch will likely remain at low ebb in 2020, analysts say.\nA recent spate of consolidation of producers in prolific Texas oilfields \u2014 WPX Energy announced the US$2.5-billion purchase of Felix Energy last week \u2014 has some investors wondering when the same thing will happen in Canada, particularly in the rich Montney resource play on the northern Alberta-B.C. border, said analyst Jordan McNiven with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.\nBut the Canadian M&A situation is quite different, he said. Factors including declining share prices, low stock-market trading volumes, poor access to capital and industry pessimism over export pipeline constraints mean companies are more interested in surviving than growing.\n\"It certainly makes it more challenging.

We're seeing very little in the way of financings being done in the upstream oil and gas industry. Whatever excess capital companies do have, they're not using it on M&A, they're using it for share buybacks and payback of debt.\"\nIn its 2020 production guidance news release this month, Calgary-based producer Tourmaline Oil Corp. said it expects to have access to over $800 million for \"select acquisition activity\" next year.\nThe news is remarkable because it's so rare, analysts agreed, adding the company has had to employ a unique solution to raise the money.\nThe acquisition pool is expected to be freed up through the company's creation of subsidiary Topaz Energy Corp., which will take ownership of its midstream and royalty assets in exchange for the expansion cash.\nCompanies that merge often justify it by citing cost synergies, the ability to do more with fewer people and resources.\nThere's less to gain in Canada where years of cutting costs and exploration budgets have reduced expected administration costs to an average of about six per cent of cash flow in 2020, compared with U.S. peers at 13 per cent, McNiven pointed out.\nHusky Energy Inc. recently confirmed it had reduced its ranks by 370 employees this year because it is spending less on growth.\nThe S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index, which tracks share prices of major producers, has dropped by more than a third in the past three years, suggesting there are plenty of bargain-priced publicly traded companies for buyers to look at.\nBut \"turning over the keys at the bottom of the market is a tough pill to swallow,\" noted McNiven.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "TSX falls from record high after a week of gains, U.S. markets mixed", "description": "'I think this kind of a catch-your-breath moment for the markets, analyst said", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tsx-falls-from-record-high-1.5294647", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5261122.1566916367!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bay-street-financial-district-sign-with-td-bank.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 23, 2019 5:44 PM ET", "2019-09-23T21:44:02.861Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada's main stock index fell from its record high on a \"benign\" day in which losses in the financial and telecommunications sectors offset gains in materials and energy.\n\"I think this kind of a catch-your-breath moment for the markets,\" said Craig Fehr, Canadian markets strategist with\u00a0Edward Jones.\n\"The TSX and S&P 500 are both within a hair of all-time highs and so today I think we're seeing markets kind of take a deep breath in the wake of the Fed interest rate cut and are surveying both the global economic data and the shifting monetary policy environment.\"\nThe S&P/TSX composite index closed down 32.49 points at 16,867.20 after hitting an intraday high of 16,892.50, just short of its Friday closing.\nSeven of the 10 major sectors on the TSX were down led by telecommunications, which fell nearly one per cent.

He praised the framework in Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan for allowing private retailers to sell product and opening the door to e-commerce.\nIn Alberta, which Damas said has\u00a0led the country for per-capita sales, the government regulator has passed on discounts from licensed producers\u00a0to retailers, dropping prices for customers. In July 2019, Statistics Canada reports legal cannabis sales\u00a0surpassing $21 million\u00a0in that province, compared to $29.6 million in Ontario, which has more than three times the population.\u00a0\nSaskatchewan reported $6.3 million in sales from cannabis stores in July 2019, the latest month for which data is available, according to Statistics Canada.\u00a0In Manitoba, the agency reports monthly sales from cannabis stores have climbed steadily from $4.2 million in December 2018 to $5.8 million in July 2019.\nDamas attributes much of that success to the number of stores, which have proliferated across the Prairie provinces compared to\u00a0their larger counterparts.\nManitoba currently has 26\u00a0operational stores, and Saskatchewan has 37.\nOntario, with more than 10 times Manitoba's\u00a0population, had 25\u00a0stores. Quebec, with a population just over six times Manitoba's, had 21. Cannabis store sales were\u00a0$29.6 million in Ontario and $21.8 million in Quebec\u00a0in July 2019.\n\"Manitoba has been punching above its weight,\" Damas said. \"We can't expect that to change the industry structure, but I think Manitoba is doing very well.\"\nWhile the Prairie provinces are\u00a0a \"bright spot,\"\u00a0he said, the legal cannabis industry as a whole in Canada still needs to mature, and has been plagued in its first year by a calamitous drop in stock prices,\u00a0a persistent black market and the lack of stores in the two largest provinces.\nHe\u00a0predicts oversupply in the coming months\u00a0as an increasing number of licences have been granted will lead to more challenges. But he noted his long-term assessment still includes a half-dozen cannabis companies that will survive and thrive.\nJohn Arbuthnot, CEO of the Winnipeg-based cannabis producer and retailer Delta 9, said the Manitoba market has been buoyed by factors like cheap power, low rent and a relatively inexpensive cost of living that keeps labour costs down.\nThe publicly traded company \u2014 which now holds the province's only federal licence to process and cultivate\u00a0cannabis, after Health Canada\u00a0suspended\u00a0the\u00a0licence\u00a0of competitor Bonify\u00a0in February\u00a0\u2014 reported a gross profit of $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2019, according to investor material provided to CBC.\n\"We've been champions of Manitoba for quite some time.\u2026 This is a great place for us to do business,\" Arbuthnot said in an interview with CBC News Thursday.\n\"I think we've done a very good job here, from a regulatory standpoint, to make sure that Manitoba, over the long term, will be competitive in retail as well [as cultivation].\"\nSince the out-the-door lineups seen on legalization day, Arbuthnot\u00a0said Delta 9\u00a0has completed 350,000 transactions in its four Manitoba\u00a0stores (two in Winnipeg, and one in each of Brandon and Thompson).\u00a0\nDespite expectations heading into legalization of a consumer base driven by young men, Arbuthnot said customer demographics have been varied.\nHe said he's optimistic about the cannabis industry's ability to build on success heading into the future, despite trouble in the stock market. Delta 9 stocks closed at\u00a0$0.60 on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, compared to $2.07\u00a0on the day after legalization.\nThat doesn't mean there aren't challenges. New numbers released by Statistics Canada Wednesday show a gram of weed costs an average of\u00a0$5.85 in Manitoba's illegal market, compared to $10.71 a gram on the legal side, based on prices reported by Canadians over the past 11 months.\nArbuthnot is hoping to see legal prices drop as the industry recovers from last year's supply shortages and increases production scale.\nSheilagh Dohie, regional director for the Winnipeg cannabis retailer Garden Variety, said in an email the company's business has been growing each month since its first store opened\u00a0in March.\n\"Partnerships with Manitoba Liquor & Lotteries and the Liquor, Gaming, and Cannabis [Authority] have been very positive,\" Dohie wrote.\nThe retailer is part of a\u00a0consortium involving Manitoba's\u00a0Fisher River Cree Nation,\u00a0the Chippewas of the Thames First Nation in Ontario, and the cannabis companies Avana Canada, Native Roots Dispensary and MediPharm Labs.\nDohie said the group would like to see more relaxed\u00a0marketing regulations\u00a0heading into the second year of legal cannabis.\n\"I would like to be able to showcase our business,\" Dohie wrote. \"Advertising cannabis should be comparable to marketing liquor, clothing, groceries, or anything else.\"\nCBC News reached out to other Manitoba retailers for comment. Meta Cannabis and Fire & Flower did not respond to CBC's requests. A spokesperson for Tokyo Smoke said the business wasn't available to comment Friday.\nLooking back on the first year of legal cannabis, Damas said it's obvious the stock side, at least, was overvalued to begin with.\u00a0Stock prices\u00a0for big-player Canadian and U.S.\u00a0cannabis companies have plunged in the past year.\nCanopy Growth Corp., the company behind retailers Tweed and Tokyo Smoke, dropped from $69.90 on April 29 to a Friday close on the Toronto Stock Exchange\u00a0of\u00a0$25.67, for example. Stocks in the Edmonton-based producer Aurora Cannabis closed at $4.86 on the TSX Friday, compared to a 12-month high of $15.07 in the days leading up to legalization.\n\"It's absolutely a bubble. It's probably one of the worst ones since the mortgage meltdown in Canada,\" Damas said of the industry's performance on the stock market.\nWhere investors were in the \"euphoria\" stage a year ago, he said, they've now moved through the \"denial\" stage and into \"panic,\" as the industry underperformed compared to inflated expectations.\u00a0Next, he's expecting \"capitulation,\" as shareholders start selling good stocks along with the bad.\n\"The spectre of empty greenhouses\u00a0\u2014\u00a0half-filled, vacant\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is now pervading [the] cannabis investor mind frame,\" he said.\n\"Here at BCMI, we're still looking for a very optimistic $172 million in monthly sales in December, which is 70 per cent or so more than what we had in July,\" Damas said.\n\"It's just that the stocks were too high and now they're coming down to earth.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "2 different start dates being recommended for 2 P.E.I. lobster fishing areas", "description": "'It is not going to be one thing ...\u00a0to solve it for everyone' ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-peifa-resutls-spring-lobster-fishing-1.5539974", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5540235.1587501938!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/lobster-fishing-season-stock-photos-2018.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 21, 2020 6:23 PM AT", "2020-04-21T21:23:30.584Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Prince Edward Island Fishermen's Association will\u00a0recommend\u00a0to Fisheries and Oceans Canada\u00a0two different start dates for\u00a0the spring lobster season\u00a0for two regions around Prince Edward Island.\nThe PEIFA released results Tuesday from its\u00a0member vote held over the weekend.

The federal minister\u00a0will have the final say as to when the spring lobster season\u00a0begins in all regions.\nMacPherson said he expects that decision to come quickly.\n\"We hope that there is a real definitive\u00a0decision here in the next day or so from the minister's office,\" he said.\n\"We have every indication that the minister is processing these requests very quickly and then people can make preparations ...\u00a0volumes, price, markets \u2014\u00a0all those kinds of things, those are still big picture issues that are being discussed.\"\nThe PEIFA\u00a0is\u00a0still working with Health PEI on guidelines for the fishermen and fish processing plants to ensure the health and safety of the workers and crews.\nMacPherson said they are trying to get decisions made to provide some stability in an unpredictable year.\n\"I think irrespective there's anxiety ...\u00a0throughout the whole season and it is not going to be one thing ...\u00a0to solve it for everyone and then we're into smooth sailing so to speak,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"Still lots of challenges out there for sure.\"\n"}, {"author": "Dan Healing", "title": "Miner Teck Resources reports Q3 profit down, plans to cut 500 full-time jobs", "description": "Vancouver-based corporation says it wants to improve efficiency following Q3 profit drop", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/miner-teck-resources-reports-q3-profit-down-plans-cut-500-jobs-1.5336248", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2575290.1572037181!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/coal-mountain-operations-teck-website-image.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 25, 2019 2:35 PM PT", "2019-10-25T21:35:30.300Z"], "source": null, "content": "Teck Resources Ltd. says it will cut 500 full-time equivalent jobs as it focuses on trimming $500 million from planned spending through to the end of 2020.\nThe Vancouver-based miner said Thursday it wants to improve efficiency and productivity after reporting its third-quarter profit attributable to shareholders fell to $369 million compared with a profit of $1.28 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\"While our financial position remains strong, we have implemented a company-wide cost reduction program with reduced spending, targeting approximately $500 million of reductions through the end of 2020,\" said Teck CEO Don Lindsay on a conference call.\nGlobal economic uncertainties are having a \"significant negative effect\" on the company's prices for its products, particularly steelmaking coal, he said.\nTeck said its revenue was nearly $3.04 billion for the three months ended Sept. 30, down from nearly $3.21 billion in the year-earlier period.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company says it earned a profit attributable to shareholders of $403 million or 72 cents per share compared with an adjusted profit of $466 million or 81 cents per share a year ago.\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of 66 cents per share for the quarter, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nTeck shares fell by as much as six per cent to $20.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n"}, {"author": "Kyle Bakx", "title": "Recounting a devastating week in North America's biggest oil play", "description": "A day-by-day account in the west Texas oilfields as oil markets in a free fall", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/permian-midland-houston-1.5498270", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5498277.1584222566!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/texas-pumpjacks.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 15, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-15T08:00:00.547Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In Houston, the second week of March usually marks a highlight on the city's business calendar, a few days when the city hosts political and business leaders from around the world at what is arguably the most important energy conference\u00a0of the year.\nThis year, organizers pulled the plug on CERAWeek\u00a0\u2014\u00a0just days before it was set to begin \u2014\u00a0because of fears of the spread\u00a0of COVID-19.\u00a0\nIt was a sign of things to come.\nThe last week has been devastating for many oil producers in North America.\nAn oil price war launched between Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2014\u00a0combined with growing coronavirus fears \u2014\u00a0rattled markets to the core and sent energy prices spiralling to their lowest levels in years.\nWhile Canada's energy sector has struggled in recent years, Texas has been a haven as the home to one of the hottest oil plays in the world, the Permian Basin. Companies\u00a0from Alberta have shifted resources to the state in a bid to keep going.\nBut now it seems few can hide from a price collapse that no one seems certain about how long, or deep, it can go \u2014\u00a0even in the Lone Star state.\nHere's how the last week unfolded as people in the oilfields reacted to one of the worst periods in the industry with oil markets in a free fall.\nAll 76 seats were full on a regional jet flight from Houston to the airport nestled between the cities of Midland and Odessa in West Texas. There was little conversation on the late Sunday evening journey. Asian markets had already opened for trading and oil prices were tanking, falling by as much as 31 per cent.\nThis part of Texas is the heart of the Permian Basin, the largest and hottest oil play on the continent. This area isn't a tourist attraction\u00a0but rather communities solely focused on the oilpatch. People here either work in the oilfield or cater to the sector by selling trucks to oil companies and teaching oilfield kids.\nThat's why everyone on the flight knew the week ahead was going to be grim.\nAround 9:30 in the morning, half a dozen trucks are waiting their turn to fill up on mud. The substance is used in drilling oil wells throughout the area.\nHour after hour, oil prices keep falling and it is the talk all around the plant. Otherwise, operations are unchanged at the AES Drilling Fluids facility in the town of Kermit as business remains brisk.\nThe parent company is Calgary-based CES Energy Solutions, which has shifted more of its focus to Texas in recent years as oilpatch activity has flowed to the Permian.\nGary Lankford is busy checking in with clients to gauge their attitudes and get a sense of their potential plans. Lankford is the company's vice-president of\u00a0Permian Basin development. He grew up in Texas and this is his 40th year working in the oilfield.\nBy his guess, he's experienced seven significant price crashes in the industry, but he admits the wisdom earned does little to anticipate what this depression will be like.\u00a0\n\"I think every one is different. This one is going to be a little different because it's dropping so fast. The fact that you think you're prepared for it \u2014\u00a0nah, you never are,\" he said.\nWith every spare minute he has, Lankford calls another client to check in. There is little panic on the other end of the phone, he said. Still, the two big questions are how bad will this be and how long will it last.\n\"Several years ago my wife and I were in Las Vegas when Frank Sinatra passed away. I said it was kind of like being in the Vatican when the pope passed away. They actually turned the lights off on the strip for two minutes,\" Lankford said.\u00a0\"Being here in Midland with what we're seeing with OPEC, Russia and oil prices, this may be the equivalent of Frank Sinatra dying. I hope not.\"\nBy day's end, oil prices fall by as much as 30 per cent, while Exxon Mobil and Chevron stock are down more than 12 per cent.\nCanadian oilsands companies are blasted, too.\u00a0Suncor losing more than 17\u00a0per cent of its value. Cenovus\u00a0closing down 51 per cent.\nIt's before\u00a09 a.m.\u00a0and Dave Hoffman is driving through foggy\u00a0west Texas\u00a0oilfield backroads. The Permian Basin extends into New Mexico and that's where one of its drilling rigs is working around the clock.\nHoffman is from Camrose, Alberta, but spends two-thirds of his time in Texas overseeing operations for Calgary-based Citadel Drilling. Traffic is heavy with workers and heavy trucks navigating the area.\nHe is convinced the company can withstand a period of depressed oil prices after surviving through several years of tough prices in Western Canada, before all of Citadel Drilling's rigs were moved to Texas two years ago.\n\"We've overcome a lot. We've come here and really done a good job and made a name for ourselves,\" said Hoffman.\u00a0\nThe 2,000 horsepower drilling rig, named\u00a0\"The Commander,\"\u00a0is hard to miss outside the town of Jal, New Mexico, with little vegetation in the desert to hide the towering red, white and gold machine.\nThe majority of the workers are Canadian. They fly in from across Canada to work rotations of 20 days on, 10 days off. Depending on what decisions the oil producers make, drilling activity could be impacted. For now, at least, there aren't any signs of disruption on the rig.\n\"No, I don't think we've recognized any real change.\" said Hoffman. \"Everyone is trying to feel out the process and see what's happening.\"\nThat evening, the crowd at the PNG Stadium in Houston is glaringly sparse. The annual rodeo is in full swing, but the majority of people are staying far away as the coronavirus threat increases.\nStill, competitors like bareback rider Pascal Isabelle from Okotoks, Alberta, bring some life into the giant 72,000 seat arena.\n\"That's a buckin' son of a gun,\" yells the announcer.\nJeremy Thompson watches the rodeo event from one end of the arena and sees parallels to what the oilpatch is going through, especially the bull riding.\n\"You do a lot of work in the chute to get that bull where you want it to go. and then you come out and it turns the wrong way and you're in the dirt. You're picking your hat up, dusting it off and wondering what's next,\" he said.\nThompson regularly travels to different parts of the U.S. to meet with clients and show off the software developed by the company he works for, Calgary-based Spira Data.\nWith the majority of the American oilpatch focused in Texas, he easily knows his way around Houston and other cities in the state.\nFor him, this week has been eventful as some customers are too preoccupied with the price meltdown and cancel their meetings with Thompson, while others seem more eager to move ahead with projects as they see technology as a way of being more efficient in their operations.\nThe following day, the rest of the rodeo is cancelled due to rising coronavirus concerns, marking the first shutdown of the Houston Rodeo in its nearly 90-year history.\nAt this point, oil prices are 40 per cent lower than they were a month ago.\nIt's the middle of an incredibly tumultuous week and at the Houston office of research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, analysts are looking into the financial health of companies to see which are best suited to survive a prolonged downturn, while also revising their forecasts and models for oil production and demand.\nAfter returning from a meeting with Exxon Mobil earlier in the day, analyst Brandon Davis sits down for an interview to explain all the developments he is seeing in the sector.\n\"We've talked to a lot of clients, both from the company side and investor side as well, hedge funds and things like that. I think the only thing everyone can agree upon is they don't know. It's an uncertain situation. Who knows what will happen with the Middle East and Russia. Maybe something will emerge.\"\nIn a sustained low-cost scenario, the larger producers are likely better off, while most distressed companies will likely be either junior or mid-sized firms. The oilfield service sector is going to have a rougher ride too.\nAt this point, the safest thing for the oilpatch is to plan for low prices for the rest of the year, said Davis. Then if prices do recover, companies \"have excess inventory you can bring online in that scenario.\"\nIt's another tough day for stock market investors who are awash in red ink with major stock markets down by between three and five per cent.\nAs stock markets open, there is red across the board again, this time as investors reel from U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement the night before to restrict travel from\u00a0Europe.\nIt's another blow to the oilpatch as it \"just adds to the negative demand impetus,\" said Ken\u00a0Medlock,\u00a0from inside his office at the Center for Energy Studies at\u00a0Rice University in Houston.\nMedlock already knows of several people who have cancelled flights and plan to drive to their spring break ski trips. Still, he anticipates even vehicle traffic will decline in the near future as anxiety grows about being near crowds.\nOn the production side, OPEC and Russia continue to pump more oil and sink prices further. Medlock says they are hoping to force oilpatch bankruptcies in the U.S. and restore more control over the global sector.\n\"That's the classic market share game. That's what that is,\" he said.\nMedlock expects consolidation in the Permian and for production to fall this year.\u00a0\nThe depths of the oilpatch's woes, though, are difficult to predict. Medlock describes it as a perfect storm with countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia pumping oil with all their might and the coronavirus sapping away demand more and more every day. The virus, in particular, seems to be the greater unknown for the sector.\n\"Any time you get into a discussion about fear that just embeds massive uncertainty in terms of how consumers are going to respond and what governments are going to do, etc.,\" he said.\nThe headlines spread across the Wall Street Journal, which arrives at corporate head offices and hotel doorsteps, all focus on the coronavirus, including \"Virus Batters Economy,\" \"In U.S., Threat Upends Daily Life,\" and \"U.S. Hospitals Face Major Challenges.\"\nThe week ultimately ends just like it began \u2014 in surprising fashion. Trump declares the coronavirus a national emergency, the Federal Reserve pours $1.5 trillion\u00a0into the American stock market and the Bank of Canada makes an unexpected interest rate cut.\nStocks jumped across the continent with the Dow up nine per cent and the Toronto Stock Exchange up 10 per cent. Still, the upward swing wasn't enough to salvage one of the worst weeks in the North American stock market's history.\nOil edges up slightly to $33.38 US a barrel. It still represents about a 25 per cent drop in one week and there are few clues about what the next week, month or year have in store for the Permian or oilfields across the continent.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1708858947505", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Alberta Energy Regulator blocks sale of Shell assets over cleanup concerns", "description": "AER said it wasn't happy with how the deal would have split the liability for cleaning up the sites", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/aer-alberta-energy-regulator-pieridae-shell-canada-1.5570875", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5176373.1560540061!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/alberta-energy-regulator.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["May 14, 2020 7:28 PM MT", "2020-05-15T17:10:30.882Z"], "source": null, "content": "Alberta's energy regulator has cited cleanup concerns in blocking the sale of sour gas wells, pipelines and other facilities from an energy giant to a much smaller company.\nIn a decision released Thursday, the regulator said Calgary-based Pieridae Energy's attempted purchase of the southern Alberta assets from Shell Canada goes against the intent of environmental laws.\nThe issue was seen as a test case of the regulator's determination to avoid cleanup costs for energy facilities falling to the taxpayer.\nIn its written decision, the Alberta Energy Regulator said it wasn't happy with how the deal would have split the liability for cleaning up the sites, especially at a pair of gas processing plants. The terms of the sale would have had Shell responsible for existing contamination and Pieridae on the hook for future problems.\n\"The scope and extent of the contamination at the site is not well known and is not well described in the applications,\" the decision said. \"To date, the contamination at the sites has not been fully understood.\"\nWithout knowing that, the regulator said, it would be impossible to know which company would have been responsible for what.\nThe decision also said the company that made the mess should clean it up.\n\"Shell is the polluter,\" said the decision. \"The ... applications appear to request that the AER, by way of approval, override or at least significantly dilute Shell's obligations.\n\"The AER is of the view that it cannot, by way of approval, carve up and redistribute fundamental regulatory obligations in a manner that is contrary to or inconsistent with (the law).\"\nThe two companies agreed to the deal last summer. It involves 284 wells, 66 facilities and 82 pipelines in the southern Alberta foothills.\nIt came shortly after the regulator had promised a closer eye on such licence transfers to ensure purchasers are able to cover reclamation costs. At the time, Pieridae's market value was less than the price of the Shell assets and its stock value was less than a dollar.\nThe number of energy facilities left unreclaimed by struggling producers has boomed in recent years. As of May 14, Alberta alone had more than 10,000 unreclaimed wells, pipelines, facilities and sites.\nIn April, the federal government pledged $1.7 billion for such so-called orphan wells in Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, although they are supposed to be reclaimed by an industry-funded group.\nThe energy regulator said the two companies were free to restructure their deal and try again to get the licence transfers approved.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1708821571899", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Cannabis company Cronos says financial results will be delayed, without explanation", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cronos-earnings-1.5473683", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4854756.1539024421!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cronos-ginkgo-20180904.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 24, 2020 10:29 AM ET", "2020-02-24T15:48:24.376Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Shares in Canadian cannabis company Cronos Group Inc. lost more than 7 per cent on Monday as the company announced it will delay\u00a0the release of its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results \u2014 without explaining why.\n\"The company has had a delay in the completion of its financial statements and will make a further announcement in a subsequent press release to schedule the date and time of the earnings conference call,\" Cronos said in a press release Monday, without elaborating.\nCronos was supposed to reveal its latest financial performance numbers on Thursday.\nCigarette company Altria\u00a0invested $2.4 billion into Cronos in late 2018 for a 45 per cent stake in the company.

He was 98.\nKnown as the \"King of Gambling,\" the dashing billionaire and bon vivant secured a four-decade monopoly on casinos in Macau, then parlayed his home advantage to build the empire that still dominated the industry after it opened to foreign companies in 2002.\nHe was the former Portuguese colony's richest person, a lavish spender and accomplished ballroom dancer who wielded great influence both in Macau and in neighbouring Hong Kong while \u2014 according to U.S. authorities \u2014 maintaining ties to organized crime.\nA family statement said he died peacefully in his sleep, but did not give a cause of death.\nTall, handsome and of mixed Chinese and European heritage, Ho fathered 17 children with four women. His extended family erupted in high-profile squabbles over his empire during his later years.\nHo himself avoided the gaming floor.\n\"I don't gamble at all. I don't have the patience,\" Ho told The Associated Press in a rare interview in 2001. \"Don't expect to make money in gambling. It's a house game. It's for the house.\"\nHe also had stakes in businesses that run everything from the ferries and helicopters connecting Hong Kong and Macau, to department stores, hotels, Macau's airport and its horse-racing tracks.\nIn 2009, Ho underwent brain surgery after he reportedly fell at home and hit his head. He left the hospital after seven months and was rarely seen in public afterward, usually in a wheelchair.\nHis weakened condition may have set the stage for a very public family feud that erupted in 2011 over control of Macau casino operator SJM Holdings Ltd.\nHo disputed a supposed transfer of his entire multibillion-dollar stake to five of his children and one of his wives, calling it a \"robbery\" that went against his desire to divide the fortune equally among various branches of his family.\nThe dispute eventually was settled after several lawsuits, and Ho transferred most of his SJM shares to family members while officially remaining chairman until he retired at age 96. He had left the same job at his Hong Kong conglomerate Shun Tak Holdings a year earlier.\nHo's long and eventful life tracked the ebb and flow of southern China's fortunes.\nHe was born on Nov. 25, 1921 into the Hotung family, at the time one of Hong Kong's wealthiest and most powerful. When he was 13, his father abandoned the family after being wiped out by a stock market crash during the Great Depression.\nHo attended Hong Kong University but didn't graduate because of the Second World War. Fluent in English and Chinese, he was working as a telephone operator for British forces when the colony fell to Japan. He boarded a boat for neutral Macau, joining refugees from mainland China in the dying fishing port.\n\"I had to throw away my uniform and run to Macau as a refugee,\" Ho said in the 2001 interview.\nDuring the war, he earned money running nighttime smuggling and trading trips up the Pearl River Delta, surviving a pirate attack on one occasion.\n\"Macau treated me so well. I went there with 10 dollars in my pocket and became a millionaire before the age of 20,\" Ho said.\nIn 1948, Ho married Clementina Leitao, the daughter of a prominent lawyer in Macau who had connections to Portugal and to Macau high society. Those ties and Ho's efforts to curry favour with Macau authorities are said to have helped him and his business partners win the casino monopoly when it came up for bidding in 1962. About the same time, Ho married Lucina Laam under a Qing dynasty code allowing men to take multiple wives. Hong Kong outlawed the practice in 1971.\nHo fathered children with two other women, Ina Chan and Angela Leong, whom he referred to as his \"wives,\" though he was not legally married to either. Ho reportedly met Chan, a nurse, when she was hired to care for an ailing Leitao, who died in 2004.\nThrough his love of the tango and the cha-cha, Ho met Leong, a trained dancer and former ballroom dancing instructor.\nAfter Portugal transferred Macau to China in 1999, the government broke up Ho's casino monopoly in 2002, allowing in foreign rivals including Las Vegas Sands Corp., Wynn Resorts Ltd. and MGM Resorts International. The resulting building boom transformed the sleepy, seedy and corrupt former colonial outpost into a glitzy gambling powerhouse fuelled by high-rolling mainland Chinese.\nThe new players brought slick offerings to compete in the world's most lucrative gambling market with SJM's nearly two dozen no-frills casinos \u2014 the company didn't build its own lavish megaresort until years later.\nAllegations of organized crime dogged Ho for years, most recently in a 2010 report by the New Jersey gaming commission that accused him of letting Chinese criminal gangs, or triads, prosper inside his casinos during the 1990s. He dismissed such allegations.\nHo was known to spend lavishly. In 2007, he paid $8.9 million US for a bronze horse head taken by French troops 150 years ago from China's imperial palace so he could donate it to a Chinese museum. He also twice bid a record $330,000 US for truffles at charity auctions.\nHo is survived by three of his wives and 16 children. His eldest son, Robert, was killed in a car crash in Portugal in 1981.\nSeveral of Ho's children are involved in the family business. Daughter Pansy is co-chair of rival MGM's Macau casino business, while son Lawrence runs another competitor, Melco. Another daughter, Josie, is an actress and singer who had a role in the 2011 Steven Soderbergh film Contagion.\nBack in 1962, when Ho acquired the gambling monopoly, the tiny Portuguese enclave west of Hong Kong was a decaying backwater deluged with refugees.\n\"In those days, the Portuguese said Stanley Ho was a dreamer. I have fulfilled all my promises,\" Ho said in 2001. \"I feel rather proud in having succeeded.\"\n"}, {"author": "Colin Butler", "title": "COVID-19 could cool London's busy spring real estate market before it begins", "description": "Many people looking to buy or sell a home now might be reconsidering ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-real-estate-1.5512935", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5512945.1585352153!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/real-estate-london-ont.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 30, 2020 5:00 AM ET", "2020-03-30T10:14:10.772Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "London's busy spring real estate market will likely see a slow down before it even gets started, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic that's sweeping the globe.\nThe virus has closed schools, businesses, sent stock markets tumbling and put entire industries on pause.\nHere in London, the city is not immune to the same forces that are currently reshaping the world. With so many moving pieces around the coronavirus crisis, realtors say there's no telling what long-term\u00a0effect this will have on the market.\u00a0\nFebruary sales data will be released this week.\u00a0London and St Thomas Association of Realtors president Blair Campbell said local realtors are bracing for a hit.\u00a0\n\"I think we can say we're anticipating a slow down,\" he said. \"The spring market, until a couple weeks ago, looked like it was going to be a full steam ahead situation and then COVID-19 happened.\"\nWith the average price of a home in London beating analysts' expectations\u00a0for 2020\u00a0in the first month of the year, all signs pointed to a repeat of the city's record-breaking 2017 real estate season.\u00a0\nThere were 568 homes sold in January, just two homes\u00a0short of the all-time record for the month. Last month saw 740 homes trade hands, the second best February on record.\u00a0\nThe association\u00a0has yet to release figures for March.\u00a0Chances are it's not going to reflect the kind of brisk sales the region saw in the first two months of 2020.\u00a0\n\"Unfortunately we don't have stats as of yet,\" Campbell said. \"Certainly we are still seeing sales activity taking place and hopefully it is emergency activity.\"\nPeople need homes. So when the\u00a0Ontario government ordered some industries to push pause on economic activity until the outbreak has run its course, real estate was deemed an essential service.\u00a0\nBecause of that, homes can still be bought and sold, even during the pandemic, but\u00a0the association\u00a0is strongly urging its members to only do so in the event of an \"emergency.\"\n\"How do you define what an emergency is? It's kind of by a case-by-case situation,\" Campbell said. \"We have clients who are mid-transaction and we want to make sure they're able to close.

But unlike traditional IPOs, Saudi Aramco offered no hoped-for price range for its shares nor any idea how much of the firm would be offered to investors on Riyadh's Tadawul stock exchange.\nAnalysts say the kingdom likely hopes local investors will push its share prices toward a desired $2 trillion US valuation and buoy that price ahead of any possible further listing abroad. Saudi Aramco also made a point in its filings to highlight its profitability and low costs through newly released data once held as a state secret by the Al Saud royal family, euphemistically referred to by the company as its \"current shareholder.\"\nHowever, economic worries, the trade war between China and the United States\u00a0and increased crude oil production by the U.S. has depressed energy prices. A Sept. 14 attack on the heart of Saudi Aramco already spooked some investors, with one ratings company already downgrading the oil giant.\n\"We want to share the Aramco shares with the citizens of Saudi Arabia,\" said Yasir al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. \"We want to get financial investors from all over the world.\"\nIt's hard to overstate the power of the oil firm, known formally as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. It produces over 10 million barrels of crude oil a day, some 10 per cent\u00a0of global demand. The firm's net income in 2018 was $111.1 billion, far beyond the combined net income of oil giants BP PLC, Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SA.\nSources say Aramco could offer one to two per cent of its shares on the local bourse, raising as much as $20\u00a0billion to $40 billion. A deal over $25 billion\u00a0would top the\u00a0record-breaking one of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014.\nSaudi Arabia's oil sits close to the surface in large pools, making it far cheaper to extract. Saudi Aramco also has proven liquid reserves of 226.8 billion barrels, the largest of any company in the world and \"approximately five times larger\" than those held by the five oil giants, according to the firm's IPO documents.\nThat's led to a clamouring from investors for Saudi Aramco stock since Prince Mohammed announced plans in 2016 for a two-phase IPO of 5 per cent\u00a0of the firm in the kingdom and abroad. The prince hopes to raise some $100 billion from investors, which will be funnelled into the kingdom's PIF sovereign wealth fund for projects to boost employment and major development projects.\n\"I believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco,\" Prince Mohammed told The Economist magazine in 2016 in announcing his plans.\nBut the planned IPO saw years of delays over valuation concerns and where to list it abroad. Oil prices, once over $100\u00a0a barrel, crashed in 2014 to under $30 a barrel. Benchmark Brent crude now trades around $60 a barrel, pushed up by a production cut by OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia and those outside of the cartel like Russia. Those cuts have limited Saudi production, in turn pushing up its estimated government budget deficit for next year to nearly $50 billion.\nThe announcement by the Capital Market Authority offered no timeline, share price or percentage of the company to be offered in the IPO, nor did officials or documents later released by Aramco. Both al-Rumayyan and Saudi Aramco CEO and president Amin H. Nasser also declined to say whether an international listing would still happen as well when addressing journalists in Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia, the city that hosts Saudi Aramco's headquarters.\n\"Usually when you go for an IPO, you have a target price,\" said Capt. Ranjith Raja, an oil analyst at data firm Refinitiv. \"There's still no clarity in what they're trying to look at.\"\nBased on that, Saudi Arabia may choose to rely on local investors to push up the price of the stock, Raja said.\nThe prospectus for the IPO will be issued on Nov. 9, Nasser said\u00a0Sunday.\nThe Saudi-owned satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported last week, citing anonymous sources, that pricing for the stock will begin Nov. 17. A final price for the stock will be set Dec. 4, with shares then beginning to be traded on the Tadawul on Dec. 11, the channel reported. The channel is believed to have close links to the\u00a0Al Saud royal family and correctly identified Sunday as the IPO's launch.\nRaja predicts\u00a0the offering will \"generate a huge amount of interest as soon as it opens.\"\nAnalysts say a $2 trillion\u00a0valuation \u2014 Apple and Microsoft separately for instance are $1 trillion \u2014 may be a stretch. By announcing the start of the IPO on Sunday, Prince Mohammed may have been convinced to take a lower valuation in order to get the IPO moving.\nSaudi Aramco has sought to assure investors, given the questions over its valuation and the potential hazards of future attacks or geopolitical risk. A presentation posted to Aramco's website last month announced the intent to offer a $75 billion dividend for investors in 2020. That's the payment per share that a corporation distributes to its stockholders as their return on the money they have invested in its stock.\nIt also pledged that some 2020 through 2024, any year with a dividend under $75 billion would see \"non-government shareholders\" prioritized to get paid.\nBut beyond the stocks, worries persist that Saudi Arabia could be hit by another attack like the one Sept. 14, which temporarily halved its production. The U.S. blames the attack on Iran. Tehran denies it launched the cruise missiles and drones used in the assault. Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility, but analysts say the weapons used wouldn't have the range to reach their targets from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.\nResponding to a journalist's question about the safety of an Aramco investment, al-Rumayyan spoke about how quickly the company restored production after the attack.\n\"The oil traders, they saw this as a nonevent, and that means it is really safe,\" he said. \"That's what the money is saying.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Boost for Saudi Arabia as Aramco shares surge 10% on debut", "description": "Crown prince trying to diversify economy away from oil", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boost-for-saudi-arabia-as-aramco-shares-surge-10-on-debut-1.5391949", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5391951.1576056733!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/saudi-aramco-ipo-investors.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 11, 2019 4:47 AM ET", "2019-12-11T09:47:43.968Z"], "source": null, "content": "Saudi Aramco shares surged the maximum permitted 10 per cent\u00a0above their initial public offering (IPO) price on their Riyadh stock market debut on Wednesday, closing in on the $2 trillion US valuation long sought by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\nThe shares leapt to 35.2 riyal ($9.39) each, up from the IPO price of 32 riyals and at the daily limit of price moves allowed by the Tadawul exchange.\nThat gives the state-owned oil giant a market value of about $1.88 trillion, comfortably making it the world's most valuable listed company, although it will have one of the smallest \"free floats\" of publicly tradeable shares, at just 1.5 per cent.\nBy comparison, U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil has a market capitalisation of less than $300 billion, while U.S. tech giant Apple is valued at about $1.2 trillion.\nSaudi Arabian Oil Co (Aramco) raised a record $25.6 billion in its IPO last week, the culmination of a years-long effort by the crown prince to open up the energy giant to outside investors and raise funds to help diversify the economy away from oil.\nThe flotation, a major challenge for the Riyadh stock exchange, propels the bourse into the world's top 10 by value of listed companies.\nBut Saudi Arabia relied on mainly domestic and regional investors to buy Aramco shares after lukewarm interest from abroad.\n\"This is a successful IPO and the Aramco listing will add depth to the local market by providing exposure to a vital sector of Saudi Arabia's economy,\" said Bassel Khatoun, managing director, frontier and MENA at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity.\n\"We are hopeful that Saudi Aramco uses the Tadawul listing as a springboard to an eventual international listing.\"\nAramco shares began trading half an hour after the market open as the Saudi bourse allowed extra time for the \"opening auction\" period when investors place their bids, in anticipation of high levels of activity.\nAramco chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan and Tadawul's top executives rang the bell to start dealing in Aramco shares. Within the first hour of trading, 766.8 million shares had changed hands, more than for any other Riyadh listed stock.\nAramco stock will become part of Tadawul index by next week and global benchmarks such as MSCI and FTSE later this month, which analysts said should fuel demand, particularly from investors who track such indexes.\nThe Saudi index was up 0.9 per cent\u00a0in early trade.\n\"Aramco's strong debut is not surprising, given that most regional managers were under-allocated in the name and hence it was natural to expect a significantly higher number of bids than offers,\" said Nishit Lakhotia, head of research at Bahrain-based securities firm SICO.\n\"We also believe QFIs (qualified foreign investor) buying will start from next week led by MSCI and then FTSE led inclusions, which may also act as a support for the stock at higher levels.\"\nSaudi retail investors who hold their shares for six months from the first day of trading can get up to 100 bonus shares, or one for every 10 held, which could limit the supply of shares on the market, said Zachary Cefaratti, CEO of Dalma Capital.\nAramco will have the second biggest weighting on the Tadawul index of 9.7 per cent, according to Al Rajhi Capital. Al Rajhi Bank has the biggest weighting at 14.6% due to its larger free float.\nEarlier this month, Tadawul introduced an index weighting cap of 15 per cent\u00a0to address concerns about the potential impact of Aramco's flotation and limit the index's correlation to the oil price.\nAramco's debut comes as oil prices are being supported by a Saudi-orchestrated move by OPEC and oil producing allies to commit to some of the industry's deepest output cuts in a decade to try to avert oversupply.\nBut Riyadh scaled back its global ambitions by only listing Aramco on the Tadawul and cancelling roadshows in New York and London due to muted interest from foreign investors.\nMost actively managed funds said they would likely steer clear of the IPO, citing concerns about governance, the environment and regional geopolitics, according to information provided to Reuters by 26 major asset managers outside the Gulf region.\nIf Aramco shares gain 10 per cent\u00a0on both Wednesday and Thursday, it will exceed the $2 trillion valuation coveted by Prince Mohammed. The company is expected to be included in the MSCI emerging markets index on Dec. 17.\nSaudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told Reuters last week he believed Aramco was worth more than its $1.7 trillion IPO valuation. \"I cannot wait to see the faces of people who missed that opportunity and how they will be chewing their thumbs,\" the minister said, calling those who invested \"friends and family\" set to benefit from any future rise in its value.\nAramco has not named its investors during the IPO process, but sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) were among Gulf sovereign funds to buy shares.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian companies feeling the pinch as coronavirus takes toll on their business prospects", "description": "Sectors from retail to air travel, mining and manufacturing are bracing for impact", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-coronavirus-business-1.5443045", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2602661.1396972977!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-us-cinema-chain.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 28, 2020 11:47 AM ET", "2020-01-28T20:12:23.039Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canadian companies are starting to feel the pinch of the\u00a0coronavirus epidemic as they call off trips and watch their stock values slide.\nThe S&P/TSX composite index in Canada had its worst trading day in nearly four months on Monday, dropping more than 100 points before partly rebounding Tuesday morning.\nImax Corp. says it postponed the release of five films after China's more than 60,000 movie theatres shut down, including the company's more than 600 locations.

That's half an inch larger than the nets they've been using for decades.\nThe 3.5-inch\u00a0mesh allows smaller walleye, sauger and other species to escape and spawn.

That led fishers long\u00a0at odds with\u00a0biologists \u2014 and fearful the province was siding with the angling industry over commercial fish harvesting \u2014 to vote to dissolve a co-management board with the province, set up their own collective and procure research they hoped will serve as a counter-narrative to the notion walleye are in trouble.\nThat research has not been completed. Sveinson accused the province of holding back data.\u00a0\nHe and Isfeld\u00a0say they are wary of spending money to purchase larger-mesh nets, only to catch fish they can not sell.\nPedersen said he's spoken to federal Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan about a net-buyback program that could help Manitoba fishers part with their old nets and buy new ones.\nPedersen said it remains unclear whether Manitoba fisheries will receive a penny from a $62.5-million kitty set aside by the Trudeau government to assist Canadian commercial fishers.\nIsfeld\u00a0said Manitoba fishers were\u00a0hoping to be compensated to keep their boats in harbour this summer. He's calling it a \"pay-not-to-fish program,\" rather than a buyback program, because the commercial fishers only want to sit out one season.\nPedersen said commercial fishers may also apply for the federal Canada Emergency Response Benefit or $6,000 small-business loans.\nHe said commercial fishers must realize they are not the only segment of the economy in trouble during the pandemic.\n\"Whether it's your corner store or whether it's a large industry or whether it's the fishing industry, everybody is just in unprecedented hurt from this pandemic,\" he said.\u00a0\"It's not much consolation, the knowledge you're in a large crowd of businesses that are hurting, but they're not unique.\"\nIsfeld\u00a0said the new regulation could spell the end of a 125-year-old commercial fishery.\n\"If this mesh size sticks, if the province does this to us, guys want permanent buyouts, because we won't be able to catch the fish the market wants,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Trump considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges", "description": "Move", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-considering-delisting-chinese-companies-from-u-s-stock-exchanges-1.5300242", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5300252.1569605988!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/alibaba-nyse.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 27, 2019 1:44 PM ET", "2019-09-27T17:44:05.819Z"], "source": null, "content": "President Donald Trump's administration is considering the possibility of delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, a source briefed on the matter said on Friday, in what would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the two countries.\nThe move would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investments into China, the source said, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg that sent shockwaves through financial markets.\nShares of Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI fell between 2 per cent\u00a0to 4 per cent\u00a0in afternoon trading.\nChina's yuan currency, traded in off shore markets, fell by 0.4 per cent\u00a0against the dollar after the news to trade near its weakest against the greenback in about three weeks.\nExact mechanisms for how to delist the companies were yet to be worked out and any plan is subject to approval by President Donald Trump, who has given the green light to the discussion, Bloomberg reported citing a person close to the deliberations.\nOfficials are also examining how the U.S. could put limits on the Chinese companies included in stock indexes managed by U.S. firms, although it was not clear how that would be done, the agency cited three sources as saying.\nA bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers in June introduced a bill to force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits or face delisting.\nChinese authorities have long been reluctant to allow overseas regulators to inspect local accounting firms - including member firms of the Big Four international accounting networks \u2014\u00a0citing national security concerns.\nAs of February, there were 156 Chinese companies listed on the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchanges, according to government data, including at least 11 state-owned firms.\u00a0\nNYSE declined to comment on Friday while Nasdaq, MSCI, S&P and FTSE Russell all did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nTrade talks between the United States and China are expected to resume next month after months of tit-for-tat moves by both sides which have weakened global growth and driven rollercoaster moves in markets.\n\"It's all very disruptive, it just adds to uncertainty and its a big negative for business investment,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist at investment bank Raymond James.

U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to restrict travel from most European countries to try to contain what he called a \"foreign virus\" isn't grounded in science and breaks international law, experts say.\u00a0Trump announced the month-long travel ban earlier this week to restrict passenger arrivals from 26 European nations that he said \"seeded\" the virus. Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease consultant and microbiologist at Toronto's Sinai Health Network, said the ban is not evidence-based. \"What the science tells you is that travel bans are not nearly effective as you think they might be,\" she\u00a0said.\u00a0Read more on reaction to Trump's travel ban.

You can send us your questions via email at\u00a0COVID@cbc.ca\u00a0and we'll answer as many as we can. We'll publish a selection of answers every weekday on our website, and we're also putting some of your questions to the experts on the air during\u00a0The National\u00a0and\u00a0CBC\u00a0News Network.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo far we've received thousands of emails from all corners of the country, including a number of questions about serology tests to how\u00a0long the virus lasts in your beard, like\u00a0this question from Parmod L.\u00a0\nHere's a question from Parmod L. that stumped us. We know the virus persists on different surfaces like cardboard and plastic for varying amounts of time. But what about beards and facial hair?\n\"We get asked about it all the time,\" says Dr. Scott Weese, a veterinary professor at the University of Guelph who researches emerging infectious diseases and infection control.\nNo one knows for sure.\nWhat epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists do know is that the novel coronavirus can't tolerate most environments, including beards.\nWeese says the virus would likely last on beards for hours \u2014 not days.\nDr. Sumon Chakrabarti, infectious disease specialist at Trillium Health Partners, echoes those sentiments.\n\"Once the virus is in the environment and out of its natural habitat in the respiratory tract, it doesn't do so well,\" Chakrabarti said, estimating it can remain active on a beard for several minutes.\u00a0\n\"Theoretically, after a fresh cough or sneeze by someone with a beard, and then someone else happens to immediately kiss that person, there is the risk of transmission.\"\nThat's part of the reason why public health officials, and Health Canada\u00a0continue to advise Canadians to wash their hands frequently with soap and water, stay home as much as possible, and practice physical distancing.\nLots of questions are coming into our inbox about COVID-19 blood tests, including this one from Arshad Q. The COVID-19 blood test, also known as a serology test, delivers results in about 15 minutes, revealing whether someone has ever had the infection and, subsequently, if they've recovered.\n\"That's very valuable information because the current understanding is that if you've been infected and recovered, you're likely immune to this infection for a period of time and likely throughout the course of this pandemic,\" says Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious disease specialist at the University Health Network.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile the test is being used in other parts of the world, it hasn't been approved in Canada just yet.\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the test is still under review, and the World Health Organization has not issued any recommendations about using it.\u00a0\nBogoch explains the test could be important, especially when it comes time to lift public health restrictions and decide when Canadians will be allowed to go back to work.\nHe said the test could help put people who have recovered from the illness at the front of the line to resume work because\u00a0they would theoretically be immune, which could help avoid another outbreak.\nWith the virus taking a serious toll on the economy, many retirees are facing the decimation of their hard-earned investment portfolios. Helen R. wants to know what retirees should do about their investments and what government assistance is in place for them.\u00a0\nDavid Sung, financial expert and\u00a0president of Nicola Wealth, said\u00a0when markets slide, there's little you can do to prevent investment losses, but he urged retiree and seniors not to panic.\n\"Over the past 90 years there have been many stock market crashes and many bear markets and after each one of these the market has gone on to new highs,\" said\u00a0Sung.\nThe government has also said it will relax Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) rules. Retirees can take out less money than previously mandated minimums. This should mean they won't have to cash in as many investments at today's much lower values, and give those assets time to recover.\nHowever, this measure won't be useful to retirees who can't afford to withdraw less money. One way to minimize the damage could be to take\u00a0RRIF payments monthly, instead of in one annual payment. At the very least, this could soften the market's blow over the course of a year, says Shannon Lee Simmons, certified financial planner and founder of The New School of Finance.\nA good takeaway from this turmoil? Going forward, \"retirees should also ensure their portfolios generate the cash flow that they require so that they don't put themselves in a position to cash out investments.\"\u00a0\nAnd if you do depend on drawing down capital, says Sung, \"you're going to want to know that your portfolio has capital in a safe place such as bonds and fixed income.\"\nAs usual, after a crash\u00a0is the worst time to react,\u00a0say experts.\u00a0\n\"I think staying the course \u2026 is the smartest and calmest thing to do right now.\"\nChildren have a lot of questions about COVID-19, including this one asked by Parker on The National during their COVID-19: Ask the Doctors segment.\nTypically, the virus persists in your body for 14 days, but emerging research suggests it could be longer.\u00a0\nSo what happens when the virus is inside? Well, once it enters your body, which generally happens through the eyes, nose, or mouth, it starts making copies of itself. These replications actually trigger the COVID-19 symptoms, says\u00a0Dr. Dina Kulik, pediatrician at the clinic Kidcrew Medical.\nWhile the virus is replicating, your immune system is also working to fight it off.\u00a0\n\"Your body will start to recognize it [COVID-19] is foreign and start to attack it,\" says Kulik. \"That's when you start to get better and less contagious.\"\nWe're also answering your questions every night on The National.

In its first day of trading, it soared to a valuation of $1.9 trillion.\nFor context, Apple was trading at a mere $1.2 trillion.\n\"[Aramco] pumps 10 per cent or more of global crude supplies,\" said\u00a0Scotiabank commodities economist Rory Johnston. \"It produces more than two times the amount of oil produced in all of Canada.\"\nAramco's size and scope is hard to fathom. It is the sole oil company in Saudi Arabia and it has, by far, the lowest costs of any oil producer in the world. To produce a barrel of crude, Johnston said it costs Aramco \"probably somewhere in the ballpark of five to 10 dollars.\" By contrast, a barrel in Alberta's oil sands costs up to $30 US to produce.\n\"It's not just the largest oil company, it's also by a long shot the most profitable oil company,\" said Johnston.\nThe Saudi kingdom has been talking about selling some shares of its prized oil giant for years. It has said it wants to use the money to help diversify away from such a strong reliance on fossil fuels. It only offered about 1.5 per cent of the company for public listing. The rest remains firmly in the hands of Saudi's autocratic royal family.\nBut the IPO comes during a rough time for global oil producers. Crude prices have fallen (again) and investments in energy projects have\u00a0dried up. Aramco's prospectus predicted peak global demand would come by 2040, but some oil analysts say it could happen as\u00a0early as next decade.\u00a0\nFew believed the oil giant would reach its lofty valuation target of $2 trillion. Many valued the company closer to\u00a0$1.2 trillion. Still, the Saudis stuck to their guns. Just last week, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said it was only a matter of time before the sceptics would be eating their words.\n\"In a few months from now \u2026 I wouldn't call them by names, but I think they would probably like not to have written those pieces that they have written,\" said the prince. \"We will get Aramco and it will be higher than the two trillion [dollars], and I can bet that this will happen.\"\nIn a lot of ways, the global downturn in oil and gas is why Aramco is so incredibly valuable. Jackie Forrest, the director of Arc Energy Research, said the company made a staggering $111 billion in profit last year.\nIn an episode of her podcast, Arc Energy Ideas, Forrest said other oil companies will struggle to make money if prices remain low.\u00a0But Aramco will just keep grinding out profits.\n\"Because you're so low-cost,\" said Forrest, \"even when prices get very low, you can still provide a return to investors.\"\nOil industry legend Daniel Yergin at consultancy IHS Markit called Aramco an \"asset class of one.\"\nThere simply is no other company like it \u2014 but that cuts both ways.\nIt's solely owned by the royal family of Saudi Arabia, a country that is not a democracy and where there is no outside accountability.\n\"This is an absolute monarchy. One of the few left in the world,\" said Ellen Wald, author of of the 2018 book Saudi Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom's Pursuit of Profit and Power.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Saudi monarchy is currently at war in Yemen, has a long and well-documented history of human rights abuses and has faced international outrage over the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But the government has no obligation to tell shareholders what it will do with the money they invest in Aramco.\n\"The money is going to go to the Saudi government,\" said Wald. \"And they're going to use that money for whatever ends they want. They say they want to use it to diversify the economy to make investments. But we don't know that's how they're going to use the money.\"\nIndeed, as long as it has\u00a0existed, Aramco has been shrouded in secrecy.\u00a0Forrest said that has kept investors guessing for her entire career.\n\"In the past, people literally made a living trying to predict some of the stuff that's now in the prospectus and available to read,\" she said.\nTransitioning from total control to at least some required transparency may prove difficult for Aramco. Johnston said the original plan was a split listing on stock exchanges in London, New York and Riyadh. But concerns were raised that assets in New York could be open to seizure in the event of lawsuits against the Saudi government.\u00a0\nSome believe the level of transparency required in New York and London were simply too much, too quick. Johnston said those concerns may have helped erode estimates of how much the company would be worth.\n\"Part of it was the downturn in the price of oil. Part of it was the degree of transparency that was required in disclosures by some of the exchanges,\" said Johnston.\nIn the end, Aramco listed on the Riyadh exchange to a primarily domestic clientele, where the Saudi royal family maintains strict control.\nHundreds of Saudi businessmen and princes were detained at the Riyadh Ritz Carlton in an anti-corruption crackdown in 2017. At the time, many saw it as a\u00a0consolidation of power\u00a0and a purge of rivals by\u00a0Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. If the Saudi government required its wealthier citizens to buy shares in Aramco or hold them longer than they intended, there's not much question that it could.\nThe IPO will test whether investors still have an appetite for oil and gas. The same issues plaguing the energy sector in Alberta are hurting investment around the world. There's just too much oil sloshing around world markets right now.\nAramco's differences when it comes to operating costs and access to oil reserves set it apart. Jackie Forrest calls Aramco the \"crown jewels\" of the oil industry, and there's no question the company will last longer and remain profitable longer than any of its rivals. But Wald wondered if investors would be \"comfortable supporting the monarchy.\"\u00a0\nThe answer came as soon as trading began. Aramco's shares soared in value.\n"}, {"author": "Ian Froese", "title": "Manitoba government promises 'emergency-ready' 2020 budget", "description": "Tax cuts are even more necessary in uncertain financial times, Finance Minister Scott Fielding says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-2020-budget-emergency-proof-tax-relief-1.5492948", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5395825.1576264642!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mba-budget-update-20191213.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 11, 2020 5:00 AM CT", "2020-03-11T10:00:00.368Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Brian Pallister's Progressive Conservative government is confident it can slash taxes, even while the global market surrounding it is under extreme stress.\nThe Manitoba government will test that belief Wednesday, when it reveals\u00a0a spending plan for 2020 that\u00a0is expected to cut taxes, while still plotting a course toward a balanced budget amid a precarious worldwide economy.\n\"I would suggest to you with uncertain times, it's more than important to provide some tax relief to small and medium-sized businesses,\" Finance Minister Scott Fielding said\u00a0Tuesday.\nFielding was speaking at Fort Richmond Collegiate, where his government announced\u00a0it would ease the payroll tax,\u00a0exempting an estimated 220 employers\u00a0from paying it.\nThat's not the only tax relief his government is promising. Last week, Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister vowed to cut the provincial sales tax\u00a0by another percentage point this year \u2014 a repeat of his\u00a0signature 2016 election promise, which the province delivered on in last year's budget, when the PST was dropped to seven per cent.\nPallister said his government will\u00a0use revenues from a new provincial carbon tax to pay for the drop to a six per cent PST.\nTaken together, the province is\u00a0whittling away at its own revenues even as oil prices plunge, stock prices stumble and the spread of COVID-19 threatens to hamstring the economy.\u00a0\nFielding was confident\u00a0on Tuesday the Manitoba government can weather the storm, saying he will table\u00a0the\u00a0\"most emergency-ready budget\" in the province's history.\n\"We've taken moves\u00a0even before these situations came up with the coronavirus, as well as others,\" Fielding said.\nHe referenced the $400-million injection last year into the rainy-day fund, a reserve account\u00a0for unforeseen\u00a0emergencies such as flooding.\u00a0\nFielding said there will be other measures\u00a0in the 2020 budget\u00a0to ensure the province can withstand a challenging economic market.\n\"We'll also be outlining some projections we have taken in consideration with the\u00a0recent events \u2026 to make sure that we're comfortable in terms of the numbers,\" the finance minister said.\nFor now, Fielding said\u00a0\"we've planned well, we've budgeted well and we think that there's a lot of contingencies that are in place.\"\nPremier Pallister said his government is in a more comfortable position today than when the NDP was in power. The province's deficit has been shaved from $932\u00a0million in 2016 to a forecast\u00a0$325 million.\n\"We're trying to be ready for the worst, but hope for the best,\" he told reporters. \"We're acting out of a sincere degree of caution, obviously, given the uncertainty of the circumstances.\"\nBut he warned against overreacting. A\u00a0government cannot bounce from crisis to crisis while\u00a0dismissing the challenges ahead, Pallister said.\n\"People are wanting,\u00a0I think, their\u00a0government\u00a0\u2026\u00a0to do their best to prepare for the eventualities that may ensue, while at the same time not unnecessarily feeding a sense of panic.\"\nNDP Leader Wab Kinew\u00a0questioned whether the government is prepared for a slumping economy.\n\"When we parse\u00a0the words that we've heard from the premier and the finance minister, it looks like they're just using the typical range of projections that they have in every year's budget, that every government does, but we should recognize that we are potentially at a more severe inflection point,\" he said.\n\"I think that the government should be taking the worst-case scenario options more seriously and should be putting in place measures to respond to that,\" Kinew said, suggesting the province could set aside money to put people to work.\u00a0\nManitoba Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont said the province shouldn't discount its own oil sector, which is being battered by sinking\u00a0prices.\nAn economic dip\u00a0of any kind would exacerbate the\u00a0debt troubles\u00a0of individuals\u00a0and governments, Lamont said. He has called for\u00a0mass debt forgiveness to give people a break.\u00a0\nNeither Pallister nor Fielding were willing on Tuesday to tease additional\u00a0contents of the budget.\u00a0\nThe already-announced cuts to the PST and payroll tax will be highlighted in the\u00a0spending plan, along with $45 million on flood-prevention projects, as\u00a0a recent mandate letter to a government minister revealed.\nThe Progressive Conservatives are expected to move toward fulfilling some of the campaign promises they made in last fall's election, such as cutting the PST from fees for preparing wills, as well as from home insurance and salon services over $50.\nThe province will again\u00a0offer\u00a0basket funding\u00a0for the City of Winnipeg to use as it sees fit,\u00a0Municipal Relations Minister Rochelle Squires told reporters on\u00a0Monday.\u00a0\nShe said she spoke with Mayor Brian Bowman that day about their government's shared priorities of building\u00a0\"climate resiliency\"\u00a0and flood protection.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1704609859541", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/programs/daybreaknorth/full-episode-for-monday-november-18-2019-daybreak-north-1.5364235", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Peloton shares decline on 1st day of trading", "description": "Shares of connected exercise machine company opened at $27 US but changed hands at $26.55", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/peloton-shares-decline-first-day-of-trading-1.5298732", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5298744.1569527106!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/financial-markets-wall-street-peloton-ipo.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 26, 2019 3:54 PM ET", "2019-09-26T19:54:20.467Z"], "source": null, "content": "Shares of connected exercise machine company Peloton are drifting lower in their first day of public trading.\nThe New York company's stock opened at $27 US.

As of November 2018, nearly 950 units have been sold.\u00a0\nThe province has also greatly reduced annual capital repair investments in social housing from $120 million in 2015-16 to $25.6 million in 2018-19 and has eliminated a number of jointly funded home repair/modification programs.\nIn 2017, the federal government announced a 10-year, $40 billion National Housing Strategy to \"help reduce homelessness and improve the availability and quality of housing for Canadians in need.\"\u00a0The strategy aims to \"remove 530,000 Canadians from housing need and reduce chronic homelessness,\" a February announcement says.\nManitoba was slow to get on board, but in June 2019 it signed an agreement with Canada.\nHousing advocates hope this will provide much-needed investments in social housing and shelter benefits.\nHowever, the KPMG report Phase 2 Report Business Case \u2014 Social Housing, commissioned by the province in 2016, outlines a different vision, and the Pallister government has been following its recommendations.\u00a0\nThe province has decreased the number of households that qualify for the Rent Assist benefit and eligible low-income renters receive less. People living in social housing have seen their rents increase and privatization plans are ramping up.\nThe private market has always been a supplier of housing for low-income people, but it has failed to provide affordable housing. This led to the development of Rent Assist under the previous NDP government \u2014 a shelter benefit for low-income renters in the private market. But private market rents across Manitoba increased last year by approximately four per cent. This, along with cuts to Rent Assist, has put many households at risk of homelessness.\nThe failure of the private market to meet the needs of low-income households suggests a need for more social housing, where rents are aligned with income, but that is not part of the plan.\nThe report by accounting firm KPMG outlines three options, none of which include seeking new ways to increase revenues to build and maintain social housing. All options result in the privatization of the Manitoba Housing portfolio.\nKPMG's recommended option is described as a \"hybrid\" where tenants \"requiring the least support [would] receive a voucher towards rent from a private landlord and most vulnerable tenants [would be] allocated to a social house provided under contract between government and a private provider.\"\nKPMG claims that \"most jurisdictions\" operate under a similar model. They specifically point to the U.K., Australia and New Zealand as examples that have moved away from social housing.\nThey don't offer an assessment of how well this model is working.\nThe privatization of social housing in the U.K. dates back to former prime minister Margaret Thatcher's 1980 Right to Buy policy, which enabled tenants to purchase publicly owned housing.\u00a0\nMuch has been written about the devastating impact this policy has had for low-income households.\nThe UK's Shelter charity estimates that 1.2 million people\u00a0are on waiting lists and with only 5,000 homes built last year, many more are\u00a0required to meet the needs of low-income households.\u00a0\nIn 2014, Scotland opted out of Right to Buy and has since reinvested in the development and maintenance of social housing.\u00a0\nAustralia has lost some 20,000 public housing units in a decade due to a gradual but steady focus on transferring ownership to the community sector.\u00a0\nAdvocates have raised a number of concerns, including overcrowding, growing waiting lists and an increase in homelessness. They note that non-profit and for-profit managers are less accountable to tenants, offer less secure leases, and have no obligations to fill vacancies.\nResearch by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI) concludes that 25 years of inadequate investment has resulted in a serious shortfall and direct public investment is the best way to tackle the issue.\u00a0\nHousing in New Zealand is some of the most expensive in the world.\u00a0\nAs in other countries, social housing has eroded and there has been little appetite to reverse the decline.\nNew Zealand has been criticized for focusing too much on home ownership, leaving far too many renters vulnerable. Economist Shamubeel Eaqub argues that the government should switch its attention to building rental properties instead, and a 2017 report by New Zealand's Salvation Army Social Policy and Parliamentary Unit describes a growing need for social housing.\u00a0\nHousing advocates have long argued that the best way to address the housing needs of low-income Manitobans is by increasing the supply of social housing, adequately maintaining it, and providing adequate support to tenants. Ideally that housing would be publicly owned and administered to ensure public accountability.\nSalvation Army New Zealand sums up the challenge well: \"Until there is some acceptance that there is a permanent and growing demand for social housing \u2026 we are unlikely to fully appreciate both the commitment we need to give to such housing and the potential it has to materially improve the lives of the most vulnerable.\"\u00a0\nKPMG is not entirely off the mark by pointing to Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. as examples \u2014 but more accurately, examples of what NOT to do.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

That includes graffiti artist Banksy, office supply chain Staples,\u00a0and thousands of home-based businesses all over the world.\nAmazon has twice the\u00a0number of sellers, but the speed at which Shopify is growing has financial analysts buzzing.\u00a0\n\"There's obviously a very large divide between the No. 1 and No. 2 competitors in e-commerce,\" says Ken Wong of Wall Street firm Guggenheim Partners. \"But eBay was previously in second place.\"\nHe's talking about Shopify's value on the stock market, which surpassed that of eBay earlier this year. It currently stands at about $35.5 billion US, compared with $29.5 billion for eBay. Amazon's market value is $873.9 billion.\nInvestors were excited about Shopify even before it listed its stock for $17 on the New York Stock Exchange in 2015. On the first day, it closed at $28.31. As of this writing, shares were trading at $309, even after a third-quarter earnings decline. (The stock is also listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.)\nTo consumers, though, the company is practically invisible. It's not a marketplace with huge brand-name recognition like Amazon. But that's part of the appeal for merchants who use Shopify. Their own brand can be front and centre.\u00a0\nNew York University professor and business commentator Scott Galloway put it this way in a video on his popular YouTube channel:\u00a0 \"Amazon partners with companies the way a virus partners with a host \u2026. Amazon sits on top of a data set and leverages these data and learnings to buttress its own private label brands and always \u2014 always \u2014 its own brand is put forward. It owns the consumer relationship.\"\nHe says Shopify's business model is the opposite. \"It's the perfect partner for brands looking to build their own business.\"\nAmazon begs to differ. In a response to an inquiry from CBC News, a spokesperson wrote: \"Canadian small and medium-sized businesses collectively exceeded over CAD $900 million in sales on Amazon Canada's online stores in 2018,\" adding that the same group sold over $2 billion worth of goods to Amazon customers abroad.\nEntrepreneurs like Jenn Harper of St. Catharines, Ont., who has a brand of cosmetics called Cheekbone Beauty, uses both Shopify and Amazon to sell her products. She says it was easy to set up an online store using the Shopify tools.\n\"I'm a 42-year-old who didn't grow up with tech in hand,\" says Harper. \"Without Shopify, I don't think this would have been possible for someone like me to have this kind of successful online shop. It wouldn't have worked.\"\nHarper was able to add text and photos to a user-friendly template to create her company website. The Shopify programs also help her with payments, marketing, shipping and customer-engagement tools.\nHer one complaint is that the Canadian company charges its customers in U.S. dollars.\n\"I pay $79 a month, and that's USD,\" says Harper. \"When you look at some of their online reviews and community reviews, some people feel duped a little bit by that.\"\u00a0\nCBC News inquired to Shopify about the rationale to bill in American currency, but a spokesperson only reiterated that it's the company's policy.\u00a0\nShopify executives insist they don't aspire to conquer Amazon.\n\"I mean listen, I've seen all of the comments around that,\" says Hana Abaza, director of marketing for Shopify Plus. She says the company is focused on its own business. \"I think what Shopify does and the problems we try and solve is really guided by what's in the best interest of our merchants.\"\nAbaza says that's why the company is investing a billion dollars into setting up it own fulfilment network, to help merchants with the delivery of goods. \"Anything we build, any direction we go, is what's best for our merchants.\"\nHowever, analysts took Shopify's announcement in June that it will build a fulfilment network \u2014 to deliver orders within two days \u2014 as a sign that the company does intend to go head-to-head with Amazon, which has close to 200 fulfilment centres around the globe.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Shopify's plan is to cobble together a bunch of third-party logistics centres to create a broader network that could be more competitive, and mirror what Amazon is doing internally,\" says analyst Ken Wong.\n\"At this stage, they haven't announced which ones have signed on as partners. From our knowledge there are at least two. To enable an Amazon Prime-like experience you would need five to eight fairly well distributed warehouses.\"\nShopify and Amazon actually work together in a number of ways. Four years ago, Amazon closed its own Webstore service for merchants, recommending its sellers use\u00a0Shopify\u00a0instead. Shopify stock jumped 20 per cent on the news.\nIts stock got another 10 per cent boost in January 2017, when Shopify announced it would allow its merchants to sell on Amazon from their Shopify online stores.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut Shopify's share price peaked this summer at over $500, and has dropped significantly since then.\u00a0 Financial results for the quarter ending September 30 showed a $72 million loss, due to spending on the new fulfilment network. Some investors opted to sell, sending\u00a0the stock price down yet again, even though revenue was up 45 per cent year-over-year.\nFor Canadians who have watched proudly as other homegrown tech companies have taken their products global, there could be a nervous sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at Shopify's remarkable growth. Although the company now operates in more than 40 countries, offers its services in 18 languages, and notched a billion in revenue for the first time this year \u2014 as the trajectories of Nortel and BlackBerry show, what goes up doesn't always stay up. The tech sector is dynamic and fortunes can change quickly.\nBut Hana Abaza of Shopify points out that Shopify founder Tobi L\u00fctke has declared on many occasions that the company intends to be around for at least 100 years.\u00a0\n\"By making sure we're continually investing in our future and in R&D, we are planning to be a 100-year company,\" she says. \"And in order to do that, we have to invest in the right areas, and that\u00a0also means investing in Canada.\"\nNationalists may try to remain optimistic that she's on the money with that.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/programs/daybreaknorth/full-episode-for-monday-november-19-2019-daybreak-north-1.5364235", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Shareholder sues Zoom for not disclosing security flaws", "description": "Shares down nearly a third of their value since hitting record highs in late March", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/zoom-sued-shareholder-1.5525870", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5524425.1586261178!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 08, 2020 8:16 AM ET", "2020-04-08T13:27:52.329Z"], "source": null, "content": "Zoom Video Communications Inc. was slapped with a class-action suit by one of its shareholders on Tuesday accusing the videoconferencing app of overstating its privacy standards and failing to disclose that its service was not end-to-end encrypted.\nShareholder Michael Drieu claimed in a court filing that a string of recent media reports highlighting the privacy flaws in Zoom's application have led to the company's stock, which had rallied for several days in the beginning of the year, to plummet.\nThe company's shares closed down about 7.5 per cent\u00a0at $113.75 US on Tuesday.

Village Pottery suddenly received a big influx of followers and orders for the mugs.\u00a0\nA few days later potter Suzanne Scott restocked her pink mugs on Etsy, a global online art and craft marketplace.\u00a0\n\"What a pleasant surprise to see @jillianharris order these mugs yesterday,\" Scott posted to Instagram, adding #shopsmall. Then, Harris posted that mention to her followers. The mugs sold out again in just a couple of minutes.\nOn the surface perhaps such\u00a0things might not seem important\u00a0\u2014 some of Village Pottery's 10,500 followers might see the post, nor not \u2014 an Instagram story only lasts online for 24 hours, then disappears.\u00a0\nBut Jillian Harris is what is called an \"influencer,\" and has more than a million Instagram followers. The B.C. native\u00a0became a celebrity from appearing on the television shows The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, then Love It Or List It. As many influencers do, she has written a cookbook, and partners with mostly Canadian brands to sell products on her website and via a seasonal subscription box called the Jilly Box (so popular there's a lottery to decide who gets them). Oh \u2014 and her signature colour is pink.\u00a0\n\"All of the mugs sold out within minutes, it was very unexpected,\" says Scott, taking a break from setting up her pottery shop in New London for the summer. Most years she'd open by the end of May, but with COVID-19 causing uncertainty, she's aiming this year for mid-June.\u00a0\n\"The wave has continued to get bigger ever since that one little story that she shared, and it's just gotten kind of crazy now!\" she said.\nHarris ordered four mugs and Scott said luckily she had a few left on hand to re-stock her online shop, which again sold out quickly, leaving customers clamouring for more.\n\"I've created a wait list,\" Scott said.\nShe said it takes three to four weeks to create each piece of pottery, and she thought about capping the list, but has decided to let it build up. Over the weekend it grew to 1,500.\nShe's had to enlist the help of fellow potter\u00a0Robert MacMillan\u00a0in fact, to turn out more mugs while she glazes them.\n\"It's been overwhelming because it's kind of happening at the best and the worst time,\" she said. One challenge has been a shortage of supplies like glaze and shipping boxes \u2014 she said \"everybody is just stretched right now.\"\u00a0\n\"Such a great thing to happen for us because we depend on the tourist season and it's just not looking that great for us, so it's quite the blessing to happen right now.\"\u00a0\nPrince Edward Island's tourists could be limited to only Islanders this summer, as borders remain closed to visitors to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Officials are looking at partnering for the summer in a \"bubble\"\u00a0with New Brunswick, which has also seen good containment of the virus, but nothing has been decided yet. Even then, there's no replacing approximately 1.5 million tourists to P.E.I. each year, mostly in the summer.\nScott said\u00a060 per cent of Village Pottery's income is usually made in July and August, and replacing that will be \"a challenge, big time. But for right now, the shoulder season months, having these online sales is keeping us going, so \u2014 it's huge right now and I hope it will just continue on and we'll get through this rocky time. \"\u00a0\nScott has been making and selling pottery for about 10 years, and her parents before her for about 40 years, but they hadn't featured a pink glaze before.\u00a0\n\"It was literally a freak accident that we had this glaze to begin with,\" she said. Her mother Daphne mixes the glazes and happened to have the ingredients for pink lying around and decided to give it a try.\u00a0\n\"I have so many buckets of glaze that I work with every day and I think I stumbled on it at the end of the season last year and just did a few pieces,\" Scott said.\u00a0\nShe sold some pink pottery over the winter and it was very popular, so she was preparing for it to be a big seller this summer. Now with the Jillian Harris effect, she's unsure if she'll be able to stock any pink in her shop, or will just work away at her wait list for what she now calls \"Jilly mugs.\"\nShe's had to enlist the help of fellow potters, in fact, to turn out more mugs while she glazes them.\u00a0\nA couple of local businesses that sell Village Pottery\u00a0have also seen them sell out quickly \u2014 not just the pink ones, but other colours and products too.\u00a0\nScott has also created other designs that are taking off.\n\"Throughout the pandemic I was struggling to get creative and trying to find a reason why I would keep be making, if there would be nobody visiting the shop,\" she said. She began making mugs with the messages \"stay at home\" and \"wash your hands\" stamped into the clay. A portion of the profits go to a local women's shelter.\nThere could yet be another gold \u2014 or pink \u2014 rush if and when Harris shows off the mugs on her blog.\n\"It makes my heart so full to see the incredible outpouring of support Village Pottery received after I reshared their Instagram post with the message that their beautiful blush pink mugs had been restocked,\" Jillian Harris told CBC via email.\u00a0She said she ordered the \"stunning\" mugs for her new office space.\n\"Not only am I excited to use these handmade mugs daily in our new Team Jilly\u00a0headquarters, but there is nothing that means more to me than being able to support a local shop during such an uncertain time,\" Harris said.\u00a0\nScott has already thanked Harris with a package of P.E.I. gifts and hopes someday Harris and her family can visit P.E.I. and the shop.\u00a0\nScott said the immense influence of a couple of fleeting mentions on social media has been a light-bulb moment for her.\u00a0\n\"Getting your product in the right hands, you know? It's all about finding that person who is going to put your product out there, and all of her followers are also my target market, you know \u2014 women age 25 to 50. So it's just worked out perfectly for us,\" she said.\nScott said she is thankful she already had a strong online and social media presence and was able to be able to respond to the demand as nimbly as she has. She encourages other businesses considering opening brick-and-mortar shops to also\u00a0work on their online presence and getting their products into the hands of influencers.\u00a0\n\"Because you never know who's going to be sharing them!\" she said\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Ford open to closing borders to visitors during pandemic, not to commerce", "description": "Provincial officials say there are now 177\u00a0cases of COVID-19 in Ontario", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-ontario-covid-19-borders-1.5499124", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5499153.1584374825!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/doug-ford-mining-conference.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 16, 2020 12:46 PM ET", "2020-03-16T16:46:27.704Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he is open to closing Canada's borders to visitors amid\u00a0the current COVID-19 pandemic, but stressed that commerce cannot be blocked.\n\"I'd be open to closing the border to visitors, but not to trade and commerce,\" Ford said during a Monday morning news conference.\n\"We have to keep the supply chain going.\"\nFord also said he has not been having conversations with other leaders\u00a0about restricting\u00a0inter-provincial movement.\n\"That hasn't come up right now,\" he said.\nIn a press conference on Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the Canadian government is closing the border to foreign nationals, though\u00a0American citizens are exempt from the entry ban.\u00a0\n\"At the moment, the measure does not apply to U.S. citizens,\" Trudeau said. \"We will have more work to do in the coming days to ensure we're doing everything we need to do to keep Canadians safe and to ensure the flow of goods and necessary equipment to Canadians.\"\nOn Monday morning, Ford threw his support behind the work of Deputy Prime Minister\u00a0Chrystia Freeland\u00a0and\u00a0Trudeau.\u00a0\n\"He's showing good leadership,\" he said of the prime minister.\u00a0\u00a0\nProvincial health officials said\u00a0on Monday morning that there are 177\u00a0cases of COVID-19 in Ontario, which is\u00a0a jump of 32 cases from yesterday afternoon's official tally.

The cuts included the elimination of some executive positions and the departures of chief manufacturing officer Arno Groll and chief marketing officer Nick Davies.\nHexo also said earlier this month that its net revenue for the quarter ended July 31 would be in the range of between $14.5 million to $16.5 million, down from roughly $26 million it had forecast before, due to factors including a slow retail rollout and early pricing pressure.\nThe cannabis company said it was withdrawing its previously issued outlook of up to $400 million in net revenue during its 2020 financial year.\nIn its latest outlook, Hexo said expects its first-quarter net revenue to be in a range from $14 million to $18 million.\nThe company provided cautious guidance for positive adjusted EBITDA in calendar 2020, \"based on certain assumptions made by management regarding store counts in the various provinces as well as operational improvements and cost saving initiatives the company is seeking to implement.\"\nSt-Louis told analysts the future of the cannabis industry remains bright, but it may be slower to ramp up and it is unclear which players \"will be Amazon and which will be the Pets.com and forgotten.\"\n\"And I think if you look to the metrics and the way Hexo is managing its business, the way we are making hard decisions on operations, and the market share we've managed to keep, that tells a much stronger story than the quarterly revenue numbers,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://gem.cbc.ca/media/media/canadian-reflections/episode-167/38e815a-00fb11579cf", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Answers to your questions about the coronavirus", "description": "A roundup of helpful links from around the CBC", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/life/culture/answers-to-your-questions-about-the-coronavirus-1.5497642", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5497695.1584138942!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/microscopic-magnification-of-coronavirus.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 13, 2020 6:45 PM ET", "2020-06-02T18:48:06.087Z"], "source": "CBC Life", "content": "Given that many of us are swimming in details around the coronavirus \u2014 with information around spread, closures and best practices coming at breakneck speed \u2014 this can feel like an overwhelming time.\u00a0With the goal of providing answers to what may be your most pressing questions, we've rounded up the latest articles from the CBC that may help.\nPlanning a Canadian vacation?

So now more than ever I think we need to have that.\"\nHarpauer said a lower dollar and more federal funding will offset some of the losses.\n\"There will be changes and we'll just track that throughout the year which is why we do quarterly reporting.\"\nOpposition Leader Ryan Meili had previously\u00a0called on the government to delay next week's budget because of the economic turmoil and health crisis caused by the coronavirus.\nSpeaking to delegates at\u00a0the annual Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) convention on Thursday,\u00a0Meili said it's not a time to panic, but we all have to work together.\n\"We can't make this go away, but we can get ahead of it,\" he said. \"We can slow it down and that will make all the difference.\"\nMeili said that If there is a spike in cases it will lead to higher mortality rates and health-care services being overwhelmed.\nThe planned First Ministers' meeting in Ottawa has also been cancelled, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in self isolation.\u00a0\nPremier Moe and other members of the Saskatchewan delegation are currently in Ottawa and will return\u00a0to Saskatchewan today.\nMoe will take part\u00a0in a conference call of Canada's First Ministers on Friday to discuss\u00a0the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "When 2 brewers fought over who could be crowned as a king in Canada", "description": "In 1982, Federal Court judge said Budweiser could not use phrase 'king of beers' on its packaging", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/archives/when-2-brewers-fought-over-who-could-be-crowned-as-a-king-in-canada-1.5389538", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Dec 21, 2019 8:30 AM ET", "2019-12-21T13:30:00.856Z"], "source": "CBC Archives", "content": "Throughout history, there have been many disputes involving crowns, territory and treasure.\u00a0\nThirty-seven years ago, one such fight involved two large brewers duelling over a regal name in a former British dominion.

He's not the only government leader feeling the strain.\nThe white patch in the beard of the country's prime minister, Edouard Philippe, seems to have doubled since France went into lockdown almost eight weeks ago.\nIn that time, more than 26,000 French people have died of COVID-19. There have been more than 137,000 cases, putting France fourth in Europe after the U.K, Italy and Spain for cases and deaths.\nMay 11 is the day the country is cautiously relaxing its strict\u00a0lockdown rules.\nMacron's cartoon anguish stems from several sources \u2014 the battle against COVID-19, which many have criticized for starting far too late, as well as the worry that with the virus still red-hot on government maps in the Paris area, d\u00e9confinement might release more death.\nFor eight weeks, no one except medical workers and those in essential jobs has been allowed out for more than an hour and more than a kilometre from their residence. And they've had to arm themselves with an interior ministry attestation, downloaded and printed or on their phone, specifying why they went out and at what time \u2014 or face a fine.\u00a0\nThe police have enforced these rules, and forcefully. According to French interior ministry statistics as of April 23, there were more than 15 million checks by police and 915,000 fines. And the fines are heavy \u2014 135 euros (about $205 Cdn).\nThat means about 12,350,000 euros ($18.6 million) that the government says will go to French hospitals.\nJust days before the end of the shutdown, I saw five police officers on bicycles surround a small 85-year-old man. He had no attestation but protested he was simply going to the doctor next door. He was warned, but not fined.\nA couple of friends were not so lucky. One was fined for standing in line outside a store with his nine-year-old daughter \u2014 the girl didn't have her official piece of paper.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother friend was fined for sitting on a bench on the sidewalk. Not allowed. She protested that she had her attestation and was over 70 and just resting because she had a bad leg. She was still fined.\nShe wasn't happy. \"Abusing petty power,\" she said. She's appealing.\nWith d\u00e9confinement, the attestations will no longer be needed. And instead of one kilometre, people will be able to travel up to 100 km from their home.\nTrains and the Paris Metro will resume service at 50 per cent of pre-pandemic levels. There will be strict controls on numbers, and passengers will have to wear masks on all public transport.\nElementary schools will open, although up to half of parents in many regions say they are refusing to send their children right away. But beaches from Brittany to the Mediterranean will stay closed, provoking public muttering even from allies of Macron.\n\"It's a sledgehammer blow,\" Didier le Gac, a Brittany backbencher from Macron's own party, told the newspaper Le Figaro. Le Gac wondered why Parisians could board a crowded subway car, but his constituents couldn't walk the beaches next door.\nShops will reopen but restaurants and caf\u00e9s remain closed until June.\u00a0I did discover that the fishmonger at the open air market, closed for two months, had taken to delivering his wares right to customers' doors every Saturday.\nLike many caf\u00e9s and restaurants in Paris, the restaurant across the street from me sells fresh produce from its farm suppliers out the back door.\nThe owner also cooks one dish a day for takeout. One day recently he called to the cook to hurry up with the grilled duck. It was the customer's birthday.\u00a0An assistant cook rushed out with two glasses of wine for the waiting couple.\u00a0\nWine keeps, but not beer. The French association of brewers announced it had poured 10 million litres of beer \u2014 four Olympic swimming pools \u2014 down the drain.\nThe lockdown has also released a poison of anxiety. I know friends who are too scared to go out, and who on a daily basis wash railings, banisters, shoes and even packages brought to their door with bleach.\nBut the government is also worried about the near-death of the French economy during this crisis. Officially, the country has lost 500,000 jobs. The number of unemployed has shot up to 3.17 million.\nIn desperation, the French government has put up 120 billion euros ($182 billion) in subsidies to companies, largely to ensure they keep paying employees.\nMacron has engaged in three huge struggles in the past 18 months \u2014 against the \"gilets jaunes,\" the spontaneous front of poorer people struggling in the provinces who felt abandoned by the government; against the public service unions, who unleashed weeks of strikes against pension reforms that would lower payments for many of their members; and now, against COVID-19.\nWhile the government has been politically wounded in each of these battles, the fight against the virus has caused particularly serious damage. In February, there was a sense of horror at what was happening in Italy, but also the comfortable conviction that it couldn't happen in France.\u00a0\nThen it did, and the country discovered its government was as ill-prepared as Italy's.\u00a0\nThe focus of public anger was the lack of masks and protective equipment for front-line health workers. That anger only intensified when Le Monde revealed that as the crisis built in February, government officials were still destroying stocks of masks under a plan agreed to in 2017.\nThat helps explain why an international poll carried out by the French polling firms Cevipof and IPSOS-Sopra Steria shows 62 per cent of the French are dissatisfied with how their government has handled COVID-19.\u00a0\nThat's a higher level of dissatisfaction than in other European countries, including Italy and even Britain, which has the highest death toll in Europe.\nMore bad news for Macron: His personal poll numbers, which bounced up at the beginning of the crisis, are falling back. Just 40 per cent say they are satisfied with his leadership.\nThe embattled president now reaches for colourful metaphors to convince his fellow citizens of the need to soldier on as the country carefully unlocks its doors.\n\"We have to ride the tiger, and tame it,\" he told representatives of French cultural industries as he promised hundreds of millions in subsidies to them on May 6. \"The tiger [the virus] isn't going to disappear, he'll still be there. And fear will still be there in society. The only way to stop the tiger from devouring us is to ride it.\"\nThe worry about a second wave of infection is still so great that 40 per cent of the country remains a \"red zone\" (where the infection rate is still high) on government maps \u2014 and that includes Paris.\nThere will be little let-up in that zone. Parks will remain closed. Distancing must be observed. Vulnerable people, those over 70 and anyone with chronic conditions, are being asked to stay confined.\nAnd the prime minister has said the country's borders will remain shut through the summer.

Yields on 10-year bonds touched a five-week high, their biggest daily rise since May 2018. The Italian blue-chip index fell 2.3 per cent, with the turmoil helping to push other European stock markets lower.\nSalvini said in a statement on Thursday he had told Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who belongs to neither coalition party,\u00a0the alliance with Five-Star had collapsed after barely a year in power and \"we should quickly give the choice back to the voters.\" He said cabinet meetings were dogged by disputes.\nThe head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, is the only one with the power to dissolve parliament, but he could first try to form a new government from the existing legislature before resorting to elections.\nSalvini urged lawmakers on Friday to return to parliament in Rome and break their summer vacations.\n\"There's nothing to say that we cannot make parliamentarians work in the middle of August. Lawmakers should get off their bums and work.\"\nThe political crisis has jolted Italians out of their August torpor, with millions of voters holidaying on the beach and facing the first autumn election in Italy's post-war history.\n\"It's a mess basically,\" said Marta Bonora, a 21-year-old languages student in Milan, noting Salvini's crackdown on immigration meant other problems were being ignored.\nAnna Scoccia, 63, who works at a newsstand in Rome, was also cynical: \"This is all a big joke, it's another of Salvini's stunts to keep his popularity up. I don't believe we will go to elections but I am still terrified by what comes next.\"\nConte turned on Salvini late on Thursday, demanding in a televised statement that Salvini explain to Italians why he wanted to bring down the government.\nUntil a few weeks ago Salvini had repeatedly said the government would last a full five-year term, but he brushed off Conte's criticisms and said Five-Star was holding up the policies the country needed to boost its stagnant economy.\nTensions came to a head on Wednesday when Five-Star and the League voted against each other in parliament over the future of a project for a high-speed train link with France.\nFive-Star has more parliamentary seats than the League, but Salvini's party now has twice as much voter support, according to opinion polls, and it has recently threatened to try to capitalize on that surge in popularity with new elections.\nHowever, it remains to be seen if things will go as Salvini plans. Pushing the nation back into election mode in August is unusual and could be unpopular and risky.\nMattarella may be unwilling to dissolve parliament ahead of preparatory work in September for the 2020 budget, which must then be presented to parliament the following month.\nItaly, which has Europe's second-largest sovereign debt burden after Greece, has already angered the European Union with an expansionary 2019 budget and Salvini wants to make major tax cuts.\nFitch Ratings is due to review later on Friday its BBB\u00a0rating on Italy's sovereign debt, which is two notches above junk status and carries a negative outlook.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1725191235941", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Colin Butler", "title": "Coronavirus forces strained London grocery stores to change the way they do business", "description": "Supermarkets have unwittingly found themselves on the front lines of a pandemic", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-coronavirus-grocery-stores-1.5499215", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5499543.1584389971!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/empty-store-shelves.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 17, 2020 5:01 AM ET", "2020-03-17T22:18:32.628Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "London grocery stores are taking measures to enhance sanitation and maintain their supplies after a wave of unprecedented stockpiling across the city amid the\u00a0widening global coronavirus outbreak.\nOver the weekend anxious shoppers stood in lines that stretched the length of some stores in order to stock up on supplies such as fresh food, canned goods, pet food, milk, toilet paper and cleaning products in a frenzy of panic buying brought on by the pandemic.\u00a0\n'This is why you see panic buying:' London shoppers denude store shelves of - toilet paper?\nThe surge has forced many supermarkets to start rationing high-demand items and begin\u00a0obsessive cleaning regimens, where employees must regularly sanitize high-touch surfaces, such\u00a0as shopping carts, checkout lanes and electronic pinpads in order to limit the potential spread of illness.\u00a0\nThe unprecedented situation has unwittingly and perhaps unexpectedly placed many supermarkets and their employees on the front-lines of an unfolding health crisis along with doctors, nurses and other first responders.\n\"No matter what happens here, the grocery store and the food supply chain won't be shut down,\" said John Harding, the store manager of Remark Fresh Markets on Hyde Park Road.\u00a0\n\"There's always going to be food available. This hoarding of food has gotten out of control,\" he said. \"We'll be one of the few places open besides the hospitals and the pharmacies.\"\u00a0\nHarding said on top of regularly sanitizing check out lanes, shopping carts and any high touch surfaces, his busy west-end store\u00a0will no longer be able to offer customers free coffee and tea at a self-serve station near the front entrance.\u00a0\n\"We've shut that down, only because you need to touch the cream and the coffee (containers) with your hands,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nHarding said the store has also stopped its self serve stations, where customers would normally get their own soups, or antipasto, opting instead to have employees serve the soup and pre-packaged pickles, olives and sundried tomatoes.\u00a0\n\"With the multiple people and traffic we have through this store, maybe a thousand people can touch a spoon during the course of the day.

It has always been a place of inspiration for me.\nA city's food scene can be traced through its most popular food markets, and\u00a0the St. Lawrence Market is no exception.\nInside, you'll\u00a0find produce vendors celebrating all things local and those with international produce. January is for blood oranges from Italy, summer is for local corn and peaches, the fall months for pomegranates from Israel.\u00a0\nFor over a decade, I lived within throwing distance of the market, it has allowed me to get to know the vendors well. Like all markets around the world, your experience improves exponentially when you spend time getting to know the personalities behind the booth.\nFor my cheese and charcuterie needs, I visit Scheffler's deli where it's easy to discover a new local or international cheese. It's also a great place to sample a cheese before you decide to add it to your holiday board. Scheffler's also regularly stocks burrata and other fresh milk cheeses\u00a0made in Ontario.\u00a0For meats, I go to Di Liso's fine meats.\nMike's Fish Market\u00a0carries a good selection of Ontario fish.

It is a booth that most people skip when they enter the market, and it is one of my favourites.\nOwner Eugene Antunes opened the Portuguese rotisserie kitchen nearly 32 years ago. He will guide you through the menu of rotisserie chicken, whole birds are slowly cooked in a cabinet. There's a thin sheet of crisp skin with meat so juicy you can peel it off the bone with a spoon. He'll encourage you to have the chicken with a side of roasted potatoes and rice\u00a0and plenty of piri piri sauce.\n\"The piri piri sauce is a thing of pride for me. I make it myself.

You'll find plates\u00a0of pastitzio, moussaka and great gyros\u00a0sandwiches.\n\"I always say if it's your first time here, get the gyros and ask for extra sauce,\" Sfiris said.\nSfiris has been a vendor at the market for over 20 years, he's seen a a lot of change in two decades.\u00a0\n\"This market has changed a lot, most noticeably its reflective of how great of a food city we've become.

Poloz, though, said declining consumer confidence would likely reduce activity.\n\"In this context, lower interest rates will actually help to stabilize the housing market rather than contribute to froth,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1708310595985", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/archives/lesson-plan/for-teachers-mergers-in-the-beer-industry", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1586247235972", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/u-s-scales-back-china-tariff-threats-hopes-rise-for-trade-truce-1.5246268", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "David Paddon", "title": "Canadian online gaming firm Stars Group to merge with Irish firm Flutter", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stars-flutter-1.5307109", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5307129.1570107348!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/paddypower.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 03, 2019 8:46 AM ET", "2019-10-03T12:56:48.605Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Stars Group Inc. has agreed to be acquired by Flutter Entertainment in an all-stock deal that will create one of the world's largest online betting and gambling companies, the companies announced Wednesday.\nThe proposal values the Stars Group at about $9 billion on based on Flutter's share price in London.\nShares of Toronto-based Stars Group closed up $6.24 or 30.81 per cent to $26.49 in Wednesday trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\nShareholders of Flutter, which is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, will own approximately 54.64 per cent of the combined company when the deal closes next year, while TSG shareholders will own about 45.36 per cent.\nThe combined company's board and executive team is expected to have representatives from both companies, including the executive chair and the chief executive of Stars Group.\n\"The board of TSG and I are delighted to recommend this exciting combination of TSG and Flutter, which we believe will create significant value for TSG's shareholders,\" TSG executive chairman Divyesh (Dave) Gadhia said in a statement.\nHe added that, under the leadership of TSG CEO Rafi Ashkenazi, who will become chief operating officer of Flutter, the company has grown and diversified the business beyond online poker to include gaming and sports betting.\nTSG recently teamed up with Fox Sports to launch a betting platform in the United States, a relationship that would continue if the transaction gets the necessary approvals \u2014 expected in the second half of 2020.\nFlutter CEO Peter Jackson, who will be chief executive of the combined company, said it would continue to work with Fox while also developing Flutter's FanDuel in the United States.\nFox Sports will have the right to acquire an approximate 18.5 per cent equity interest in FanDuel Group at its market value in 2021.

You can't telecommute if you're a cleaner or janitor.\nIn Canada, as elsewhere in the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed just how essential their work is for public health and safety. And yet, janitorial workers in Canada have for years been among the lowest-paid in the country, and classified as so-called 'low-skilled' labour. Essential, but not commanding a lot of respect.\nDeena Ladd is the executive director of the Workers' Action Centre, an organization in Toronto that works with people in low-wage and unstable employment.\u00a0\nShe spoke to The Sunday Edition's Michael Enright about the working conditions of cleaners in Canada. Here are some excerpts from that conversation, edited for clarity and condensed.\nMany of the cleaners that I work with clean your grocery stores, malls, office buildings, medical centres. But in most cases, they're not hired directly by those companies. That company probably subcontracts out to a middle broker, and they, in turn, hire cleaners.\u00a0\nSo those cleaners, for the most part, are not even seen as workers. They're seen as independent contractors. So they're not even getting the benefits of labour protection. They're lucky if they get minimum wage.\u00a0\nEven before this pandemic hit the country, they were definitely not given proper health and safety equipment. They're not told what kind of chemicals they're using. And they really are very vulnerable because they're not able to speak out against the issues that they're facing because they'll just get fired.\u00a0\n[The workforce] is a lot of new Canadians, a lot of immigrants, a lot of undocumented workers.\u00a0\nSome workers, like some of the city municipal workers who are cleaners, are in a union. But for the most part, when you're looking at private businesses and malls and grocery stores, most of those cleaners in my experience have not been in unions and don't have the ability to unionize without losing their jobs \u2026 When a union tries to organize a subcontractor, the property management company just gets rid of the subcontractor and then they hire a new subcontractor.\nMany of our governments have refused to pay attention to the deterioration of working conditions. We have been raising the alarm bells for decades now. At least for the last 20 years, we've been talking about the fact that lots of people in our labour market are increasingly without protection.\u00a0\nIf anything, this pandemic has shown you can't say that cleaners are essential workers without providing them with essential protection. And one of those essential protections and labour standards is paid sick days. People are going to work, they don't have the proper health and safety equipment, they have no masks, and they're cleaning buildings. And they could potentially get sick, but they don't have paid sick days.\nSince COVID-19 hit, a lot of the labour leases and subcontractors are asking the workers to use more heavy duty chemicals in their cleaning but they're not, for instance, explaining to the workers what those chemicals are, or how to protect themselves. They're not giving them information. And workers are afraid of asking and afraid of not using those chemicals because they can't afford to lose their jobs right now.\nWhat we're also finding right now, especially since this crisis hit, is that a lot of cleaners have had their work intensified. So they're being asked to do more cleaning duties, they've got added layers of work and they're not getting any extra pay for that.\u00a0\nWe're saying to people, document your hours, make sure that you are noting how many hours you're not getting paid so we can try and do something about it afterwards. But, as you can imagine, with millions of people across this country losing their jobs, workers are very afraid.\u00a0\nTechnically, on paper, many workers have the right to refuse work, but in reality that's pretty much not the case. For many workers who don't have a union, they know that when they speak up about something that's happening they are risking their jobs.\u00a0\nThis pandemic is really exposing the crucial role that cleaners are playing, and yet they are never really considered that. They are the invisible workers. They come in at night to clean our buildings and to clean the grocery stores. They're not necessarily seen, and people haven't really cared about those working conditions before.\nIf you voluntarily quit your job because you're afraid of getting sick, you won't get access to that benefit. I've had workers contact our centre basically afraid, because they don't want to go on public transportation that is overcrowded to get to their job. Or they are working in long-term care facilities or nursing homes where the risk of infection is higher. Yet their employers have told them that if you don't come to work, we will fire you or it will be seen as you quitting your job \u2014 which then has huge implications for workers trying to get access to income support.\nAnd, if they don't have a valid social insurance number they will not be eligible for the emergency response benefit. One of the things that we've been trying to expose to the government is that if we really want to flatten the curve, having a valid social insurance number should not be a barrier. It's critical that all of these workers who are in these essential services have the ability to stay home if they get sick \u2014 because at the end of the day, if you have to put food on the table or take care of your children, and you don't have a valid social insurance number and you can't get these income security benefits, then you're going to have to go to work sick.\nWe have hundreds and thousands of undocumented workers in this country, especially with the policies that are happening in the U.S. right now that have forced people out of the U.S. and into Canada. We need to make sure that we're looking after them as well.\nOne of the interesting things that we've been seeing recently is cleaners and grocery store workers are being called superheroes, which is fantastic. But superheroes need decent working conditions. They need paid sick days and a decent minimum wage. And they need to make sure that they have a voice at work.\nThey shouldn't just be called superheroes because they're doing what we need. They need us to stand up for them as well.\nClick 'listen' above to hear the full interview.\n"}, {"author": "Kaila Jefferd-Moore", "title": "Whitehorse residents paint picture of what dismal rental market looks like", "description": "Median price for renting in Whitehorse is $1,050 a month, according to Yukon Bureau of Statistics", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/vacancy-rate-in-whitehorse-1.5218398", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3685727.1558637258!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/whistle-bend.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jul 28, 2019 7:00 AM CT", "2019-07-28T13:00:00.598Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Whitehorse renters say it's a struggle to find affordable housing in Yukon's largest city.\n\"It is incredibly difficult to find somewhere to rent anywhere [in] Whitehorse with anything someone could feasibly make off of our minimum wage,\" said Whitehorse renter Fox Gilberds.\n\"It's not feasible for anyone who's trying to, for example, move out of their house for the first time.\"\u00a0\nThe city's population grew by 23 per cent between 2008 and 2018, but from renters' perspectives, available affordable housing hasn't kept pace with rising demand.

Most landlords expect new tenants to pay a damage deposit equivalent to one month's rent, plus first month's rent.\u00a0\nThe Yukon Anti-Poverty Coalition states\u00a0that the average Whitehorse family spends 30.4 per cent of its before-tax household income on housing. Housing is considered affordable when it costs less than 30 per cent of a household income, according to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).\n\"Businesses are struggling because they can't get people to move to the Yukon to work because there isn't a sufficient place to live,\" said Whitehorse city councillor\u00a0Laura Cabott at a council meeting on July 15.\nCBC reported earlier this month that the owner of the two McDonald's restaurants in Whitehorse has begun offering to subsidize rents for employees recruited in Canada.\nAccording to the Yukon Bureau of Statistics, the median price for renting in Whitehorse is $1,050 a month. Rent for a one-bedroom apartment or condo can range from $950 to $1,600.\u00a0\n\"It takes a bit of looking but [places to rent] are out there. I would say they're not exactly cheap though,\" said Petrus Lommerse, another renter in Whitehorse.\nLommerse said he and his partner are lucky compared to a lot of people: they knew someone building a house with a suite in it who offered to rent it to them.\u00a0\n\"I think it's extremely competitive,\" said Melina Sheldon, a renter who moved to Teslin because housing was unaffordable in Whitehorse.\u00a0\n\"I've been finding [places to live] either through word of mouth, friend of a friend, or knowing somebody who's leaving a unit,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"It's kind of all about who you know.\"\u00a0\nSheldon moved to Whitehorse from Vancouver, where she was living in her own bachelor apartment.\n\"I don't even think there are a lot of bachelors that even exist here. And then one-bedroom apartments are kind of atrociously priced, so the affordability of having a one-bedroom on your own isn't very realistic.\"\nAccording to an April 2019 rental survey by the Yukon Bureau of Statistics, there were 75 vacant units in Whitehorse out of a total of 2,332 rental units.\nThe city of Whitehorse is expanding Whistle Bend, its newest subdivision,\u00a0and earlier this year the Yukon government announced plans to build a mixed-income housing development downtown with 48 units.\nWhitehorse's 2018 Downtown Plan says options for all housing types are needed downtown, but some residents have pushed back against increasing population density in the city's core.\u00a0\nWhitehorse renter Patrick Bradley says he got lucky when he found his rental. He said the main reason he's in his current apartment is that he was first to respond to an offer from the landlord.\u00a0\n\"I think they said they had over 100 people that they were picking from,\" said Bradley. \"So had I not responded in time, it wouldn't have worked out so well for me.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1592901699893", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Tim Hortons strikes deal with Beyond Meat to offer plant-based breakfast sandwiches", "description": "Coffee chain is 2nd in Canada to offer Beyond Meat's products", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tim-hortons-beyond-meat-1.5171987", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5172047.1560348683!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tim-hortons-beyond-meat-breakfast-sandwiches.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 12, 2019 10:37 AM ET", "2019-06-12T18:31:25.133Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "One of the most high-profile companies in the fast-growing business of plant-based meat alternatives has struck a deal with one of Canada's biggest coffee chains to sell meat-free breakfast sandwiches across the country.\nTim Hortons announced Wednesday that starting immediately, the chain's 4,000 locations across Canada are offering breakfast sandwiches made with Beyond Meat patties, a plant-based meat\u00a0alternative whose popularity seems to be soaring.\nLast summer, Beyond Meat struck a deal with burger chain A&W to offer their products in the chain's quick-service restaurants, and demand for the product soon overwhelmed supply.\nWednesday's news makes Tim Hortons the second national fast-food restaurant to offer the product in Canada, although the hamburger version of the product\u00a0did recently become available for home consumption when they hit\u00a0grocery stores\u00a0last month.\n\"We've listened to our guests and are excited to be able to offer three delicious breakfast sandwiches that vegans, vegetarians, flexitarians and meat lovers can feel good about,\" Tim Hortons' chief operations officer\u00a0Mike Hancock said.\nThe chain will offer three varieties of the Beyond Meat patty, including in an English muffin with egg and cheese, in a tortilla wrap with egg, cheese and other ingredients, or in a 100 per cent vegan form on a baked biscuit with lettuce and tomato.\n\"We're excited to introduce the Beyond Breakfast Sausage patty at Tim Hortons as a protein-packed breakfast solution,\" Beyond Meat founder and chief executive Ethan Brown said.\n\"For busy Canadians on the go, our Beyond Breakfast Sausage not only tastes great, but comes with the added environmental benefits of plant-based protein.\"\nBeyond Meat is one of the biggest players in the growing industry of meat alternatives, which cater to a younger generation of eaters who are eschewing conventional meats in favour of plant-based alternatives.\nMany other companies are also in the space, including Canada's Maple Leaf Foods\u00a0which recently pledged $300 million to build a factory in Indiana that will make plant-based meat alternatives.\nEstimates suggest the market for such products has doubled in the last few years and is showing no signs of slowing down.

The indictment from the prosecutors in Braunschweig \u2014 in Volkswagen's home region of Lower Saxony \u2014 is part of a separate legal push to try managers over allegations they delayed disclosing the scandal to investors.\nLawyers for the three accused said they would contest the charges, while Volkswagen said its supervisory board would meet immediately to discuss the indictments which, if accepted by a Braunschweig state court, will lead to a trial date being set.\nDiess's lawyer said the indictment would not hinder him in his role as CEO, adding that as Diess did not join Volkswagen until July 2015 he could not have foreseen the scandal would have such a huge impact on the company.\nVolkswagen shares lost up to 37 per cent\u00a0in value in the days after the scandal broke.

The World Health Organization postponed until Thursday a decision on whether to declare an international emergency over the outbreak of the flu-like illness, which can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms, including one case in the United States.\n\"The cost to the global economy can be quite staggering, in negative GDP terms, if this outbreak reaches epidemic proportions as until this week, the market was underestimating the potential of the flu spreading,\" Stephen Innes, chief Asian strategist for AxiCorp, said in a report.\nThe travel sector has already started to feel the hit as shares of four North American airlines that fly to China, including Air Canada, fell on Tuesday amid growing anxiety about the viral infection.\nNone of the airlines fly directly to Wuhan, but their Chinese partner airlines do, and some passengers transfer from a Chinese carrier to a Canadian one, offering the potential for the virus to spread here.\nShares at the three biggest U.S. cruise lines have also fallen, with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. \u2014 which boasts a major Chinese presence \u2014 dropping more than four per cent this week.\nAnalyst Chris Murray of AltaCorp Capital pointed to the past for clues on the market volatility, propelled by \"an unknown level of potential disruption.\"\n\"History suggests shares may be in for a rough ride,\" he said of airline and tourism stocks in a research note. He recalled jittery stock movements after the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003, as well as with H1N1 influenza in 2009 and the Ebola virus in 2014.\n\"These larger-scale epidemics can have a more pronounced near-term impact. However, once a better understanding of the magnitude of the spread and severity was understood, stock prices recovered quite sharply in all three cases within months,\" he said.\nThe extent of the epidemic so far still falls well short of the spread of SARS, a virus from the same family as coronavirus that spread from China to more than two dozen countries \u2014 including Canada.\nSARS infected more than 8,000 people worldwide, killing close to 800, according to the World Health Organization. The disease sickened about 438 Canadian patients and caused 44 deaths in the Toronto area.\nSARS cost the country $5.25 billion and about 28,000 jobs, according to a 2014 report by Kai Ostwald, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs.\nThe damage came in large part from fear-based shifts in consumer behaviour rather than higher medical expenditures, Ostwald said.\n\"Specifically, fear of contagion prompted widespread aversion behaviour, in which people significantly reduced activities that put them in close proximity with others. This included not only things like flying and eating in restaurants, but also activities like workplace and school attendance,\" he wrote.\nHotels in the Greater Toronto Area, where the Canadian outbreak was centred, lost out on an estimated $39 million in revenues in April 2003 alone, according to the Canadian Tourism Commission.\nLess traffic through the city's Pearson airport spawned some $220 million in losses, according to the Conference Board of Canada. More than 800 bus tours were cancelled by the end of April \u2014 when the World Health Organization issued a one-week travel advisory for Toronto \u2014 with an economic loss of up to $6 million.\nAir Canada wouldn't speculate on the potential impact from coronavirus. In 2003 financial reports, it said passenger revenues decreased in part due to lower demand for travel resulting from the SARS crisis, particularly in the Pacific market that \"was severely adversely impacted with large reductions in traffic and capacity.\"\nChang Hoon Oh, a business professor at Simon Fraser University, warned against alarmist reactions to relatively small outbreaks.\nCanadian authorities are now more prepared for SARS-like viruses, he said. But he also noted that the number of annual visitors to Canada from China has shot up, growing by a factor of 10 since 2000 to 757,000 travellers in 2018, according to Statistics Canada.\nOn Tuesday a U.S. citizen who had recently returned from China was diagnosed in the Seattle area, making the United States the sixth country to report a case, following China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.\nWhile the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, uncertainty over how deadly and transmittable the new virus may be has amplified concerns, especially on the cusp of the annual mass travel surrounding lunar New Year, which begins this week.\nDr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, says she immediately contacted her counterparts at the provincial level upon hearing of three potential cases of the new virus that were investigated and ruled out.\n\"They in turn have notified their front line in terms of their health system,\" Tam said on a call with reporters Monday. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer has said hospitals are already employing protocols established during the SARS epidemic in anticipation of possible cases.\nCanadians are at low risk of contracting the illness, Tam said. Other precautionary measures have been introduced by the Public Health Agency of Canada, including screening processes at airports in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal to identify passengers travelling from Wuhan for assessment by Canada Border Services Agency officers, including a possible temperature check.\nTour operators are alert, but aren't battening down the hatches just yet.\n\"Industry is monitoring the issue,\" said Tourism Industry Association of Canada spokeswoman Marcela Diaz in an email.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Add a little green to your isolation blues by growing an indoor garden", "description": "'This weather is not going to last forever and eventually these things can go outside'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/covid-isolation-indoor-gardening-edmonton-1.5507850", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3947271.1547683456!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/growing-rosemary-on-windowsill.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 24, 2020 11:00 AM MT", "2020-03-24T17:00:00.584Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Feeling lonely in these days of self-isolation?

Larger gardening projects could be undertaken in\u00a0a light-filled room in the basement or a heated shed\u00a0with proper lighting.\n\"Make sure your pots have holes in the bottom and make sure you put your pots on a saucer or a tray and that will collect water so you don't make a mess everywhere,\" she added.\u00a0\nTo get started, invest in basic gardening tools, appropriately-sized planters and good potting soil.\nFor seedlings, look for starter soil with lots of fertilizer\u00a0or buy starter plants that you can nurture indoors, she said.\n\"We do have some starter plants and seedlings that customers can purchase, for petunias and pansies, marigolds and peppers, even begonias,\" McDonald said\n\"They're a little bit of a cheaper price right now so you can get them now and grow them indoors until they're ready to go outdoors.\"\u00a0\nThink carefully about what you want to plant, McDonald cautioned.

The combined company would have more than $5 trillion in client assets under management.\n\"With this transaction, we will capitalize on the unique opportunity to build a firm with the soul of a challenger and the resources of a large financial services institution that will be uniquely positioned to serve the investment, trading and wealth management needs of investors across every phase of their financial journeys,\" Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger said in a prepared statement.\nTD Ameritrade stockholders would receive 1.0837 Schwab shares for each TD Ameritrade share they own.\nThe transaction gives Schwab about 12 million client accounts, $1.3 trillion in client assets and approximately $5 billion in annual revenue. The combined company is expected to control 24 million client accounts.\nBy itself, Schwab may control close to half the market for acting as a custodian for money managed by registered investment advisers, for example, while TD Ameritrade may control about 15 to 20 per cent, according to Kyle Voigt, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\nThe rewards for passing regulatory muster would be lucrative: A combined company \"makes strong strategic sense,\" would be able to cut costs and could bump up Schwab's earnings per share by more than 25 per cent over the long term, Voigt said.\nThe deal could also herald more mergers across the industry.\nSchwab sent shockwaves through the industry less than two months ago when it said it would do away with commissions for online trading of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds, fees that have long fuelled the industry.\nAll major brokerages have followed suit, but fees had been falling for years.\nBeyond players like Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity and E-Trade Financial, apps like robinhood.com out of Palo Alto, Calif., have also entered the fray to help customers get invested in the market.\nThat has increased the pressure on San Francisco's Schwab Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., of Omaha, Neb., the biggest publicly traded brokerages.

In contrast, the e-cigarette market was worth about $11 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at more than eight\u00a0per cent annually over the next five years, according to research firm Mordor Intelligence.\nIn April, Philip Morris won approval to sell a heated tobacco product called IQOS in the United States, a major victory for a company looking to move beyond traditional cigarettes.\nUnlike combustible cigarettes, the IQOS devices heat tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper, generating an aerosol that contains nicotine.

B.C.'s TransLink said in April it was losing $75 million a month due to decreased ridership, while ridership on the Toronto Transit Commission has dipped to less than 20 per cent of the norm. At the same time, leaders in both Ontario and Quebec have recommended riders wear masks as physical distancing becomes difficult or impossible.\nDarnel Harris, an urban planner and executive director of Toronto-based mobility advocacy group Our Greenway, believes there are alternatives to both public transit and travelling in high-emission vehicles: electric bikes.\u00a0\nAccording to a recent study by the U.K.-based Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions, e-bikes have the potential to help people return to work \u2014 especially those who are hesitant to use public transport or live in areas with little to no service.\u00a0\nE-bikes, which are electrically assisted bicycles that range in price from roughly $1,500 to $9,000, are a cheaper alternative to car travel \u2014 not to mention a greener one when they're charged using clean power. They can often hit speeds of 25 km/h, and give people a way to avoid crowded buses and trains.\n\"Crucially, it allows people to go further, easier, and expands their access to things in an efficient way,\" Harris said, \"especially within a suburban area, where things are more spread out.\"\nE-bikes have gained a foothold abroad. In the Netherlands, roughly 40 per cent of bikes sold last year were electric, according to Dutch industry organizations RAI and BOVAG, while in China they have been a popular replacement for motorcycles for more than a decade.\nBut Harris sees demand surging in North America: U.S. sales increased by 85 per cent in March, according to the New York Times, while he said Canadian businesses are struggling to keep e-bikes in stock.\u00a0\nEven so, the possibility of e-bikes becoming commonplace in Canada continues to face significant hurdles. Harris said the federal government currently has insufficient safety standards in place, while Transport Canada proposed dropping all regulation of them in 2018.\u00a0\nHarris said rules are necessary to regulate the vastly different kinds of e-bikes on the market, including the much larger cargo bikes often used in place of delivery trucks.\u00a0\nConfusing or contradictory definitions of \"e-bike\" have led to legal troubles for some riders. In B.C., a Supreme Court judge recently upheld charges against a man who rode an e-bike without insurance, even though the man argued the law doesn't require it.\u00a0\n\"When people are unclear \u2026 about the law and how it applies, then of course they run the risk of offending the law,\" said David Hay, a Vancouver lawyer who specializes in bike-related cases. For example, to be able to ride without road insurance or a license in B.C., it's required that the bicycle have limited power and that it turns off when the rider stops pedalling \u2014 a feature many e-bike models don't have.\u00a0\nHays and Harris think that definitions and regulations around e-bikes need to be updated before they'll be widely adopted in this country.\u00a0\n\"Whenever you get any kind of technological innovation, the law struggles to keep up,\" Hays said. \u2014 Jackson Weaver\nOur interview last week with Dan Kraus of the Nature Conservancy of Canada \u2014 and particularly his advice on taking a more laissez-faire attitude to dandelions \u2014 invited a large response from readers. Here's a sampling.\nDoug Grant wrote, \"It mystifies me that a plant expert would so enthusiastically defend dandelions \u2014 an invasive monoculture. The issue isn't a few here and there. It's that they'll take over if left unchecked.\"\nBruce Bennett, co-ordinator at the Yukon Conservation Data Centre, said, \"Canada is home to at least 13 species of dandelions, and only three are non-native.\"\nCatharine Ross wrote, \"I love the old-fashioned lawns with lots of clover. I also hate the over-manicured look. One year I just let my lawn grow without cutting. I got a visit from the town bylaw officer telling me that my lawn was too high and I had to cut it. I told him I was xeriscaping, but he was having none of it.\"\n\"According to my American Webster's Dictionary, their definition of a 'weed' is 'a plant that has no economic value.' Well, us Canadians all know that the American ... measure of 'value' is strictly monetary, although that may be changing, slowly,\" wrote a reader who goes by Indian Joe. \"As a kid in N.B. in the 1950s, a favourite spring green was dandelion leaf. Another was 'lamb's quarters.' We chewed 'spruce gum.' As a 'hippie' in the late 1960s I made tea from chamomile, raspberry leaf and wild rose berries. Slippery elm was a cold remedy. Glad to see you write an article about these 'unwanted' plants that do so much for the eco-culture.\"\nThe amount of tree loss in tropical regions ticked up again in 2019. According to data gathered by the University of Maryland and released by Global Forest Watch, the loss of primary forest \u2014 i.e. forest areas in their original state \u2014 was nearly three per cent higher in 2019 than the year before. Wildfires in Brazil and Bolivia are among the causes of this, as is clear-cutting efforts for agricultural use and commercial mining.\nAs people across the U.S. and, indeed, around the world protest the treatment of black people at the hands of police, many climate activists and reporters have been drawing connections between race and environmental issues. Namely that people of colour are often the ones most affected by pollution and climate catastrophe, and that they need a greater role in the environmental movement.\nLast November, the United Nations announced that in order to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, CO2 emissions would need to drop by 7.6 per cent annually over the next decade.\u00a0\nGiven that worldwide emissions are estimated to have risen by about 0.4 per cent in 2019, this seemed like an unattainable goal.\nA recent study published in Nature Climate Change, however, suggests that as a result of global shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions in 2020 could drop by roughly seven per cent.\nAt first glance, it might appear as though a devastating economic shutdown is the only way to reach those UN targets. But some experts insist there is a way to have economic growth and still reduce emissions.\nDon Drummond, an economist who worked for the federal Department of Finance for 23 years, pointed out that emissions in Canada have almost flatlined, on average, over the past few years during a period of economic growth (prior to the coronavirus pandemic).\n\"We've achieved higher growth with flattening emissions, and we can and should go further and achieve positive growth with declining emissions,\" said Drummond, an adjunct professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., and former chief economist at the Toronto-Dominion Bank. \"That can be done, but we need a more concentrated policy effort.\"\nMany governments around the world are trying to stimulate their economies during the pandemic, and this could be an opportunity to funnel money into green technologies, said Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, a Canadian professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia in the U.K. and lead author of the Nature study.\nLe Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said that one of the key findings of the Nature study was that the biggest drop in emissions during the pandemic has been in surface transport. This, she said, could be one sector governments could target.\nThat could \"include everything from encouraging home-working for those who want to and who can [and] developing infrastructure for \u2026 walking or cycling.\"\nWhile Drummond believes the Canadian government is likely to invest in methods to reduce emissions, he said it will likely be a long time \u2014 perhaps years \u2014 before we see stimulus packages aimed at revitalizing the economy, such as specific jobs programs.\nIn the meantime, he said the government can use other means to reach the 7.6 per cent emissions-reduction goal, such as disincentives \u2014 like the carbon tax on things like gasoline and heating fuels \u2014 which can be effective in bringing down emissions, particularly when that money is recycled back to people and businesses, as the federal government is doing.\nAnother could be investing in retrofitting buildings to make them more efficient, which would be very labour-intensive and could create more jobs. But Drummond said that would be \"second best.\"\nMark Jaccard, a professor of sustainable energy at Simon Fraser University in B.C., said transitioning to renewable energy isn't as costly as some may think it is.\nHe said it would cost \"at most, two years of economic growth spread over a 30-year period.\" (In recent years, Canada has experienced annual growth in the 1.5 to 1.9 per cent range.)\nJaccard, who is currently working on the next IPCC report, said that this small sacrifice over an extended period of time is far better than the alternative: \"the dramatic crashing [of] your economy because of wildfires, acidified oceans, rising seas, major storms and pandemics that can happen from climate change.\"\nDrummond agrees, noting that concerns about emissions reductions harming the economy will likely always be around, even if they are without merit.\nCanada is already on the right path, he said, and the country can ramp up its efforts to see both economic growth and a notable reduction in emissions.\n\"We are doing it right now, we're just not doing it enough,\" Drummond said. \"If you asked me to move a three-tonne rock, if I can move it an inch, I'm pretty sure I can move it a foot.\"\n\u2014 Nicole Mortillaro\nAre there issues you'd like us to cover?

Or a savings account where it's the bank, not the saver, who collects interest.\nWelcome to the upside-down world of ultra-low and negative interest rates that is taking hold in many parts of the world where economic growth has been sluggish. Now more than a decade old, economists think it could be a feature of the global economy for years to come and change the way people save and invest.\n\"This will mean that we must save more, work longer, and expect less,\" said Olivia Mitchell, an economics professor at the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania.\nThe latest chapter is the drop in interest rates on some bank deposits below zero as central banks, particularly in Europe and Japan, try to support the economy amid uncertainty about trade by making borrowing cheaper to spur spending and investment. Official data released Friday showed that Germany's growth ground to a halt at the end of last year.\nEconomists think there are also longer-term factors causing low rates, such as aging populations in rich countries and high rates of savings in China and other emerging economies.\nLow rates first hit in the wake of the global financial crisis. The U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank slashed rates close to zero. In 2014, the ECB went negative.\nUltra-low rates have helped push up stock markets to record highs, as vanishing returns on safe assets lead to a search for returns elsewhere. Pushing people to invest in riskier assets is part of the stimulus effect central banks are trying to impart. But there are also fears that very low rates can cause markets to bubble up, and crash back down with painful consequences. So far, the dire predictions haven't come true. The current bull market in U.S. stocks turns 11 years old on March 9.\nIn Germany, some banks are now telling companies and others with large amounts of cash that they must pay a rate on large deposits instead of accruing interest. The penalty typically applies to big accounts, such as more than 500,000 euros (about $727,000 Cdn), according to financial website Biallo.de. Banks are doing this because they themselves have to pay a 0.5 per cent\u00a0penalty on deposits they hold at the European Central Bank. If banks can't find a home for depositor money, it winds up in their ECB holdings and results in their being charged.\nSmall depositors like individual consumers are so far not being charged on savings. The idea is politically toxic, especially in Germany.\nBut the low rate environment raises questions about preserving wealth, especially for those trying to save for retirement. German newsmedia are full of stories about \"penalty rates\"and criticism of the European Central Bank for, as they put it, expropriating savers.\nGerhard Michel, a financial coach in Duesseldorf, says people need to be aware that inflation eats away at savings even in more normal times, though people may be less aware of it when rates are above zero.\n\"If you look at it historically, people with savings accounts never had any kind of interesting performance,\" he said. \"The inflation rate ruins any returns on the government bond market or the savings market - and it has always been that way historically. What shocks people now is that people must say the word zero, or even negative, interest.\"\nMichel, who is 53, teaches his coachees about value investing, a more time-consuming approach that analyzes financial statements to look for companies the market may be underestimating.\nHis approach with his own money: \"I will buy stocks until the end of my days.\"\nFour trillion euros worth of government bonds of the 19 countries that use the euro now yield less than zero. Trillions more in Japanese and other government bonds trade below zero around the world. Even Greece, which defaulted on government bonds in 2012 and carries the highest debt load in Europe, was able to sell three-month notes at a negative rate.\nWhy, in fact, would anyone pay for the privilege of buying a bond?\nOne way of viewing the phenomenon is that the investor is paying for the safety of the investment. Or buyers may hope to sell the bond at a profit. That is possible if rates go even lower - as some analysts think they will.\nOn the positive side of the ledger, low or negative interest rates can make it easier for companies and consumers to borrow, stimulating economic activity. The European Central Bank says its policies created 11 million new jobs since 2013. In the U.S., home sales have picked up as mortgage rates have fallen to 3.7 per cent.\nNow, even some home buyers can get into the negative rates game.\nThe Danish bank is unusual in offering the negative rate, but mortgage rates for credit-worthy borrowers are also not far above zero in Germany. For instance, a 10-year mortgage with a large down payment can carry interest of only 0.7 per cent.\nIt's worth noting that real interest rates \u2014\u00a0in other words, when official and market rates are below the rate of inflation \u2014\u00a0have been negative at several points in history, such as in the 1970s, when inflation in the developed world ran into double digits.\nWhat's unusual today is that the actual quoted rates are below zero and that rates have been low for so long.\nInterest rates are always a tradeoff, says economist Adalbert Winkler, professor of international and development finance at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. \"Low real rates favour borrowers like mortgage holders at the expense of savers, and when rates rise it's the other way around.\"\n\"This is always the case when you have expansionary monetary policy and it doesn't make sense to deny that,\" he said.\nLow rates make it easier for governments to borrow and build infrastructure that can spur economic growth, although political pressures have meant that Europe's biggest economy, Germany, prefers to balance its budget than borrow. Other governments, such as Italy, are constrained by high debt.\nNegative rates have not yet appeared in the United States, but they could if the economy stumbles into recession, some economists say. The Federal Reserve would almost certainly cut the short-term rate to nearly zero, as it did for seven years beginning in the Great Recession.\nSince the U.S. 10-year yield is already very low by historical standards, at 1.6 per cent, it wouldn't take much to push it below zero, said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics. The Fed may try to prevent it from happening, possibly by selling Treasuries, but it's not clear they would succeed.\n\"We're not immune to it,\" he said. \"That's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-type world that we don't want to go into.\"\nSo far, Federal Reserve officials have downplayed the potential for negative rates in the U.S.\n\"That's not a tool we're looking at,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday during a congressional hearing. He cited research that negative rates can hurt banks' profits and restrain their willingness to lend.\nThe German Economic Institute in Cologne studied multiple factors believed to cause low rates and concluded it's not just due to central banks but represents a longer-term trend. So low or negative rates could be around for years.\nWith that in mind, Mitchell, the professor, persuaded her two daughters to save 18 per cent of their salaries when they found their first jobs.\n\"We're in a very different capital market regime now than in the last 30 years,\" she said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Get informed on the top stories of the day in one quick scan", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/morning-brief-march-10-2020-1.5492069", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 6:40 AM ET", "2020-03-10T10:40:21.916Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Good morning!

Nissan announced an interim dividend of 10 yen per share, down from 28.50 yen a year ago.\nThe company's global vehicle sales fell 7.5 per cent to 1.27 million in the quarter. Sales in China, its biggest market, fell 2.5 per cent, while those in the United States fell 4.5 per cent.\n\"Our sales in China outpaced the market, but sales in other key regions, including the U.S., Europe, and Japan underperformed,\" Stephen Ma, a corporate vice-president who will become chief financial officer next month, told reporters.\nSlowing demand for cars in the United States and China, the world's biggest auto markets, has led to cut-throat competition, and Nissan's slump in first-half sales has knocked operating profit off course from the automaker's full-year target.\n\"We are revisiting all our assumptions, and as you can see that is why we revised down our forecast for sales volume for the full year,\" Ma said.\nNissan slashed its full-year operating profit forecast by 35 per cent to 150 billion yen, which would be its worst full-year performance in 11 years.\nIt now sees global retail sales at 5.2 million vehicles, down from a previous forecast for 5.5 million, bracing for its worst annual sales in six years.\nNissan in the past few weeks has announced a revamp of its top ranks with younger executives including Ma, while naming the head of its China business, 53-year-old Makoto Uchida, as its next chief executive. The company is seeking to draw a line under the legacy of Ghosn, who is awaiting trial in Japan on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies.\nThe automaker said it would hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting on Feb. 18, 2020, to vote on a proposal for Uchida and other members of the new executive team to become company directors, while former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, outgoing interim CEO Yasuhiro Yamauchi and former Renault CEO Thierry Bollore were scheduled to vacate their director posts.\nYears of heavy discounting and fleet sales, particularly in the United States, has cheapened the automaker's brand image while lowering vehicle resale value and denting profit.\nNissan is implementing a global recovery plan under which it will axe nearly one-tenth of its workforce and cut global vehicle production by 10 per cent through 2023 to rein in costs which it has said ballooned when Ghosn was CEO.\n"}, {"author": "Ainslie MacLellan", "title": "Quebec companies aim to

The Ekati\u00a0mine\u00a0in the Northwest Territories\u00a0suspended operations on March 19, becoming the world's largest producing diamond mine to close because of the pandemic.\u00a0\nAs the world braces for\u00a0what some predict will be a global recession, discretionary spending could drive the demand for diamonds down even further, and bring the North's resource-dependent economy with it.\u00a0\nBut diamond analyst Paul Zimnisky says he has hope the industry will rebound by the end of the year.\nDriving Zimnisky's optimism is the idea that as the threat of COVID-19 slowly dissipates, people will spend \u2014 and spend a lot.\u00a0\n\"When things start to get back to normal, there's some pent up demand and people go out and buy things that make themselves feel good after what we've been through,\" Zimnisky says.\n\"If you look into November, December ... it could actually turn out to be a pretty good holiday season and, you know, people are extra generous which would bode well for diamond demand.\"\nWhile that may seem counterintuitive as many, including Zimnisky, predict a global recession, that kind of spending is exactly what's been happening in China, as the country began lifting some of its lockdown restrictions late last month.\n\"I mean there's some evidence of that when you look at the Chinese market. They actually call it 'revenge spending' after people are restricted\u00a0with\u00a0shopping and going out. It does kind of create a situation where there is pent up demand,\" he said.\nWhat could also help the diamond industry recover in the coming months is the drop in diamond supply as\u00a0mines like Ekati suspend\u00a0operations, while others\u00a0slow production. If supply continues to drop long term, it could help prices increase, Zimnisky says.\nBut just how much the supply will dip is still being debated.\u00a0\nMining analyst Ben Davis with Liberum Capital Ltd. estimates it could drop by 12 per cent. Zimnisky thinks it'll be more like 10 per cent.\nCurrently, Zimnisky said the confirmed production drops from temporary closures is about three per cent.\nWhile Zimnisky is optimistic the industry will rebound by the end of the year, what happens between now and then could decide the future of the Diavik\u00a0diamond mine.\nTwo weeks ago, Rio Tinto, which operates the mine,\u00a0announced that 50 northern workers, roughly five\u00a0per cent of the Diavik workforce,\u00a0were being sent home with pay to reduce the risk of the spread of the coronavirus to their home communities.\u00a0\nAbout\u00a0half of Diavik's employees are flown up from southern Canada. Those workers are exempt from some of the travel restrictions put in place by the N.W.T.'s chief public health officer Dr. Kami Kandola.\u00a0\nBut if those travel restrictions were to tighten and Diavik was forced to suspend operations and go into care and maintenance, there is a possibility it could stay shuttered.\nZimnisky says mines nearing the end of their mine life would have to take a very close look at whether it would be worth reopening.\nDiavik has an estimated five years of production left.\n\"There would be a longer-term suspension like a care and maintenance situation ...

The Ekati\u00a0mine\u00a0in the Northwest Territories\u00a0suspended operations on March 19, becoming the world's largest producing diamond mine to close because of the pandemic.\u00a0\nAs the world braces for\u00a0what some predict will be a global recession, discretionary spending could drive the demand for diamonds down even further, and bring the North's resource-dependent economy with it.\u00a0\nBut diamond analyst Paul Zimnisky says he has hope the industry will rebound by the end of the year.\nDriving Zimnisky's optimism is the idea that as the threat of COVID-19 slowly dissipates, people will spend \u2014 and spend a lot.\u00a0\n\"When things start to get back to normal, there's some pent up demand and people go out and buy things that make themselves feel good after what we've been through,\" Zimnisky says.\n\"If you look into November, December ... it could actually turn out to be a pretty good holiday season and, you know, people are extra generous which would bode well for diamond demand.\"\nWhile that may seem counterintuitive as many, including Zimnisky, predict a global recession, that kind of spending is exactly what's been happening in China, as the country began lifting some of its lockdown restrictions late last month.\n\"I mean there's some evidence of that when you look at the Chinese market. They actually call it 'revenge spending' after people are restricted\u00a0with\u00a0shopping and going out. It does kind of create a situation where there is pent up demand,\" he said.\nWhat could also help the diamond industry recover in the coming months is the drop in diamond supply as\u00a0mines like Ekati suspend\u00a0operations, while others\u00a0slow production. If supply continues to drop long term, it could help prices increase, Zimnisky says.\nBut just how much the supply will dip is still being debated.\u00a0\nMining analyst Ben Davis with Liberum Capital Ltd. estimates it could drop by 12 per cent. Zimnisky thinks it'll be more like 10 per cent.\nCurrently, Zimnisky said the confirmed production drops from temporary closures is about three per cent.\nWhile Zimnisky is optimistic the industry will rebound by the end of the year, what happens between now and then could decide the future of the Diavik\u00a0diamond mine.\nTwo weeks ago, Rio Tinto, which operates the mine,\u00a0announced that 50 northern workers, roughly five\u00a0per cent of the Diavik workforce,\u00a0were being sent home with pay to reduce the risk of the spread of the coronavirus to their home communities.\u00a0\nAbout\u00a0half of Diavik's employees are flown up from southern Canada. Those workers are exempt from some of the travel restrictions put in place by the N.W.T.'s chief public health officer Dr. Kami Kandola.\u00a0\nBut if those travel restrictions were to tighten and Diavik was forced to suspend operations and go into care and maintenance, there is a possibility it could stay shuttered.\nZimnisky says mines nearing the end of their mine life would have to take a very close look at whether it would be worth reopening.\nDiavik has an estimated five years of production left.\n\"There would be a longer-term suspension like a care and maintenance situation ... I think when you start to look at our mines that are approaching the end of mine life, you know, the other way of looking at it might be that there's just not enough resource left to make putting [the mine] on care and\u00a0maintenance worth it,\" Zimnisky said.\nIn an emailed statement from Rio Tinto, a spokesperson did not comment on what Zimnisky said, but emphasized that the mine\u00a0continues to operate \"at capacity,\" and in line with recommendations and orders of the N.W.T.'s Office of the Chief Public Health Officer.\n\"Our focus is on the health and safety of our employees and communities, and on keeping our operations running safely, so we can continue to contribute to the Northwest Territories\u00a0economy,\" the spokesperson said.\u00a0\nOne thing Zimnisky says is absolutely clear\u00a0is that the market won't rebound overnight.\n\"When you look at some of the diamond mining stocks ... some of them are down 50, 60, 70 per cent just over the last month or two.

It was designed to weather these types of significant market downturns once in a while.\"\nThe pandemic has stunted the global economy as governments order workers to stay home and shutter businesses in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.\u00a0\nBut Machin says that thanks to a diversified portfolio, will overcome a projected recession.\nHere's part of Machin's interview with The Current's Matt Galloway.\u00a0\nThe economic fallout is already being felt. So how is it that the CPPIB would be insulated by that?\nThe money we manage isn't completely insulated. So obviously as markets go down, it's likely that the funds that we have will go down. But we do a number of things.\u00a0\nFirst of all, we diversified the monies. We haven't got all our eggs in one particular market or one particular type of investment, and that provides some cushion.\u00a0\nFor example, generally when the stock market goes down, the government bond market will strengthen. That provides some offsets.\u00a0\nHow much of our money is invested in oil and gas? Because we've seen the price of oil, again, drop lower and lower and lower. The gas sector taking a huge hit as well.\u00a0\nNot so much. About 3 per cent of the fund overall is exposed to that sector. So it's not a huge amount.\u00a0\nWhere are you investing the pension money of Canadians?\nSo it's invested broadly around the world, which helps.\u2026 We're invested in the rest of North America, Russia, South America, Europe and we're invested in Asia. We're invested in bonds and we're also invested in private assets like infrastructure \u2014 relatively safe things, generally on the infrastructure front, like roads and ports and electricity and those types of things.\nWhat are [the] industries that are doing better now than others? Because it seems as though, from a distance, that everybody is taking this hit.\nThere are industries that are doing fine. For example, anything to do with our delivery and logistics, particularly at-home ordering.\u00a0\nOne company we've invested in Europe is a flavour and fragrance company that's benefited from two things. One is the rise in the buying of toilet paper and tissues because it puts the fragrance in that, and also canned soup.\u2026 The flavour that goes into that also came from this company.\nSo there are certain companies that are doing well. But it is a narrow slice of companies.\u00a0\nAnd generally there's lots of companies, whether it's in travel or leisure or sports, etc., that are obviously going to suffer quite a lot. And then there's a lot in between that are going to just have dampened demand and dampened ability to do business, because all the economies in the world are shut down.\nAre you predicting a recession?\nYes. So we're predicting that for the world for this year, we'll be down about 2.4 per cent growth, and Canada is going to be particularly badly hit in the second quarter of this year. So over 20 per cent decline annualized for GDP growth. So it's going to be a very steep recession.\u00a0\nBut we think by the fourth quarter, it should be growing strongly again. And by next year, we see the world rebounding. So the world growing almost 7 per cent next year is our current number, and Canada growing over 4 per cent for next year.\u00a0\nBut I think we've got months ahead of us to get through this.\nThis Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0\nWritten by Justin Chandler.

About 20 per cent\u00a0of oil traded worldwide goes through the Strait of Hormuz, where the shipping lane is only three\u00a0kilometres\u00a0wide and tankers have come under attack this year.\nThe international benchmark for crude oil jumped 4.5 per cent, or $2.98 US, to $69.23 a barrel in London trading. The U.S. contract was up 4.3 per cent, or $2.60, to $63.78.\nThe higher oil price\u00a0in the wake of the U.S. airstrike was driving up share prices for Canadian energy companies and threatening higher fuel prices for consumers in Canada.\nCanadian oil and gas stocks climbed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, led by oilsands producers MEG Energy Corp. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.\nRandy Ollenberger, managing director of oil and gas equity research at BMO Capital Markets, says there are fears that an escalation in conflict could affect Saudi Arabian output or lead to problems with oil shipments through the region.\n\"We saw $80 [for Brent crude oil]\u00a0last time with a relatively brief outage,\" he said.\n\"If Iran made a more concerted action to disrupt global production, you'd be looking at prices higher than that, in which case you'd certainly see an even bigger move in Canadian equities.\"\n\"Revenge will come, maybe not overnight, but it will come, and until then we need to increase the geopolitical risk premium,\" said Olivier Jakob, head of consultancy Petromatrix, in a note to investors.\nHe noted Iran's response may not be limited to the Strait of Hormuz.\nIn September, Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels launched drone attacks on the world's largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia. The strike briefly took out about half of the supplies from the world's largest oil exporter. The U.S. directly blamed Iran, which denied involvement.\nLaunching attacks that can't be easily linked back to Iran limits the chances of direct retaliation.\nHowever, Iran has also directly targeted tankers. This year, it seized a British-flagged tanker\u00a0the Stena Impero for several weeks. And it has shot down a U.S. military drone.\nAbout 80 per cent\u00a0of the crude oil that travels through the Strait of Hormuz goes to countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea.\nBut the rise in the global price of oil will have a wider effect, particularly in oil-importing countries with big manufacturing sectors like Germany and Italy. Those countries fared worst in the stock market on Friday, with their main indexes falling 1.4 per cent\u00a0and 1.1 per cent,\u00a0respectively.\nThe economic damage could be limited given that the energy market is flush with oil while the growth in demand has softened as major economies have slowed. And crude-producing countries,\u00a0particularly the Unites States,\u00a0have been pumping oil at a high rate.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) group\u00a0and key ally Russia agreed last month to cut their oil production, but many countries have been pumping above their limits.\nThat has\u00a0kept the price of oil in check. On Friday, the Brent benchmark rose to its highest since May after largely hovering around $60 a barrel.\nA gradual rise in renewable energy production could also limit the economic damage from a jump in crude prices.

Governments in Europe, the Americas and elsewhere are desperately trying to build up supplies for medics, nursing home staff and the public.\nNow, with global cases surpassing one million and the outbreak exploding in the United States, the competition for precious stocks is intensifying further.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said\u00a0Friday that the U.S. government is now recommending Americans wear cloth face coverings on a voluntary basis to stem the spread of the virus, but the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend wearing medical-grade masks.\nHe also said he was signing a directive to stop the export of N95 respirator masks, which provide essential protection for health-care workers,\u00a0and other U.S. medical equipment.\nU.S.-listed multinational 3M Co. said Friday that the White House had ordered it to stop all shipments to Canada and Latin America of respirators that it manufactures in the U.S., despite what 3M called \"significant humanitarian implications.\"\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said\u00a0blocking the flow of equipment across the border would be a \"mistake\" that could backfire, noting that the country's health-care professionals go to work in Detroit every day.\nIn another case, an order of 200,000 masks bound for Germany was diverted to the U.S., Berlin Secretary of Interior Andreas Geisel said, calling it an \"act of modern piracy.\"\nIn a statement Friday, Geisel said the consignment had been \"confiscated\" in Bangkok and said: \"Even in times of global crisis, you shouldn't use Wild West methods.\"\nHowever on Saturday, his office rowed back, saying it was still trying to clarify the circumstances of how the masks, which were ordered from a German wholesaler, and not from U.S. manufacturer 3M, had been diverted.\nA spokesperson\u00a0for 3M told Reuters the company had no evidence its products had been seized.\nAsked by Reuters about the 200,000 masks at a daily briefing\u00a0Saturday, Trump said \"there has been no act of piracy.\"\nA U.S. Department of Homeland Security official told Reuters this week that U.S. companies and the government have been paying above market price for much of the gear purchased overseas.\nThe official, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter, said the U.S.\u00a0would not stop buying \"until we have way too much\" and could still be searching out protective gear abroad through August.\n\"We've gotten our hands on every bit of it that we can,\"\u00a0the official said.\nLea Crager, a spokesperson for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the agency co-ordinating the search for medical supplies abroad, said disasters often lead to price increases for certain goods.\n\"If it causes some sort of a supply chain disruption, you're going to see costs rise for an essential commodity,\" Crager said. \"It just happens.\"\nIn Brazil, Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said this week that China had ditched some Brazilian equipment orders when the U.S. government sent more than 20 cargo planes to the country to buy the same products.\n\"Our purchases, which we expected to complete in order to be able to supply, many were dropped,\" said the minister in an interview Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, Mandetta said Brazil had finally succeeded in placing a 1.2 billion reais ($319\u00a0million Cdn) order for equipment, although it will only be delivered in 30 days.\nA second German source employed by a company now helping Merkel's government to order masks said the last weekend of March had been a turning point, and drew a link with the U.S.'s increased presence in the market.\nContracts no longer guaranteed delivery, the source said, adding: \"Demand is much, much bigger than supply.\"\nIn France, three regional leaders painted a similar picture.

I'm talking about hours, potentially days.\"\nThat was more than one week ago and the federal government has yet to unveil how it plans to help the oil and gas sector.\nIn recent years, the oilpatch in Western Canada\u00a0hasn't had a lot of good things\u00a0to say about the federal government.\u00a0But executives around the sector these days are voicing few complaints \u2014 and even expressing words of encouragement.\nAs the federal government assembles some sort of relief package, oilpatch leaders are\u00a0saying\u00a0how well Ottawa is handling the situation and how communication about the issue has abundant and positive.\nSeveral board members of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers are in weekly conversations with\u00a0Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan\u00a0and calls with provincial government leaders.\n\"They've all been really just excellent in understanding the size of this crisis, and they're all over it and they're basically saying, 'We're making plans and we need your input to get it right,'\" said Jonathan Wright, chief executive of NuVista Energy, a Calgary-based oil and gas company with a focus on northwest Alberta.\nWright wouldn't get into the specifics of those conversations, to respect the confidentiality, but said there is no secret about what the oilpatch wants.\n\"At a time like this, the number one thing is liquidity. The first three things are liquidity,\" he said.\nWhen commodity prices are so low, oilpatch companies often struggle to obtain financing from banks, investors and the broader finance community.\n\"The last thing you want to see is, for example, your bank line shrink at a time like this, even though you're a strong company,\"\u00a0said Wright. \"Where the government can step in is ensuring they are providing liquidity and encouragement to the banks such that we don't get an undue compression of liquidity for strong companies.\"\nThe oilpatch is struggling because of three main factors right now: The decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to flood the market with oil, problems with accessing funding from equity markets, and COVID-19, which has resulted in demand for oil to plunge.\nOil prices in Alberta are at record lows with a barrel of crude selling for about $4 US this week.\nStill, any talk of financial help for the oilpatch will enrage critics who would much rather see government money used to promote renewable energy sources, instead of aiding the fossil fuel sector.\u00a0If money goes to the oilpatch, they say, it should be aimed at helping workers, not companies.\nThis federal government has said it needs a strong oil and gas industry to help with the transition to cleaner energy.\nThe oilpatch doesn't want a handout or bailout from Ottawa, according to Grant Fagerheim, the chief executive of oil producer Whitecap Resources.\u00a0Instead, industry leaders want the federal and provincial governments to look at ways to reduce expenses for the industry such as providing funding for debt and lowering royalties.\n\"Then you are not picking winners and losers, you're actually doing it overall for the energy space to help drive down their costs to make it more competitive with other places around the world,\" he said.\nRichard Masson, an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy and chair of the World Petroleum Council of Canada, said Ottawa could provide financial relief in many forms such as loans with flexible repayment terms.\n\"We need to allow the companies to have enough cash so they don't get so much debt on their balance sheets that the creditors won't continue to support them,\" he said.\n\"They need enough financial capacity that they can continue to pay all these operating costs, even if they're losing money, and get through to the other side.\"\nTristan Goodman, president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada, which represents junior and mid-sized oil and gas producers, said the sector is also looking for relief in other ways, such as regulatory changes that reduce costs while the industry deals with its current struggles.\n\"Anything around regulatory support to make sure we can continue to move forward during times of cash flow crisis, as well as making sure the fiscal side of that is also taken care of, meaning taxes and anything on that side,\" he said.\u00a0\nGoodman said help for the sector will help other industries across the country as well that it does business with, from technology firms to steel manufacturers to finance companies.\n\"It's really not just about the oil and gas business,\" he said.\n\"It really is about the broader Canadian economy and all those sectors, whether they're professional accountants and lawyers, finance people or IT\u00a0people.\"\nIn the past, the federal government has provided funding for the cleanup of orphan oil and gas wells, which provides jobs for the oilfield service sector, and it may look to support more of this type of work.\nMorneau's office did not immediately return a message seeking comment.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadians have paid Netflix nearly $800M so far this year", "description": "Critics argue Netflix draws viewers away from homegrown TV programming", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/netflix-revenue-canada-taxes-1.5398579", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5398606.1576540167!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/streaming-stocks.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 16, 2019 7:02 PM ET", "2019-12-17T17:10:48.103Z"], "source": null, "content": "Netflix pulled back the curtain on new financial details Monday that reveal how many Canadians subscribe to the service and how much they pay the streaming giant.\nThe Los Gatos, Calif.-based company raked in $780 million Cdn\u00a0of revenue from Canada during the first nine months of the 2019 financial year, according documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThat compares to Canadian revenues of $835 million\u00a0in the full 12-month period of 2018, and $668 million\u00a0during 2017.\nThose figures could add heat to the debate over Netflix not paying domestic revenue taxes.

A playoff victory\u00a0over the Saskatchewan Roughriders on the way to the CFL championship made the end of a long Cup drought even sweeter, not to mention the fact the Riders' season ended when quarterback Cody Fajardo struck a goalpost.\nManitobans overall\u00a0tend to be less obsessed with competing with our western neighbours, who tend to be\u00a0just as nice and polite as we are, if not more.\nNonetheless, the eternal struggle with\u00a0Saskatchewan seemed\u00a0to be a factor in the development of a significant piece of Premier Brian Pallister's fiscal policy.\n\"Manitoba's level of sales tax now makes us tied with Saskatchewan. We were two behind them before,\" Pallister said Thursday as he announced Manitoba's provincial sales tax will drop another percentage point on Canada Day.\n\"It makes us essentially tied with Minnesota and it moves us within one per cent of North Dakota,\" he added, drawing further attention to regional sales-tax rivalries that never seem to make the top of the highlights packages on TSN's SportsCentre.\nIn all seriousness, sales-tax differentials are a big deal in western\u00a0Manitoba towns like Russell and Swan River, where shoppers are said to scoot across the border to buy groceries or\u00a0bigger-ticket items in the retail mecca of Yorkton, Sask.\nThis does not, however, seem to be the main reason Pallister doubled\u00a0his 2016 election campaign pledge to cut the PST by one percentage point.\nRather, this second PST cut effectively serves as a partial rebate for the other big policy plank he unveiled on Thursday: the resurrection of his carbon tax.\nFor those of you trying not to follow along at home\u00a0\u2014 and who can blame you\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Pallister's Progressive Conservative government announced plans to bring in a $25-a-tonne carbon tax in 2017 and then cancelled that plan the following year.\nPallister was and remains indignant over Ottawa's insistence on imposing a carbon tax that would eventually rise\u00a0to $50 a tonne in Manitoba, all the while allowing leeway for some other provinces.\nNow, the $25-a-tonne carbon tax described by Pallister as\u00a0\"flat like the prairie horizon\" is back, albeit with a new name. It's now a \"green levy,\" a moniker that may be easier to sell to the PC party base than a carbon tax.\nExcept, it is a carbon tax. Pallister made that clear when he repeated his pitch to Ottawa to cut Manitoba some carbon slack as the only western, Tory-led province willing to play ball on\u00a0greenhouse-gas reductions.\nThe revenue from this tax\u00a0\u2014 $285 million a year, based on what the PCs said Thursday\u00a0\u2014 will not be earmarked for environmental initiatives, including what Pallister described as \"record new green investments\" that will be announced on Wednesday\u00a0when the 2020-21 provincial budget is unveiled.\nInstead, the revenue from Carbon Tax Two: The Levy Strikes Back\u00a0will flow into general revenues as a partial backstop for that PST cut.\nHow precisely this will work, in terms of money in and money out of the provincial books, is up in the air for now.\nOn April Fool's Day, Ottawa will impose a $30-a-tonne carbon tax on Manitoba. This is not a joke, despite the date.\nThen on July 1, Manitoba is set to institute its green levy. At that point, Ottawa could claw back its tax by $25. The feds could also choose to ignore the Manitoba tax altogether.\nIn the meantime, Manitoba and Ottawa could work out some form of carbon tax deal. Or the Supreme Court could make a ruling in Manitoba's legal challenge of Ottawa's right to impose a carbon tax.\nIn other words, anyone who claims to know\u00a0precisely what Manitobans\u00a0will be paying in terms of carbon taxes this summer is a gambler or a fool or both.\nThis is only some of the fiscal uncertainty facing the province, whose budget season coincides with increasing uncertainty about the worldwide economy.\nA long-expected stock market correction appears to have arrived, hastened if not triggered by fears about COVID-19, the illness related to the new coronavirus\u00a0spreading across the planet.\nIf the correction marks the start of a recession, Manitoba may have more trouble balancing its books in the coming years, as Pallister promised to do.\nThe province is expecting real gross domestic product growth of 1.3 per cent this year, based on a fiscal\u00a0update earlier this week. The Conference Board of Canada is less optimistic about Manitoba as it predicts the provincial economy will only grow by 0.9 per cent.\nBoth of those projections were formulated\u00a0before COVID-19 fears led to stock market selloffs. If a prolonged economic slowdown\u00a0is coming, Manitoba may not be as immune as it was in 2008-09, thanks to the\u00a0increasingly interconnected nature of global supply chains in a product-on-demand world.\nIn other words, Manitoba may yet regret a decision to forgo hundreds of millions of dollars in PST revenue this year in particular.

With that, lumber prices also hit dramatic lows.\u00a0\nThen, the 1929 stock market crash kicked off the Great Depression, which had this effect on P.E.I.: there was literally no money.\u00a0\nClive Bruce was born in 1910 and fished off P.E.I.'s north shore for 80 years \u2014\u00a0cod, hake, lobster, tuna, whatever he could, sometimes for as little as one\u00a0cent a pound. His first paying job was for 10 cents a day.\nHe told Dutch he used to trade cod liver oil for gas for his boat.\nBruce told a story of his aunt and uncle receiving a letter at Christmas which had to be answered \u2014 however, they did not have the two cents for a stamp.\u00a0\n\"They had a bunch of hens and they kept feeding the hens hot food and hot water to see if they could get a couple of eggs out of them, to go to Mossey's store to buy a stamp\" he said.\nThe\u00a0hens eventually laid two eggs, and his uncle went to the store, sold the eggs to get the stamp, and mailed the letter \u2014 although \"a month-and-a half after it was due\", Bruce said.\nBruce told Dutch he eventually built his own house in Elmira by getting up at 2:30 a.m. to pound nails before heading down to the wharf to go fishing at sunrise.\u00a0\nNora Wonnacott of Charlottetown was born in 1896 and died in 2004 at the age of 107.\nShe told Dutch in an interview back in 1998 about some of the stores in Charlottetown when she was growing up. S.A. MacDonald ran a store by the same name on Queen Street, she said, which sold clothing and of course, hats, which everyone wore at the time.\nThe store's head milliner, Pauline Seaman, taught Wonnacott to make hats when she was a young woman, and she thought she might even become a hat-maker herself. She recalled a trip to New Brunswick with Seaman for an Easter hat fashion show \u2014 she said her favourite part of the trip was dancing with a couple of nice fellows at the local dance hall!\u00a0\nThe store's owner \"wanted me to go in the window and show clothes. I knew if I did that, I'd be thought terrible. Those things weren't done here. He said he'd give me $10 each time,\" Wonnacott said.\u00a0\nShe didn't do it.\n\"I thought it'd cheapen me,\" she said.\nTimes might have been tough, but a woman's reputation was worth everything in those days.\u00a0\nMany Islanders were tempted by the opportunity to make money by rum-running and bootlegging, since there was little opportunity to buy liquor legally except by prescription. If they could come up with $3 to $5 a gallon for the rum, they could easily make double the money selling it.\u00a0\nRum boats sat a few miles off P.E.I.'s shore, not daring to land lest they be arrested by P.E.I. prohibition officers.\u00a0\nClive Bruce told Dutch he didn't run rum, but he would sell the rum-runners bottles of fresh water \u2014 trading one bottle of water for a carton of cigarettes with 20 packages.\nThe cigarettes were also contraband, he said, and the packages were stamped \u2014 so he'd empty the individual unstamped cigarettes into a bucket with a rock in the bottom. If he saw the authorities approaching in their cutter, he'd toss the bucket overboard to get rid of the evidence, he said.\u00a0\nLester Hickox was born in 1909. His father Spurgeon was a man of many skills, and ran the little ferry between Clyde River and Charlottetown. As a boy, Lester worked with his father on the ferry, transporting everything from passengers to Ford Model T cars into town.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"I remember one time seeing a vessel coming in from Barbados with molasses, boatload of molasses, big barrels of molasses!\" Hickox said.\nWhen the crew lined up the wooden barrels or \"puncheons\" on the wharf, they began to swell in the summer hear, so air holes were cut in the barrels for ventilation.\n\"The kids would\u00a0go down there with straws, sucking molasses out of these barrels,\" Hickox said with a chuckle. \"I'd like to get some of the molasses today that we had then.\"\u00a0\n\"You'd pour it, it was almost clear, it wasn't black like it is now. The molasses we get now is what they used to call 'horse molasses' in those days.\"\u00a0\nPeople would buy the barrels once they were empty, and scrape the sticky residue off the bottom to make candy. Then they'd saw the barrel in half, and use the two containers to store salt herring and mackerel.\nIn other words, nothing was wasted.\u00a0\nKeith Pratt, born in 1910, ran a general store for years in Bloomfield Station where molasses was one of the most popular commodities.\u00a0\n\"We would sell in the store there about 50 puncheons of molasses in a year,\" he told Dutch. The puncheons held 90 to 100 gallons and at 13 pounds per gallon, they would weigh 1,200 to 1,300 pounds.\nLeading up to Christmas, Pratt\u00a0said he'd sell a puncheon every day to Islanders, using it to make baked goods\u00a0or moonshine. He paid 43.5 cents per gallon.\u00a0\nPratt recalled having to heat the molasses on the stove in winter, because it would be too cold and thick to use.\nHere are some more \"you think you had it hard?\" scenarios from the bygone days, from past Dutch columns you may have missed.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1609983555813", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Kerry Campbell", "title": "Under shadow of COVID-19, Island potato growers face uncertain season", "description": "Those who grow for french fry industry expecting volume cut of up to 20% in contract with Cavendish Farms", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-covid-19-potato-growers-1.5536703", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5184953.1561131858!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pei-spring-planting-potato-farming-2019.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 20, 2020 6:00 AM AT", "2020-04-20T09:00:00.315Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In eastern P.E.I., where the soil is sandier and dries quickly, some Island potato farmers have already begun planting this year's crop. Other growers farther west will start planting in the coming weeks.\u00a0\nBut even before most potatoes are in the ground, many producers are facing an uncertain future for their product, which could affect decisions they make around what to plant this spring, along with the money they're able to make once potatoes have been harvested.\n\"It's going to shake itself through so that everybody's going to feel some hurt,\" said Vernon Campbell, who farms near Kensington.\nThe closure of restaurant dining rooms across North America has taken a big bite out of demand for P.E.I.'s biggest export \u2014 frozen fries and other potato products.\nLike many Island farmers, Campbell grows potatoes under contract with processor Cavendish Farms, the biggest private employer on P.E.I.\nThe company has already asked Campbell and its other suppliers to start selling what's left of last year's crop to other buyers if they can. Campbell is sitting on 12 million pounds of potatoes, about twice as much as he would usually have this time of year, and still expects to sell those to Cavendish Farms.\u00a0\nBut the timeline for delivery is now delayed and there's a possibility Cavendish might still not take them all \u2014\u00a0something the company could be allowed to do under its contract because the circumstances leading to the drop in demand are beyond either parties' control.\nMeanwhile, Campbell and other growers have a new contract for the coming season, but won't know until the end of April how many potatoes the company wants from them from this year's harvest. They've been told to expect reductions in volume\u00a0of up to 20 per cent.\nCampbell said he'll plant the excess acres in barley or alfalfa or something else \"but of course potatoes have always been the cash generator.\"\nPotato receipts are worth a quarter-billion dollars a year to Island farmers, not to mention the hundreds of millions per year in the value of frozen potato exports from P.E.I.\nJason Hayden, chair of the P.E.I. Potato Board, said he expects an overall drop in potato acres planted this season, and a drop in revenues that could hit contract potato growers particularly hard.\n\"For a typical farm cutting back 10 to 20 per cent may not seem like much, but each farm is sort of built to handle a certain capacity,\" he said.\nThere are variable costs for things like fertilizer that can go down with lower production, Hayden explained, but also fixed costs for things like equipment that are static \"and it makes it hard to not only be profitable, but just to break even in a year like this.\"\nThe board is discouraging farmers from planting more potatoes than they have a market for, for fear of flooding the market and depressing prices.\nThere's been an uptick in demand for fresh potatoes from consumers stocking up, and for product to be made into potato chips, because as the United Potato Growers of Canada noted in a recent report, \"consumers have continued to purchase their favourite stay-at-home\u00a0snack and comfort food\" through the pandemic.\nBut Hayden said\u00a0it hasn't been enough to make up for lost restaurant sales.\n\"The really big unknown is our markets. Will restaurants be open and food service be back sort-of to normal or will that still be more-or-less closed down?\" he said.\nThe potato industry is also facing a potential labour supply shortage as growers who use temporary foreign workers face delays getting them to Canada and getting them through the federally-mandated two weeks of isolation before they can be put to work.\u00a0\nThere are also concerns that an outbreak of COVID-19 at Cavendish Farms, which employs 700 people,\u00a0could put a stop to processing.\nAnd then there are concerns that even if restaurants open back up, international supply chains could remain disrupted, jeopardizing the more than $300 million in frozen potato products P.E.I. ships internationally each year.\nAs they consider spring planting, farmers are also mulling over what to do if they end up with tens of millions of pounds of potatoes from their existing stocks that can't be processed.\nThe options being considered include everything from making some available to local food banks to burying them in the ground.\u00a0\n\"That would be the last option,\" said Hayden. \"We're certainly hoping we can make some kind of use of the potatoes that are on hand at the moment without resorting to that.\"\nWhile expecting a hard season ahead, Campbell said he's been through other hard times, like when potato wart closed the U.S. border to P.E.I. potatoes.\n\"We're very blessed to live in a place like this. You know we've contained the pandemic so far,\" Campbell said.\nIt'll be \"a good year to have behind us.\u2026 Keep your head down and work hard, and hopefully we'll be here for better days ahead.\"\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Money was scarce and times were tough in P.E.I.'s Bygone Days", "description": "How some Islanders scraped together a living 100 years ago", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bygone-days-dutch-thompson-money-was-scarce-hard-times-1.5503183", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4821729.1584727726!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/s-a-macdonald-s-custom-tailor-shop-and-clothing-store-ca-1900.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 22, 2020 8:00 AM AT", "2020-03-22T11:00:00.250Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Reginald (Dutch)\u00a0Thompson's column The Bygone Days brings you the voices of Island seniors, many of whom are now long-departed.

Potter\u00a0says she too has heard many concerns from people in the downtown core, especially from seniors and tourists, about the lack of a grocery store.\n\"They always went downtown to do their grocery shopping for years and years and years before the commercial uptown even happened,\" she said.\n\"I think part of it is the pattern in the way of living that has changed for them and for historic downtown.\"\nAnother voice she often hears is from the restaurants in downtown who need to run up town to stock up when their inventory is low or even when they need something quickly.\nWith the\u00a0focus on rejuvenating the downtown area,\u00a0Potter\u00a0said the area is now ripe for a grocery store.\nPotter's pitch for a grocery store would be something similar to Masstown Market in Nova Scotia \u2014 a familiar stop for people en route to Halifax.\n\"To me that would be a huge success as a grocery store in downtown,\" she said.\nMasstown marries ideas from a farmer's market and a grocery store as it includes a\u00a0deli, bakery, a restaurant, groceries, local flavours and more.\n\"When you look at that it is\u00a0always jam-packed with locals, it's not just tourists there\u00a0\u2026 they're going there because it's something very unique,\" she said.\n\"To me if we can provide that, and also we can make it convenient for people here, then I think you have a win-win.\"\nA \"niche\" grocery store like that, Potter said, would add\u00a0value to the downtown as a potentially popular spot for tourists and it would simultaneously fill a gap that's been missing in Summerside since Foodland\u00a0closed.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "BMO restructuring charge to lead to hundreds of job losses", "description": "BMO says restructuring charge to affect about 5% of global workforce, without offering specifics", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-of-montreal-q4-1.5382312", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5382330.1575390104!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bmo-20191203.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 03, 2019 12:03 PM ET", "2019-12-03T18:44:51.624Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Bank of Montreal's fourth-quarter profit fell to $1.19 billion as it was hit by a restructuring charge related primarily to severance that will affect about five per cent of its global workforce.\nThe bank said Tuesday the quarter ended Oct. 31 included a $357-million restructuring charge as a result of a decision to accelerate delivery of digitization initiatives and simplification of the way it does business.\nPart of reason for the move was lower margins from its personal and commercial banking business in the United States as a result of lower interest rates, as well as slower U.S. economic growth expected next year, officials said.\nBMO didn't reveal details about where or when the job cuts will occur, but it had about 45,513 employees at the end of October. A five per cent cut suggests about 2,275 jobs would be affected.\nBased on the geographic breakdown of BMO's workforce, the restructuring could affect roughly 1,500 jobs in Canada and 775 in the United States.\nChief financial officer Tom Flynn said the efficiency initiatives announced Tuesday will provide annual savings of $200 million in its 2020 financial year, which began Nov. 1, and about $375 million by the first quarter of its 2021 financial year.\n\"I would expect the savings that we've talked about to flow through each of our businesses in a fairly representative way \u2026 both by operating group and by geography,\" Flynn told analysts on a conference call.\nChief executive Darryl White said the cuts are a \"sizable move\" for the bank but reflects its strategy of continuous improvement and management discipline.\n\"We're looking for people to invest in areas where we have opportunities for growth and slow down in areas where we don't,\" White said.\nHe said BMO clients and the bank have \"general balanced optimism\" about their momentum going into 2020.\n\"In Canada, we expect macroeconomic conditions to remain constructive in 2020, improving modestly from 2019 with stable interest rates and unemployment running at a four decade low of 5.6 per cent.

Our goals over the medium-term are to achieve average earnings per share growth of seven per cent to 10 per cent.\"\nIn reporting its results Tuesday, BMO said it will now pay a quarterly dividend of $1.06 per share, up three cents from its previous rate.\nThe increased payment to shareholders came as BMO reported its net profit amounted to $1.78 per share for the quarter ended Oct. 31. The result was down from a profit of nearly $1.70 billion or $2.58 per share a year ago, when the fourth quarter included a $203-million after-tax benefit from the re-measurement of an employee benefit liability.\nThis year's fourth quarter included $253 million in total provisions for credit losses, up from $175 million a year earlier, but lower than the $306 million announced for the quarter ended Aug. 31.\nOn an adjusted basis, BMO says it earned nearly $1.61 billion in the quarter, up from $1.53 billion in the same quarter last year. The adjusted profit amounted to $2.43 per share, up from $2.32 per share a year ago.\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of $2.41 per share, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nBMO was the second of Canada's big banks to release fourth-quarter results, following Bank of Nova Scotia.

That said, there are many credible environmentalists who insist market forces can and will be used to improve the climate.\nAnd greed may have contributed to the mess in Hong Kong. It has been widely remarked that income disparity, high housing costs and a shortage of good jobs have been among\u00a0the early\u00a0motivations for the youthful discontent that has blown up into something so much worse.\nMy current job at the CBC is to write about economics and financial markets, so it is hard to escape the fact that anything I write about Hong Kong will include those kind of references. But the reader's tweet made me think about\u00a0how important financial markets are, specifically in the case of this dispute that has grown through mismanagement from peaceful demonstrations to pitched battles reminiscent of a war zone.\u00a0\nThe first thing to say is that, while far from perfect in their current rendition, markets remain valuable tools, that, until we invent a better system, are essential to our well-being as individuals and as a society.\u00a0Arguably they are often commandeered by elite special interests. However, while\u00a0too complex to describe all their benefits\u00a0here, financial markets also allow us to build large, useful structures and evaluate their relative worth.\nThe best financial markets, like the best ports or highway systems, are not built overnight. The most reliable ones only occur in relatively healthy societies, ones that have a well-educated workforce, functioning transportation, good housing and laws\u00a0that try to discourage corruption and\u00a0fraud. As an example of such a society, Hong Kong \u2014\u00a0with median incomes at developed-country levels, reliable courts and good services \u2014\u00a0has been\u00a0ideal.\nWhile stock markets may be the visible portion, a successful financial centre like Hong Kong is an intricate network of highly skilled humans working together in banking, law, insurance, sales, communication and a variety of specialist jobs\u00a0it is hard for most of us to imagine. Large\u00a0financial\u00a0centres are enormously valuable\u00a0for the services they provide, the local wealth they generate in terms of employment and other spin-offs.\nAs a rule, successful financial markets and the complex system required to run them do not grow up\u00a0in unstable war zones. And when stable societies crumble, markets crumble with them.\nThis is one of the reasons the current chaos in the streets of Hong Kong matters to markets and why those markets may act as a deterrence to greater police violence or the kind of invasion threatened by Chinese military police. Because the more\u00a0Hong Kong degenerates into a war zone, with battles in\u00a0the streets and buildings in flames, the harder it is for all those people to do their jobs and\u00a0the less likely the people who make the region's markets so valuable will want to stay.\nAnother reason markets make a difference to Hong Kong demonstrators is that sharply falling markets draw world attention. While the world may have grown used to months of demonstrations, falling markets act as an indicator that something new and more serious is happening.\nA third effect is the danger of serious market declines for\u00a0China. China's explosive growth means Hong Kong's share of the country's GDP has shrunk to about three per cent, but that is with only half a per cent of China's population. Recent calculations by Reuters show the region's markets continued to punch above its weight in importance to the Chinese economy, with Chinese assets in Hong Kong worth almost 10 per cent of the whole country's GDP.\n\"Losing such a massive financing channel risks destabilizing the already slowing Chinese economy, hurting confidence that the Communist Party can continue to deliver prosperity after a strong, decades-long track record,\" said the Reuters analysis.\nDe-escalating the current destructive violence with peaceful negotiations will likely be the best outcome for pro-democracy demonstrators. It would also help preserve Hong Kong's economy and its value to China.\nBut for the powerful government in Beijing, the danger of shattering\u00a0Hong Kong's\u00a0value as a vigorous financial market\u00a0due to an extended military crackdown, with the resulting\u00a0danger that it would weaken the Communist Party's grip on power, may be the strongest impetus for\u00a0Chinese government moderation.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Kelly Crowe", "title": "Prominent scientist dares to ask: Has the COVID-19 response gone too far?", "description": "Leading epidemiologists publish duelling commentaries, igniting debate on social media", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-response-scientists-1.5502423", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5502482.1584587184!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus-new-york.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 19, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-19T08:00:00.023Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It's a clash of titans \u2014 an epic battle between two famous scientists over the world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn one corner, influential Stanford University epidemiologist John Ioannidis, who wrote a commentary asking whether taking such drastic action to combat the pandemic without evidence it will work is a \"fiasco in the making.\"\nAcross the mat, prominent Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch punched back with a defiant response titled: \"We know enough now to act decisively against COVID-19.\"\nWatching from the sidelines? Everybody else. The people who worry the world has gone too far too fast.\nAnd those afraid the response hasn't come fast enough.\nThe debate comes down to questions about\u00a0data. What is the true fatality rate of COVID-19? How many people are already infected?\n\"Better information is needed to guide decisions and actions of monumental significance and to monitor their impact,\" Ioannidis wrote. \"In the absence of data, prepare-for-the-worst reasoning leads to extreme measures of social distancing and lockdowns. Unfortunately, we do not know if these measures work.\"\nIoannidis told CBC News he worries about the consequences of those measures.\n\"Put a stall to the entire economy. Tell people to stay at their homes, get depressed, commit\u00a0suicide, domestic violence. Who knows? Child abuse, children losing their education, companies crashing \u2026 unemployment, the stock market already dropping 20 per cent.\n\"Is that the solution?\"\nThe day after Ioannidis's bombshell commentary appeared on the medical news website STAT, the site published Marc Lipsitch's response.\nLipsitch\u00a0said he talked to Ioannidis beforehand and found that they had more in common than it seemed.\n\"I would say that his article did what contrarian writing should do: started a discussion.\"\nLipsitch insists drastic action is required.\n\"Waiting and hoping for a miracle as health systems are overrun by COVID-19 is not an option,\" he wrote. \"For the short term, there is no choice but to use the time we are buying with social distancing to mobilize a massive political, economic, and societal effort to find new ways to cope with this virus.\"\nSocial media lit up as other leading scientists joined the fray.\nDr. Gabriel Leung, dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, who has seen COVID-19 up close, challenged how Ioannidis compared the illness to the\u00a0seasonal flu.\nAbsolutely! Of every 1,000 infecteds who show symptoms, 14 will die. Highly age dependent where the risk of getting infected is 3x and then risk of dying is another 3x in 70+year-olds compared to those in their 30s. <br>This is NOT seasonal flu nor even 2009 pandemic flu! <a href=\"https://t.co/q6kWaPnPzE\">https://t.co/q6kWaPnPzE</a>\nSwiss epidemiologist Marcel Salath\u00e9 responded\u00a0with a satirical post using an image of the 1918 flu pandemic.\u00a0\n<a href=\"https://t.co/bGbbA9PCdn\">pic.twitter.com/bGbbA9PCdn</a>\nFor his part, Ioannidis is at home in Palo Alto, Calif., obeying an order by county officials in the San Francisco area to \"shelter in place.\" He's also weathering another storm \u2014 \"a pandemic of emails\" flooding his inbox as people respond to his commentary.\n\"The vast majority,\" he said, \"are congratulations and thinking along the same wavelength.\"\nHe said he doesn't know what response would be appropriate. And he acknowledges the situation in northern Italy is a disaster.\nBut he urges scientists and decision-makers to make it a priority to gather the data to find out if the response to the virus might end up being more damaging than the pandemic itself.\nProf. Ross Upshur of the University of Toronto is a public health expert, a physician and a scholar of the ethics and history of global health emergencies. He's also a veteran of the SARS\u00a0outbreak.\nHe has corresponded with Ioannidis over the years and respects the Stanford professor's expertise:\u00a0\"He is one of the most cited, most highly regarded researchers.\"\nBut in this particular case, Upshur said, Ioannidis is making an error in his analysis by failing to view the current response through the lens of public health instead of evidence-based medicine.\n\"Of course there's a lack of data,\" said Upshur. \"It's all nice to stand on the sidelines and say, 'Hey, you know we don't have very good data. These are not evidence-based decisions.' Well, of course they're not, because we don't have the evidence.\"\nIoannidis said it's time to make getting that data a top priority. The capacity to do the necessary research exists, even in the midst of the pandemic response, he said.\u00a0\n\"These data may show that lockdown is something that we need to do and then decide for how long,\" he said. \"They may show that it is a horrible idea. Because we don't know what harms these interventions will have.\"\nHe said the response so far has been based on modelling, which uses a series of assumptions about important factors including the rate of infection and the case fatality rate.\nSo far, COVID-19 has killed almost 9,000 people around the world. Doctors working in modern health-care systems in Italy, France and Spain report being on the verge of collapse.\nDr. Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization's emergencies program and a veteran of the Ebola epidemic, said \"speed trumps perfection.\"\n\"Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management,\" he said during the WHO's briefing last Friday. \"Everyone is afraid of making a mistake. Everyone is afraid of the consequence of error. But the greatest error is not to move. The greatest error is to be paralyzed by the fear of failure.\"\nStill, Ioannidis said\u00a0he worries about a domino effect with\u00a0the global response.\n\"I think there is \u2026 the feeling that other leaders have taken measures, and if we don't act, there is a sense of negligence. Doing that without a plan to realize where we are and where we're headed is extremely dangerous.\"\nThe roadmap for responding to public health emergencies was drawn centuries ago, according to Ross Upshur. There are massive volumes of research, philosophy, court decisions and public inquiries that have upheld the legal and ethical imperative to take dramatic action to protect against a dire threat to public health, he said.\nThe touchstone is the precautionary principle, clearly articulated in the 2006 investigation into Canada's response to the SARS epidemic, written by Justice Archie Campbell of the Ontario Superior Court.\n\"Where there is reasonable evidence of an impending threat to public health, it is inappropriate to require proof of causation beyond a reasonable doubt before taking steps to avert the threat,\" Campbell wrote in a chapter called \"Spring of Fear,\" citing Justice Horace Krever, who presided over Canada's tainted blood inquiry.\nAs Upshur put it:\u00a0\"We have put in place public health laws and public health powers for a reason.\"\n\"I know there is going to be a reckoning,\" he said.\u00a0\"I know people are going to ask whether this decision was disproportionate or not. But I don't think people in public health had any other option.\"\nIoannidis said that might be true. But there are some key questions that need to be answered in order to make sound decisions going forward, he said.\n\"We desperately need to know, No. 1, the prevalence of infection, and No. 2, the incidence of new infections,\" he said. \"If we make decisions with such tremendous uncertainty, we can get tremendous harms.\"\nThe lack of data is one point on which Lipsitch and Ioannidis agree.\n\"The U.S. has done fewer tests per capita so far than almost any rich country in the world,\" Lipsitch wrote. \"And many critical details of the epidemiology \u2014 including the absolute number of cases, the role of children in transmission, the role of presymptomatic transmission, and the risk of dying from infection with SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 remain uncertain.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "From shopping to walks: Your coronavirus questions answered", "description": "Staying protected is all about social distancing, cleanliness with 'attention to detail'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/covid-coronavirus-mark-joffe-alberta-health-edmonton-1.5506878", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5504482.1588339127!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cda-coronavirus-20200319.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 23, 2020 12:22 PM MT", "2020-03-25T20:00:07.055Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "From shuttered businesses and empty offices to silent streets and crashing stock markets, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered\u00a0every aspect of daily life in Alberta.\nAs the number of cases continues to grow and sanctions intended to curb social interactions escalate, many Albertans are\u00a0wondering how best to protect themselves, and which every-day activities are still considered safe.\nDr. Mark Joffe joined Edmonton AM on Monday to answer some of those questions.\u00a0\nJoffe is the vice-president and medical director for northern Alberta at Alberta Health Services.\nHe is also a professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Alberta, where he's also an adjunct professor in medical microbiology and immunology and the School of Public Health.\nHere is that conversation, edited for clarity and length.\nQ. Is it still OK to go to recreational areas like the river valley trails that could be crowded?\nA. I was out walking\u00a0in the river valley this weekend. I was actually quite impressed that most people, as they came toward me on the path, seemed to understand that they\u00a0needed to remain about six feet away from me and I was certainly doing the same with them.\nIt's great being out in the fresh air and especially if there's a little bit of wind blowing that would dilute any virus that might be in the air, that would be the safest you could possibly be.\nI am self-isolating and only going out to walk my dog. Will I be able to continue if a quarantine is called?\u00a0\nWe're going to\u00a0have to look after our animals. They're part of our families. We can't ignore them. And I can't really imagine that we'll reach a point of quarantine where we won't be able to take our animals out for a walk to do their business. I hope we don't reach that point.\nBeing out in the great outdoors is actually the safest place to be as long as you're six feet away from others walking outside. It couldn't be any safer than that.\u00a0\nNew testing protocols give priority to at-risk populations. Why was this change needed now?\nWe knew that, over time, we would have to look very carefully at our test strategies and that things would evolve. To date, the focus to date has been on returning travelers. We knew over time the number of travelers would gradually drop off as borders closed and as Canadians returned home. We also knew that as the number of individuals impacted by COVID-19 increased in our communities that we would have to refocus our attention.\nAgain the key thing is, individuals who get sick need to stay home. We don't need a test to tell people to stay home.\nWe will be focusing our testing more on vulnerable populations, particularly those in senior centres. We're going to be focusing the testing more on essential service workers, particularly health care workers. It will be really important for us to know whether a healthcare worker with a mild fever or a cough\u00a0has COVID-19 or not. And if they do not have it, we're going to want to get them back into the workforce as soon as their symptoms settle.\nMy 74-year-old husband has a severe lung disease. Is it safe for me to do our shopping or should I rely on the help of my neighbours?\u00a0\nI would say that an individual who has serious underlying lung disease and is in their 70s is exactly this sort of individual that we want to protect from COVID-19. \u00a0\nI understand that your caller prefers to do her own shopping and wants to be out in public. She can certainly do so safely, if she maintains social distancing, cleans her hands frequently and clean surfaces frequently. She can go out and can do some of her household chores safely if she's really attentive to detail.\nBut I think this is a time that it would be reasonable to accept some help from others as well.\nIf I go out shopping, is it safe to bring the items inside my home immediately?\nI think it's certainly safe to bring things immediately inside if you wanted to. But you can take some extra precautions with articles that may come in packaging.\u00a0\nFor example, if you buy 12 rolls of toilet paper in wrapping, you could take the wrapping off outside and bring the individual rolls inside. Any contamination would be on the outside surface. There may be surfaces that you could wipe down with a common household cleaner or disinfectant.\nWith cardboard boxes in general, it's a good idea to remove the items from the box and then bring any smaller items inside.\nWhat should people who are continuing to work in an office be doing to take extra precautions?\nIt's about the attention to detail and focusing on activities that we probably wouldn't have thought much of before. It's about social distancing, staying two meters away from others as much as possible. It's about frequent hand cleaning.\nAnd if one is working in a cubicle-type environment, use cleaners or disinfectants to clean the high-touch surfaces frequently. It's certainly possible to continue to go to work in that kind of an environment but it's really about the attention to detail.\nMany of the symptoms\u00a0are similar to a flu or the common cold. At what point should I be concerned?\u00a0\u00a0\nBy far the most common symptom with COVID-19 is fever and just about everyone that develops COVID-19 will have a fever. Sometimes it's not present right at the beginning but it will occur within the first day or two. That's the most common thing. Cough is the second most common. And so again it's that combination of a fever and a cough. That should make individuals most concerned.\u00a0\nThere definitely are some other things that can occasionally be seen. Muscle aches and pains and fatigue are fairly common as well. It's that combination of symptoms, the onset of a fever with a cough that would be the most concerning.\nHow airborne is the virus?\u00a0\nWhat we know about this virus is that it's spread in relatively large droplets that emerge from the mouth as people talk or particularly if they cough or sneeze those large droplets tend to settle out over about three feet possibly out to as much as six feet. That's why we talk about social distancing. The virus is not airborne. It does not spread long distances through the air.\nWhat about air temperature? How does that impact transmission?\nI don't think we fully understand this yet. We certainly know with some viruses\u00a0they actually tend to prefer cold weather and low humidity, and as the temperature rises or the humidity rises, they may not survive as long in the environment.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Why Hong Kong student protests matter to markets and vice versa: Don Pittis", "description": "Financial markets are engines of prosperity but they can be destroyed", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hong-kong-markets-violence-1.5357782", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5357991.1573665649!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hongkong-protests.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 14, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-11-14T10:08:12.050Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As Hong Kong's rule of law descends into something more like a police state, the Chinese region's financial markets may be more important than many demonstrators realize.\nBy Wednesday the Hang\u00a0Seng\u00a0Index, sort of a cross between Toronto's TSX Composite and New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average, was down about four\u00a0per cent amid a week of increasing violence.\u00a0\nA four per cent decline over three days is nothing to be sneezed at in a world where that amount represents a healthy percentage gain for an entire year for Canadians saving for retirement.

However, while\u00a0too complex to describe all their benefits\u00a0here, financial markets also allow us to build large, useful structures and evaluate their relative worth.\nThe best financial markets, like the best ports or highway systems, are not built overnight. The most reliable ones only occur in relatively healthy societies, ones that have a well-educated workforce, functioning transportation, good housing and laws\u00a0that try to discourage corruption and\u00a0fraud. As an example of such a society, Hong Kong \u2014\u00a0with median incomes at developed-country levels, reliable courts and good services \u2014\u00a0has been\u00a0ideal.\nWhile stock markets may be the visible portion, a successful financial centre like Hong Kong is an intricate network of highly skilled humans working together in banking, law, insurance, sales, communication and a variety of specialist jobs\u00a0it is hard for most of us to imagine. Large\u00a0financial\u00a0centres are enormously valuable\u00a0for the services they provide, the local wealth they generate in terms of employment and other spin-offs.\nAs a rule, successful financial markets and the complex system required to run them do not grow up\u00a0in unstable war zones. And when stable societies crumble, markets crumble with them.\nThis is one of the reasons the current chaos in the streets of Hong Kong matters to markets and why those markets may act as a deterrence to greater police violence or the kind of invasion threatened by Chinese military police. Because the more\u00a0Hong Kong degenerates into a war zone, with battles in\u00a0the streets and buildings in flames, the harder it is for all those people to do their jobs and\u00a0the less likely the people who make the region's markets so valuable will want to stay.\nAnother reason markets make a difference to Hong Kong demonstrators is that sharply falling markets draw world attention. While the world may have grown used to months of demonstrations, falling markets act as an indicator that something new and more serious is happening.\nA third effect is the danger of serious market declines for\u00a0China. China's explosive growth means Hong Kong's share of the country's GDP has shrunk to about three per cent, but that is with only half a per cent of China's population. Recent calculations by Reuters show the region's markets continued to punch above its weight in importance to the Chinese economy, with Chinese assets in Hong Kong worth almost 10 per cent of the whole country's GDP.\n\"Losing such a massive financing channel risks destabilizing the already slowing Chinese economy, hurting confidence that the Communist Party can continue to deliver prosperity after a strong, decades-long track record,\" said the Reuters analysis.\nDe-escalating the current destructive violence with peaceful negotiations will likely be the best outcome for pro-democracy demonstrators. It would also help preserve Hong Kong's economy and its value to China.\nBut for the powerful government in Beijing, the danger of shattering\u00a0Hong Kong's\u00a0value as a vigorous financial market\u00a0due to an extended military crackdown, with the resulting\u00a0danger that it would weaken the Communist Party's grip on power, may be the strongest impetus for\u00a0Chinese government moderation.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "From shopping to walks: Your coronavirus questions answered", "description": "Staying protected is all about social distancing, cleanliness with 'attention to detail'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/covid-coronavirus-mark-joffe-alberta-health-edmonton-1.5506878", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5504482.1588339127!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cda-coronavirus-20200319.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 23, 2020 12:22 PM MT", "2020-03-25T20:00:07.055Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "From shuttered businesses and empty offices to silent streets and crashing stock markets, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered\u00a0every aspect of daily life in Alberta.\nAs the number of cases continues to grow and sanctions intended to curb social interactions escalate, many Albertans are\u00a0wondering how best to protect themselves, and which every-day activities are still considered safe.\nDr. Mark Joffe joined Edmonton AM on Monday to answer some of those questions.\u00a0\nJoffe is the vice-president and medical director for northern Alberta at Alberta Health Services.\nHe is also a professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Alberta, where he's also an adjunct professor in medical microbiology and immunology and the School of Public Health.\nHere is that conversation, edited for clarity and length.\nQ. Is it still OK to go to recreational areas like the river valley trails that could be crowded?\nA. I was out walking\u00a0in the river valley this weekend. I was actually quite impressed that most people, as they came toward me on the path, seemed to understand that they\u00a0needed to remain about six feet away from me and I was certainly doing the same with them.\nIt's great being out in the fresh air and especially if there's a little bit of wind blowing that would dilute any virus that might be in the air, that would be the safest you could possibly be.\nI am self-isolating and only going out to walk my dog. Will I be able to continue if a quarantine is called?\u00a0\nWe're going to\u00a0have to look after our animals. They're part of our families. We can't ignore them. And I can't really imagine that we'll reach a point of quarantine where we won't be able to take our animals out for a walk to do their business. I hope we don't reach that point.\nBeing out in the great outdoors is actually the safest place to be as long as you're six feet away from others walking outside. It couldn't be any safer than that.\u00a0\nNew testing protocols give priority to at-risk populations. Why was this change needed now?\nWe knew that, over time, we would have to look very carefully at our test strategies and that things would evolve. To date, the focus to date has been on returning travelers. We knew over time the number of travelers would gradually drop off as borders closed and as Canadians returned home. We also knew that as the number of individuals impacted by COVID-19 increased in our communities that we would have to refocus our attention.\nAgain the key thing is, individuals who get sick need to stay home. We don't need a test to tell people to stay home.\nWe will be focusing our testing more on vulnerable populations, particularly those in senior centres. We're going to be focusing the testing more on essential service workers, particularly health care workers. It will be really important for us to know whether a healthcare worker with a mild fever or a cough\u00a0has COVID-19 or not. And if they do not have it, we're going to want to get them back into the workforce as soon as their symptoms settle.\nMy 74-year-old husband has a severe lung disease. Is it safe for me to do our shopping or should I rely on the help of my neighbours?\u00a0\nI would say that an individual who has serious underlying lung disease and is in their 70s is exactly this sort of individual that we want to protect from COVID-19. \u00a0\nI understand that your caller prefers to do her own shopping and wants to be out in public. She can certainly do so safely, if she maintains social distancing, cleans her hands frequently and clean surfaces frequently. She can go out and can do some of her household chores safely if she's really attentive to detail.\nBut I think this is a time that it would be reasonable to accept some help from others as well.\nIf I go out shopping, is it safe to bring the items inside my home immediately?\nI think it's certainly safe to bring things immediately inside if you wanted to. But you can take some extra precautions with articles that may come in packaging.\u00a0\nFor example, if you buy 12 rolls of toilet paper in wrapping, you could take the wrapping off outside and bring the individual rolls inside. Any contamination would be on the outside surface. There may be surfaces that you could wipe down with a common household cleaner or disinfectant.\nWith cardboard boxes in general, it's a good idea to remove the items from the box and then bring any smaller items inside.\nWhat should people who are continuing to work in an office be doing to take extra precautions?\nIt's about the attention to detail and focusing on activities that we probably wouldn't have thought much of before. It's about social distancing, staying two meters away from others as much as possible. It's about frequent hand cleaning.\nAnd if one is working in a cubicle-type environment, use cleaners or disinfectants to clean the high-touch surfaces frequently. It's certainly possible to continue to go to work in that kind of an environment but it's really about the attention to detail.\nMany of the symptoms\u00a0are similar to a flu or the common cold. At what point should I be concerned?\u00a0\u00a0\nBy far the most common symptom with COVID-19 is fever and just about everyone that develops COVID-19 will have a fever. Sometimes it's not present right at the beginning but it will occur within the first day or two. That's the most common thing. Cough is the second most common. And so again it's that combination of a fever and a cough. That should make individuals most concerned.\u00a0\nThere definitely are some other things that can occasionally be seen. Muscle aches and pains and fatigue are fairly common as well. It's that combination of symptoms, the onset of a fever with a cough that would be the most concerning.\nHow airborne is the virus?\u00a0\nWhat we know about this virus is that it's spread in relatively large droplets that emerge from the mouth as people talk or particularly if they cough or sneeze those large droplets tend to settle out over about three feet possibly out to as much as six feet. That's why we talk about social distancing. The virus is not airborne. It does not spread long distances through the air.\nWhat about air temperature? How does that impact transmission?\nI don't think we fully understand this yet. We certainly know with some viruses\u00a0they actually tend to prefer cold weather and low humidity, and as the temperature rises or the humidity rises, they may not survive as long in the environment.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Kelly Crowe", "title": "Prominent scientist dares to ask: Has the COVID-19 response gone too far?", "description": "Leading epidemiologists publish duelling commentaries, igniting debate on social media", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-covid-pandemic-response-scientists-1.5502423", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5502482.1584587184!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus-new-york.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 19, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-19T08:00:00.023Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It's a clash of titans \u2014 an epic battle between two famous scientists over the world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn one corner, influential Stanford University epidemiologist John Ioannidis, who wrote a commentary asking whether taking such drastic action to combat the pandemic without evidence it will work is a \"fiasco in the making.\"\nAcross the mat, prominent Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch punched back with a defiant response titled: \"We know enough now to act decisively against COVID-19.\"\nWatching from the sidelines? Everybody else. The people who worry the world has gone too far too fast.\nAnd those afraid the response hasn't come fast enough.\nThe debate comes down to questions about\u00a0data. What is the true fatality rate of COVID-19? How many people are already infected?\n\"Better information is needed to guide decisions and actions of monumental significance and to monitor their impact,\" Ioannidis wrote. \"In the absence of data, prepare-for-the-worst reasoning leads to extreme measures of social distancing and lockdowns. Unfortunately, we do not know if these measures work.\"\nIoannidis told CBC News he worries about the consequences of those measures.\n\"Put a stall to the entire economy. Tell people to stay at their homes, get depressed, commit\u00a0suicide, domestic violence. Who knows? Child abuse, children losing their education, companies crashing \u2026 unemployment, the stock market already dropping 20 per cent.\n\"Is that the solution?\"\nThe day after Ioannidis's bombshell commentary appeared on the medical news website STAT, the site published Marc Lipsitch's response.\nLipsitch\u00a0said he talked to Ioannidis beforehand and found that they had more in common than it seemed.\n\"I would say that his article did what contrarian writing should do: started a discussion.\"\nLipsitch insists drastic action is required.\n\"Waiting and hoping for a miracle as health systems are overrun by COVID-19 is not an option,\" he wrote. \"For the short term, there is no choice but to use the time we are buying with social distancing to mobilize a massive political, economic, and societal effort to find new ways to cope with this virus.\"\nSocial media lit up as other leading scientists joined the fray.\nDr. Gabriel Leung, dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, who has seen COVID-19 up close, challenged how Ioannidis compared the illness to the\u00a0seasonal flu.\nAbsolutely! Of every 1,000 infecteds who show symptoms, 14 will die. Highly age dependent where the risk of getting infected is 3x and then risk of dying is another 3x in 70+year-olds compared to those in their 30s. <br>This is NOT seasonal flu nor even 2009 pandemic flu! <a href=\"https://t.co/q6kWaPnPzE\">https://t.co/q6kWaPnPzE</a>\nSwiss epidemiologist Marcel Salath\u00e9 responded\u00a0with a satirical post using an image of the 1918 flu pandemic.\u00a0\n<a href=\"https://t.co/bGbbA9PCdn\">pic.twitter.com/bGbbA9PCdn</a>\nFor his part, Ioannidis is at home in Palo Alto, Calif., obeying an order by county officials in the San Francisco area to \"shelter in place.\" He's also weathering another storm \u2014 \"a pandemic of emails\" flooding his inbox as people respond to his commentary.\n\"The vast majority,\" he said, \"are congratulations and thinking along the same wavelength.\"\nHe said he doesn't know what response would be appropriate. And he acknowledges the situation in northern Italy is a disaster.\nBut he urges scientists and decision-makers to make it a priority to gather the data to find out if the response to the virus might end up being more damaging than the pandemic itself.\nProf. Ross Upshur of the University of Toronto is a public health expert, a physician and a scholar of the ethics and history of global health emergencies. He's also a veteran of the SARS\u00a0outbreak.\nHe has corresponded with Ioannidis over the years and respects the Stanford professor's expertise:\u00a0\"He is one of the most cited, most highly regarded researchers.\"\nBut in this particular case, Upshur said, Ioannidis is making an error in his analysis by failing to view the current response through the lens of public health instead of evidence-based medicine.\n\"Of course there's a lack of data,\" said Upshur. \"It's all nice to stand on the sidelines and say, 'Hey, you know we don't have very good data. These are not evidence-based decisions.' Well, of course they're not, because we don't have the evidence.\"\nIoannidis said it's time to make getting that data a top priority. The capacity to do the necessary research exists, even in the midst of the pandemic response, he said.\u00a0\n\"These data may show that lockdown is something that we need to do and then decide for how long,\" he said. \"They may show that it is a horrible idea. Because we don't know what harms these interventions will have.\"\nHe said the response so far has been based on modelling, which uses a series of assumptions about important factors including the rate of infection and the case fatality rate.\nSo far, COVID-19 has killed almost 9,000 people around the world. Doctors working in modern health-care systems in Italy, France and Spain report being on the verge of collapse.\nDr. Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization's emergencies program and a veteran of the Ebola epidemic, said \"speed trumps perfection.\"\n\"Perfection is the enemy of the good when it comes to emergency management,\" he said during the WHO's briefing last Friday. \"Everyone is afraid of making a mistake. Everyone is afraid of the consequence of error. But the greatest error is not to move. The greatest error is to be paralyzed by the fear of failure.\"\nStill, Ioannidis said\u00a0he worries about a domino effect with\u00a0the global response.\n\"I think there is \u2026 the feeling that other leaders have taken measures, and if we don't act, there is a sense of negligence. Doing that without a plan to realize where we are and where we're headed is extremely dangerous.\"\nThe roadmap for responding to public health emergencies was drawn centuries ago, according to Ross Upshur. There are massive volumes of research, philosophy, court decisions and public inquiries that have upheld the legal and ethical imperative to take dramatic action to protect against a dire threat to public health, he said.\nThe touchstone is the precautionary principle, clearly articulated in the 2006 investigation into Canada's response to the SARS epidemic, written by Justice Archie Campbell of the Ontario Superior Court.\n\"Where there is reasonable evidence of an impending threat to public health, it is inappropriate to require proof of causation beyond a reasonable doubt before taking steps to avert the threat,\" Campbell wrote in a chapter called \"Spring of Fear,\" citing Justice Horace Krever, who presided over Canada's tainted blood inquiry.\nAs Upshur put it:\u00a0\"We have put in place public health laws and public health powers for a reason.\"\n\"I know there is going to be a reckoning,\" he said.\u00a0\"I know people are going to ask whether this decision was disproportionate or not. But I don't think people in public health had any other option.\"\nIoannidis said that might be true. But there are some key questions that need to be answered in order to make sound decisions going forward, he said.\n\"We desperately need to know, No. 1, the prevalence of infection, and No. 2, the incidence of new infections,\" he said. \"If we make decisions with such tremendous uncertainty, we can get tremendous harms.\"\nThe lack of data is one point on which Lipsitch and Ioannidis agree.\n\"The U.S. has done fewer tests per capita so far than almost any rich country in the world,\" Lipsitch wrote. \"And many critical details of the epidemiology \u2014 including the absolute number of cases, the role of children in transmission, the role of presymptomatic transmission, and the risk of dying from infection with SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 remain uncertain.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "What profits at Canada's big banks are saying about the odds of a recession", "description": "Royal and CIBC revealed numbers last week.

That's because Canada's five biggest lenders \u2014 Royal Bank, TD, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank and CIBC \u2014 have a hand in nearly every aspect of Canada's economy, from loaning businesses money for expansion to funding the mortgages that finance much of the housing market.\nThose same banks are in the midst of revealing their quarterly earnings this week, and the numbers should offer a good glimpse of where the economy is headed.\nThe Royal Bank of Canada was first to report last week, showing profits rising to a record $3.3 billion\u00a0in the third quarter. CIBC was next, with a quarterly profit of $1.4 billion\u00a0in the three months up to the end of July.\nBoth figures are up only slightly from last year's level, but in a world in which the financial media is warning of negative rates, inverted yields and huge stock market swings on a seemingly daily basis, rising profits are good to see at the banks. Because if the banks are making money, there's a good chance many of their customers are doing well, too.\nThe Bank of Montreal and Scotiabank\u00a0will\u00a0report their earnings\u00a0Tuesday morning. TD's expected to show its hand on Thursday.\u00a0\nWhile the forecast for the two banks we've already heard from was generally sunny, that's not to say there weren't a few clouds on the horizon \u2014 potential storms that investors will be on the lookout for in the other banks' outlooks.\nRoyal managed to grow their residential mortgage business by almost 6 per cent in the past year to $298 billion, an impressive feat considering how big a player they were in the market to begin with. As CBC News has reported, mortgage rates have been headed lower in recent months, a development that's a double-edged sword for banks \u2014 because each mortgage individually is less profitable for them, but they are also able to sell more of them because they appear to be cheaper.\nPolicymakers have spent years worrying about Canadians' debt loads, but Royal Bank's performance suggests there's room for more. Borrowers wouldn't be taking on all that new debt if they weren't feeling confident about their prospects, either. As TD Bank analyst Mario Mendonca put it, \"We expect mortgage growth to make a healthy recovery this quarter, reflecting a reasonably strong spring selling season, particularly in Ontario.\"\nThe mortgage picture\u00a0at CIBC, meanwhile, wasn't quite as rosy. Despite handing out $9 billion in new mortgages during the quarter, the total value of CIBC's mortgages actually shrank by a little more than one per cent\u00a0to $222 billion.\nWorse still for the bank is where many of them are.\u00a0\"CIBC is the most-exposed to mortgage loans in Ontario and British Columbia,\" Bloomberg analyst Paul Gulberg said.\u00a0\nWhile Canada's housing market overall has shown signs of stabilizing, activity in Toronto and Vancouver is still causing worry, so it should be interesting to see what the other banks have to say about their mortgage businesses.\nAnother possible dark cloud on an otherwise blue sky could\u00a0be what the banks are saying about their loans to businesses. That's because both\u00a0banks reported higher credit loss provisions \u2014 money that banks set aside to write off bad loans. While it's still a tiny slice of their overall business, if more businesses are having trouble paying back their bank loans, that's a bad sign for the economy.\u00a0\nAt Royal, credit losses came in at $425 million, a 27 per cent increase year over year. At CIBC, the figure stood at $291 million for the quarter, a 21 per cent increase year over year.\nThe worst part is those credit losses seem to be spreading beyond certain problematic parts of the economy.\n\"It used to be oil and gas but it looks like it has spread ... to some other areas,\" said James Shanahan, a senior equity research analyst\u00a0with Edward Jones.\nThe\u00a0oil and gas sector has been hit hard and has been a black mark on Canada's economy for a while, but there's some evidence that weakness is spreading to businesses in forestry, agriculture, and other industries, he said.\n\"It's not too surprising given the tremendous growth, but this could be a problem for the banks,\" Shanahan said.\nLoans going bad are a bad sign for any business \u2014 never mind the broader economy \u2014 but the two banks did give a surefire indication that they are feeling confident about their prospects: they raised their dividend.\nNo major Canadian bank has missed a dividend payment in more than a century, but with a track record like that, banks are incredibly careful not to promise any more cash than they are confident they'll be able to come up with.\nCompanies that have to snatch back a dividend payment tend to be punished heavily on the stock market, so the banks have been raising their payouts steadily, but cautiously, for decades.\u00a0\nBased on Royal and CIBC\u00a0not increasing\u00a0their dividends during the previous quarter, Mendonca\u00a0was expecting both banks\u00a0to hike this time around. And that's exactly what they did \u2014 another three cents for Royal and four for CIBC.\u00a0\nHe's expecting a bump up at Scotiabank, too, but not for BMO since\u00a0that bank already hiked last quarter.\nBased on how much they are paying out, Shanahan\u00a0says the banks have some capacity to keep the dividend hikes coming, but on the whole he thought the\u00a0numbers at Royal and CIBC showed they are \"in pretty good shape.\"\nAnd as for the rest, \"I think results will continue to come in similarly,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Fitbit bought by Google for $2.1B", "description": "Deal is pending regulatory approval, Google says Fitbit could move or delete their data", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/alphabet-google-fitbit-deal-1.5344159", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5344171.1572618294!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/financial-markets-wall-street-fitbit.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 01, 2019 10:26 AM ET", "2019-11-01T14:44:23.245Z"], "source": null, "content": "Fitbit is being acquired by Google's parent company for about $2.1 billion US, a deal that enables the internet company to step back into the hotly contested market for smartwatches and health and fitness trackers.\nFitbit is a pioneer in wearable technology, but it's been shredded by that competition.

The combined company is expected to control 24 million client accounts.\nBy itself, Schwab may control close to half the market for acting as a custodian for money managed by registered investment advisers, for example, while TD Ameritrade may control about 15 to 20 per cent, according to Kyle Voigt, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\nThe rewards for passing regulatory muster would be lucrative: A combined company \"makes strong strategic sense,\" would be able to cut costs and could bump up Schwab's earnings per share by more than 25 per cent over the long term, Voigt said.\nThe deal could also herald more mergers across the industry.\nSchwab sent shockwaves through the industry less than two months ago when it said it would do away with commissions for online trading of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds, fees that have long fuelled the industry.\nAll major brokerages have followed suit, but fees had been falling for years.\nBeyond players like Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity and E-Trade Financial, apps like robinhood.com out of Palo Alto, Calif., have also entered the fray to help customers get invested in the market.\nThat has increased the pressure on San Francisco's Schwab Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., of Omaha, Neb., the biggest publicly traded brokerages. Schwab had $3.85 trillion in total client assets at the start of the month, while TD Ameritrade had $1.3 trillion at the end of September.\nThe deal is expected to close in the second half of next year. It's anticipated to take 18 to 36 months to integrate the two businesses once the transaction is complete. The corporate headquarters of the combined company will eventually relocate to Schwab's new campus in Westlake, Texas.\nThe Toronto-Dominion Bank, which currently holds approximately 43 per cent of TD Ameritrade's stock, will have an ownership position of approximately 13 per cent in the combined company, with other TD Ameritrade stockholders and existing Schwab stockholders holding approximately 18% and 69%, respectively.\nTD Ameritrade suspended its search for a CEO, naming chief financial officer Stephen Boyle as interim president and CEO.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Aurora Cannabis cuts 500 jobs across company, CEO steps down", "description": "Company halted construction on 2 facilities in November", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/aurora-cannabis-layoffs-1.5455005", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5455800.1581091223!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/terry-booth-aurora-cannabis-ceo.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 06, 2020 3:19 PM MT", "2020-02-06T23:12:53.917Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Aurora Cannabis is laying off some 500 workers and replacing CEO Terry Booth, who has stepped down, the company said Thursday.\u00a0\nThe Edmonton-based cannabis giant said in a statement it has eliminated close to 500 full-time equivalent staff across its operations.

Some analysts, like Chris Damas,\u00a0are concerned Hexo's actions may have\u00a0helped create a tipping point.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The last week of stock trading in cannabis has been typical of rapid panic,\" said Damas, an independent cannabis analyst\u00a0and an author of the BCMI Cannabis Report.\u00a0\nDamas said Hexo's revenue problems are emblematic of an industry going through a major shakeup as overall cannabis sales in Canada have not lived up to forecasts.\u00a0\nHexo's stock slipped nearly 25 per cent Thursday to close at $3.76 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\u00a0By Friday's close, it was down to\u00a0$3.35.\nHexo's revised fourth-quarter outlook was also announced at between\u00a0$14.5 and $16.5 million, significantly less than the\u00a0$26 million in its previous outlook.\u00a0\n\"While we are disappointed with these results, we are making significant changes to our sales and operations strategy to drive future results,\" said St-Louis in his statement.\nHowever the problem of lower than expected cannabis sales is industry-wide, and as legal pot nears its first year anniversary, the reasons are becoming clearer.\u00a0\nStatistics Canada has put the value of the cannabis market at $5.7 billion, and yet Damas said that by the end of 2019, it will have only produced a little over $1 billion in first-year sales.\nThat suggests that in the new era of legal pot, the black market's presence is still keenly felt.\nWhat's more, a federal government report suggested that the total amount of dried cannabis held by cultivators, distributors and retailers stood at 347,171 kilograms at the end of July \u2014 more than 30 times the amount of total sales that month.\n\"We have an inventory glut, and we're adding to it at a rapid pace,\" explained cannabis analyst Craig\u00a0Wiggins.\nA Health Canada report released last October suggested\u00a0Canadians could consume 920,000 kilograms of\u00a0recreational and medical marijuana in the first year of legalization.\u00a0\u00a0However,\u00a0Wiggins said the legal industry has sold just 14 per cent of that projected supply to date \u2014 while producing four-fifths\u00a0of that 920,000 kilograms.\n\"Think of the market as a glass of water, and it's full. And we're pouring more water into it. That's our harvest,\" he said.\nThe statement from St-Louis also pointed\u00a0to the difficulty of getting the product to market, something other licensed producers have complained about \u2014 particularly when it comes to opening stores in Ontario and Quebec.\nPer-capita sales are higher in provinces like Alberta where there's a large network of stores, said Keith Merker, CEO of WeedMD.\n\"Every challenge as this industry grows up has an impact,\" Merker said.\nDamas said Ontario\u00a0should have roughly 1,000 stores to serve its\u00a0population, noting Alberta has approved 284 store licences\u00a0as of September while also having roughly 10 million fewer people.\n\"It's been a catastrophe,\" said Damas.\nHexo still has a contract to provide cannabis to stores operated by the\u00a0Quebec government, as well as a deal to produce a cannabis-infused drink with Molson Coors when edibles become legal later this year.\u00a0\nHowever, when the company says in its statement it will focus on \"profitability,\" they could be eyeing cuts to\u00a0their roughly 800-person workforce,\u00a0said\u00a0Gilles Levasseur with the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management.\n\"The first thing you got to do,\" said Levasseur, \"is cut the costs. And cutting costs usually means cutting salaries.\"\nHexo did not respond to CBC's request for more details about their statement.\nWiggins\u00a0also said the downturn in stocks across the industry will likely mean a shakeup, and he wonders\u00a0whether there are now too many players making too much pot that no one wants to buy.\n\"The tide has rolled out,\" Wiggins said. \"And now we're seeing who's swimming with no clothes on.\"\n"}, {"author": "Paul Palmeter", "title": "N.S. farmer says producers have obligation to provide food amid COVID-19", "description": "'We have a duty to our fellow citizens and to our province to provide them with food at this time'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/farmer-says-producers-have-obligation-to-provide-food-for-nova-scotians-1.5530848", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Apr 13, 2020 2:10 PM AT", "2020-04-13T17:10:23.142Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Getaway Farm in West Glenmont, N.S., has had to change the way it does business due to COVID-19.\nAlong with the everyday duties on the Kings County farm, which overlooks the Bay of Fundy, the business manages a processing facility in Bedford and a retail shop in Halifax.\n\"We have to take the extra precautions to make sure our farming family is pretty much quarantined so we don't become compromised, because then it compromises the animals and how we give them care,\" said Chris de Waal, one of the owners of Getaway Farm.\nDe Waal has two dozen employees.\nAs is the case with many businesses, the virus is making an impact on his profit margins.

Established players seek new sources of cash as share prices fall.\u00a0Experts predict a shakeout in the industry as smaller players, unable to find buyers, begin to fail.\nThe numbers vary across Canada according to how each province has managed their own legalization rollout, but statistics show the vast majority of cannabis users still get their pot from what police sources recently\u00a0called \"a strong, vibrant dark market out there selling illegal drugs.\"\nWhile the legal industry battles to grab market share from their illicit competitors, economists could have told them this would happen.\nAnd not just \"could have.\" Economists did tell them.\u00a0In April 2017, long before cannabis became legal on Oct. 17, 2018, economist Rosalie Wyonch, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute, was one of those who had a warning for governments expecting to get rich from legalized pot.\n\"If the government taxes marijuana heavily,\" she wrote in an open letter to Bill Blair, the federal cabinet minister who led the way on Canada's pot policy, \"it will ensure the continuation of the black market and will be undermining its efforts to control the substance.\"\nOf course, revenue wasn't the only thing motivating government policy that helped keep pot prices high. Before legalization, health experts worried that legal\u00a0availability and low prices would lead to a flood of new cannabis users.\nThat pessimism from the health lobby was the mirror image of\u00a0optimism from the cannabis industry and its investors, who foresaw Canadians smoking up a storm.\nBut as it turned out, both sides were wrong. While there was a small uptick in purchases immediately following legalization attributed to law-abiding Canadian trying the drug for the first time or for the first time in a long time, the feared (and hoped for) deluge of new users never came.\nThe latest figures from Statistics Canada show that\u00a0cannabis use has been relatively static, with a few heavy users responsible for most of the consumption.\u00a0\nAnd while legal pot shop assiduously check IDs to make sure patrons are of legal age, the continued existence of a huge and thriving black market means younger buyers can get all they want from illegal dealers who, in Ontario for example, still control something like 80 per cent of the market.\nIn that province, if the government had actually been\u00a0trying to help the illicit market flourish, it would have been hard to do a better job.\n\"If we had one store for every 10,000 people, which is the rule of thumb, in Ontario we would have something like 1,500 stores and we only have 24,\" said cannabis business analyst Chris Damas, on the phone from his home in Barrie, Ont., about 100 kilometres\u00a0north of Toronto. He says there is no shortage of illegal suppliers to fill that gap.\n\"Here in Barrie, which has a lively drug culture, [with a population of] 150,000 people, there's no store,\" said\u00a0Damas, who writes the BCMI Cannabis Report. \"So why would they want to drive to downtown Toronto to get some marijuana that was legal?\"\nDamas\u00a0says a high government excise tax and other expenses\u00a0means prices are about double what people can get from their local dealers, including home delivery.\u00a0\nA potential solution to smash the illegal market proposed years ago\u00a0was to use the power of a monopoly seller in a way that would be illegal if it were done in private business. Governments would have to step in, cut their own take to zero and promise not to raise taxes for say, two years, while letting the most efficient producers compete on price, all the while increasing the number of stores to make legal purchases easy.\nIt might have worked better if that had been the plan from the beginning, back when cannabis producers were flush with cash.\nBut after what he sees as years creating overcapacity, now Damas fears that despite Cannabis 2.0, economic activity in the sector could fall by half, which he calls \"the Great Depression in cannabis\" as the pot boom goes into reverse.\n\"The repercussions are pretty too-horrible to contemplate.\"\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Yes, computers really are taking jobs from humans \u2014 especially in banking: Don Pittis", "description": "Study shows automation and artificial intelligence will cut 10% of banking jobs alone", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ai-compuers-jobs-banking-1.5305680", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4005101.1570034164!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/royal-bank-soctiabank-with-td-s-black-tower-in-background-at-king-and-bay-toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 03, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-10-03T17:43:38.267Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A worrying new report has just added a credible voice to the idea that computers are coming for our jobs.\nAs I write, the clients-only Wells Fargo report has not been made public, but those who have seen it quote the 225-page document\u00a0as saying technology\u00a0will slash 10 per cent of banking jobs over the next decade.\nWhile the number of North American manufacturing jobs shrinks, service sector jobs, including in banking, have been a mainstay of job creation. That may be\u00a0about to change.\n\"Technological efficiencies will result in the biggest reduction in head count across the U.S. banking industry in its history,\" said an article released by the global business news service\u00a0Bloomberg.\nIn a story titled\u00a0Tech forecast to destroy more than 200,000 US bank jobs\u00a0the Financial Times quotes the report's author as saying the job cuts will be the \"greatest transfer from labour to capital\" of all time, and will represent a \"golden age of banking efficiency.\"\nWith such remarks, the report by\u00a0well-known banking analyst Mike Mayo seems aimed at people like\u00a0bank shareholders who yesterday lost money in the markets.\nBut for\u00a0bank employees and those worried about where jobs will come from, the report from\u00a0Wells Fargo, the U.S. banking giant famous for its stagecoach origins and for its 2016\u00a0account fraud scandal,\u00a0the news may not be so good.\nThe essence of the report is that a huge investment in technology by the financial industry, estimated at $150 billion US\u00a0annually\u00a0including in artificial intelligence, is paying off. It means new job cuts would allow the banks to continue to find efficiencies\u00a0well beyond the ATM banking and branch closures familiar to Canadians that have helped banks repeatedly increase profits.\nWhile the report focuses on the U.S. industry, Canadian banks are known as leaders in many areas of banking automation, including debit cards and remote banking.\nAs the\u00a0Wells Fargo report says, large banks able to take advantage of the new\u00a0technology will be among the greatest beneficiaries. The biggest Canadian banks with operations in the U.S. and around the globe usually\u00a0rank in the top 10 North American banks by capitalization.\nFront-line branch employees have already been thinned out, but\u00a0the new cuts are expected to be spread across branches and head offices. Call centres will also lose jobs, the report says.\nThe loss of relatively low-paying jobs in customer service\u00a0is a reminder that low wages don't prevent businesses from cutting staff, something\u00a0opponents of minimum wage increases sometime\u00a0suggest. With half of a business's outlays going to employment costs, reducing workers\u00a0whatever their wage level\u00a0remains one of the only practical ways of increasing profits.\nThe trend also confirms concerns over the growing income divide between jobs that can be replaced by computers and those that, so far, cannot. Among the jobs that the report says will remain relatively safe include the tech workers needed to keep the banking software running and secure.\nOther jobs less likely to be cut will be in sales, consulting and advising, the report says.\nEarlier fears for job losses were due to automation where robots could do the physical work that formerly required human labour\u00a0or machine operators. As many reports told us as early as 2013, robots were replacing\u00a0warehouse workers and assembly line employees.\nAt the time service jobs were seen as an alternative, requiring young people to learn to use their brains rather than their brawn. This latest report is a reminder that as software becomes more sophisticated, higher-level jobs will also disappear, and not just in banking.\nPredictions a decade into the future,\u00a0whether in banking or any other industry, are\u00a0inevitably uncertain.\nMany economists have insisted that job losses\u00a0in one sector do not mean there will be fewer jobs overall. So far that has proven true.\nBut a recession caused by the simmering global trade war may mean it will take time for society to create new jobs lost to technology in administrative jobs like banking.\nThis week new figures from the U.S. show manufacturing\u00a0slumped sharply for the second month in a row as the U.S.-China trade war begins to bite. That decline in factory activity has been described as one of the triggers for the latest\u00a0stock market tumble\u00a0in the U.S. and Canada.\n\"The disappointing data is only fanning long-standing fears of slowing global growth,\" said Alec Young, managing director of Global Markets Research at FTSE Russell, this week.\nA slowing economy is not good for banks. As Canadians look for ways to cut back they will be less likely to pile on debt, expanding the loan book of banks, their life blood.\u00a0\nWhen it was expected interest rates were on the way up banks would at least\u00a0have benefited as borrowers were forced to pay a little more to extend their loans. But now rates seem to be on the way back down.\nIf a recession comes, banks will be competing\u00a0to get their costs down too, making the replacement of human workers with much cheaper technology an alluring prospect.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Mimi Sheriff", "title": "They took me into their homes, cabins and sheds: Growth and gratitude in an N.L. decade", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/pov-mimi-sheriff-grateful-after-a-decade-in-newfoundland-1.5299172", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 6:00 PM NT", "2019-10-13T22:33:19.370Z"], "source": null, "content": "Labour Day, September 2009.\nI arrived in St. John's at 2 a.m. Filled with the excitement and apprehension of moving to a new place, I waited for daylight and then rushed outside to explore the city which would be home\u00a0for the next two years.\nThe streets were eerily quiet.

There is no shortage of challenges that could be discussed and need to be addressed but, I'm choosing not to do that today.\nNot because they are not important \u2014 they are \u2014 but because sometimes we need to take stock of the positives and I already mentioned I was sentimental.\nDespite the skepticism and confusion of friends and family, I have stayed, like many others\u00a0and I've loved my time here.

I'm\u00a0treated like a member of their family.\nWhen I was\u00a0looking unsuccessfully for a soccer team to join, my friend Aaron Goulding\u00a0instead invited me to join his ultimate Frisbee team.

I have his business card for you and he's expecting you to send him your resum\u00e9.\"\nMy kind friend Melissa Royle shared that information, and\u00a0I've been working at Bluedrop for the past seven years and am grateful for my diverse, funny and smart work family. Without a meaningful job I wouldn't have stayed. If you believe someone is a good fit for a job, connect and vouch for them. I hear immigrants are good workers.\nI refer to myself as \"spot the dot\" here, because\u00a0I am often the only person of colour in any given situation and I stand out.\nDuring\u00a0my first year in Newfoundland, I was asked to take pictures with various members of a family as they had never met a person of colour. I agreed, but\u00a0was shocked and I awkwardly laughed, leaving that experience with the realization that here, I wasn't just Mimi.\nI felt the burden of being an ambassador for all 54 countries in Africa.\nOver time, similar experiences and conversations would happen and I learned\u00a0to become comfortable and use them as education opportunities. The same way that I've\u00a0watched children in Ethiopia who have never seen a white person. They pointed at, giggled and innocently followed tourists because they're\u00a0different \u2014 and that's how I've drawn parallels.\nIt's a small world and curiosity is universal.\nBigger cities have diversity as the status quo, and it's taken for granted. One of my favourite aspects about my time in Newfoundland has been having a front row seat to experiencing the province slowly becoming\u00a0more diverse.\nWhat a unique and meaningful opportunity it has been to attend different immigration conferences and events to brainstorm ideas for the future and directly share my thoughts with Minister Ahmed\u00a0Hussen, and then to organize my own event with Oxfam called Re-Imagining Africa \u2014\u00a0Two Sides to Every Story.\nI now understand the growing pains of multiculturalism from a homogenous society and can empathize with those that don't yet understand the benefits.\nAt the same time, I am also the same person who recently felt the most irrational sense of joy watching a group of about 10 children from multiple races and cultures chatting and playing at the bus stop on LeMarchant Road in St. John's.\nThey looked like one of the diverse advertisements for the United Colors of Benetton clothing and I wanted to take a picture of them, but\u00a0that seemed creepy. I hope they all stay when they're\u00a0older.\nAs a vendor at the St. John's Farmers' Market selling Ethiopian food, I happily spend my Saturday with the best clients and some like-minded individuals who see the endless amount of business opportunity in this province. Whether it's Orathai from delicious Yes Thai\u00a0catering, Mark from Ontario who owns NL Organics, Kevin from Ireland of the famous Old Dublin Bakery,\u00a0or Kim who makes unique jewelry through Velvet Snow Accessories \u2014\u00a0they represent hard work and hope for the province, and I implore you all to support local when you can.\nPersonally, had I lived in a bigger city where I readily had access to Ethiopian food, I would never have started my own catering business, or been as acutely aware to look out for opportunities. And that would have been the biggest shame.\nLastly, have I really lived in Newfoundland if I haven't learned\u00a0to talk about the weather?\nI'm an African at heart and hate the cold.\nAnyone in my office will attest to the space heater and blanket I use for most of the year. But I was once told that \"there is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.\" They clearly hadn't lived here very long but, the sentiment stuck with me and shifted my outlook of the weather.\nI bought good, weather-appropriate\u00a0clothing, and it's ironic that as a city girl, I've learned\u00a0to appreciate the outdoors in a place that has the worst weather. That's the magic of the fresh air and humbling landscape of Newfoundland that I've come to love.\nIf you are new to this province, I hope you'll take the time to stop comparing long enough to see the opportunities available, and find your own joy here.\nI don't know where the next decade will take me but so far, it turned out that I was here for a good time\u00a0and a long time.\nThanks, b'ys!\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Paula Duhatschek", "title": "Housing crisis forcing domestic violence victims to stay longer in shelters", "description": "Length of stays on the rise in Guelph, Waterloo region", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/housing-crisis-forcing-domestic-violence-victims-to-stay-longer-in-shelters-1.5495495", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3753556.1473360227!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/haven-house.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 13, 2020 5:26 AM ET", "2020-03-13T09:26:00.336Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of\u00a0Stopping Domestic Violence, a CBC News series looking at\u00a0the crisis of intimate partner violence\u00a0in Canada and what can be done to end it.\u00a0\nWomen fleeing domestic violence in southwestern Ontario are staying longer and longer in what are supposed to be temporary shelters. A tight housing market has left them with few options.\nWomen's shelters in Waterloo region and Guelph report that the average time women are staying has been on a steady increase \u2014 in one case more than doubling in just a few years. \u00a0\nAt Women's Crisis Services of Waterloo Region, the average length of stay has gone from about 6.5 weeks during the 2017-2018 fiscal year to about 9.5 weeks in the current fiscal year.\nAt Marianne's Place, a shelter run by Guelph-Wellington Women in Crisis, the average length of stay went from 5.5 weeks in 2017, to 12 weeks in 2019. \u00a0\n\"People used to be able to find a place easily \u2026 and now it's months and months of looking, and they're getting turned down or not hearing back,\" said Christine Wilson, residential programs manager at Marianne's Place.\nWilson said some people leaving abusive relationships may have also dealt with financial abuse. In some cases they may not even have a credit history, she said.\nSharing these details with a landlord, Wilson said, can yield mixed results.\n\"Some people will be sympathetic to it and want to help, and other times it will just bring out their fear, as if something will happen to them if they rent to that person,\" she said.\n\"For somebody who is in a shelter, trying to find a place \u2026 there's just a lot of presumption about what that may mean.\"\nTerice Jules began staying at a local shelter since December and is on a waitlist for community housing.\nIn the meantime, Jules has also been going to multiple viewings each day, trying to find an affordable place for herself and her children.\n\"I'm hoping \u2026 [to] maybe finding somebody that's willing to take me on as a tenant,\" she said.\n\"I just really want to settle and get my kids on the right track.\"\nSurvivors of both domestic violence and human trafficking do have priority access to community housing units.\nBut Ryan Pettipiere, director of housing services for the region of Waterloo, says the demand for community housing is so great that everyone is waiting longer \u2014 even those with that status.\n\"As fewer people are able to move into community housing that backs things up,\" he said.\n\"When you zero in on a particular demographic, like individuals that are fleeing domestic violence or human trafficking, it also has an impact on those specific populations as well, which is really unfortunate.\"\nPettipiere said a few years ago, people with priority status would be looking at an average wait time of about two to three months for housing. Nowadays, the average wait time is more like five or six months.\nLori Richer, housing stability manager for\u00a0Wellington\u00a0County\u00a0housing services, said those with priority status in her community are also looking at an average wait time of about six months.\nShe noted this is still a far shorter wait time than what people without priority status can expect: a wait time that can span\u00a0three to six years.\nIn 2017, the province piloted a portable housing benefit program that offered financial assistance to survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking.\nAccording to the province, over 1,400 households across Ontario have been approved to receive monthly assistance through the program.\nThe benefit has since been made permanent and will be folded into the new Canada-Ontario Housing Benefit, which will begin in April 2020.\nThose who work in shelters and in affordable housing say that beyond subsidies,\u00a0more housing stock is simply needed.\nCBC reached out to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing to ask what investments in affordable housing will be made in the upcoming budget.\nA spokesperson said no details will be released until the budget is made public on March 25.\nIn the meantime, Jules said she hopes to find a place for her family as soon as possible.\n\"It would mean the world,\" she said. \u00a0\nIf you need help and are in immediate danger, call 911.

That may be\u00a0about to change.\n\"Technological efficiencies will result in the biggest reduction in head count across the U.S. banking industry in its history,\" said an article released by the global business news service\u00a0Bloomberg.\nIn a story titled\u00a0Tech forecast to destroy more than 200,000 US bank jobs\u00a0the Financial Times quotes the report's author as saying the job cuts will be the \"greatest transfer from labour to capital\" of all time, and will represent a \"golden age of banking efficiency.\"\nWith such remarks, the report by\u00a0well-known banking analyst Mike Mayo seems aimed at people like\u00a0bank shareholders who yesterday lost money in the markets.\nBut for\u00a0bank employees and those worried about where jobs will come from, the report from\u00a0Wells Fargo, the U.S. banking giant famous for its stagecoach origins and for its 2016\u00a0account fraud scandal,\u00a0the news may not be so good.\nThe essence of the report is that a huge investment in technology by the financial industry, estimated at $150 billion US\u00a0annually\u00a0including in artificial intelligence, is paying off. It means new job cuts would allow the banks to continue to find efficiencies\u00a0well beyond the ATM banking and branch closures familiar to Canadians that have helped banks repeatedly increase profits.\nWhile the report focuses on the U.S. industry, Canadian banks are known as leaders in many areas of banking automation, including debit cards and remote banking.\nAs the\u00a0Wells Fargo report says, large banks able to take advantage of the new\u00a0technology will be among the greatest beneficiaries. The biggest Canadian banks with operations in the U.S. and around the globe usually\u00a0rank in the top 10 North American banks by capitalization.\nFront-line branch employees have already been thinned out, but\u00a0the new cuts are expected to be spread across branches and head offices. Call centres will also lose jobs, the report says.\nThe loss of relatively low-paying jobs in customer service\u00a0is a reminder that low wages don't prevent businesses from cutting staff, something\u00a0opponents of minimum wage increases sometime\u00a0suggest. With half of a business's outlays going to employment costs, reducing workers\u00a0whatever their wage level\u00a0remains one of the only practical ways of increasing profits.\nThe trend also confirms concerns over the growing income divide between jobs that can be replaced by computers and those that, so far, cannot. Among the jobs that the report says will remain relatively safe include the tech workers needed to keep the banking software running and secure.\nOther jobs less likely to be cut will be in sales, consulting and advising, the report says.\nEarlier fears for job losses were due to automation where robots could do the physical work that formerly required human labour\u00a0or machine operators. As many reports told us as early as 2013, robots were replacing\u00a0warehouse workers and assembly line employees.\nAt the time service jobs were seen as an alternative, requiring young people to learn to use their brains rather than their brawn. This latest report is a reminder that as software becomes more sophisticated, higher-level jobs will also disappear, and not just in banking.\nPredictions a decade into the future,\u00a0whether in banking or any other industry, are\u00a0inevitably uncertain.\nMany economists have insisted that job losses\u00a0in one sector do not mean there will be fewer jobs overall. So far that has proven true.\nBut a recession caused by the simmering global trade war may mean it will take time for society to create new jobs lost to technology in administrative jobs like banking.\nThis week new figures from the U.S. show manufacturing\u00a0slumped sharply for the second month in a row as the U.S.-China trade war begins to bite. That decline in factory activity has been described as one of the triggers for the latest\u00a0stock market tumble\u00a0in the U.S. and Canada.\n\"The disappointing data is only fanning long-standing fears of slowing global growth,\" said Alec Young, managing director of Global Markets Research at FTSE Russell, this week.\nA slowing economy is not good for banks. As Canadians look for ways to cut back they will be less likely to pile on debt, expanding the loan book of banks, their life blood.\u00a0\nWhen it was expected interest rates were on the way up banks would at least\u00a0have benefited as borrowers were forced to pay a little more to extend their loans. But now rates seem to be on the way back down.\nIf a recession comes, banks will be competing\u00a0to get their costs down too, making the replacement of human workers with much cheaper technology an alluring prospect.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Paige Parsons", "title": "U of A steps closer to developing lands near south campus", "description": "Michener Park likely first up for redevelopment", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/u-of-a-steps-closer-to-developing-lands-near-south-campus-1.5448468", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5448511.1580514137!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/michener-park-in-south-central-edmonton-will-likely-be-the-first-site-considered-for-development-by-the-university-of-alberta-s-land-trust.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 03, 2020 7:00 AM MT", "2020-02-03T14:00:00.811Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The University of Alberta is forging ahead with plans to develop its land in south-central Edmonton.\nLast week, through an order in council, the province granted the school permission to lease out some approved parcels for up to 99 years.\n\"It is something that this institution has been looking at for a long-term period,\" said U of A vice-president of facilities and operations Andrew Sharman. \"And now we're at the point of being able to move forward.\"\nIn the wake of funding reductions to post-secondary institutions in the 2019 provincial budget, the school laid out a plan for managing the $44.2 million cut to its operating grant, including the possibility of activating its land trust \u2014 an arm's-length agency that has the capacity to manage leases and development of school-owned properties.\nIn an emailed statement Friday, Advanced Education Minister Demetrios Nicolaides said the province was \"pleased\" to make the recommendation, citing the MacKinnon Report's recommendation that the school find ways to generate revenue beyond government grants.\u00a0\nThe order in council was first drafted in 2015.\u00a0\nSharman said the first parcel likely up for development will be Michener Park \u2014 a series of student housing complexes at the west end of the Malmo Plains neighbourhood. The existing buildings were already slated for closure this summer.\n\"It has great opportunity for redevelopment as the buildings on it are at the end of their life, or past the end of their life,\"\u00a0Sharman said. \"And with it being within the city boundaries, close to transit, LRT, main arteries in an established community \u2013\u2013 that's definitely one of the priorities for development.\"\nNext up would likely be the property known as the West 240\u00a0\u2014 an open field bordered by 122nd Street to the east, Whitemud Creek Ravine to the west, and the Grandview Heights and Lansdowne neighbourhoods to the north and south respectively.\nIn 2019, a U of A official told CBC the school owns 26,000 acres of property across the province. It also owns a research facility on Vancouver Island. But there are no plans to lease or develop land\u00a0currently used for research, Sharman said.\nSharman said the U of A looked to other school land trusts as inspiration: the UBC trust was formed in 1988, and by 2019 had generated more than $1.6 billion for the school's endowment fund.\u00a0\nUniversity of Alberta Properties Trust Inc. was created in 2015 and is overseen by a board of directors. But it has remained empty since its creation. With the order in council on the books, the process of transferring the identified parcels into the land trust is expected to begin in the coming weeks.\nBut Sharman said it's too early to say what will be built and when it might happen.\nHe said decisions will be \"market driven\" and the trust will work with joint venture partners and the private sector, as well as with the surrounding communities and the city's zoning requirements.\n\"I wouldn't see major return on our investment any sooner than five years, and again a lot of it will depend on the economy and what the market will bear,\" Sharman said.\u00a0\nWard 10 Coun. Michael Walters said he expects adding housing stock and more amenities through mixed-use development at the Michener site would likely be welcomed. But there is \"tension,\" he said, about the value of the West 240 area, given its proximity to the ravine and existing homes.\n\"That will have to be developed very thoughtfully over time,\" Walters said. \"With the land trust being the mechanism to deliver that development, communities are going to have a greater say than if the university was to do it themselves.\"\nWalters also said he isn't overly concerned about the university's land eating into the city's own brownfield developments, such Blatchford, Rossdale or the Exhibition Lands. What's needed, he said, is a mindset shift to prioritize developments that increase density over sprawling further at the outskirts.\n\"There's plenty of land development opportunities, and plenty of market to support those land development opportunities,\" he said.\n\"This is a new development, but one that has been expected for a long time,\" said Stephen Dobson, civics representative for the Lendrum community league.\nDobson also sits on the South Campus Neighbourhood Coalition \u2014 a group that formed in 2010 in response to development happening on the university farm, during a time when the surrounding neighbourhoods felt like the school wasn't really consulting with them.\nSince the formation of the land trust, Dobson said, communities in the area have been aware development could eventually come, so he doesn't expect anyone will be too surprised. And he doesn't expect any imminent changes.\nA more immediate concern, he said, is that once Michener Park empties out later this year, the vacant buildings could attract trouble and become a derelict eyesore.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/programs/allinaday/money-column-betting-on-veggie-burgers-1.5255169", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "City's climate plan calls for smaller homes, cleaner cars", "description": "But latest inventory shows greenhouse gas emissions rising, not falling", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-climate-change-master-plan-1.5391113", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5099914.1555425995!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/climate-emergency-rally-april-2019-ottawa-city-hall.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 14, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-14T09:00:00.596Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The City of Ottawa is envisioning a future with smaller homes and a car-free downtown as it prepares to adopt an ambitious new plan to deal with climate change \u2014 but first it needs to convince residents to curb their own greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe road map, which goes before the city's environment committee for approval Tuesday,\u00a0could\u00a0affect\u00a0every city decision,\u00a0from how it approves highrise towers to what kind of buses it buys.\u00a0\nStaff are recommending the city\u00a0set\u00a0tougher\u00a0targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fall in line with\u00a0the United Nations' goal to limit warming to 1.5 C. The new aim is\u00a0for\u00a0city\u00a0operations to be net-zero by 2040, and for the rest of the city to hit that same target\u00a0by 2050.\nTo get there, the average new home will be smaller\u00a0and will use heating and cooling technology that's far less reliant\u00a0on natural gas and\u00a0other fossil fuels.\nAll new vehicles will be electric, and there will a congestion surcharge to enter the\u00a0downtown core.

Scott Moffatt, chair of the city's environmental protection, water and waste management committee, says a key piece will be building more densely, and making sure outlying\u00a0communities have their own jobs and amenities to cut down on commuting.\n\"As it stands today, you cannot buy a pair of socks in the village of Richmond,\" Moffatt said. \"That's not a complete community.\"\nOther changes will have to come from the private sector, Moffatt noted, and the municipality will have to rely on upper levels of government\u00a0to fund its ideas for combatting climate change.\nGetting citizens to do their part will be crucial, since city operations make up only five per cent of local\u00a0greenhouse gas emissions.\nAfter starting to make\u00a0gains\u00a0when\u00a0the Ontario government stopped burning coal, the 2018 inventory\u00a0\u2014 Ottawa recently started tracking emissions annually instead of every four years \u2014 showed the city is trending in the wrong direction, with natural gas\u00a0and electricity used to heat and cool homes a major contributor.\u00a0\nOn the other side of the equation, the city is reducing\u00a0emissions from its own\u00a0operations. Upgrades at the local landfill\u00a0made the biggest dent.\nThe diesel-powered city\u00a0fleet, however, remains a major source of pollution.

How did you get into this situation?\nA: We took our return provision to address the fact that some of our oils and softgels weren't selling as we expected, and that basically had a very negative impact throughout our numbers.\u00a0\nBut if you park that, we're still looking at a market share in the recreational market of over 25 per cent across the country. Gross revenues were up to $118 million.\nCanadian medical sales were up, international sales were up, our retail sales were up and overall cannabis shipments were up.\u00a0\nSo there is some good in there, but certainly clouded by the fact that we had to take these write-offs and provisions and certainly clouded by the fact that we simply don't have enough places to sell our product in Ontario.\u00a0\nQ: If I'm an employee \u2014 and there are more than a thousand of them \u2014 and I see that the company lost $374 million in its second quarter, I'm wondering whether I'm still going to have a job. Are there going to be job losses?\nA: There are not going to be job losses.\nFirst, we do have to divide out the accounting number [of the losses] versus the sort of cash number,\u00a0because our losses reflect the value of change in option holdings or the value of change of our number of plants in the ground.\u00a0\nAnd while we're still losing money, in the grand scheme of what we have in the bank, in the grand scheme of what the future looks like, we actually remain quite bullish on the future.\u00a0\nQ: You've blamed the Ontario government for not licensing retail stores quickly enough. What were you expecting?\nA: Blame is maybe a strong word. We take our share of responsibility for the fact that in the early days, there was inconsistency in supply, and that's in some ways to be expected.\nThe result is governments made tough choices about the retail store rollout.\nThere are clearly not enough stores in Ontario. There is enough supply now to support more. And we need the government to move quickly.\u00a0\nQ: How many more stores do you need?\nA: In Ontario, there is [currently] one store for every 600,000 people. In Colorado, for example, it's one store for every 10,000 people.\nSo you could literally see hundreds and hundreds \u2014\u00a0and probably upwards of a thousand stores \u2014\u00a0in Ontario to properly support the market.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Emma Smith", "title": "Education, reuse key to making sure personal protective equipment lasts, says doctor", "description": "Hundreds of people have been trained to coach health-care workers on PPE use", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/personal-protective-equipment-alex-mitchell-working-group-masks-gowns-gloves-supply-1.5536273", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5485097.1583336521!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/during-the-spread-of-covid-19-n95-masks-have-become-popular-products-at-pharmacies.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 17, 2020 4:00 PM AT", "2020-04-17T19:00:21.062Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Hundreds of Nova Scotia health-care workers are doing double duty coaching their co-workers in the proper use of personal protective equipment.\nIt's all part of the province's plan to conserve masks, gloves, gowns and face shields\u00a0during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\n\"We really do need to pay close attention to proper education, treating fear, making sure that people have the right things and use the right things at the right times,\" Dr. Alex Mitchell told CBC's Information Morning on Friday.\nMitchell, a general surgeon, became medical co-lead of a special PPE working group in the middle of March to take stock of the province's stockpile, and to make sure there were enough supplies to make it through the\u00a0pandemic.\u00a0\nHe said his team quickly realized they needed to train coaches, many of them front-line health-care workers themselves, to share best practices.

On television, in\u00a0schools, on the street and\u00a0at home, one word hangs in the air: coronavirus.\nThe coronavirus \u2014 which causes COVID-19 \u2014 and its repercussions are unlike anything people today have ever experienced. Stock markets have been\u00a0plunging, travel restrictions have been put in place, major sports events have been suspended, schools are closing\u00a0and an entire country, Italy, is under lockdown.\nAll of this information can be overwhelming and frightening for children, and it's up to parents to provide accurate information in an age-appropriate manner, one expert says.\nJulie Farrally, of Mississauga, Ont., is the mother of two teenagers.\u00a0She noticed heightened concern from\u00a0her 15-year-old son, Noah. It started fairly early on and began with frequent handwashing.\n\"He's definitely more conscious about germs,\" Farrally said. \"He's definitely way more conscious about keeping the house clean, to the point where I'm like, 'No, you're in the house, and you've been in the house, you don't need to rewash our hands.'\"\nIt's not that he's paranoid, she said, just more conscious about being clean.\nYouth psychiatrist Dr. Rachel Mitchell, with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, said it's important to validate fears held by children, to\u00a0listen to them and to be sure to speak to them at the age-appropriate level. If they have asked questions, answer them honestly,\u00a0and don't share any more information other than what they asked.\n\"Obviously, the conversation you have with a five-year-old is not going to be the same conversation that you have with a 10-year-old, which is not the same conversation that you're going to have with a teenager,\" Mitchell said.\nAlso, don't keep them in the dark.\n\"Don't hide news from kids,\" Mitchell said. \"The instinct to protect them is natural and valid and inherent to being a parent. But as with any difficult news story, telling them the realistic truth at their level of understanding is very important.\"\nBut that also doesn't mean putting on the news 24/7. Mitchell said there is value to limiting exposure to the news.\u00a0\nThat's something that Farrally and her husband are doing.\n\"I won't turn on the news and just keep it on,\" she said. \"I don't want to overdo it. I'm not hiding it, but I just don't want to overdo it.\"\u00a0\nFor young children, Mitchell said, parents could read the news with them. This provides the opportunity to ask questions along the way. But tell them only what you think they need to know.\u00a0\n\"Thinking that something is being kept from you is more anxiety-provoking than a real conversation at any age,\" Mitchell said.\nAnd a bit of empowerment goes a long way.\n\"Helping kids feel that they have agency through handwashing, for example, is amazing,\" Mitchell said.\u00a0\nWith COVID-19 cases rising across Canada daily, it may be difficult for parents to deal with their own fears and concerns. But Mitchell said it's important to keep calm around children.\n\"You have to be aware of your anxiety,\" she said. \"If it's out of control, then that's probably not something you want to show your kids.\"\nInstead, parents can leave the room if they\u00a0feel their\u00a0anxiety is overwhelming and return once they've calmed down.\nFor Farrally, she said her concerns over COVID-19 ebb and flow.\n\"Sometimes I think, 'OK, most people are going to get over this,'\" she said.\u00a0\nBut the fast and ever-changing status of the disease\u00a0makes it difficult to keep those fears at bay. One challenge was the announcement Wednesday by the World Health Organization\u00a0that\u00a0it was a pandemic, she said.\n\"I thought, 'Damn, how nervous should I be about this?'\" she said. \"And,honestly, I'm really glad we're not going anywhere for March Break.'\"\nAnd finally, ensure that children are reading trusted sources and not listening to rumours or misinformation passed through social media, particularly for children who may be more anxious than others.\n\"Always validate that anxiety and that concern, because it's valid, especially now,\" Mitchell said. \"If it's dismissed, then\u00a0that's a missed opportunity\" as a parent.\n"}, {"author": "Clare Hennig", "title": "Vancouver needs 10,000 affordable housing units a year to address rental 'backlog,' report advises", "description": "There\u2019s a mismatch between what\u2019s being built and what renters need, says economist Mark Lee", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-needs-10-000-affordable-housing-units-a-year-to-address-rental-backlog-report-advises-1.5393571", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4605140.1522881136!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancouver-home-sales-slows.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 12, 2019 1:08 PM PT", "2019-12-12T21:08:33.994Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A total of at least 10,000 rental homes.\nThat's how many units of non-market rental housing a Canadian think tank says need to be built every year to address Metro Vancouver's ongoing affordability crisis.\nAccording to Marc Lee, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives who wrote\u00a0a report on the matter,\u00a0the problem in Vancouver isn't a lack of construction,\u00a0it's a mismatch between what's being built and what's needed.\u00a0\n\"We've had a major building boom in recent years,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"But for some reason, we're not building the type of housing that we actually need to address the crisis.\"\nNon-market rental housing, which included public housing and co-ops, is more affordable than the average for-profit, privately-developed home.\u00a0\n\"The emphasis has been on building condos,\" Lee told Gloria Macarenko, host of CBC's On The Coast.\u00a0\n\"We've seen some efforts by municipal governments to try to move the needle on that \u2026 but the end result still ends up being apartments that are very expensive.\"\nMunicipalities across the Lower Mainland have brought rules and incentives to encourage developers to build rental units, as well as focusing on building more social housing.\u00a0\nLee argues the push for affordability needs to be more aggressive to make a difference.\u00a0\n\"We haven't come up with the numbers to get ahead of the curve,\" he said.\u00a0\nAbout four to five per cent of housing in Metro Vancouver is some form of public housing, like social housing or co-ops, Lee said.\u00a0\nHe compared that to some cities in Europe where public housing is closer to 20 to 25 percent of the stock, or Vienna, the capital of Austria, where almost half of the total housing stock is public.\n\"We need to think a lot bigger,\" Lee said.\u00a0\nThe number of 10,000 units per year for Metro Vancouver comes from data compiled from various studies, Lee said, ranging from city reports to estimates from the B.C.

The company sought creditor protection in April because it couldn't pay a key $20-million US interest payment and another\u00a0$16-million Cdn\u00a0bill to its partner at the Diavik diamond mine. It says those missed payments could have led to bankruptcy if left unpaid.\u00a0\nTodd Parsons, the president of the Union of Northern Workers, which represents 400 workers at the company's Ekati diamond mine confirmed the pension was in a shortfall. On Wednesday, he said the shortfall was at least $9.1 million.\nIn a series of followup emails on Thursday, Parsons said through a spokeswoman that the UNW was\u00a0made aware of the $9.1 million shortfall April 1, after the union requested the official information from the company.\nIn a second email, Parsons acknowledges the union is aware of the figures reported in Kaye's affidavit\u00a0and says the union is trying to come to a better understanding of the situation. The union requested more documentation from Dominion about a week ago, but has not yet received a response, he said.\u00a0\nThe next official actuarial report confirming the pension's financial position to Jan 1, 2020 was originally set for June 30, 2020, but that deadline has been extended 90 days.\u00a0\nThe union has a legal team examining the situation and will argue those benefits should be guaranteed, Parsons explained.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We're going to want our members, our employees addressed first ahead of creditors,\" he said. \"The union is going to insist on protecting the priority of these pensions for these workers, that's a normal expectation.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nGovernment regulators had previously identified the issue and the company was working to address it, Parsons said, but he was not certain how long that's been ongoing and whether it had been fully addressed.\u00a0\n\"My understanding is that this was identified as an issue through normal accounting practices for defined-benefits plans,\" Parsons said. \"That information had been reported to the union.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nPart of the creditor protection process is the restructuring and settling of debts. It's not certain the pension deficit will be met.\nUltimately, Parsons said he hopes\u00a0Dominion resolves its financial issues, returns to normal operations and continues with its plan to address the shortfall over the long-term.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut like so much in this process,\u00a0that's not guaranteed.\nWhen a company goes through creditor protection or bankruptcy, the money already put into the defined benefits pension is generally safe from creditors \u2014 but the deficits are not, according to several experts canvassed by CBC News.\u00a0\nA defined benefit pension plan is a plan where the employer pays out benefits based on factors such as length of employment and salary history, typically for life. They've grown increasingly rare in the private sector in favour of defined contribution pensions because of the expense to employers.\u00a0\u00a0\nThough the courts are still settling this issue, the shortfall often becomes an unsecured debt that the company owes, just like any other unsecured debt the company needs to pay. Those creditors take the least priority when determining which creditors should be paid.\u00a0\u00a0\nLike with all other unsecured debts, there's no way to tell whether it will be honoured. Underfunded pensions have been a recurring issue in Canadian bankruptcy courts over the past decade, notably during the Sears case in 2018.\nSince first applying for court-ordered creditor protection, Dominion has said it plans to return to business once COVID-19 has passed and has $180-million US in inventory around the world to sell. It blames ongoing commercial and travel restrictions due to COVID-19 for leaving it with a cash-flow crisis.\nRead more about Dominion's situation and how the next steps are critical\u00a0\nCBC News had asked Dominion Diamond for an interview to discuss this issue, but the company declined. Instead it sent a statement that did not address the questions directly, attributed to CEO Pat Merrin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Dominion's commitments to employees and local communities remain a priority for the company,\" Merrin said in the statement. \"We are working diligently to secure sufficient financing to continue operations and allow Dominion to emerge from the CCAA process an even stronger company.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Equipment dealer blames farm trade wars as plans for aggressive growth stall", "description": "Rocky Mountain Dealerships Inc. cites

demands were not met.\nWhen the prosecutor spoke, he told jurors: \"That is what extortion sounds like.\"\nClosing arguments were the culmination of a three-week trial for the California lawyer who

His former law firm office manager testified that finances were so desperate last March that several employees had been evicted from their $50,000-a-month offices and were working from their homes.\nDefence lawyers say the government was trying to criminalize the kinds of negotiations that lawyers engage in every day when they aggressively represent clients. They were expected to offer closing arguments of their own later Tuesday on behalf of Avenatti, who has pleaded not guilty.\nIn his closing, Podolsky repeatedly played recorded conversations he said prove that Avenatti was working for his own benefit in his dealings with Nike, rather than for the benefit of his client, Gary Franklin, a Los Angeles amateur basketball coach.\n\"Michael Avenatti, facing a mountain of debt, saw light at the end of the tunnel,\" Podolsky said. \"He saw a meal ticket: Gary Franklin.\"\nFranklin testified last week that he hoped that a high-profile lawyer like Avenatti would restore a decade-long sponsorship relationship between his amateur league and Nike after he got the company to punish two executives who demanded he play a role in payments to athletes' families.\nThe prosecutor added: \"The evidence is clear. It is simple.

Newly constructed units have outpaced demand for rent, nudging Regina's vacancy rate from 7 per cent to 7.7 per cent.\nThis elevated vacancy rate has pushed landlords and property managers of older units to lower their rents as they try to compete with new rentals.\nThe CMHC report breaks down what happens if\u00a0you remove newly constructed buildings from the equation. If you compare the same units from 2017 to 2018 \u2014 without new\u00a0buildings\u00a0\u2014 rent for a two-bedroom apartment declined by 0.5 per cent, according to the report.\nShawn Schlechter, owner of Shawn's Property Management, says he has never seen a vacancy rate this high in his 20 years in the business.\nHe says his main goal is to get tenants in the door. When a property owner tells him they need a $1,000 to cover their bottom line, he urges them to come down to $900 in order to stay competitive.\u00a0\n\"It's just one of those things that you have to do. It's better to lose $100\u00a0than it is to lose the whole $1,000,\" said Schlechter.\nHe says he and other landlords are in the red for their properties right now.

The bank's stock dipped six per cent on the stock market on Tuesday.\nPaige A. Thompson, who uses the online handle \"erratic\" \u2014 was charged with a single count of computer fraud and abuse in U.S. District Court in Seattle. Thompson made an initial appearance in court and was ordered to remain in custody pending a detention hearing Thursday.\nFederal agents began tracking Thompson online after being notified by Capital One of a possible breach in July.\nOn June 18, Thompson sent a message on Twitter to another user saying, \"Ive basically strapped myself with a bomb vest, (expletive) dropping capitol ones dox and admitting it.\"\nThe FBI raided Thompson's residence Monday and seized digital devices. An initial search turned up files that referenced Capital One and \"other entities that may have been targets of attempted or actual network intrusions.\"\nThompson was a systems engineer at Amazon Web Services between 2015 and 2016, about three years before the breach took place.\nWhile that service is used by Capital One, there is no evidence that Amazon's cloud system was involved in the breach.\n\"AWS was not compromised in any way and functioned as designed,\" a company spokesperson said Tuesday.\n\"The perpetrator gained access through a misconfiguration of the web application and not the underlying cloud-based infrastructure. As Capital One explained clearly in its disclosure, this type of vulnerability is not specific to the cloud.\"\nCapital One Financial Corp. was notified by a third party on July 19 that their data had appeared on the code-hosting site GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft. The McLean, Va., company says it immediately notified the FBI.\nThe FBI said a Twitter user who went by \"erratic\" sent a user direct messages warning about distributing the bank's data, including names, birth dates and Social Security numbers. That user reported the message to Capital One.\nCapital One said it believes it is unlikely that the information was used for fraud, but the investigation is ongoing.\nThe data breach involves about 100 million people in the U.S. and six million in Canada.\nIn Canada, the company offers Mastercard credit services, including those attached to Hudson's Bay Company and Costco.\nThe company says it will offer free credit monitoring, and other offerings for anyone affected, but the details have not been ironed out yet \u2014 nor have all the impacted customers been contacted.\n\"We are working on the details and will be providing further information soon,\" a spokesperson for Capital One Canada told CBC News. \"I can confirm that the free credit monitoring tool and identity theft insurance will be available to all those affected. The specific details on this will be shared over the next few days.\"\nThe bank said the bulk of the hacked data consisted of information supplied by consumers and small businesses who applied for credit cards between 2005 and early 2019. In addition to data such as phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth and self-reported income, the hacker was also able to access credit scores, credit limits and balances, as well as fragments of transaction information from a total of 23 days in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\"While I am grateful that the perpetrator has been caught, I am deeply sorry for what has happened,\" said Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank. \"I sincerely apologize for the understandable worry this incident must be causing those affected and I am committed to making it right.\"\nCapital One Financial Corp., the nation's seventh-largest commercial bank with $373.6 billion in assets as of June 30, is the latest U.S. company to suffer a major data breach in recent years.\nIn 2017, a data breach at Equifax, one of the major credit reporting companies, exposed the Social Security numbers and other sensitive information of roughly half of the U.S. population.\nLast week, Equifax agreed to pay at least $700 million to settle lawsuits over the breach in a settlement with federal authorities and states. The agreement includes up to $425 million in monetary relief to consumers.\nMany major banks have sought to stem the risk of data breaches in recent years. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank began replacing customers' debit cards several years ago with more secure chip-based cards. While the cards with chips are common these days, many merchants still rely on the older, less secure card-swiping equipment. Credit card companies have also beefed up fraud monitoring in the wake of high-profile data breaches that hit retailers such as Target and Home Depot.\nThe average cost of a data breach in the U.S. last year was just under $8 million, according to a study by IBM Security and Ponemon Institute.\nA public defender appointed to represent Thompson did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\n"}, {"author": "Eva Uguen-Csenge", "title": "Richmond library event offers rent-boosting tips for landlords", "description": "The event was originally titled 'The Secret to Charging Above Market Value Rents'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/richmond-library-event-rent-landlords-boost-1.5301346", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5146801.1569956660!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-rent-sign-regina-sask-stock-rental-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 28, 2019 8:00 AM PT", "2019-09-28T15:00:00.789Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Richmond Public Library is hosting a sold-out event by a speaker promising to teach landlords how to charge higher rents on their properties.\nThe Realtor leading the workshop says the goal is to show landlords how to increase their properties' value so they can collect above-market rents.\nThe event, originally titled \"The Secret to Charging Above Market Value Rents,\" is now being called \"Adding Value to Your Rental Property.\"\nThe original title raised some alarms for the\u00a0library, which asked that the event's name be changed.\nIt's part of a series of workshops on real estate for Mandarin speakers led by Vancouver Realtor Alina He.\nThe title was changed after the library contacted He.

But in a place where money has always played such an important role, markets tell part of the story.\nOn Monday the Hong Kong stock market, Asia's third largest and the fourth biggest in the world, plunged by 2.6 per cent as hundreds of billions of dollars in value was wiped off share prices.\nDemonstrators are reacting Tuesday to a new police shooting, photos of a bloody attack and video of a motorcycle cop using his vehicle to run down protesters.\nUniversities and many businesses are closed. For many the main\u00a0subway system, the MTR,\u00a0has become a no-go zone\u00a0after demonstrators accused the listed company of being in league with the government and police.\nYesterday, shares in the MTR Corporation did worse than the market as a whole and are down about 20 per cent in the last four months\u00a0as the stations have become a target of reprisals including gasoline bombs, damaged pay terminals and smashed windows.\nA fire aboard a subway car that resulted in\u00a0injuries and the dangers of panic from smoke and tear gas have made people wary of taking what has been one of the most efficient\u00a0and most crowded\u00a0public transit systems in the world. But for many ordinary commuters there are few alternatives.\nNot just the large listed companies are suffering. Besides the damage and loss of tourism, regular folks are staying home more and spending less in restaurants.\nStrangely\u00a0in such a law-abiding community, where muggings for example just don't happen, polls still show most Hong Kongers blame the police and government.\nIt is not unreasonable to say that the escalating violence and its economic cost can be traced back to a single cause, the refusal of Beijing and the Hong Kong government that does its bidding to back off a plan to force the extradition of Hong Kong people to face Chinese courts.\nFor whatever reason, the Hong Kong government of Carrie\u00a0Lam and her\u00a0Beijing masters decided that despite strenuous objections from all parts of society to having their common law legal system overruled\u00a0by Chinese courts, it was time to draw a line in the sand.\nIn these polarized times where people\u00a0gravitate to contradictory conclusions, taking a hard line may seem like a powerful tool for politicians to\u00a0invigorate their supporters and demonstrate the strength of their views. But as I pointed out a few months ago in the case of Brexit, taking a rigid stance also motivates your opposition. And the results may be contrary to what you hoped.\nIn a small way this week's battle over the wearing of poppies,\u00a0or as commentator Adam Kassam described it,\u00a0the weaponization of the poppy, was a similar example, which had precisely the opposite of its intended effect. Rather than encouraging people to wear poppies, many of us felt obliged to take them off this year rather than be seen as backers of what seemed like Don Cherry-style racism.\nFailing to take a stand is often characterized as weakness. Former British prime minister Neville Chamberlain's name has been blackened by history for his supposed failure to take a hard line against Hitler, though the details are far more complex.\nUndoubtedly there are times to take a stand. But it is a policy to be saved for special occasions when the alternative is extreme. It should also be reserved for times when the result of standing your ground is not worse than, as in the case of Hong Kong, what will happen if your bullheadedness is opposed.\nIn the event, after drawing its line in the sand the Hong Kong government was forced to step back, first suspending and then finally withdrawing the extradition bill as protests mounted. But it was too late.\nThe early and repeated unwillingness to listen, to negotiate, to compromise came at a cost. As violence intensified and demands escalated, reaching out across the gulf is no longer as easy as it would have been when many people would have been happy with simpler concessions.\nAlmost bizarrely, Beijing representatives in the region are calling for harsher laws\u00a0to draw yet another line in the sand. As if further escalation will calm a popular protest movement that has begun to spray paint the nihilistic slogan \"Burn with us\" on buildings. Students of Chinese history will know how explosive popular revolts can become.\nIntervening with force majeure at this stage could well destroy more than it saves, smashing markets, resulting in\u00a0pain and anger across China and threatening Communist Party legitimacy.\nRather than draw more lines, the government must urgently join with moderate demonstrators and business leaders to pursue a path to peace. It will not be easy at this stage.\u00a0It may require concessions. But it may still be possible, and it is definitely worth the effort for Hong Kong, for China and for world markets.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Slashing all car insurance rates during COVID-19 would be 'overly simplistic,' says industry CEO", "description": "Don Forgeron says \u2018adjustments\u2019 are being made to \u2018better reflect the reduced risk\u2019\u00a0", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-friday-edition-1.5543921/slashing-all-car-insurance-rates-during-covid-19-would-be-overly-simplistic-says-industry-ceo-1.5542704", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5511567.1585257098!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/empty-ottawa-coronavirus.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 24, 2020 3:08 PM ET", "2020-04-24T19:10:47.739Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Transcript\nDespite the enormous drop in vehicle collisions on Canada's roads during the coronavirus pandemic, the nation's insurance bureau insists there is no reason to lower insurance rates across the board.\u00a0\nOntario Provincial Police said there were\u00a0953 collisions in and around the Greater Toronto Area over the last month \u2014 compared to more than\u00a02,500 over the same period last year.\u00a0That's a drop of over 62 per cent.\u00a0\nDon Forgeron, president and CEO of the Insurance Bureau of Canada, says that because of the \"substantial\" decline in crashes, the insurance industry has \"decided that adjustments need to be made to better reflect the reduced risk.\"\u00a0\nHowever, Forgeron told As It Happens host Carol Off\u00a0that a blanket rate reduction is \"an overly simplistic approach to what is a complex issue.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHere is part of their conversation.\u00a0\nWhat does this mean for the auto insurance industry?\nIt's clear that when the premiums were set for policies that consumers currently have, they were set in a different time and place. They were set with the expectation and the belief that accident rates that were in existence during 2019 would continue into 2020. Clearly, that has changed substantially.\nBecause of that, the industry has decided that adjustments need to be made to better reflect the reduced risk.\u00a0\nWhat kind of adjustments?\u00a0\nThe industry is made up of about 180 different insurers and they all have their own business models and all insure different segments of society.\nWhat [the majority] announced a couple of weeks ago was for consumers whose driving habits have changed substantially \u2026 there ought to be premium reductions as a result of that.\u00a0\nInsurers have taken variations on that theme. Their customers are getting in touch with them and adjustments are being made to those policies.\nSo people have to actually be proactive? The customers have to say that they are not driving as much and the car has been sitting in the driveway since the beginning of March. Or do the insurance companies themselves initiate this?\nThe insurance companies, of course, would have no way of knowing what your circumstances are, whether or not they've changed or in what way they've changed. So, yes, it does require the customer to get in touch and let their insurance broker or their insurance company know what has changed.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe insurers themselves would decide what kind of discounts might be given to those customers?\u00a0\nYeah, auto insurance rates are heavily regulated in Canada. There are provincial rate regulators in each province who establish rates. And there are a lot of rules and guidelines around how these changes need to be made.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is not just left to chance. So companies would have to offer reductions or rebates or changes in line with rules that would have been approved by regulators when the rates were originally filed.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome companies have done it differently. Some have decided to simply write a cheque, a refund cheque to consumers. Others are providing deferred payments. Others are providing a credit against their policy.\u00a0\nThe New Democratic Party in Ontario is asking for auto insurers in the province to cut all rates by 50 per cent. Why not just do that?\nI understand the sentiment behind that, but what I don't understand is the science behind that. Insurers rely on actuarial science \u2014 so do regulators \u2014 to arrive at a premium for a consumer that's reflective of the risk.\u00a0\nSimply pulling a number out of the air, [like] 50 per cent, just wouldn't fly with regulators. There's more science to it than that. It's an overly simplistic approach to what is a complex issue.\u00a0\u00a0\nIs the auto insurance industry going to see increased profits [during the pandemic]?\u00a0\nLike everything else through this crisis, it's impossible to know how this all plays out.\u00a0\nThe industry underwrites commercial insurance. It underwrites property insurance. It's also affected by the stock market and the ups and downs that we're witnessing there. And so it's far too early to tell how this all plays out.\nBut what I can tell you, I know most of your listeners won't believe what I'm about to say, but going into this year, the industry was marginally profitable.\u00a0\nIt's not an industry that attracts huge returns on investment and it has been a difficult three to five years, driven in large part by natural catastrophes right across the country.\nWritten by Adam Jacobson.

They were set with the expectation and the belief that accident rates that were in existence during 2019 would continue into 2020. Clearly, that has changed substantially.\nBecause of that, the industry has decided that adjustments need to be made to better reflect the reduced risk.\u00a0\nWhat kind of adjustments?\u00a0\nThe industry is made up of about 180 different insurers and they all have their own business models and all insure different segments of society.\nWhat [the majority] announced a couple of weeks ago was for consumers whose driving habits have changed substantially \u2026 there ought to be premium reductions as a result of that.\u00a0\nInsurers have taken variations on that theme. Their customers are getting in touch with them and adjustments are being made to those policies.\nSo people have to actually be proactive? The customers have to say that they are not driving as much and the car has been sitting in the driveway since the beginning of March. Or do the insurance companies themselves initiate this?\nThe insurance companies, of course, would have no way of knowing what your circumstances are, whether or not they've changed or in what way they've changed. So, yes, it does require the customer to get in touch and let their insurance broker or their insurance company know what has changed.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe insurers themselves would decide what kind of discounts might be given to those customers?\u00a0\nYeah, auto insurance rates are heavily regulated in Canada. There are provincial rate regulators in each province who establish rates. And there are a lot of rules and guidelines around how these changes need to be made.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is not just left to chance. So companies would have to offer reductions or rebates or changes in line with rules that would have been approved by regulators when the rates were originally filed.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome companies have done it differently. Some have decided to simply write a cheque, a refund cheque to consumers. Others are providing deferred payments. Others are providing a credit against their policy.\u00a0\nThe New Democratic Party in Ontario is asking for auto insurers in the province to cut all rates by 50 per cent. Why not just do that?\nI understand the sentiment behind that, but what I don't understand is the science behind that. Insurers rely on actuarial science \u2014 so do regulators \u2014 to arrive at a premium for a consumer that's reflective of the risk.\u00a0\nSimply pulling a number out of the air, [like] 50 per cent, just wouldn't fly with regulators. There's more science to it than that. It's an overly simplistic approach to what is a complex issue.\u00a0\u00a0\nIs the auto insurance industry going to see increased profits [during the pandemic]?\u00a0\nLike everything else through this crisis, it's impossible to know how this all plays out.\u00a0\nThe industry underwrites commercial insurance. It underwrites property insurance. It's also affected by the stock market and the ups and downs that we're witnessing there. And so it's far too early to tell how this all plays out.\nBut what I can tell you, I know most of your listeners won't believe what I'm about to say, but going into this year, the industry was marginally profitable.\u00a0\nIt's not an industry that attracts huge returns on investment and it has been a difficult three to five years, driven in large part by natural catastrophes right across the country.\nWritten by Adam Jacobson.

It's easy enough for politicians to talk up a roaring economy. In its own way, it's easy to say what you'd do when\u00a0the economy is in the tank. But a patchwork of mostly good and some bad is a harder pitch.\nAnd right now, Canada's economy is doing OK. Maybe not great, but certainly not bad. That's not exactly the kind of quote that's\u00a0put on posters.\n\"The economy was fairly weak over the latter half of 2018,\" said\u00a0Pedro Antunes, chief economist with the Conference Board of Canada. But, he noted, \"We've seen a modest pick up in the first quarter.\"\nOn a longer scale,\u00a0the last three or four years,\u00a0Antunes said\u00a0the Canadian economy has \"done quite well.\" And while it may sometimes be hard for Canadians to see that bigger picture, economists say the country's economic\u00a0indicators are relatively strong.\n\"The aggregate economic data in Canada is looking quite strong,\" said\u00a0Frances Donald, chief economist and head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife.\u00a0\"We have plenty of jobs, wages are rising, GDP numbers are fairly solid.\"\nThat's all the more remarkable\u00a0given that much of the world is doing a lot worse.\nAnd yet\u00a0a new poll commissioned for CBC News\u00a0highlights Canadians' economic anxiety, with 32 per cent of respondents saying that\u00a0the cost of living is\u00a0the thing they are most worried about.\nWatch why some Canadians say they're worried about the cost of living:\nIn a lot of ways, that makes sense, according to Donald.\u00a0\nThe broader economy\u00a0is\u00a0performing well,\u00a0but many Canadians still struggle:\u00a0Housing affordability is still at crisis levels in Toronto and Vancouver,\u00a0energy prices remain stubbornly low,\u00a0and child-care costs weigh heavily on families.\n\"So while the data,\u00a0as a whole, still looks fairly solid,\" said\u00a0Donald,\u00a0\"it's completely understandable,\u00a0even from someone who spends all day looking at numbers,\u00a0... why consumers and households might be feeling a little bit nervous.\"\nWhat's more, concern about the cost of living ranked as the top worry for every segment of Canadians polled:\u00a0Indigenous Canadians, new Canadians, first-time voters and visible minorities.\nWhile just one in 10 Canadians say they're not getting by financially, another 68 per cent say they \"have to think about how they spend money.\" And concern over jobs ranks seventh\u00a0in terms of what worries Canadians the most.\u00a0\nIt's easy to understand where those concerns come from. Debt\u00a0levels remain high. Wages are finally beginning to rise, but growth has been stubbornly low for decades.\nStill, an honest accounting of the data shows that that negative perception doesn't quite match the economic reality.\nWhen asked to rank their top three most important election issues, a full 35 per cent\u00a0of Canadians polled listed\u00a0\"jobs/the economy.\" But Canada has been posting record job creation. The Canadian economy added 27,000 jobs in May, and\u00a0in April, a stunning 106,500 jobs were added.\u00a0In all, nearly half a million jobs were added over the past 12 months.\nWage\u00a0growth is also coming in above inflation, meaning Canadians are seeing their wages rise faster than the cost of the things we buy, from food to gasoline.\nWhat's more, many of the jobs being added are high-paying tech and financial services jobs.\n\"If you look at the period over the last decade or so, where\u00a0we've seen this kind of restructuring away from high-paid manufacturing jobs, we've seen almost as many jobs created in this [other] segment of the economy, this professional services segment,\" said Antunes.\nThe CBC poll also found that 54 per cent\u00a0of respondents worry\u00a0that accepting too many immigrants would change Canada\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but economists say that change is much needed,\u00a0specifically on the jobs front.\n\"Let's just take a look at where labour markets are today,\" said\u00a0Antunes. \"We\u00a0have an unemployment rate that's at 5.4 per cent. According to some estimates, that's as low as it can get.\"\nCanada, he said,\u00a0is essentially at \"rock bottom on the employment rate.\"\nThe Conference Board of Canada recently released a report highlighting the need for more immigration.\n\"There's no doubt about it that immigration will contribute to the\u00a0labour force,\" said Antunes.\u00a0\"When you talk to employers in many parts of this country, [they're] desperate to find skilled and less skilled workers, and immigration is going to be a big part of solving that gap.\"\nThat kind of disconnect appears throughout perceptions around\u00a0the economy\u00a0\u2014\u00a0whether it's jobs,\u00a0trade wars,\u00a0exports or oil prices. Exacerbating that is the fact that Canada isn't just one singular economy, said Donald.\u00a0Rather, it's a sort of a patchwork of regional and sector-based economies.\n\"The economy is\u00a0\u2014 and feels \u2014 different depending on which province you're in,\" she said.\u00a0\"We have the energy patch, we have urban areas that are being driven predominantly by housing activity,\u00a0and then we have other key cities and rural areas that are swayed by neither of those two factors.\"\nEconomic anxiety also becomes amplified by global oil prices and international trade tensions. Canada alone doesn't have much influence in changing those.\u00a0But both feed into the notion that the economy is struggling, no matter what the data says.\nBut if you can look past the\u00a0anecdotal evidence\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a hard feat for everyone, no doubt\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you'll find an economy performing pretty well.

For more information about our commentary section, please read this\u00a0editor's blog\u00a0and\u00a0our FAQ.\nPremier Jason Kenney is fluent in both of Canada's official languages. Yet he can't seem to communicate with Alberta's teachers.\nThat became evident this week when Kenney and the Alberta Teachers' Association (ATA) butted heads yet again over the government's investment arm, the Alberta Investment Management Corporation, commonly known as AIMCo.\nThe government is forcing the teachers' $18-billion pension fund, the aptly named Alberta Teachers' Retirement Fund (ATRF), to use AIMCo as its sole investment manager rather than invest with any manager it chooses. AIMCo manages $119 billion in assets, including the pension funds for 375,000 public sector workers, as well as the Alberta Heritage Savings Fund.\nKenney has said rolling the teachers' pension fund under AIMCo's management will save teachers $20 million a year in premiums, increase the scale of AIMCo's portfolio \"to invest prudently in a larger class of assets,\" and\u00a0generate better returns for the fund.\nThe ATA is not happy. It hasn't been happy about this since last fall when the government passed Bill 22 forcing the ATRF funds under the AIMCo umbrella.\nThe ATA has a long list of reasons to stay clear of AIMCo: the ATRF has been doing a perfectly good job managing the fund for the past 80 years; the Kenney government unilaterally made the decision without first asking the 46,000-member teachers' association what it thought; and the ATA is suspicious of pretty much everything the Kenney government does.\nAnd this week, another reason: AIMCo reportedly lost a whopping $4 billion in the pandemic-hammered stock markets. The story was first reported in the New York-based magazine, Institutional Investor, that called the AIMCo investment strategy a \"blunder.\"\nThe magazine pointed out that although \"Canada boasts some of the world's most sophisticated and best-performing public investment funds ... AIMCo is not among that top tier, experts and data suggest.\"\nI don't think anybody at AIMCo will be printing out the Institutional Investor article to send home to mom.\n\"For example, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan delivered 9.8 per cent annualized over the last decade, whereas AIMCo gained 8.2 per cent \u2014 a gap of more than 1.5 percentage points per year,\" said the article. \"Even within its own province, AIMCo has trailed the smaller Alberta Teachers' Retirement Fund.\"\nFortunately for the teachers' fund, its $18 billion in assets have not yet been placed into AIMCo's portfolio. That transition is still underway as both sides work out details. But the ATA, rattled by the AIMCo blunder, wants Kenney to reverse course.\n\"Teachers invest their own money into their pension plan,\" said ATA president Jason Schilling. \"Teachers were not consulted on the takeover and this story further validates our concerns. I am calling on the Government of Alberta to finally listen to teachers and stop the takeover by repealing Bill 22.\"\nWhen I asked Kenney during a news conference Wednesday if he'll listen to Schilling or transfer control to AIMCo, Kenney seized on the word \"control\" and ducked down a rabbit hole.\n\"No, we were never going to transfer control to AIMCo. The premise of your question is completely unfactual,\" he said, setting us up for a Kenneysian lecture.\nKenney said the ATRF board will continue to be the governing authority and AIMCo \"would simply act as the investment agency for the board as it does for every other public pension fund in Alberta.\"\nThat sounds innocent enough, except for a couple of glaring issues.\nFor one, those other public pension funds are handcuffed to AIMCo. They don't have the freedom to take their money and find a manager that doesn't make billion-dollar blunders.\nAs for teachers, Schilling said the final decision on investing their money will be made by AIMCo, not the teachers' retirement fund board.\n\"What's being transferred from the Alberta Teachers' Retirement Fund to AIMCo is the control of the investment management,\" said Schilling. \"There will still be an ATRF board. The board can give suggestions to AIMCo, in terms of investment management strategies, but they don't always have to follow it. And this is the problem teachers have with this transfer.\"\nKenney did point out correctly that the teachers' pension benefits are protected under law, even if the pension fund should take a financial hit. But Schilling said if AIMCo lost, say, $4 billion of the teachers' fund, teachers still on the job would likely see their pension contributions increase to help make up the deficit.\n(We don't know yet if the ATRF has lost money during the pandemic crisis. A statement on its webpage said, \"while we can't avoid losses when the market falls as it did in March, we structure the portfolio to avoid making a bad situation worse when it does happen.\"\nA Globe and Mail article this week said while the average Canadian pension plan lost 8.7 per cent of its value in the first three months of this year, \"AIMCo is expected to be down far more than this.\")\nThe NDP, not surprisingly, has happily jumped into this controversy.\nNew Democrat MLA Christina Gray has tabled a private member's bill that would reverse Bill 22 as well as give other public pension funds under AIMCo's umbrella the freedom to find other investment managers, if they so choose.\nBill 203 is purely symbolic, of course, in the face of the United Conservative Party's majority government.\nKenney seems not to understand the teachers' concerns. Or, perhaps more accurately, he understands perfectly well what they're saying but has turned a deaf ear.\n"}, {"author": "Kathleen Harris", "title": "Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau tests positive for coronavirus", "description": "PM to begin 14 days of isolation, has no symptoms", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid19-trudeau-premiers-coronavirus-1.5495001", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5496324.1584081796!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/year-diary-20191210.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 12, 2020 11:13 AM ET", "2020-03-13T10:44:15.182Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The prime minister's wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus and will remain in isolation, his office said Thursday.\n\"She is feeling well, is taking all the recommended precautions and her symptoms remain mild,\" the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau \"is in good health with no symptoms,\" the PMO said, adding that he will follow the advice of doctors and stay in isolation for 14 days.

From July until December of this year,\u00a0output cuts will continue at 7.7 million bpd, and 5.8 million bpd for the 16 months after that.\nThe so-called OPEC+ countries agreed to have Mexico reduce its daily output by 100,000 barrels only for those two months, which had been a sticking point for the accord. The pact came after a marathon video conference\u00a0between officials from 23 nations.

Consumption has dropped by an estimated 30 million bpd.\nTrump had threatened OPEC leader Saudi Arabia with oil tariffs and other measures if it did not fix the market's oversupply problem. Low prices have put the U.S. oil industry, the world's largest, in severe distress.\nOPEC+ has said it wanted producers outside the group, such as the United States, Canada, Brazil and Norway, to cut a further five\u00a0per cent,\u00a0or five\u00a0million bpd.\u00a0\nCanada and Norway had signalled their willingness to cut, but as of Friday, Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan had said Canada had\u00a0yet to promise any specific production cuts.\nAlberta, Canada's biggest oil-producing region, \"has already formerly curtailed 80,000 barrels per day,\" O'Regan said.\n\"This is good.

We still have a larger issue.\"\nThe United States, where legislation makes it hard to act in tandem with cartels such as OPEC, said its output would fall steeply by itself this year due to low prices.\nMexico had initially blocked the deal but its president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, had said Friday that he had agreed with Trump that the U.S. will compensate what Mexico cannot add to the proposed cuts.\n\"The United States will help Mexico along and they'll reimburse us sometime at later date when they're prepared to do so,\" Trump said at a White House press briefing Friday.\nKarl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto, said in a release that while the deal\u00a0was historic, challenges remain\u00a0\u2014 such as the capacity of storage facilities before the deal begins, and questions about what enforcement mechanisms will apply to nations who renege on the agreement.\u00a0\n\"Perhaps most importantly, economic conditions continue to worsen on a global basis, with shutdowns extending, trade flatlining, and unemployment levels surging to historic levels. Demand declines may outpace any production cuts, leaving storage facilities to continue filling,\" he wrote.\nA 15 per cent\u00a0cut in supply might not be enough to arrest the global price decline, banks Goldman Sachs and UBS predicted last week, saying Brent prices would fall back to $20 US per barrel from $32 at the moment, and $70 at the start of the year.\nAs Asian markets reopened Monday local time, West Texas Intermediate\u00a0crude\u00a0was trading at\u00a0$22 US per barrel.\nAlberta Premier Jason Kenney\u00a0said on Twitter Sunday that while there are challenging months ahead, the deal puts the sector on a path to recovery.\n\"We are glad to see sanity return to global oil markets.

For Ann Hodges, that moment arrived on November 30, 1954, at precisely 1:46 p.m., while she was lying on the couch. It wasn't so much an epiphany as a painful reality that struck her that day, when a lime-green \"cosmic missile\" streaked across the clear afternoon sky, crashed through her roof, bounced off a console radio, and flew smack into the side of her body.\u00a0\nAs the only known person to be hit by a meteorite, Ann became an instant sensation. By nightfall, hundreds of people, including the national news media, descended upon her backyard, snapping photos of the extraterrestrial object, checking out the damage to her house, and looking in awe and horror at the jet-black, football-sized bruise the impact left on her hip.\u00a0\nBecause she was napping, Ann had slept through the fireball's spectacular descent. Witnesses saw it blaze across three states; TVs began scrambling from the alien interference; and the sonic boom jolted a boy right off his bike more than one hundred kilometres away, in Montgomery, Alabama. As for the locals, when the shooting star finally hit ground zero in the town of Sylacauga, most of them thought they'd heard a plane crash or an exploding bomb.\u00a0\nAfter a few weeks, though, as with all freak accidents, the buzz died down. The reporters packed up and went home and the neighbours returned to their daily lives. And while the meteorite\u00a0certainly made an impression on everyone that day, only one person's cosmic perspective was forever changed. For Ann Hodges, the universe, with its meteors and comet showers and supernovas, was no longer a separate place somewhere \"out there.\" Oh, no. The cosmos could come right into your house, if it wanted to, and slap you wide awake.\nFar from being idyllic and tranquil, the heavens are hell. You've got your raging flames, your choking plumes of poisonous gas; darkness, chaos, and violent destruction are pretty much everywhere. In fact, if you look up into the sky tonight in the direction of Sagittarius, just above the archer's arrow, there's a supermassive black hole in our galaxy that is, at this very moment, obliterating everything within its horizon.\nThat's the universe we live in. But it's not the way it feels. That you and I are relatively calm right now, that we aren't in a raw panic at the total and utter mayhem that dangles right above our heads, is because we live in a bubble, a physical one called the atmosphere. From space, this dome is clearly visible. It's a thin, bluish-white film that acts like a planetary force field: it blocks out lethal radiation, maintains temperatures within a tiny range (compared to the extremes of space), and incinerates most of the meteors that would otherwise pulverize the surface of Earth.\u00a0\nAs human beings, we all live inside another kind of bubble as well: a psychological one that shapes our ideas about the everyday world. This is our \"reality bubble.\" Just as rocks hurtling at supersonic speed find it hard to penetrate Earth's atmosphere, unwelcome facts and unfamiliar ideas almost never make it through the membrane of the reality bubble. It shields us from thinking about forces \"out there\" that are seemingly beyond our control and lets us get on with the business of our lives.\u00a0\nBut problems arise with inflated certainty, and we see it over\u00a0and over again. Whether it's real estate bubbles, or stock market bubbles, or political bubbles, being in a bubble means, by definition, that we've got a warped perception of reality. And in the end, all bubbles share the same fate: inevitably, they burst.\nSo we might do well to remember that even our most stable conceptions of the world can be overturned. For over two centuries, the universe was understood to be governed by Newtonian physics, and then Einstein came along. But it doesn't always take a genius to expand our view of the world.

It's so interesting to realize how much money you spend that you really don't need to.\"\nMany Canadians have an opportunity to get a new perspective on their finances during the COVID-19 crisis, but the question is whether reduced spending will be a temporary blip caused by the lockdown, or whether consumers\u00a0will start thinking twice about some of their\u00a0purchases once the country reopens for business.\nGrocery bills are definitely higher for most people, as everyone is eating at home during the lockdown. But that represents a net savings for those who are doing their own cooking and not ordering in frequently. Homemade meals cost far less than restaurant food.\nA survey done by Statistics Canada in early April found that while close to 30 per cent of respondents said COVID-19 affects their ability to meet financial obligations, almost 50 per cent reported only a minor impact or none at all.\nSome Canadians are actually better positioned to meet their financial obligations during the pandemic.\nFor example,\u00a0many people\u00a0are driving less often, and when they do, they benefit from the current low price of gasoline. Some insurance companies are even giving rebates.\nSome people are also saving money if they normally use public transit to travel to their workplace but are now working from home.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, discretionary spending on visits to nail salons, barber shops, travel, and concert or theatre tickets is no longer an option.\nThose closures are creating hard times for countless small businesses, as well as those who work in Canada's oilpatch.\nGursh Singh, an online manager with Credit Canada Debt Solutions, a not-for-profit credit counselling service, says the agency has seen a recent\u00a0increase in clients trying to position themselves to better manage their finances.\n\"We're speaking to Canadians who are using this time to take proactive measures regarding their debt and finances,\" she said.\nSome are looking for more affordable ways to manage their debt, while others are sorting out negative items on their credit report, she said.\nOfficial retail sales figures for Canada won't be available for some time, so RBC economists used the bank's proprietary spending data to create a snapshot of how the COVID-19 pandemic has altered Canadian consumption. The bank's COVID Consumer Spending Tracker concludes that credit card spending fell approximately 60 per cent in the week that ended March 30 compared to the same period a year ago.\nBut beyond the forced frugality of a lockdown situation, the reluctance\u00a0to spend could also be related to fears of a recession or even a depression ahead. The International Monetary Fund says that \"as a result of the pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply ... much worse than during the 2008\u201309 financial crisis.\"\nMax Miller, the financial services worker in Toronto,\u00a0said he plans to put his newfound savings to good use.\n\"I might put a little bit more toward the mortgage than I typically would, or I'm putting money into investments.\"\nIt remains to be seen whether this more restrained spending on the part of many consumers is a trend with any staying power. Canadians have grown accustomed to borrowing heavily to finance homes, cars, trips, and credit card payments.\nIn March, Statistics Canada reported that Canadian households owe an average of $1.76 for every dollar of disposable income. In other words, we spend and borrow almost double what we make. The Bank of Canada has been warning consumers about high levels of indebtedness for years, often citing the situation as a risk to the nation's overall economic health.\nDimitry Anastakis, the chair of business history at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, said attitudes toward money are \"generational,\" and that many people who lived through the Second World War, or perhaps had parents who lived through the Great Depression, became savers.\n\"They had that instinctive response built into them, in reaction to what was basically 20 years of economic insecurity,\" he said.\nBut the attitudes of baby boomers, gen Xers and millennials have been shaped by different circumstances, and many think of themselves more as consumers than citizens, he said.\n\"The baby boomers and all those that followed are not savers,\" he said. \"Their identities are caught up in what they wear, what they buy and what cars they drive. This is the consequence of an economic system that is geared toward credit and debt, rather than saving.\"\nAnastakis says consumer behaviour following the Great Depression and the Second World War suggests Canadians are likely to return to their previous spending habits quickly, once there is a vaccine for COVID-19, and this fearful period ends.\n\"Historically, that's always what's happened,\" he said. \"When we've returned to normal, we've spent even more. We've been more consumptive. It's a relief, 'Oh we can spend again.'\"\nMax Miller said he tracks all his monthly expenses with an Excel spreadsheet.\n\"I have a very accurate picture of my finances at all times \u2014 probably excessively,\" he said with a laugh.\nThe lockdown has cut out many of the regular expenses he and his girlfriend make, such as socializing in bars and restaurants and taking Uber rides, but he expects that won't continue once the city starts opening back up.\n\"I anticipate all of my expenses after the quarantine to go back up to the usual amounts,\" he said.\u00a0\nWhile that may not be ideal from a personal finance perspective, there's no question it will be good for the overall economy.\nConsumer spending typically accounts for 70 per cent of all economic activity; indeed, it's what drove the rise of prosperity and stock market gains of the past decade, following the financial crisis of 2008.\nWATCH | How Canadians across the country are helping each other through the pandemic:\nBut this historic chapter of a\u00a0radically changed business environment could offer a lesson to many Canadians, about how to view our spending habits.\nThat's how Winnipeg's Jo-ann Trunzo sees it.\n\"This seems like a good time to separate needs from wants.\"\n"}, {"author": "CBC Books", "title": "Read an excerpt from RBC Taylor Prize finalist The Reality Bubble by Ziya Tong", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/books/read-an-excerpt-from-rbc-taylor-prize-finalist-the-reality-bubble-by-ziya-tong-1.5475628", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5143290.1558450775!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/the-reality-bubble-by-ziya-tong.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 26, 2020 10:04 AM ET", "2020-02-26T15:04:59.641Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Reality Bubble\u00a0by science journalist Ziya Tong is a finalist for the 2020 RBC Taylor Prize.\nThe $30,000 prize recognizes the best in Canadian literary nonfiction.\nIn\u00a0The Reality Bubble,\u00a0Tong reminds readers that the human eye pales in comparison to what animals with infrared, ultraviolet and 360-degree vision can see.

But in a\u00a0health and economic crisis unlike anything we have experienced before, the landscape is constantly changing.\nWATCH | Modelling suggests we're in it for the long haul:\n\"The thing is, we're working with the best evidence that we have at the time,\" said infectious disease specialist Sumon Chakrabarty on CBC\u00a0Radio's The Current last week.\nOn Friday, recession arbiter, the C.D.Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council, declared that Canada is officially in a recession. Growth figures from February released last week showed the economy was already slowing even before the Canadian lockdown had begun.\nEchoing Chakrabarty's comments on the medical outlook, the newly appointed next head of Canada's central bank, Tiff Macklem, took a similar stance from the economic point of view.\n\"The bank has to be humble about what it doesn't know,\" he said, responding to reporters' questions on Friday in an empty auditorium.\nAnd as events unfold, Macklem warned that the Bank of Canada's economists will be forced to forecast based on a range of possible outcomes that will probably change over time.\n\"The Bank of Canada has tremendous analytic economic financial capacity to analyze what's going on in the economy, and I think an important role for the Bank of Canada is to provide Canadians with as much information as it can honestly provide,\" said Macklem, \"recognizing that\u00a0we're probably going to have to look at more than one scenario.\"\nJust as the World Health Organization and Canada's Chief Public Health Officer\u00a0Dr. Theresa Tam have been accused of getting it wrong at first and changing their prescriptions to fight the virus, economic policy is taking plenty of flack as well.\nEconomists at commercial and retail banks have been chided for underestimating the severity of the effect of the pandemic on the economy.\nThe federal government has had to update its policy of economic support as each new group complained that it had been left out or shortchanged. Even then, existing plans face new criticism, such as from employers concerned that the support package means workers would rather stay home than take the jobs they offer.\nAs governments expand borrowing to pour money into the economy, no one is sure what the long-term effects will be. Some worry about deflation; others, inflation.\nSimilar to the events of the Great Recession in 2008, some critics worry attempts by central banks to flood capital markets with cash to avoid systemic failures are employing public funds to artificially boost the price of stocks, adding to the wealth of stockholders who are already better off.\nBut even if the medium- and long-term uncertainty remains for both the illness and the economy, fresh data this week will give a firmer grip on what is happening in the present.\nTomorrow's trade figures are for March, so they will give a fresher perspective than last week's GDP numbers, likely revealing how a slowdown caused by our trade partners in Asia and Europe transformed into a domestic logjam as the virus hit home.\nBut Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey report for the month of April will be the freshest economic data of all.\nAlthough Friday jobs numbers are likely to be bad, representing the first full month of the lockdown, there's a bright side. As provincial economies experiment with reopening businesses and sending employees back to work, there is a chance that this week's lows will represent a nadir. Of course, all bets will be off if it turns out we have opened up too soon, or if frustrated Canadians cause a new outbreak by mingling too quickly.\nAs our next Bank of Canada governor pointed out, at a time like this optimism is good. So long as it is tempered by realism.\n\"There is certainly a fairly optimistic scenario, that when you think of this as a natural disaster \u2014\u00a0as we recover from the natural disaster, the economy bounces back fairly quickly,\" said Macklem, who is current dean of the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\n\"But clearly, there are downside risks against that scenario.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U.S. Fed says monetary policy will remain 'non-political' after Trump-Powell meeting", "description": "Trump summons Fed chairman to White House to discuss economy, interest rates", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-powell-meeting-1.5363766", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5363780.1574106281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/federal-reserve-trump.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 18, 2019 3:08 PM ET", "2019-11-18T20:08:49.361Z"], "source": null, "content": "President Donald Trump summoned Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to the White House on Monday to discuss the economy and interest rates \u2014 issues on which Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed.\nThe Fed said in a statement that Powell's message to Trump during their meeting was similar to the one he expressed in congressional testimony last week, when he said that the economy is in good shape and that the Fed would likely suspend its rate cuts for now. The central bank has cut its benchmark short-term rate three times this year to try to support the economy.\nMonday's meeting could fuel concerns that the White House is intensifying public pressure on Powell, who was Trump's own choice to lead the Fed, to cut rates more aggressively.\nAs an independent agency, the Fed has long been seen as needing to remain free of political pressure to properly manage interest rate policy. Though other presidents occasionally sought to push the central bank toward rate cuts, they typically did so privately.\n\"Finally, Chair Powell said that he and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective and non-political analysis,\" the Reserve said in its statement.\nMost economists say they think Powell will continue to resist Trump's pressure. Some regard the chairman as more politically agile than some of his predecessors, such as Ben Bernanke.\n\"I don't see evidence of political pressure having any impact on Powell,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, an economist at Oxford Economics.\nPowell regularly meets with members of Congress from both parties. During two hearings last week, lawmakers sounded largely supportive and respectful of the Fed's independence.\nDemocrat Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, criticized Trump ib Twitter for trying to \"intimidate the Federal Reserve in a way Presidents have never done.\"\n\"Kudos to Chair Powell for resisting Trump's bullying,\" said Pascrell.\nFor months, Trump has regularly assailed Powell's leadership and for not cutting rates as much as the president would like. Trump has called Fed officials \"boneheads\" and has asserted that the economy and stock market would be performing better if rates were lower or even negative as in Europe and Japan.\nTrump tweeted Monday that his meeting with Powell was \"very good and cordial.\" He added that he and the Fed chairman discussed \"interest rates, negative interest, low inflation, easing, Dollar strength and its effect on manufacturing, trade with China, E.U. and others, etc.\"\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also attended the meeting, the Fed said.\nPresidents often meet with Fed chairs to discuss the economy. But the stakes are much higher when the backdrop is Trump's frequent attacks on the Fed and its chairman.\nMonday's meeting was at least the second since Trump elevated Powell to the chairman's post in 2018. In February this year, the two had dinner at the White House. At that dinner, they discussed the state of the economy as well as the Super Bowl and Tiger Woods' golf game, Mnuchin said then.\nTrump has complained that negative rates, which have been put in place by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, have left the United States, with its higher rates, at a competitive disadvantage. The Fed's benchmark rate is in a range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent, an extremely low level by historic standards, particularly given that the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low of 3.6 per cent.\nIn a speech last week, Trump said, referring to negative interest, \"Give me some of that.... I want some of that money. Our Federal Reserve doesn't let us do it.\"\nThe Fed's relatively high benchmark rate, compared with the negative rates overseas, probably does keep the dollar at a higher value compared with the euro and yen. That, in turn, can make U.S. exports more expensive overseas.\nStill, the vast majority of mainstream economists oppose the notion of deploying negative rates for the U.S. economy, which is healthier and is growing faster than its European and Japanese counterparts.\nNegative rates are typically a sign that an economy is struggling. Many U.S. economists have expressed skepticism that negative rates help accelerate growth and argue that they would cause problems unique to the U.S. financial markets.\nFar more Americans, for example, stash savings in money-market funds than savers overseas. Those funds seek to keep their shares equal to $1. Negative rates could cause more of those funds to fall below $1, or \"break the buck,\" which last occurred during the financial crisis a decade ago and fuelled panic among investors.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Get informed on the top stories of the day in one quick scan", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/morning-brief-march-16-2020-1.5498832", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 16, 2020 6:38 AM ET", "2020-03-16T14:10:00.916Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Good morning!

Some are offering to pick up and deliver supplies for seniors and others who can't do it for themselves.  Kari Hollend set up a similar group in Toronto:\u00a0How can I help COVID 19 Toronto.\u00a0Her original intent was to help people in the film industry, which is specifically hard hit. The amount of support within the group is astounding, she said. \"In dark times, what's always amazing is to see the solidarity, and people wanting to help each other,\" Hollend said.

Out loud and somewhat unexpectedly, she said she would give two years of her life to stand in front of an orchestra and \"wave my hands\" as a conductor. She expected the person she had just told, a violinist for the ballet orchestra, to laugh. \"He turned toward me and said, 'Why don't you become a conductor for ballet? You are a dancer and we all know you are playing piano here every day until midnight,'\" she said.

It's so interesting to realize how much money you spend that you really don't need to.\"\nMany Canadians have an opportunity to get a new perspective on their finances during the COVID-19 crisis, but the question is whether reduced spending will be a temporary blip caused by the lockdown, or whether consumers\u00a0will start thinking twice about some of their\u00a0purchases once the country reopens for business.\nGrocery bills are definitely higher for most people, as everyone is eating at home during the lockdown. But that represents a net savings for those who are doing their own cooking and not ordering in frequently. Homemade meals cost far less than restaurant food.\nA survey done by Statistics Canada in early April found that while close to 30 per cent of respondents said COVID-19 affects their ability to meet financial obligations, almost 50 per cent reported only a minor impact or none at all.\nSome Canadians are actually better positioned to meet their financial obligations during the pandemic.\nFor example,\u00a0many people\u00a0are driving less often, and when they do, they benefit from the current low price of gasoline. Some insurance companies are even giving rebates.\nSome people are also saving money if they normally use public transit to travel to their workplace but are now working from home.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, discretionary spending on visits to nail salons, barber shops, travel, and concert or theatre tickets is no longer an option.\nThose closures are creating hard times for countless small businesses, as well as those who work in Canada's oilpatch.\nGursh Singh, an online manager with Credit Canada Debt Solutions, a not-for-profit credit counselling service, says the agency has seen a recent\u00a0increase in clients trying to position themselves to better manage their finances.\n\"We're speaking to Canadians who are using this time to take proactive measures regarding their debt and finances,\" she said.\nSome are looking for more affordable ways to manage their debt, while others are sorting out negative items on their credit report, she said.\nOfficial retail sales figures for Canada won't be available for some time, so RBC economists used the bank's proprietary spending data to create a snapshot of how the COVID-19 pandemic has altered Canadian consumption. The bank's COVID Consumer Spending Tracker concludes that credit card spending fell approximately 60 per cent in the week that ended March 30 compared to the same period a year ago.\nBut beyond the forced frugality of a lockdown situation, the reluctance\u00a0to spend could also be related to fears of a recession or even a depression ahead. The International Monetary Fund says that \"as a result of the pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply ... much worse than during the 2008\u201309 financial crisis.\"\nMax Miller, the financial services worker in Toronto,\u00a0said he plans to put his newfound savings to good use.\n\"I might put a little bit more toward the mortgage than I typically would, or I'm putting money into investments.\"\nIt remains to be seen whether this more restrained spending on the part of many consumers is a trend with any staying power. Canadians have grown accustomed to borrowing heavily to finance homes, cars, trips, and credit card payments.\nIn March, Statistics Canada reported that Canadian households owe an average of $1.76 for every dollar of disposable income. In other words, we spend and borrow almost double what we make. The Bank of Canada has been warning consumers about high levels of indebtedness for years, often citing the situation as a risk to the nation's overall economic health.\nDimitry Anastakis, the chair of business history at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, said attitudes toward money are \"generational,\" and that many people who lived through the Second World War, or perhaps had parents who lived through the Great Depression, became savers.\n\"They had that instinctive response built into them, in reaction to what was basically 20 years of economic insecurity,\" he said.\nBut the attitudes of baby boomers, gen Xers and millennials have been shaped by different circumstances, and many think of themselves more as consumers than citizens, he said.\n\"The baby boomers and all those that followed are not savers,\" he said. \"Their identities are caught up in what they wear, what they buy and what cars they drive. This is the consequence of an economic system that is geared toward credit and debt, rather than saving.\"\nAnastakis says consumer behaviour following the Great Depression and the Second World War suggests Canadians are likely to return to their previous spending habits quickly, once there is a vaccine for COVID-19, and this fearful period ends.\n\"Historically, that's always what's happened,\" he said. \"When we've returned to normal, we've spent even more. We've been more consumptive. It's a relief, 'Oh we can spend again.'\"\nMax Miller said he tracks all his monthly expenses with an Excel spreadsheet.\n\"I have a very accurate picture of my finances at all times \u2014 probably excessively,\" he said with a laugh.\nThe lockdown has cut out many of the regular expenses he and his girlfriend make, such as socializing in bars and restaurants and taking Uber rides, but he expects that won't continue once the city starts opening back up.\n\"I anticipate all of my expenses after the quarantine to go back up to the usual amounts,\" he said.\u00a0\nWhile that may not be ideal from a personal finance perspective, there's no question it will be good for the overall economy.\nConsumer spending typically accounts for 70 per cent of all economic activity; indeed, it's what drove the rise of prosperity and stock market gains of the past decade, following the financial crisis of 2008.\nWATCH | How Canadians across the country are helping each other through the pandemic:\nBut this historic chapter of a\u00a0radically changed business environment could offer a lesson to many Canadians, about how to view our spending habits.\nThat's how Winnipeg's Jo-ann Trunzo sees it.\n\"This seems like a good time to separate needs from wants.\"\n"}, {"author": "Peter Armstrong", "title": "When it comes to personal finances, most Canadian voters have the same concerns", "description": "Canada is a vast and diverse country, but data shows many of us are facing similar economic challenges", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/election-voters-canadians-concerns-1.5280947", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5112658.1566856660!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fiscal-monitor-20190426.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 15, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-15T15:46:17.570Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Over the course of this election, political parties will spend tens of millions of dollars targeting voters. They'll try to convince you they're just like you. They're worried about the same things you are and hopeful about the same things, too.\nBut how much do we Canadians really know about one another?\nIn an economy driven by resources and banking, it would be easy to think the most common jobs are working oil rigs or in finance.\nBut as the graphic below shows, retail salesperson\u00a0tops the list of most common jobs for women, and is second on the list for men, behind only truck driver.\nWe are a nation of consumers, after all.\nRetail salespeople, truck drivers and cashiers\u00a0are all jobs being targeted by automation. That may help explain why there's so much economic anxiety in Canada right now. Some of the most common jobs in the country are set to be replaced, or at least fundamentally altered, in the not-too-distant future.\u00a0\nAnd even if your job isn't under threat by automation, many people in Canada are pessimistic about\u00a0their long-term prospects. According to a recent CBC poll, the thing most Canadians are concerned about is the\u00a0cost of living.\u00a0\nAt a macro level, the Canadian economy is doing well. Perhaps not great, but certainly not bad. Jobs are being added in droves and GDP growth has come in well above expectations. But that economic expansion is patchy at best. GDP forecasts for\u00a0B.C. and Newfoundland and Labrador\u00a0are in a different stratosphere than those for\u00a0Alberta and New Brunswick.\nPerhaps our biggest concern is debt. Canadians owe record amounts of money. The national debt-to-income ratio is a staggering 177 per cent. For every dollar we earn, we owe $1.77. That debt keeps Canadians up at night and has a real impact on their quality of life.\u00a0\nOver the course of any election you will hear nearly endless appeals to the middle class. An\u00a0Environics poll from 2012\u00a0famously found that 93 per cent of Canadians believe they're in the middle class.\nThe median household income in Canada is\u00a0$70,675 (that's household, not individual).\nAnd yes, the economy is in the midst of a 10-year expansion. Since the end of the 2008 financial crisis, stock markets have rebounded considerably and corporate profits have bounced back.\nBut wages have remained stubbornly flat. So, the economic benefits have largely gone to\u00a0shareholders, not workers.\nWages are finally showing some signs of life. Canadian wage growth in July came in at 4.5 per cent\u00a0and remained high in August, at 3.7 per cent. But there's a big gap to close when looking at who has benefited since the financial crisis of 2008.\nElections are supposed to be a chance to bring the country together and decide how to proceed on the important issues of our day. But that's incredibly hard to do well when we're all wrapped up in our own little bubbles.

per cent tariff on Chinese goods starting next month, and have decided to temporarily exclude things like computers, game consoles, some toys and clothes from the punitive measure.\nThe United States Trade Representative (USTR) said it has removed a number of items from the list of products that\u00a0will be subject to a 10 per cent tariff as of Sept.\u00a01, while delaying\u00a0the implementation of the tariff on others.\nThe list of products that will see the tariff delayed includes \"computers, video game consoles, certain toys, computer monitors, and certain items of footwear and clothing,\" coming from China and bound for the United States.\nInstead of facing a levy as of next month, the tariff on\u00a0those items won't be implemented until mid-December. Not all technology products got the reprieve, however. Smart watches, fitness trackers, smart speakers,\u00a0Bluetooth headphones and other portable devices will be hit as planned.\nInvestors took the decision as a sign of progress in trade negotiations, since a December implementation gives the two sides more than enough time to hammer out a wide-ranging trade deal to finally put their issues aside once and for all.\nPaul Gardner, partner and portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management, said the market views the softer tariff plan as a major concession on Trump's part.\n\"There's almost a feeling that the U.S. administration blinked,\" he said. \"They didn't go with their threats.\"\nHe also said timing the tariffs on toys and electronics\u00a0to not be implemented for another few months is clearly designed to allow shoppers to not feel the higher prices until after the key holiday shopping season in December.\n\"He probably got a lot of pressure from Senate and Congress and he wanted to delay that until after Christmas,\" Gardner said.\nThe tariffs have been overhanging the world's economy since Aug.\u00a01 when U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted he wanted to put another 10 per cent tariff on another $300 billion\u00a0US worth of Chinese imports. Previous tariffs were very targeted on some sectors, but the latest tariff move would have hiked prices on a wide variety of cheap consumer goods that U.S. shoppers buy from China en masse.\nIn addition to the tariff delay on some items, the USTR says other products will be completely exempt \"based on health, safety, national security and other factors.\"\nStock markets cheered the development, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping 500 points or almost two per cent from Monday's close.\nThe broader S&P 500 was up by roughly the same amount in percentage terms, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fared even better, up 185 points\u00a0or 2.35 per cent to 8,050. That's largely because huge technology companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google stand to benefit from not having tariffs on imported technology products.\nDavid Madden, market analyst\u00a0at CMC Markets, said the market rally makes sense, given that\u00a0\"the easing up of hostilities between the U.S. and China has been a welcome change to the doom and gloom of the past few days.\"\nInvestors are taking the move as a sign of optimism for negotiations, but there may be far more self-serving\u00a0factors at play.\nKarl Schamotta, market strategist at\u00a0Cambridge Global Payments, says the move is clearly designed \"to alleviate pressure on American consumers as they head into a critical holiday-punctuated election season.\"\n\"Although clearly taken with the aim of furthering political objectives, the decision to postpone additional tariffs on China will be encouraging news for global markets \u2014\u00a0but may be too little, too late.\"\nMike Loewengart, vice-president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial in New York, said that while the\u00a0tariff news on Tuesday is a positive, it could also be a sign of a long road ahead.\n\"All indications are that China is gearing up for a protracted dispute while expectations in the U.S. are for a much quicker resolution.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "COVID-19 unknowns leave economy dazed and wobbly: Don Pittis", "description": "It is certain the world will recover, but doubts remain over when and how", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-economy-paralysis-1.5499388", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5499595.1584392173!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus-new-york.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 17, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-17T09:49:27.519Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Paralysis is not supposed to be one of the symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus sweeping the world.\nBut drastic action by the world's central banks \u2014\u00a0the \"bazooka\" as German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz\u00a0labelled it, a term quickly adopted by the financial\u00a0media \u2014 has left economic actors stunned and immobilized.\nAs markets continue to\u00a0gyrate and tumble\u00a0there is increasing evidence that even free money, now being offered at nearly zero per cent, is simply not enough to reassure the world facing an inscrutable\u00a0future.\nEvidence of that paralysis came from close to home yesterday.\nWhile the headline from the Canadian Real Estate Association's monthly release boasted of a resurging property market, far more revealing was what the group's economists said about the future.\n\"As providers of the most accurate and timely housing data and statistics, CREA cannot credibly update its quarterly forecast at this time,\" said the association in bold type at the top of its\u00a0data report for February.\nLess than two weeks ago, when Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz announced his\u00a0first big interest rate cut, there were fears the sharp fall in lending costs would goose the Canadian property market with the attendant\u00a0danger of recreating a real estate bubble.\nNow even the experts aren't sure. And things are changing quickly. Only last week there were\u00a0accusations\u00a0that the central bank was scheming to restart the economy on the backs of overborrowed Canadians.\nSuddenly, what seemed like a reasonable concern over the threat of more reckless borrowing has transformed into new worries that the spring property market and the retail sector are crumbling as house hunters and shoppers stay home.\nAnd housing is only one sector\u00a0under assault by a tangle of interdependent consequences of the new coronavirus for which no one had developed strategies. Canada's fossil fuel sector knew there were challenges ahead, but they did not include a sudden plunge in demand followed by a vicious price war.\n\"The macroeconomic backdrop is completely uncharted waters for oil and gas companies,\" said\u00a0Tom Ellacott, vice-president of the energy research company Wood MacKenzie.\nWith no way to know what energy prices for the rest of the year will be, investment plans made a few weeks ago have become meaningless.\nThe caricature of so many of us closeting ourselves with bales of toilet paper and emergency supplies in the safety of our homes applies to investors as well. As world leaders, including\u00a0Prime Minister Justin\u00a0Trudeau, repeatedly announce updated ways of coping with the virus, investment plans made yesterday\u00a0are out of date today.\nAs the Bank of Canada governor once told us during the disputes with the U.S., the main economic impact of trade uncertainty was that companies and individuals considering whether to spend money\u00a0cut their investment plans\u00a0until they could see the way forward.\nIf that is how investors reacted to ambiguity over the future of trade, it is no wonder the current set of unknowns has\u00a0them bewildered.\nWill government\u00a0rules to slow the spread of the virus get stricter yet? Will the shortage of parts we saw when Asian factories closed recur in the U.S., our biggest trading partner, as cases and deaths climb? Will the path of the disease in the U.S. and Canada be staggering like in Italy or mild like in Singapore?\nWill job losses lead to a vicious circle of collapsing demand? How many consumers or businesses will default on loans? Can the consumer confidence that has recently been leading the economy bounce back?\nAnd just as the bizarre quest for too much toilet paper was accelerated by social media feedback, a new round of uncertainty for investors has been caused by investors themselves.\nWhy do markets keep selling off even as experts reassure us stocks will bounce back? Is there something wrong that we don't know and everyone else does? Will the economy and the market structure crack under the strain?\nWith so many questions unanswered, even more rate cuts and a suite of government plans to inject money into the economy at various levels apparently are not enough\u00a0to make that uncertainty go away. And there is no point in telling people not to panic.\n\"First, those who are already panicking are unlikely to listen. Second, those who aren't will start to wonder if they should,\" wrote emergency preparedness expert Simon Wessely in the\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0on the weekend.\nEverything will change when we know \u2014\u00a0or at least think we know \u2014\u00a0the answers to some of those questions.

Now, he has been left to tackle a climate of rising rental rates and long wait lists for affordable housing.\nThe town deemed his apartment \"hazardous to the health and safety\" of people in and around it after complaints prompted an inspection on Feb. 24. The order also applies to the other two apartments on the upper floor and the dining hall on the lower level.\nAs for the landlord, the town's order requires him to \"retain an Ontario Professional Engineer\" who will review\u00a0the building after appropriate fixes have been made\u00a0and submit a report to the town's building department by March 24.\nKobelnak\u00a0has lived in the unit at 18 Talbot Street North for about 12 years \u2014 and said with rental prices rapidly rising and no family in the area, he has nowhere else to go.\n\"You have to go out. You can't stay here. You have to get out now,\" said Kobelnak, recalling the words of the inspectors on Feb. 24.\nHe adds town officials informed him he's allowed to \"come and go\" for\u00a0two weeks from that date to move his belongings out of the unit. For Kobelnak, \"that ain't going to happen\" since he doesn't have the money to afford a storage unit.\n\"Who's going to pay for all that? I can't pay for storage. No way,\" he said, adding town\u00a0officials informed the tenants it would be the landlord's responsibility to provide alternate accommodations. \"We already know he's not going to put us up.\"\nDespite the town's order, most of Kobelnak's belongings remain stuffed in a room with wooden pillars precariously holding up part of the ceiling. That same room also contains a large hole in another part of the ceiling, caked in black mould.\nWhen it's time for bed, the 70-year-old\u00a0said he resorts to sleeping in his electric mobility scooter. But there's one thing that keeps Kobelnak returning to the apartment everyday.\n\"I've got a cat to look after. He's my family. He's like a kid\u00a0\u2014 but he's my kid,\" he said, adding he doesn't have any friends or family in the area who can assist him with finding a proper place to sleep.\nEssex officials said they received one complaint about the building from a tenant back in 2013,\u00a0which concerned \"smaller issues\" that were quickly rectified by the landlord.\nA second complaint was received by the town two weeks before the Feb. 24 inspection. According to the town, \"significant issues in terms of structural framing, access to safe exits, and fire separation between units\" required the building department\u00a0to take swift action.\n\"As the organization responsible for enforcing the Ontario Building Code, we must balance the needs of multiple parties, but the protection of life and safety of the public is our number one priority,\" the town said in a statement to CBC News.\n\"While we understand the frustration of the tenant and difficulty in finding alternative housing, we believe the proper recourse and/or remedy would be a question for the Landlord Tenant Board.\"\nImmediately after receiving the town's order to leave, Kobelnak\u00a0submitted an application for subsidized\u00a0housing to the Windsor-Essex Community Housing Corporation \u2014 which the organization said it has expedited in light of his situation.\nHowever, it still may be \"months\" before Kobelnak makes it to the top of the wait list, according to the city's executive director of housing Debbie Cercone, who points to a 50 per cent increase in the need for affordable housing since 2011.\nAccording to Cercone, the wait list sits just shy of 6,000 people. Of that, more than 400 people have also had their applications expedited like Kobelnak.\n\"We used to be able to turn people around fairly quickly, within weeks,\" she said. \"We are now months and years for wait times.\"\n\"Our one-bedrooms make up about half of the list. The wait can be fairly long for those particular units.\"\nOne option Kobelnak has, she said, is to seek emergency shelter.\u00a0That would require him to relocate to Windsor\u00a0\u2014 specifically, The Salvation Army.\n\"In terms of any other options, we have support agencies in the community that would help individuals who require help in searching for available units,\" said Cercone.\n\"They would be able to work with this gentleman in order to address his needs on the short-term if he required a unit immediately.\"\nNolan Hennin, case work manager at the Essex MPP constituency office, said the number of rental units \u2014 and their values \u2014 on the private market has seen a significant increase throughout the past five years.\n\"I've seen bachelor's [apartments] as high as 1,200 dollars,\" he said, adding affordable housing stock is a \"growing need\" in Essex.\nAccording to Hennin, the majority\u00a0of people who come into the constituency office with housing problems are seniors who have occupied their unit \"for a long time.\"\nThese photos were taken by CBC News during a visit to Kobelnak's apartment on Mar. 5:\n\"An individual is in a building. He's been in there for 20 years and is paying five to six hundred dollars a month rent. Maybe the building gets condemned or somebody wants to sell the building,\" said Hennin. \"All of a sudden they need to find a new place.\"\n\"Then, they look into the market rate and they have to shell out another five to six hundred dollars for their rent.\"\nIn terms of options for people who end up in these situations, Hennin\u00a0said many either stay with family or move into an emergency shelter, adding affordable housing stock is a \"growing need\" in Essex.\u00a0\n\"It's really about what their support network is like. Some people may have access to family who would take them in, whereas other people wouldn't\u00a0\u2014 and then don't really have any other resource than trying to use a shelter service or something along those lines.\"\nKobelnak said his\u00a0main source of income is old age security, which amounts to $1,500. He adds the search for affordable rental properties in Essex is a significant challenge with\u00a0that income.\n\"It's $1,300 for a one-bedroom. Plus, you've got to pay for your heat and hydro,\" said Kobelnak. \"I only get 15 [hundred]. What am I going to eat?\"\nBuilding owner Earl McCormick spoke with CBC News on Friday and acknowledged the ceiling needs to be completely redone. He added a contractor would be called in that same day to start repairing the roof.\n\"I'm hoping they'll have everything fixed where they wouldn't have to leave. It'll be all fixed, say, within a week or so. That way they can stay,\" said McCormick, adding he doesn't believe he bears \"any responsibility\" for the condition of the building.\nWhen asked about Kobelnak's claim that he's only attended the apartment about five times in 12 years, McCormick didn't dispute that.

In 2019, 8,500 new units were added to the city's rental stock \u2014 1,000 more than in 2018.\nWith a record number of people migrating to the region, nearly every available apartment is occupied, especially in boroughs\u00a0such as the Sud-Ouest and Verdun, where the vacancy rate has dropped\u00a0as low as 0.5 per cent.\nApartments with three bedrooms or more are in the highest demand, with an average monthly rent hovering around $1,070 per month and a vacancy rate of 0.7 per cent.\nAnd things aren't looking much better off-island, as the vacancy rate in the suburbs has dropped to 1.2 per cent.\nThe rise in housing prices has also played a role, as fewer people under 35 are buying properties.\u00a0At the same time, with the aging population, more older homeowners are\u00a0downsizing to rentals, the report says.\nThe availability of rental housing in Montreal is on par with what's happening across the country. The national vacancy rate stood at 2.2 per cent. That's down from 2.4 per cent in 2018, making it the lowest level since 2002.\nSome landlords and developers say Quebec's\u00a0strict regulations \u2014 rent control, costly building permits, zoning laws \u2014 are hurting the industry and making the situation worse.\n\"The more regulations we have, we have\u00a0less production of new housing stock,\" said Hans Brouillette, spokesperson for the Corporation des Propri\u00e9taires Immobiliers du Qu\u00e9bec\u00a0(CORPIQ), a landlords'\u00a0association.\nThe first step, he said, is to scale back on provincial and municipal regulations that raise costs for investors looking to build or renovate properties.\u00a0All the extra\u00a0costs get passed onto the renters, he said.\nProperty owners who can't raise rent enough to cover those costs\u00a0may turn to other options such as subdividing the property, letting their family move in, or hosting short-term rental services like Airbnb, he said.\nThey may even resort to leaving\u00a0the property vacant because it's not profitable to invest\u00a0tens of thousands of dollars in a unit that can only be rented at a nominal rate under the province's rental control laws, he said.\u00a0\n\"The rents are too low for the trouble of managing those apartments or renovating them,\" Brouillette said.\nHowever, those very regulations and policies that are\u00a0keeping more rental stock off the markets, according to Brouillette's group,\u00a0are what\u00a0tenants' advocacy groups say Quebec needs to tighten up.\nA provincial coalition of housing advocacy groups, RCLALQ, is demanding Quebec's housing minister come up with short-term emergency measures.\n\"Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest must act quickly if we want to prevent renters from finding\u00a0themselves on the streets on July 1,\" said RCLALQ spokesperson Maxim Roy-Allard in a statement.\nRents are becoming unaffordable\u00a0for many tenants, says RCLALQ, with\u00a095,000 Quebecers\u00a0paying more than 50 per cent of their income toward shelter, forcing them to cut back on other necessities.\nAnd the competition for rental units creates other problems as well, the group says.\n\"These low vacancy rates intensify the discrimination experienced by tenants as owners become more selective,\" tsaid RCLALQ.\n\"Even if discrimination is prohibited under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, many landlords do not hesitate to discriminate or use different schemes to avoid renting to certain people.\"\n"}, {"author": "Hannah Kost", "title": "Seed sales skyrocket as Calgarians seek plant-based solution for food panic, malaise", "description": "Seed sales have tripled in the wake of COVID-19, says garden centre owner", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/seeds-plants-planting-food-shortage-growing-garden-covid-19-quarantine-1.5512125", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5512614.1585333115!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/seeds.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 27, 2020 2:28 PM MT", "2020-03-27T20:28:15.166Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Toilet paper, hand sanitizer and pantry staples aren't the only items in high demand these days \u2014 quarantine living has reportedly prompted Calgarians to buy seeds en masse.\u00a0\nSeveral garden centre owners say their stores are selling seeds quickly and in\u00a0high volumes, and\u00a0are now ordering them in bulk\u00a0to meet the demand.\nColin Atter, who owns Plantation Garden Centre in northwest Calgary, said his largest supplier of seeds from\u00a0the United States\u00a0has recently notified him that it is completely sold out its stock.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Lethbridge-based seed supplier Wildrose Heritage Seed Company has stated on its website that it will be \"taking a breather\" until March 30 because of the \"incredible\" number of orders it has received in the past few days.\n\"People are \u2026\u00a0scared they're not going to get what they want or need, and [that] there will be a shortage,\"\u00a0Atter\u00a0told the\u00a0Calgary Eyeopener on Friday.\n\"So they're buying like crazy, and we are trying to secure supply like crazy.\"\nTo keep up with demand, Atter said, Plantation Garden Centre is double ordering all of its seeds.

Wheeler said the agency is still running tests on the system, and expects the\u00a0DFO will start receiving data from the satellites in the fall.\n\"This puts Canada in a position of being able to support partners around the world with the challenge of illegal fishing, and I think that's quite a critical mission for our department and for Canada,\" said Wheeler.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": "Keith Boag", "title": "Coronavirus puts a spotlight on the moral compass of America", "description": "The individualism the U.S. was founded on might not serve it well in the current public health crisis", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/keith-boag-coronavirus-moral-character-1.5505963", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5506367.1584926014!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus-usa.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 23, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-23T11:03:57.727Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "\"The greatness of the American character is shining forth,\"\u00a0U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence pronounced at one of the daily coronavirus press briefings last week.\u00a0\nIt was more wish than fact, and it was soon tested when U.S. President Donald Trump aimed a sneering personal harangue at a reporter who'd asked whether it was wise to encourage optimism that the virus could soon be easily treated with an existing malaria drug \u2014 as Trump had suggested.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"What do you say to Americans who are scared, though, I guess?\"\u00a0NBC reporter Peter Alexander asked in a follow-up question. \"Nearly 200 dead, 14,000 who are sick, millions \u2014 as you witnessed \u2014 who are scared right now.

It didn't work, and the market crash turned out to be the single strongest indicator to people of how seriously Wall Street takes the public health threat.\nAnd then there's the story of Matt and Noah Colvin of Tennessee. The New York Times discovered the brothers last week sitting on a hoard of nearly 18,000 bottles of hand sanitizer they'd hurriedly scooped up over a couple of weeks of driving around the state and neighbouring Kentucky\u00a0in a frantic crusade to find as much of it as they could.\nThey were planning to sell their stash,\u00a0at huge markups, on Amazon, but Amazon reportedly stopped them as well as several other profiteers around the country who were also trying to corner the market on sanitizer, wipes and face masks. After the New York Times story prompted\u00a0a massive backlash, the brothers\u00a0agreed to donate all of the supplies.\nYou can find examples of similar bad behaviour across the world, including in Canada, but no country has invested as heavily as the U.S. in the idea of itself as a land where freedom to pursue opportunity is paramount.\nBut in a time of crisis, that creed can stray into the desperate territory of \"every man for himself.\"\u00a0\nLast week, Christopher Beem, director of the McCourtney School of Democracy, wrote about the challenge facing America's sense of itself in the face of COVID-19.\nHe noted that, long before the coronavirus came over the horizon, some American political philosophers had come to a different view of U.S.\u00a0society. They refer to themselves as communitarians (not to be confused with communists or communalists) rather than the liberals contemplated in the Declaration of Independence.\n\"Like the communitarians from 30 years ago, Americans need to challenge the idea that everyone is just pursuing their own happiness as individuals,\"\u00a0he wrote. \"When we live together in society, we depend on each other. And therefore, we have obligations to each other.\"\u00a0\nThat spirit surely exists among many Americans. Some see it embodied in the growing democratic socialist movement, for example.\nBut it's been endlessly documented that Trump has never embraced anything even remotely similar. And he's proud of that.\n\"America First\"\u00a0is the national expression of his decades-old personal brand of solipsism.\nBut he is just one type of American, not every American.\u00a0\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo seems to have his moral compass calibrated to the moment. In announcing last Friday that he would effectively shut down the economy of his state and the country's largest city, he put his self-interest aside and prepared to take one for Team USA.\u00a0\n\"This is statewide order ... I accept full responsibility,\"\u00a0he said.

All the fish are collected. We have them in our lab. We were ready to start these experiments,\" said\u00a0biologist Caroline Senay, DFO's lead scientist on redfish in the Gulf.\n\"[But] as long as we cannot access the lab, I think everyone is having a hard time to know what they'll be doing exactly in the upcoming months.\"\nIt's a remarkable comeback for a population designated \"endangered\" in 2010 by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, an independent advisory panel. The designation was\u00a0imposed based on a 98 per cent decline in abundance.\nAccording to the 2019\u00a0DFO stock assessment, there's now an estimated 4.3 million tonnes of redfish in the Gulf.\n\"We're seeing an astonishing increase. We have never seen these numbers. The biomass is going up exponentially,\" Senay said.\nThe massive population is primarily made of fish live born \u2014 not hatched from eggs \u2014 from 2011, 2012 and 2013.\nThe arrival of these cohorts coincided with record-warm ocean temperatures in the deepwater where redfish live.\n\"That is quite a mystery on how come, why did we win the lottery like this in those years where we've seen those large cohorts reappearing in the Gulf?\u00a0The main explanation is surely in terms of temperature warming. That is maybe not beneficial for all species, but it seems that redfish are kind of enjoying those new conditions in the Gulf,\" Senay\u00a0said.\nThe numbers of redfish have not grown, but their combined mass increased because the individual fish are thriving and heavier.\nSenay said many questions need answering:\n\"We're going to expose them to different temperatures, to different acidity levels to kind of mimic actual and future conditions in the Gulf,\" Senay said.\n\"And we're gonna measure a bunch of physiological parameters such as their metabolism, their consumption rate\u00a0and growth rate to see how that gradient of environmental conditions will affect redfish, but also their needs in terms of energy. So we'll have a better idea of the overall predation by redfish on shrimp.\"\nTo carry out that research,\u00a0DFO retrieved hundreds of live redfish for testing in the summer and fall of 2019.\nIt's not as easy as it sounds because redfish brought up to the surface during fishing are almost always damaged, if not dead.\nThey have an air pocket in the abdomen that helps with buoyancy.\u00a0If the fish is brought up to the surface too quickly, air expands as the pressure drops and the bladder stretches, which compresses the organs and the stomach is often pushed into the mouth of the fish.\nThe bladder may even burst.\nLast year,\u00a0DFO divers went to Les Escoumins, Que.\u00a0In depths of 30 to\u00a040 metres, they\u00a0used dip nets to capture redfish one by one.\nThe fish were transferred into cages that were raised to the surface over a few days, performing decompression stops, much like divers do.\nToday, there are 800 redfish in tanks at the Lamontagne Institute awaiting the return of DFO scientists like Senay.\nConfusingly,\u00a0redfish in the Gulf are made up of two nearly identical but distinct species:\u00a0the far more common deepwater redfish and the Acadian redfish.\nThe DFO stock assessment says the combined biomass for both increased by 72 per cent between 2017 and 2019.\nThe assessment says 70 per cent of the deepwater redfish population have reached the legal minimum 22-centimetre size for harvest.\nJan Voutier, a manager at Louisbourg Seafoods, said\u00a0it's still too soon to resume large-scale fishing.\nThe Nova Scotia company catches redfish in the Atlantic.\n\"We are seeing them outside the Gulf. The fish are plentiful, but they're too small,\" said\u00a0Voutier.\n\"Our markets are demanding larger and larger fillets all the time and this fishery is years away from being ready.\"\nDFO is proposing to maintain the current quota of 4,500 tonnes\u00a0for redfish in the Gulf\u00a0when the 2020-21 season opens May 15.\nMeanwhile, deepwater redfish\u00a0is still considered an endangered species by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.\nThe DFO stock assessment notes that a \"revision appears warranted.\"\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": "Brittany Toole", "title": "Chefs and food writers share the best cooking advice they got from their moms", "description": "\u201cMy mom taught me that cooking for others was really rarely about the food itself.\u201d  ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/life/food/chefs-and-food-writers-share-the-best-cooking-advice-they-got-from-their-moms-1.5557762", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5558472.1588798746!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/883140318.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 06, 2020 4:58 PM ET", "2020-05-06T20:58:46.978Z"], "source": "CBC Life", "content": "While the internet is full of recipe inspiration and answers to our culinary questions, I recently realized just how often I turn to my mom for cooking advice.

But, 20 years of cooking and here I am doing comfort Indigenous cooking... because when I was a kid, my mom made delicious food. It could be as simple as meatloaf, a goulash\u2026 she used to make really good borscht \u2014 that's the kind of comfort that I enjoyed that my mom really taught me.

Her whole approach to cooking was centred around who was coming to her table, and how could she give them a beautiful experience. She taught me to put my guests first, to think about their favourite foods; dishes that would be personal. Her conscientiousness and consideration of others, through how she cooks for them, was definitely an inspiration and influence in how I cook, and why I chose to write a cookbook about gathering people together around food. My mom taught me that cooking for others was about them leaving your home with memories of love and laughter first, and the food second. (But never without leftovers in hand!) It helped me never be afraid to cook or try new things in the kitchen because as long as I was cooking with someone else in mind, from a place of generosity and giving, it was guaranteed to be a success.\"\nWallace Wong, chef and founder of culinary consulting and catering brand Six Pack Chef:\nThe best thing my mom, my aunt and grandma taught me about cooking is that the most important thing is realizing you are cooking for someone and that it was a way to show them you care about them \u2014 it was a way to show you loved them. I use this philosophy in my cooking because every time I cook and serve a dish, I think of what they taught me and ask myself 'am I showing this person how much I care and love them?' I also use it as a reference for whenever someone I cook for gives me great compliments or are really enjoying the dish, that means they feel the love and are reciprocating it back.\u00a0\nSigne Langford, chef and author of Happy Hens & Fresh Eggs: Keeping Chickens in the Kitchen Garden with 100 Recipes:\n\"Truth be told, Mother wasn't much of a cook day to day. When company came, she had her specialities \u2014 baba au rhum, paella, chiffon cake, her wonderful shortbread at Christmas \u2014 but the rest of the time, everything was under-seasoned and overcooked. I grew up in the 1960s and '70s, when casserole was queen and everything came out of a can, but, when Father's garden started to provide, her cooking was transformed. Then, it was all about simplicity and letting the ingredient shine: juicy, sweet strawberries, crunchy wax beans, cool cucumbers. Perfectly fresh ingredients don't need much meddling; some heat, maybe. Salt? Sure. Butter? Almost always! I absorbed this kitchen gospel and cook by it still. And don't worry Mother, I'm over it now. A childhood of canned spaghetti can be washed away with a single thought of your warm stewed rhubarb and strawberries spilled over vanilla ice cream.\"\nMary Berg, host of Mary's Kitchen Crush and author of Kitchen Party: Effortless Recipes for Every Occasion:\n\"I've made no secret of my mom's aversion to the kitchen but I think the best lesson she's taught me is that cooking and food are first and foremost about sharing. Whether purposefully or not, she has always shown me that there is always enough to go around when a family friend stops by on a whim around dinnertime, or when a neighbour might need a little extra care. In our house, food itself is the best way to share and convey love. Even though cooking might not be her favourite thing in the world, I think this 'whatever I have in the fridge is yours' mentality to sharing food is one of the most amazing lessons I've learned in the kitchen, and in my mind, it makes everything taste about a hundred times better.\"\nJulie Miguel, founder of the blog Daily Tiramisu and recipe developer:\u00a0\n\"I lost my mother when I was 15 years old. I learned how to cook by watching her day-in and day-out. I sat on the kitchen counter and was her sous chef. During her last few weeks of life, she knew she couldn't cook for us anymore so she gave me detailed instructions for her chicken stock recipe. I wrote them down in her hospital room. She had all the ingredients portioned in the freezer (chicken legs along with tomato and mirepoix ingredients from our garden). I followed her instructions and made the stock; I was surprised at how tasty it was!\u00a0This simple stock recipe sparked my passion for cooking and gave me the base and knowledge for future recipes. I'm so grateful she taught me this recipe before it was too late because to this day we have been unable to locate her recipe book.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nShahir Massoud, chef and author of the upcoming cookbook \"Eat Habibi, Eat!\":\n\"This one is a bit tricky, because my mom isn't the greatest cook (haha)... however she recently taught me something interesting while I was writing recipes for my cookbook. I was tinkering with ways to transform a classic and traditional Egyptian breakfast called ful medamas (basically fava beans cooked then smashed with olive oil, lemon juice, herbs etc... served with eggs and bread). I was getting way too out there: trying different beans, methods, techniques and so on. When my Mom found out, she emphatically said NO! There are certain dishes you don't want to modernize, experiment with, or change. The very essence of what makes some dishes so enjoyable is how consistent and comforting they have been over the years, and I guess I needed her to remind me of that.\"\u00a0\nJoy McCarthy, holistic nutritionist and author of\u00a0The Joyous Cookbook:\n\"My mom taught me one of the most important aspects of eating that I value greatly to this day: the importance of togetherness. She was never preachy about it but she made sure we shared at least one meal together a day as a family. Usually that was dinner from Monday to Friday, and every Sunday night we'd have both my grandmothers over for a special family dinner. Togetherness is so important for our well-being; I can't wait to do that again with my parents when social distancing comes to an end!\"\nMatt Basile, chef and owner of Fidel Gastro's catering:\n\"My mother used to be a great cook, until recently when she became more into is it gluten-free than does it taste good. She never was fancy with food but always had great flavours and quality. [She] was always about the products themselves \u2014 specifically produce, meat and fish. She would always tell me to never ever ignore how quality impacts taste.\"\u00a0\nJennifer Crawford, reigning MasterChef Canada, writer and host of My Queer Kitchen:\n\"'You have to smell this,' my Aunt Bernie would exclaim, shoving that season's fresh dill fronds in my face. This was the accidental best lesson in cooking. She did this every year, with every bit as much enthusiasm as the year before. Lush pleasure and joy from the farmers market to the table, Bernie felt and vocalized it all. If appreciation was a shining light, having Bernie cook for you was like staring straight into a supernova. She passed away a year ago this Mother's Day, so she's been on my mind plenty. In our last conversation, I tearfully told her I admired how much she unabashedly adored and enjoyed food. 'Others may have prepared it better,' her eyes sparkled and she reached for my arm, 'but no one loved it more than me.' And as usual when it came to food, I believe she was right.\nShayma Owaise Saadat, food writer, professor and entrepreneur:\n\"'Don't fret \u2014 make do with what you have \u2014 and make it your own.' Whether it was that frozen Ellio's nine-slice pizza, or a can of chickpeas in the pantry, my Ami always knew how to transform something seemingly mundane into a nourishing and special treat. Those are the skills I hold dear to me in my life today. When my father was away on work-related trips, sometimes we'd have [that] frozen pizza. But before sliding it into the oven, Ami would add spoonfuls of keema on top \u2014 a Pakistani-style ground beef dish, fragrant with ginger, garlic and browned onions. My favourite part was letting the keema crisp up under the broiler before biting into a slice. There were also times when we would come home late at night, after a long trip, and Ami would open a tin of canned chickpeas and stewed tomatoes, making chanay for dinner, finished off with matchstick slices of ginger. We ate it with pita bread she always kept in the freezer.

I learned the basics needed for a sauce and the techniques behind getting the consistency just right.\"\u00a0\nShane Chartrand, culinary ambassador for River Cree Resort:\n\"The one thing that my mom taught me is the importance of comfort food; I understand the laissez-faire way of talking about [comfort food] because anyone can make it, when you think about it. But, 20 years of cooking and here I am doing comfort Indigenous cooking... because when I was a kid, my mom made delicious food. It could be as simple as meatloaf, a goulash\u2026 she used to make really good borscht \u2014 that's the kind of comfort that I enjoyed that my mom really taught me. My mom never taught me how to cook, she just cooked because we had a big family; I watched her cook and it was an inspiration to me, and made me who I am today.\"\u00a0\nLisa Dawn Bolton, author of On Boards:\n\"My mom taught me that cooking for others was really rarely about the food itself. Her whole approach to cooking was centred around who was coming to her table, and how could she give them a beautiful experience. She taught me to put my guests first, to think about their favourite foods; dishes that would be personal. Her conscientiousness and consideration of others, through how she cooks for them, was definitely an inspiration and influence in how I cook, and why I chose to write a cookbook about gathering people together around food. My mom taught me that cooking for others was about them leaving your home with memories of love and laughter first, and the food second. (But never without leftovers in hand!) It helped me never be afraid to cook or try new things in the kitchen because as long as I was cooking with someone else in mind, from a place of generosity and giving, it was guaranteed to be a success.\"\nWallace Wong, chef and founder of culinary consulting and catering brand Six Pack Chef:\nThe best thing my mom, my aunt and grandma taught me about cooking is that the most important thing is realizing you are cooking for someone and that it was a way to show them you care about them \u2014 it was a way to show you loved them. I use this philosophy in my cooking because every time I cook and serve a dish, I think of what they taught me and ask myself 'am I showing this person how much I care and love them?' I also use it as a reference for whenever someone I cook for gives me great compliments or are really enjoying the dish, that means they feel the love and are reciprocating it back.\u00a0\nSigne Langford, chef and author of Happy Hens & Fresh Eggs: Keeping Chickens in the Kitchen Garden with 100 Recipes:\n\"Truth be told, Mother wasn't much of a cook day to day. When company came, she had her specialities \u2014 baba au rhum, paella, chiffon cake, her wonderful shortbread at Christmas \u2014 but the rest of the time, everything was under-seasoned and overcooked. I grew up in the 1960s and '70s, when casserole was queen and everything came out of a can, but, when Father's garden started to provide, her cooking was transformed. Then, it was all about simplicity and letting the ingredient shine: juicy, sweet strawberries, crunchy wax beans, cool cucumbers. Perfectly fresh ingredients don't need much meddling; some heat, maybe. Salt? Sure. Butter? Almost always! I absorbed this kitchen gospel and cook by it still. And don't worry Mother, I'm over it now. A childhood of canned spaghetti can be washed away with a single thought of your warm stewed rhubarb and strawberries spilled over vanilla ice cream.\"\nMary Berg, host of Mary's Kitchen Crush and author of Kitchen Party: Effortless Recipes for Every Occasion:\n\"I've made no secret of my mom's aversion to the kitchen but I think the best lesson she's taught me is that cooking and food are first and foremost about sharing. Whether purposefully or not, she has always shown me that there is always enough to go around when a family friend stops by on a whim around dinnertime, or when a neighbour might need a little extra care. In our house, food itself is the best way to share and convey love. Even though cooking might not be her favourite thing in the world, I think this 'whatever I have in the fridge is yours' mentality to sharing food is one of the most amazing lessons I've learned in the kitchen, and in my mind, it makes everything taste about a hundred times better.\"\nJulie Miguel, founder of the blog Daily Tiramisu and recipe developer:\u00a0\n\"I lost my mother when I was 15 years old. I learned how to cook by watching her day-in and day-out. I sat on the kitchen counter and was her sous chef. During her last few weeks of life, she knew she couldn't cook for us anymore so she gave me detailed instructions for her chicken stock recipe. I wrote them down in her hospital room. She had all the ingredients portioned in the freezer (chicken legs along with tomato and mirepoix ingredients from our garden). I followed her instructions and made the stock; I was surprised at how tasty it was!\u00a0This simple stock recipe sparked my passion for cooking and gave me the base and knowledge for future recipes. I'm so grateful she taught me this recipe before it was too late because to this day we have been unable to locate her recipe book.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nShahir Massoud, chef and author of the upcoming cookbook \"Eat Habibi, Eat!\":\n\"This one is a bit tricky, because my mom isn't the greatest cook (haha)... however she recently taught me something interesting while I was writing recipes for my cookbook. I was tinkering with ways to transform a classic and traditional Egyptian breakfast called ful medamas (basically fava beans cooked then smashed with olive oil, lemon juice, herbs etc... served with eggs and bread). I was getting way too out there: trying different beans, methods, techniques and so on. When my Mom found out, she emphatically said NO! There are certain dishes you don't want to modernize, experiment with, or change. The very essence of what makes some dishes so enjoyable is how consistent and comforting they have been over the years, and I guess I needed her to remind me of that.\"\u00a0\nJoy McCarthy, holistic nutritionist and author of\u00a0The Joyous Cookbook:\n\"My mom taught me one of the most important aspects of eating that I value greatly to this day: the importance of togetherness. She was never preachy about it but she made sure we shared at least one meal together a day as a family. Usually that was dinner from Monday to Friday, and every Sunday night we'd have both my grandmothers over for a special family dinner. Togetherness is so important for our well-being; I can't wait to do that again with my parents when social distancing comes to an end!\"\nMatt Basile, chef and owner of Fidel Gastro's catering:\n\"My mother used to be a great cook, until recently when she became more into is it gluten-free than does it taste good. She never was fancy with food but always had great flavours and quality. [She] was always about the products themselves \u2014 specifically produce, meat and fish. She would always tell me to never ever ignore how quality impacts taste.\"\u00a0\nJennifer Crawford, reigning MasterChef Canada, writer and host of My Queer Kitchen:\n\"'You have to smell this,' my Aunt Bernie would exclaim, shoving that season's fresh dill fronds in my face. This was the accidental best lesson in cooking. She did this every year, with every bit as much enthusiasm as the year before. Lush pleasure and joy from the farmers market to the table, Bernie felt and vocalized it all. If appreciation was a shining light, having Bernie cook for you was like staring straight into a supernova. She passed away a year ago this Mother's Day, so she's been on my mind plenty. In our last conversation, I tearfully told her I admired how much she unabashedly adored and enjoyed food. 'Others may have prepared it better,' her eyes sparkled and she reached for my arm, 'but no one loved it more than me.' And as usual when it came to food, I believe she was right.\nShayma Owaise Saadat, food writer, professor and entrepreneur:\n\"'Don't fret \u2014 make do with what you have \u2014 and make it your own.' Whether it was that frozen Ellio's nine-slice pizza, or a can of chickpeas in the pantry, my Ami always knew how to transform something seemingly mundane into a nourishing and special treat. Those are the skills I hold dear to me in my life today. When my father was away on work-related trips, sometimes we'd have [that] frozen pizza. But before sliding it into the oven, Ami would add spoonfuls of keema on top \u2014 a Pakistani-style ground beef dish, fragrant with ginger, garlic and browned onions. My favourite part was letting the keema crisp up under the broiler before biting into a slice. There were also times when we would come home late at night, after a long trip, and Ami would open a tin of canned chickpeas and stewed tomatoes, making chanay for dinner, finished off with matchstick slices of ginger. We ate it with pita bread she always kept in the freezer. There is always beauty in simplicity.\"\nInterviews have been condensed and edited for space and clarity.\n"}, {"author": "Bryce Hoye", "title": "Doctor feel-good practising without a licence: Winnipeg police bust illegal cannabis operation", "description": "Dr. Kush warehouse in Sargent Park subject of raid where 'sophisticated' business operating outside of the law", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-cannabis-producer-illegal-bust-police-1.5536265", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5536570.1587153381!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/patrol-sargent-jeffrey-norman-winnipeg-police.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 17, 2020 3:59 PM CT", "2020-04-18T03:49:31.170Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "If you were to call Dr. Kush\u00a0on Friday hoping to place a\u00a0cannabis order drop-off, you'd find the line is no longer in service.

That ship docked in Oakland, Calif., Monday afternoon.\nThe Canadians onboard\u00a0will be transported by government-chartered plane to Trenton, Ont., where they will be assessed before undergoing a 14-day quarantine.\nThe Trenton-bound plane will start boarding around 10 p.m. ET with a scheduled arrival around 5:15 a.m. ET on Tuesday.\nNineteen\u00a0crew members and two passengers have tested positive for the virus aboard that cruise ship, which was headed to Oakland this morning after sitting off the coast of San Francisco for days.\nDuring Monday's briefing, Hajdu and Foreign Affairs Minister\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said passengers will not be permitted to board the airlift if they are showing any symptoms of coronavirus. Those passengers displaying symptoms will instead be\u00a0treated in the U.S.\nChampagne said the cruise\u00a0company will cover the cost of the airlift, but other costs associated with the repatriation effort\u00a0will be absorbed by the federal government.\nThe letter from Trudeau and Freeland also notes the financial impact of the global outbreak.\n\"The related economic implications resulting from COVID-19, whether those be narrowing export markets, decreased tourism, pressures on the supply chain or dropping commodity prices, are a significant concern and we know that Canadians are not just experiencing this solely as a public health issue,\" the letter reads.\nThe Opposition Conservatives said in debate in the House Monday that the Liberals cannot blame a slowing economy on the COVID-19 outbreak, and introduced a motion calling on the government to release all documents stretching back to Nov. 14,\u00a02015 warning of a possible economic downturn.\u00a0The vote passed with a vote of 313 to zero.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "What's open and closed for Christmas Day and Boxing Day 2019 in Halifax", "description": "Spoiler alert: most stores and services are closed on the 25th and 26th", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/christmas-2019-whats-closed-open-1.5407755", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4446774.1577997125!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/christmas-wrapping-stock.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 24, 2019 9:17 AM AT", "2019-12-24T13:17:01.756Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Here's a list of what's open and closed on Christmas Day in the Halifax area in 2019:\nClosed Christmas and Boxing Day, reopening Friday, Dec. 27.\nClosed Christmas Day, open 8:30 a.m. until 6 p.m. on\u00a0Boxing Day.\nClosed Christmas Day and Boxing Day.\nClosed Christmas Day and Boxing Day.\nClosed Christmas Day and Boxing Day.\nThe Halifax Shopping Centre, Mic Mac Mall, Park Lane Mall, Scotia Square, Dartmouth Crossing, and Sunnyside\u00a0Mall are closed on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.\u00a0\nThe Otter Lake Waste Management Facility, the Halifax Recycling Plant and municipal composting facilities will be closed on Christmas Day, but open regular hours on Boxing Day.\nThe household special waste depot in Bayers Lake is closed until Saturday, Jan. 11.\nThere will be no garbage, organics or recyclables collection services on Christmas Day.\nAll branches and departments of Halifax Public Libraries are closed Christmas Day and Boxing Day.\nHalifax Transit buses will be operating on holiday service schedules on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.

Europe, where biofuels have been deemed carbon neutral, is now accepting huge quantities of woodchips\u00a0from the U.S. and Canada.\nExploring the use of\u00a0heating fuelled by low-grade wood was one of the recommendations in University of King's College president\u00a0Bill Lahey's review on forestry practices in Nova Scotia.\nIain Rankin, minister of Lands and Forestry, said burning low-grade wood that's already been cut is better than using oil that's shipped to Nova Scotia from overseas.\n\"I believe that this is a better alternative, and I think Nova Scotians will see that,\" he told CBC's Information Morning.\nRankin said biomass\u00a0furnaces in the six buildings that are part of the province's pilot project are\u00a0over 90 per cent efficient.\n\"If you're using material that is largely waste from material that's being thinned off of woodlots, and you have a highly efficient system, the conclusions that we have seen so far is there are net carbon benefits,\" he said.\nBut Sterman said using \"so-called waste wood\"\u00a0is not sustainable, and that his research takes into account wood from thinning, not clearcuts.\nHe said lower grade wood is\u00a0an important source\u00a0of nutrients for forests and provides carbon for the soil as it decays.\nWoodchips for the six biomass projects will come from private woodlots, Rankin said.\n\"It reduces the risk of some of these landowners, say, converting their forest to another type of land use, whether it be agricultural or development, because that would be more harmful for the environment and deplete the carbon stocks that we have in the province,\" he said.\nHe added that the province is also looking for\u00a0new markets for woodchips from sawmills following Northern Pulp's closure.\nSterman said his research doesn't mean governments should continue to rely on coal and oil, but\u00a0what's really needed is a commitment to build\u00a0energy-efficient buildings.\n\"We have technologies ready to go today that can cut our greenhouse gas emissions and still provide us with what we need to generate that warmth, make sure the lights stay on,\" he said.\nRankin said he's open to reading Sterman's research and having Nova Scotia's science\u00a0peer reviewed.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Gambling chain Caesars to be taken over by Eldorado Resorts in $17B deal", "description": "Acquisition puts about 60 casinos and resorts in 16 states under a single name", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/caesars-eldorado-vegas-1.5187307", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5187313.1561379714!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/las-vegas-tourism.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 24, 2019 8:37 AM ET", "2019-06-24T12:37:00.301Z"], "source": null, "content": "Eldorado Resorts will buy Caesars in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $17.3 billion US, creating a casino giant.\nThe acquisition Monday puts about 60 casinos and resorts in 16 states under a single name, one of the biggest gambling and entertainment ventures in the United States.\n\"Together, we will have an extremely powerful suite of iconic gaming and entertainment brands, as well as valuable strategic alliances with industry leaders in sports betting and online gaming,\" Eldorado CEO Tom Reeg said in a prepared statement.\nThe company, which will be called Caesars, will be led by Reeg, along with Eldorado Chairman Gary Carano.

When he circled back to the Blues, he went through their improbable run from last place in the league to champions with nods to Steen, owner Tom Stillman, captain Alex Pietrangelo, goaltender Jordan Binnington, forward Jaden Schwartz \u2014 who he called \"Jason\" \u2014 and playoff MVP Ryan O'Reilly.\n\"Being able to see [the Oval]\u00a0Office and get a tour of the White House, it doesn't get much better than that,\" said Schwartz, who acknowledged he might have a new nickname. \"This is [something]\u00a0you'll remember forever.\"\nTrump to St. Louis Blues left wing Alexander Steen:<br><br>\u201cYou think I could take him in a fight?

Young fan Laila Anderson, who was the team's inspiration while she fought a rare auto-immune disease, got her own mention.\n\"You inspired the Blues all season, and today you continue to inspire all Americans,\" Trump said. \"We all know your story.\"\nStillman, who presented Trump with a No. 45 Blues jersey, called it a \"light-hearted, fun kind of celebration.\" He echoed Steen's sentiments about why the entire team showed up \u2014 a departure from when goaltender Braden Holtby and forward Brett Connolly skipped the 2018 champion Washington Capitals' visit in March in support of teammate Devante Smith-Pelly.\n\"I think this team acts as a team in everything they do,\" Stillman said. \"They stick together. By and large, [I]\u00a0like to keep politics and sports separate. This is a matter of a traditional honour, being invited to the White House by the presidency. It's something you do. I'm really proud of our group for all coming together and having a good time of it, as well.\"\nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman; Pence's wife, Karen; and Republican Sens. Roy Blunt and Josh Hawley of Missouri were among those in attendance for the half-hour ceremony.\nCoach Craig Berube stressed the notion of the Blues' playoff run as a team effort and brushed off Trump's comment that the pressure was off after winning.\n\"We won the Stanley Cup, I think, once we got our team working together and playing together,\" Berube said. \"When you play as a team, day in and day out \u2014 hard \u2014 you're going to be hard to beat. So that's what it basically boiled down to. These guys all came together as a team and played for each other, and we ended up being champions.\"\nDuring White House event with the St. Louis Blues, Trump disses sports agents: \"Those agents, right? They sit in bed, they weigh 350 pounds, and they complain, 'you're not playing very well today, c'mon.'\" <a href=\"https://t.co/GECGxTOMbF\">pic.twitter.com/GECGxTOMbF</a>\nThe Blues paraded down the streets of St. Louis, raised their championship banner, donated a Cup ring to the Hockey Hall of Fame and capped it all off by going to the White House. Now, players are eager to move on to trying to do it all again.\n\"It's a new year and new challenges and experiences,\" Binnington said. \"We kind of still have this stuff lingering around, but obviously it's positive and it's amazing to experience that. But at the same time, yeah, it's back to work and simplify things a little bit.

Projects must be worth between $1 million and $15 million.\nThe fund is aimed at projects that improve production processes, diversify product ranges, increase production capacity or allow entry to new markets and identify new uses and markets for wood fibre.\nAccording to the program criteria on the NSBI website, to receive a rebate a project must also align with the Lahey Report on sustainable forestry practices and not negatively affect the province's preferred status with the United States Department of Commerce.\nThe money is in addition to a $50-million transition fund the province created in the wake of Northern Pulp's closure. The Pictou County-based mill shut down at the end of January after it was unable to secure approval to build a new effluent treatment facility and the government refused to grant an extension for the use of its existing treatment site.\nThe government announced recently that the transition fund, which has already allocated $13.5 million, would be topped back up to its original total. The idea for the rebate program comes from the transition team overseeing the fund.\nJeff Bishop, executive director of Forest Nova Scotia and a member of the transition team, said the idea was prompted by the knowledge that any business that might be considering a capital expenditure was probably going to have difficulty getting help from a bank, considering the uncertainty surrounding the industry.\n\"We know it's not going to answer everybody's questions, but we would never want to be in a spot here where someone is looking to invest here but they just can't find access to the right capital for a small-, medium- or large-sized business that might make sense,\" he said in an interview.\n\"I think it was taking stock of, as I say, what tools were in the toolbox that we could leverage at this time to allow folks to do what they want within the business and find access to capital to help them do that.\"\nThe transition fund has already made money available for silviculture and road-building work, short-term loans to help with equipment payments and money for retraining and emergency assistance for people affected by the mill's closure.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Fed stands pat, keeps benchmark U.S. interest rate steady", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/federal-reserve-interest-rate-1.5444744", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5341289.1572457524!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/federal-reserve.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 29, 2020 2:14 PM ET", "2020-01-29T19:31:11.450Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a low level Wednesday amid an economy that looks solid but faces potential global threats.\nThe Fed sketched a mostly positive picture of the U.S. economy in the statement it released after its latest policy meeting. It also repeated its pledge to \"monitor\" the world economy, which may be held back in the coming months by China's viral outbreak. Stock and bond markets have gyrated in the past week over fears about the virus.\nThe central bank said it would hold short-term rates in a range of 1.5\u00a0to 1.75 per cent, far below levels that have been typical during previous expansions. Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have indicated that they see that range as low enough to support faster growth and hiring.\nStock prices rose modestly after the Fed issued its statement at 2 p.m. Eastern time.\u00a0\nThe Fed's statement was nearly identical to the one it issued after its December meeting, though it described consumer spending as rising at only a \"moderate\" rather than at a \"strong\" pace. That change likely reflects relatively modest spending by Americans over the winter holidays.\nLast year, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate three times after having raised it four times in 2018. Powell and other Fed officials credit those rate cuts with revitalizing the housing market, which had stumbled early last year, and offsetting some of the drag from President Donald Trump's trade war with China.\nMany economists and investors had hoped that U.S. and global growth would pick up this year, now that the U.S. and China have signed a preliminary trade deal that removed some tariffs on Chinese goods. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund said last week that low interest rates and reduced trade tensions would likely buoy the global economy over the next two years and help nurture steady if modest growth.\nBut China's viral outbreak has injected fresh doubts into that outlook. The coronavirus has in effect shut down much of that nation and seems sure to slow the Chinese economy \u2014 the world's second-largest \u2014 which had already been decelerating. The virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.\nMajor companies across the world have responded by suspending some operations in China. Starbucks said it plans to close half its stores in China, its second-largest market. British Airways has halted all flights to China, and American Airlines suspended Los Angeles flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing.\nHotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators are among the industries that have suffered the most immediate repercussions, especially in countries close to China. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's suppliers in China have been forced to delay the re-opening of factories that have closed for the Chinese New Year holiday until Feb. 10.\nInvestors seem increasingly to believe that the Fed will feel compelled to cut rates again later this year. The chances of a cut by September's Fed meeting have risen to about 56 per cent, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch tool, up from 37 per cent\u00a0just a month ago.\nStill, the Fed will likely wait to see how last year's rate cuts play out. Among other benefits, the cuts have helped drive down mortgage rates and led home buyers to bid up prices on a dwindling number of available properties. Home sales jumped in December and were nearly 11% higher than a year earlier.\nSince they last met in December, Fed officials have presented a nearly unified front in support of keeping rates unchanged, possibly for the rest of this year. That contrasts with last year, when both \"hawks,\" who tend to favour higher rates, and \"doves,\" who typically lean toward lower rates, occasionally dissented from the Fed's rate decisions.\nThe Fed's decision came a day after President Donald Trump urged Fed chair Jerome Powell to cut rates in a tweet, arguing it would make U.S. interest rates \"competitive with other Countries.\" Yet the Fed hopes to avoid the ultra-low and negative interest rates that exist in much of Europe and Japan, which they \u2014 and most analysts \u2014 see as evidence of weak economies.\nMost analysts think the Fed would be more willing to cut rates if there were clear signs of a sharp economic slowdown. Still, some Fed watchers say they foresee a rate cut by the summer or after November's elections.\nOne reason for a potential future cut is that inflation remains chronically low. According to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, prices rose just 1.5 per cent\u00a0in November from a year earlier, below the central bank's 2 per cent annual target. Since the Fed adopted that target in 2012, inflation has failed to consistently reach that high, to the surprise of the Fed and most economists.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian and U.S. economies are converging but danger lurks: Don Pittis", "description": "Poloz and Wilkins warn that markets overestimate the power of a rate-cut quick fix", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/poloz-powell-rates-economy-1.5204132", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5207418.1562794054!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bank-of-canada-20190710.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 11, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-07-11T16:01:07.313Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "On the face of it, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz and his deputy Carolyn Wilkins had some excellent news about the Canadian economy in yesterday's Monetary Policy Report.\nThe happy story included falling mortgage\u00a0rates, continued employment strength and growing business investment that have pushed Canadian economic growth rates higher in the first half of the year than almost anyone expected.\nBut as global trade threats linger, Canada's top central bankers warn that many people who should know better, including stock market investors, seem to think cuts to interest rates can solve all problems.\nIn a complex world riven by trade disputes, they say, there are simply limits to the power of central bankers to patch things up. The warnings, including hints of the possibility of a new bout of stagflation, were effectively a message that rate cuts are no easy answer for the damaging effect of\u00a0a global trade war.\n\"The underlying shock would be very bad for economic growth, it would be bad for the level\u00a0of productivity, it would be quite harmful to profitability,\" said Poloz\u00a0of a potential growing trade spat.\u00a0\"It would be a pretty significantly negative scenario.\"\nMore on that later, but first a look at why the Canadian central bank foresaw Canada's interest rates remaining steady while on the\u00a0same day U.S. central banker Jerome Powell implied in congressional testimony that U.S. interest rates were about to fall.\nWhile that sounds like\u00a0the U.S. and Canada diverging, the senior deputy governor of Canada's central bank\u00a0said at yesterday's news conference, instead it was a sign that the two economies\u00a0were growing together.\n\"In fact, it's a sign of convergence, and this is because the two countries are at different points in our economic cycles,\" said Wilkins. \"The U.S. is slowing to a more sustainable pace while Canada is moving back up to its trend growth.\"\nAt the end of last year there were signs businesses were shying away from new Canadian investments due to fears a new NAFTA would not be resolved. Even as that fear faded, the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and U.S. President Donald\u00a0Trump's threats against Mexico over immigration left a lingering feeling of caution.\nWilkins\u00a0said\u00a0resolving all those difficulties\u00a0plus renewed strength in the Canadian oil and gas sector have helped to stimulate business investment confidence.\nSigns of a return to confidence in the Canadian housing market, including five-year mortgage rates returning to levels of five years ago, mean real estate will once again be a growth stimulant rather than a drag.\nOf course, as Poloz remarked, Canadian business still has an interest rate advantage.\u00a0U.S. interest rates\u00a0at 2.5 per cent are well above Canada's 1.75 per cent.\nFutures markets foresee Canada holding interest rates steady this year while the Fed makes three quarter-point cuts. Barring other potential shocks, that would put the two rates back into sync.\nWhile business confidence and a partial return to strength in oil and\u00a0housing markets are clear drivers, the central bankers say\u00a0continued strength in new hiring is slightly more mysterious.\nWilkins says economists have had trouble working out a clear relationship between the timing of GDP growth and waves of new hiring, just one of the complexities that make looking into the economy's future a far-from-exact science.\nDespite resolution of many of the trade worries the bank has described in the past, Poloz and Wilkins say they and their advisers still believe the biggest risk for Canada's economic future remains trade. The bank's strategy for trying to address something it cannot control is to draw up two divergent scenarios.\nFor those interested, the two extreme outlooks are described in Box 2 on Page 21 of the Monetary Policy Report. And of course the gloomier\u00a0one, an all-out trade war, is the more\u00a0interesting.\nIn describing this bleaker scenario Poloz\u00a0foresees that central banks, with their single superpower of making money cheap, simply may not be equipped to deal with the repercussions. And he says it is here that stock market investors, blithely assuming lower rates will always make stocks go higher, may be mistaken.\n\"The markets are not really onto the complexity of it,\" said Poloz, describing an event where trade barriers raised the cost of imports while a falling loonie added to the effect.\u00a0\n\"In that moment you have a trade-off between a slowing economy and rising unemployment and rising inflation at the same time,\" said Poloz. \"And obviously monetary policy would not be able to buffer both of those.\"\nAll the more reason for Canadians to hope the Bank of Canada's good news scenario where \"the global economy broadly returns to pre-2017 trade arrangements, and uncertainty about future trade policy dissipates\" is the one that comes true.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Alex Brockman", "title": "Yellowknife's housing market slows as economic slump looms on the horizon: CMHC", "description": "CMHC's annual report on Northern housing shows mixed outlook across the 3 territories ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cmhc-housing-territories-nwt-1.5263453", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3781447.1475014118!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/rentals.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 29, 2019 4:00 AM CT", "2019-08-29T10:00:00.306Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Yellowknife's housing market is cooling as the Northwest Territories' diamond mines approach the end of their lifespan and the territory's economic future increasingly looks bleak.\nThat assessment comes from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) in its latest annual report on housing in Canada's North.

company that owns those mines will pay\u00a0off a $550-million bond it owes creditors.\u00a0\nCredit ratings agency Moody's has downgraded Northwest Acquisitions ULC, a subsidiary of the conglomerate that owns parts of the Ekati and Diavik diamond mines.\u00a0\u00a0\nEarlier this month, Moody's changed its rating on a $550-million bond down to CAA1 from B3. It also changed its outlook from stable to negative. This means the agency is less confident that Northwest will be able to pay off the bond when it comes due in November 2022.\n\"The difference between a B and a CAA, that seems to be a cutoff in the market within that speculative or junk bond grade,\"\u00a0said Jamie Koutsoukis, a vice-president and senior analyst with Moody's Canada.\u00a0\n\"There's even less credibility when it moves to a CAA.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThough the Northwest bond has always been classified as a risky investment by Moody's standards, this downgrade is a significant step, she said.\u00a0Moody's best possible rating is AAA, which is reserved for what it sees as the safest investments, such as government bonds.\u00a0\nForecasting the future of the Ekati and Diavik diamond mines has become difficult since the Dominion Diamond Corporation was purchased by the Washington Companies in 2017.\u00a0\n\"There's no plan in place to extend the mine life at a time when the debt is coming closer and closer to coming due,\" explained Koutsoukis.\u00a0\n\"We continue to see a contraction in the time they have to develop this mine plan.\"\u00a0\nNorthwest Acquisitions\u00a0purchased all of the shares in the company\u00a0and the corporation is now\u00a0the privately-owned\u00a0Dominion Diamond Mines.\u00a0\nAs a private company ultimately owned by the Roy Dennis Washington Trust, Dominion is now subject to fewer public reporting requirements than companies that are publicly traded on the stock market.\u00a0\nIt remains silent on whether it has plans to extend the life of its mines, which are some of the territory's most significant employers. Projections suggest Diavik is expected to close within the next decade and Ekati would need significant expansion to continue producing into the 2030s.\u00a0\nOne possible expansion, of the Jay pipe at Ekati, was put on hold in May 2018. \u00a0At the time, a spokesperson for Dominion Diamond Mines said it was to study whether the project could make enough money. There has been no information on that project since.\u00a0\nEmails seeking comment from Dominion Diamond Mines for this story and an update on the expansion were not immediately returned to CBC News.\u00a0\nPaul Zimnisky, a diamond-industry analyst based in New York, says the markets are in the dark as well, waiting for an announcement on the company's plans.\u00a0\n\"Dominion is probably going to have to make a decision relatively soon,\" he said in an email. \"The economics of the potential expansion options are probably OK-to-good, but not great, which is why there has not been a decision yet.\"\u00a0\nTo the markets, either Dominion extends the life of Ekati or it doesn't, he said. Whatever decision it\u00a0makes\u00a0would affect how much money the company has to pay back its creditors and whether it will be able to pay off its debt.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Limited supply of cannabis edibles nearly ready in N.L.", "description": "'Start low, go slow,' advises NLC's cannabis project lead Peter Murphy", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/cannabis-edibles-date-1.5397543", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5326858.1576589760!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/aurora-edibles-chocolate-cannabis.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 16, 2019 2:05 PM NT", "2019-12-16T17:35:03.244Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "While some provinces are waiting to get through regulations allowing the sale of edible cannabis items, products are hitting the shelves in Newfoundland and Labrador this week.\nEdible cannabis products are officially permitted for sale as of Tuesday.\nHowever, supply is expected to be limited while suppliers get their stock and supply sorted, says Peter Murphy, cannabis project lead at the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation.\n\"Some of our licensed producers are actually going to airship things in, so maybe by the end of the week this week you should see some things,\" Murphy said.\n\"This week we anticipate some chocolates, some soft chews, some hard candies and maybe some baked goods.\"\nMurphy said the rollout of edible products will be a \"slow roll,\" with about 10 items available in stores and online this week, with a growing selection coming online in early 2020.\n\"Then you'll start to see some carbonated beverages, you'll see some still beverages, and some tea bags,\" Murphy said.\n\"So it'll be very interesting to see how they do in Newfoundland, given the popularity of tea.\"\nMurphy said people should make themselves aware of cannabis edible use on Health Canada's website, and keep in mind that it's a far different experience from smoking.\n\"When you inhale cannabis, that pretty much hits you almost instantaneously.

You can read the first and second\u00a0articles, and listen to a West of Centre podcast about it here.\nCBC News commissioned this public opinion research before concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic mounted. About half of the total survey of 1,200 respondents was conducted before stock markets and oil prices plunged (March 2-8).\u00a0 The other half of the interviews took place after this economic shock (March 9-18). Growing concerns about the pandemic continue to shape public attitudes. As with all polls, this one is a snapshot in time. CBC News \u2014 and the public opinion experts consulted on this survey research \u2014 believe the data offers some valuable insights into Albertans'\u00a0attitudes about the economy and politics just at the moment when COVID-19 changed everything.\nRight about now, the\u00a0fair deal panel report was supposed to be submitted to the Alberta government. That deadline has been extended until Easter.\u00a0\nI don't know what the report will say, but what we do know is that we are in the middle of a global COVID-19 pandemic, and Wexit supporters have gone silent. So have Albertans who have claimed for years that the province is getting a raw deal from the rest of Canada.\u00a0\nClearly, the reason why critics of Alberta's place in Confederation have gone quiet is that the benefits of being in Canada have become so apparent. The federal government and provincial governments have been co-operating, with little public friction, in addressing the severe health and economic impacts of COVID-19.\u00a0\nThe give and take of Confederation in this time of enormous stress\u00a0appears to be working rather well.\nGovernments at all levels have been listening to experts, particularly their chief medical officers, in responding to this unprecedented crisis. Unlike the United States, provinces are not competing for scarce medical resources.\u00a0\nMore importantly, the benefits of federal resources have become apparent, as Ottawa is deploying an $82-billion economic rescue package. In addition, Alberta awaits an imminent financial bailout package from Ottawa for its oil and gas sector.\u00a0\nBut even before the impact of this pandemic became clear, before the conciliatory tones at the podiums and this new imperative for interprovincial and federal co-operation, Albertans showed little support for the fair deal proposals.\nAs polling data from the CBC News Road Ahead 2020 survey illustrates, proposals for greater Alberta autonomy in Canada were well below majority territory, and support for separatism was even lower.\u00a0\nSince this survey took place March 2-18, just at the moment when oil and gas prices fell and the first stages of the pandemic response were initiated, it is highly likely that those low numbers would be even lower today as the COVID crisis deepens.\nWhile Alberta's dissatisfaction with Canada had been growing over the past several years, it became white hot in the aftermath of the October 2019 federal election.\u00a0\nThere were no Liberal MPs elected between Winnipeg and Vancouver, the Trudeau government was scrambling to address a national unity problem, and the Wexit movement was gaining steam.\u00a0\nIn the midst of this turmoil, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney outlined his fair deal agenda.\u00a0\nA panel would be created to explore the feasibility of establishing a provincial tax collection agency (replacing Revenue Canada), a provincial pension fund (replacing the Canadian Pension Plan), a provincial police force (replacing the RCMP), and other measures designed to generate more autonomy for Alberta within Canada.\nThis panel conducted town halls across the province in December and January, built an online survey instrument, and was to issue a report to the Kenney government by March 2020.\u00a0\nIn a March 13, 2020, appearance on the West of Centre podcast,\u00a0panellists Donna Kennedy-Glans and Drew Barnes said that during their town hall meetings there was overwhelming\u00a0support for the proposals.\nThis would have been consistent with the views of members of the United Conservative Party (UCP) who unanimously endorsed all of the fair deal proposals at their AGM on Dec.\u00a01, 2019.\nKennedy-Glans and Barnes were likely correct that the people they listened to agreed with greater autonomy for Alberta in Canada. However, that was not a representative sample of all Albertans.\u00a0\nIn fact, as the CBC News Road Ahead public opinion data shows, just before and in the first days of the current pandemic situation, most Albertans gave a thumbs down to the\u00a0proposals.\u00a0\nMany Albertans still said they were unhappy with the federal equalization program. Seventy per cent of respondents agreed with the statement \"Canada's system of equalization payments is unfair to Alberta.\" (This was the same percentage as the 2018 CBC Road Ahead survey.) Nevertheless, there was little appetite for a radical restructuring of Alberta's place in Canada.\nLet's look a the numbers for some other fair deal proposals:\nOnly 37 per cent of Albertans agreed that \"the provincial government should establish an Alberta Pension Plan to replace the Canada Pension Plan for Albertans.\"\u00a0\nOnly 34 per cent agreed that \"the provincial government should establish an Alberta Revenue Agency to collect our own taxes and replace the Canada Revenue Agency.\"\u00a0\nOnly 31 per cent agreed that \"the provincial government should establish an Alberta Police Force that would take over rural policing from the RCMP.\"\u00a0\nAs far as separatism was concerned, only 25 per cent agreed that \"Alberta would be better off if it separated from Canada.\"\nObviously, there was a major disconnect between those who attended the UCP AGM and the fair deal panel's town halls versus Albertans as a whole. These numbers highlight the stark difference between those who self-select and those who are a representative sample.\u00a0\nWhen we look deeper into the data, the cross-tabs on the CBC News Road Ahead 2020 survey provide more information about who might have been attending those town halls, and who supports the fair deal proposals.\nIn general, supporters are male, from rural Alberta, work in the oil and gas sector, vote\u00a0for the UCP, don't have a university degree\u00a0and identify\u00a0as ideologically right of centre.\nThere's a lot of numbers here. But they tell a story.\nFor example, here are the percentages for those who wanted an Alberta Police Force:\nLook at the way the numbers break down by gender and education levels. Look at the divide between urban and rural, private versus public sector, and by political leaning.\nAnd it is notable that even the strongest demographic groups for the fair deal proposals were still shy of 50 per cent.\nThese low numbers for the\u00a0proposals and separatism should not be surprising.\u00a0\nAfter all, Albertans, many of whom have roots across the country, have always been attached to Canada. According to the CBC News Road Ahead 2020 survey, 18 per cent are more attached to Canada than Alberta. While 29 per cent are more attached to Alberta than Canada. And\u00a052 per cent are equally attached to Alberta and Canada.\nThe\u00a0panel report was supposed to be delivered by the end of March, until the deadline was extended. This polling was done between March 2 and March 18. Since then, it can seem that the entire economic landscape of Alberta has shifted, and no doubt numbers and opinions have shifted along with that.\nHow the political landscape could shift we won't know for some time. There are still far too many unanswered questions.\nWhat does the report to the Kenney government state? How will the government respond? Will it be publicly released? If so, when?\nWill the Kenney government, as was promised, hold a referendum on the proposals? Who would hold a referendum on proposals that have the support of about one-third of Albertans? Would there be an appetite for a major fight with Ottawa in the midst of a health pandemic and a major economic recession?\u00a0\nIf I were Premier Kenney, I would put the report on the shelf and say that this is not the time to pursue the fair deal proposals in the midst of a pandemic.\nAlberta alienation has waxed and waned over the past century. It reached a peak in the fall of 2019, and now, in the spring of 2020, it has reached a trough.\u00a0\nCrises often bring people together, but the fact is Albertans did not want greater autonomy from Canada before this crisis.\nMethodology:\nThe CBC News random survey of 1,200 Albertans was conducted using a hybrid method between March 2 and March 18, 2020, by Edmonton-based Trend Research under the direction of Janet Brown Opinion Research. The sample is representative along regional, age\u00a0and gender factors. The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For subsets, the margin of error is larger.\nThe survey used a hybrid methodology that involved contacting survey respondents by telephone and giving them the option of completing the survey at that time, at another more convenient time, or receiving an email link and completing the survey online. Trend Research contacted people using a random list of numbers, consisting of half land lines and half cellphone numbers. Telephone numbers were dialled up to five times at five different times of day before another telephone number was added to the sample. The response rate among valid numbers (i.e. residential and personal) was 13.2 per cent.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U.S. nears goal line in coronavirus stimulus negotiations, Senate leaders say", "description": "Trump hopes economy is 'raring to go' by April 12, but WHO concerned about U.S. disease response", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-coronavirus-legislation-tuesday-1.5507858", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5508186.1585068577!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/virus-outbreak-oregon.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 24, 2020 11:01 AM ET", "2020-03-24T22:47:06.056Z"], "source": null, "content": "Democrats and Republicans said Tuesday they were close to reaching a deal on a $2 trillion US\u00a0coronavirus economic stimulus package, raising hopes that the U.S. Congress could soon act to try to limit the economic fallout from the pandemic.\nDemocrats have twice blocked attempts to advance the bill, saying it did not provide enough money for states and hospitals, lacked sufficient aid for unemployed Americans and did not include adequate supervision of a massive fund to aid big businesses.\nRepublicans, Democrats and top aides to President Donald Trump have negotiated for days over the package, which would be the third and largest passed to address the crisis if it is backed by both the Republican-majority Senate and Democratic-majority House of Representatives.\nTrump's administration has launched a major push for action to try to blunt the economic impact of the pandemic and steep stock market decline, after he spent weeks dismissing the risks.\nTrump said during a Fox News appearance Tuesday that the White House could consider extending its 15-day guidelines to promote social distancing, announced on March 16, but he also indicated it was not his\u00a0preference.\n\"I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,\" he said from the Rose Garden.

Millions of masks coming as back up to States,\" Trump said.\nIn another development, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said Tuesday it would award\u00a0$100 million immediately to 1,381 health centres\u00a0across the nation to bolster their response to the pandemic.\nThe health centres may use the funds to meet screening and testing needs, acquire medical supplies and boost telehealth capacity, the HHS said. The $100 million was earmarked in an emergency spending bill of\u00a0$8.3 billion signed by Trump on March 6.\n"}, {"author": "Bani Sapra and Paul Wiseman", "title": "Why Trump tariffs haven't revitalized American steelmakers", "description": "U.S. president's fight against foreign steel overshadowed by trade war with China ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-tariffs-steelmakers-1.5348012", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5348019.1572958495!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trump-s-steel-tariffs-short-lived-hopes.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 05, 2019 8:24 AM ET", "2019-11-05T13:24:55.881Z"], "source": null, "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump's move last year to tax imported steel triggered jeers but also cheers. Its goal \u2014 to raise steel prices \u2014 threatened to hurt the legions of U.S. manufacturers that depend on steel.\nBut at least it would benefit\u00a0steel companies and the Americans who work for them. That was the idea, anyway.\nYet Trump's 25 per cent\u00a0tariffs, it turns out, have done little for the people they were supposed to help. After enjoying a brief tariff-induced sugar high last year, American steelmakers are reeling. Steel prices and company earnings have sunk. Investors have dumped their stocks.\nThe industry has added just 1,800 jobs since February 2018, the month before the tariffs took effect. That's a mere rounding error in a job market of 152 million and over a period when U.S. companies overall added nearly four\u00a0million workers. Steelmakers employ 10,000 fewer people than they did five years ago.\n\"Even with these very high tariffs, the industry has not been able to take advantage,\" said Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at Mercatus Center, an economic think-tank at George Mason University.\nTrump's pledge to rejuvenate the steel industry had helped him win votes in the 2016 election in such key states as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. His inability to deliver a boom for the industry raises doubts about how he'll fare in those states in 2020. Voters will be weighing whether to move on from Trump or reward him for at least taking the fight to foreign steel mills.\nWhat's caused steel prices to fall are factors ranging from lower demand \u2014 thanks to a weaker global economy \u2014 to the industry's own rush to boost production after Trump's tariffs took effect.\nFor the first few months after Trump's tariffs took effect, steel prices did rise. The price of a metric ton of hot rolled band steel hit $1,006 US in July 2018, according to the SteelBenchmarker website, which tracks steel prices. Since then, it has plunged to $557 \u2014 lower than before the tariffs.\n\"Over time, (pricing has) come down, down, down, down, down,\" said Mark Lash, president of United Steelworkers Local 1066 in Gary, Ind., which represents about 1,400 workers at US Steel's plant there.\nThe president's campaign against foreign steel has been overshadowed by his trade war with China over Beijing's industrial policies, which are widely seen as predatory. But the steel tariffs came earlier and demonstrated Trump's willingness to overturn seven decades of U.S. free-trade policies and aggressively target imports.\nBy taxing imported steel, Trump risked raising costs for the many U.S. industries that use steel, straining ties with American allies and defying the limits of his authority to unilaterally punish trading partners.\nBut Trump was determined to revive heavy industries like steel and protect them from what he termed unfair foreign competition. He installed a veteran lawyer for the steel industry, Robert Lighthizer, as his top trade negotiator.\nThe impulse to protect steelmakers was in some ways odd. After all, the economic benefits of protecting steel are modest: The industry employs just 142,000 people. By comparison, Home Depot alone employs 400,000. And the newest steel plants are highly automated. They don't need nearly as many workers as steelworks of the past did, so the potential job gains are limited.\nNevertheless, Trump's trade team decided steel was worth fighting for. For decades, good-paying steel jobs had lifted millions of blue-collar workers into the middle class.\nOne of them, Doug May, spent 43 years working at US Steel's Granite City plant in Illinois before retiring. Since the Great Recession, that plant has idled and restarted its furnaces at least twice. Despite the instability, May says the Granite City plant provided a solid job.\n\"You can really raise a family,\" he said. \"I sent three boys to college working there.\"\nInitially, steelworkers cheered the tariffs.\n\"Right after Trump made the announcement, US Steel announced that they'd be restarting one of the two furnaces they'd idled,\" May said. \"Everybody was pretty excited.\"\nTrump had unsheathed an unconventional weapon. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 gives the president broad authority to tax imports that his Commerce Department decrees a threat to national security. Section 232 tariffs are also hard to challenge at the World Trade Organization. The WTO grants countries broad leeway to determine their national security interests.\nIn January, Trump boasted on Twitter: \"Tariffs on the 'dumping' of Steel in the United States have totally revived our Steel Industry... A BIG WIN FOR U.S.\"\nThe good times didn't last.\nThe first sign of trouble showed up on the stock market. Shares of steelmakers had topped out on Wall Street in February 2018 before the tariffs hit. Since then, the NYSE Arca Steel Index has plunged 32 per cent.\nAnd the tariffs have so far done nothing to blunt China's dominance. China accounts for 54 per cent\u00a0of world steel production. The United States, five\u00a0per cent.\nWhat went wrong?\nGrowth is slowing in the United States and worldwide partly because Trump's own tariffs have raised costs and escalated uncertainties for businesses. Slower growth means less business for steel mills.\n\"Market demand right now is relatively soft,\" said Charles Bradford, an independent steel analyst.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Southwestern Ontario hospitals could run out of surgical face masks in 5 days, officials warn", "description": "500,000 masks have been ordered but are being held at Chinese customs, Ontario Nurses Association says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/ontario-nurses-association-masks-supply-covid-19-update-1.5520187", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5507279.1586799335!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/philippines.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 03, 2020 8:01 AM ET", "2020-04-04T18:19:43.887Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As the province braces for a spike in COVID-19 cases, Southwestern Ontario is days away from running out of desperately needed masks that protect health care workers from the spread of the deadly virus, CBC News has learned.\u00a0\nFor the 20 hospitals in the region that stretches from Windsor to Woodstock and is supplied by Healthcare Materials Management Services (HMMS), which buys supplies for the hospitals, the region will run out of surgical masks with face shields in five days, the Ontario Nurses Association (ONA) has told its members.\u00a0\nEarlier this week, workers at the London Health Sciences Centre were told to wear surgical masks at all times while in the hospital, but were also told they'd only get two masks per shift, unless the masks got soiled.\u00a0\nIn a letter to nurses sent by ONA and obtained by CBC News, the situation with N95\u00a0respirators, which protect against small particles and are worn during surgery and around patients suspected of or diagnosed with having COVID-19, is even more dire.\u00a0\nThere is just a seven-day supply of N95\u00a01870 masks, an 11-day supply of N95 8210 masks and just over a months supply of N95 1860 masks.\u00a0\nMore masks have been ordered by HMMS, but 500,000 of them are being held at Chinese customs and another 700,000 masks have been sourced but they've yet to be produced and it's unknown if an American-made component in those masks will be restricted for sale in the United States, according to ONA.\u00a0\nSome nurses at the London Health Sciences Centre have been refusing to work without the masks.\u00a0\nCBC News has reached out repeatedly to the London Health Sciences Centre and St. Joseph's Health Care, which have refused interviews about the supply of personal protection equipment.

But it also underlined for the public the seriousness of the situation and put the prime minister in a position to practise what he's preached\u00a0by taking personal responsibility and isolating himself for 14 days.\n\"Of course it's an inconvenience and somewhat frustrating,\" Trudeau said. \"We're all social beings, after all, but we have to do this because we have to protect our neighbours and our friends, especially our more vulnerable seniors and people with pre-existing conditions.\"\nIt might also provide some small measure of reassurance to a skittish public if/when the prime minister and his family emerge after two weeks with clean bills of health.\nBut this will not all be over in a couple of weeks.\nThis historic global and national crisis \u2014 a crisis that can't be easily compared to any recent disruption \u2014\u00a0will not pass quickly or quietly. What has challenged Trudeau and other leaders over this frantic past week \u2014 the monumental task of effectively and responsibly responding to a global pandemic and all of the social and economic side effects that come with it \u2014 will continue to challenge them for weeks and months to come.\nOn that score, the last few days might offer just a hint of how difficult this will be, and how much will be demanded of political and health authorities.\nThat a crisis of some kind was taking shape has been apparent for some time \u2014 since mid-January\u00a0at least, when China began taking extraordinary measures to deal with an outbreak. But what might have seemed like a distant rumble for several weeks became a deafening roar over the last five days.\nFirst, the stock markets became jittery. Then came Donald Trump's calamitous address to the American people. Then everything seemed to start happening at once \u2014 sports leagues suspended their seasons, major events were cancelled, celebrities announced their diagnoses, the prime minister's wife reported experiencing flu-like symptoms.\nOn Wednesday morning, the Trudeau government announced a series of measures to deal with some of the effects of COVID-19's spread. Twenty-four hours later, it seemed like that announcement had happened in a different era.\nIt is a feature, not a bug, of federalism that the responsibility for public health care is shared across governments. But\u00a0in situations such as this, that can lead to varied responses. At times on Thursday there were different decisions being made in different provinces on school closures and public gatherings. British Columbia announced a rule for non-essential travel on Thursday, then a federal guideline on travelling abroad was made official on Friday.\nIn the current crisis, it's also easy to make comparisons between countries \u2014 to see which nations have moved further and faster.\nCombined with the\u00a0clamour\u00a0of social media, the\u00a0COVID-19 outbreak\u00a0has the potential to be\u00a0treated as something like an arms race\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with the nations\u00a0moving fastest and most aggressively being seen as the ones taking the\u00a0\"best\"\u00a0approach, however oversimplified such conclusions tend to be.\nThe Trudeau government might get credit for not jumping at dramatic\u00a0but inefficient\u00a0responses. If the finer points of public policy are going to be watched closer than ever, however, government officials have to fully explain both what they're doing and why they're not doing something else. Platitudes won't work.  But explaining things has rarely been a strength of the Trudeau government,\u00a0which tends to prefer gauzy expressions of\u00a0vision and values to details and descriptions.\nIn that respect, one of the government's best assets right now might be Health Minister Patty Hajdu, the plain-spoken former director of a homeless shelter in Thunder Bay. On Wednesday, it was Hajdu who framed the potential infection rate.\nOn Friday, she stepped forward to explain the arguments against banning travellers from entering the country, pointing out that such measures don't seem to have helped the situation in Italy. (It was also Hajdu who broke the tension somewhat with a crack about how she didn't need Chrystia Freeland's step-stool to see over the podium.)\nThe backbone of the public response in Canada has been the presence of senior health officials at the federal and provincial levels \u2014 the steady, serious and knowledgeable doctors\u00a0who\u00a0have been put front and centre for regular public updates.\u00a0Speaking outside his official residence on Friday (with reporters positioned a safe distance away), Trudeau stressed the central role of expertise in the official effort.\n\"We will continue to make decisions based on recommendations of medical experts, public health authorities and top scientists,\" he said. \"We're not closing the door to any further steps but we will make those decisions based on what science tells us.\"\nThat's reassuring\u00a0in its own way\u00a0\u2014 even if science can't magically make this problem go away, and even if relying on science won't absolve elected politicians of responsibility for any mistakes that are made.\nThursday was discombobulating. The government's statements in question period were lacking in detail and the prime minister was in isolation. Friday was full of official activity.\nGovernment House Leader Pablo Rodr\u00edguez, flanked by his opposition counterparts, announced from the foyer of the House of Commons that Parliament would be suspended until April. A half dozen ministers and the chief medical officer then appeared at the National Press Theatre to outline new measures to respond to the medical emergency. The prime minister emerged from Rideau Cottage around noon with promises of significant new government assistance. Then Finance Minister Bill Morneau and the governor of the Bank of Canada appeared at the National Press Theatre to explain further steps to support the economy.\n\"Addressing COVID-19 must be a Team Canada effort,\" Trudeau said.\nThat national effort would no doubt benefit from the prime minister keeping all governments aligned, and including the opposition parties as much as possible.\nBut the potential points of stress and friction are many. What's happening now might be compared to the experience of wartime \u2014\u00a0the sort of war that includes a massive domestic effort. In a matter of days, huge portions of Canadian society have shut down, if only temporarily.\nBut this is not a war. The foe is far less tangible\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the threat is much closer to home.\nPublic anxiety could turn to frustration. Systems and institutions have yet to be truly tested. Many Indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable.\nResources will need to keep flowing. Communication will need to be regular and nimble. Governments may have to be creative. There will be ample opportunities to second-guess. Some will be quick to assign blame. And ultimately, Canadian officials and citizens can only control what occurs within our own borders.\nIf the stock markets are a useful barometer, the Trudeau government did reasonably well on Friday: after falling throughout the morning, the Toronto Stock Exchange picked up after noon and finished more than 1,200 points up for the day.\nBut that is just one afternoon. Trudeau might need to prepare Canadians for a long and difficult haul.\n\"Every order of government is working to stop the spread of the virus. Businesses and citizens are taking precautions. We have outstanding public health authorities who are doing an outstanding job,\" Trudeau said at the conclusion of his prepared remarks on Friday. \"We will get through this together.\"\nThat's likely the message that Canadians need to hear right now. It could be\u00a0the spirit that carries the day.\nBut there are many such days to come. And many of those days are likely to be difficult.\n"}, {"author": "Geoff Leo", "title": "Depleted national stockpile leaves Canada reliant on China for masks, gowns and other supplies during pandemic", "description": "Health Canada has temporarily lowered its standard for the importation of PPE to meet demand", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/ppe-import-china-shortage-1.5552426", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5533761.1587241533!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ppe-covid-19.JPG", "publishedAt": ["May 06, 2020 2:00 AM CT", "2020-05-07T01:23:50.977Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "More than two months into the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0pandemic, federal and provincial governments are using\u00a0extraordinary measures to supply health-care workers with personal protective equipment, including letting them use expired masks.\nAnd with more than 61,000 cases of\u00a0COVID-19 coast to coast, and the country reaching the milestone of more than 4,000 deaths on Tuesday, supplies are just trickling in from overseas suppliers.\nIn March, Ottawa passed an\u00a0interim order\u00a0that allows\u00a0masks, face shields and gowns to be imported and sold in Canada\u00a0even if they do not meet\u00a0Health Canada's pre-COVID-19 standards.\nHealth Canada hasn't responded to questions from CBC\u00a0News about\u00a0the ways in which it has relaxed its rules, but the order's description says that the products must still be \"manufactured according to comparable standards.\"\nThe United States appears to be taking a similar approach. The U.S. Food and Drug administration\u00a0says that \"for the duration of the pandemic,\"\u00a0it will allow the importation of KN95 masks, which are respirators manufactured according to Chinese standards.\u00a0\nAs of April 30, Health Canada had ordered 1.8 billion units of\u00a0PPE,\u00a0from masks to gloves to gowns.\u00a0Of the 36 devices approved so far under the order,\u00a034\u00a0are manufacturers in China, including Wuhan Orient Honest International Trade Co.,\u00a0Shandong\u00a0Zhushi\u00a0Pharmaceutical Group Co.,\u00a0and Peek-a-Boo!

The chief difficulty, she said, \"is sorting out the good and the bad apples.\"\nLast month, China's own government revealed it had seized 89 million pieces of poor-quality product. Canada has also received at least one million masks from China that don't meet its standards since the pandemic began.\u00a0\nHealth Canada's interim order was\u00a0prompted by\u00a0what the agency's\u00a0website calls\u00a0an \"unprecedented and urgent need for medical devices during the\u00a0COVID-19 crisis.\" That demand has caused critical shortages, it says.\u00a0\nThe shortage is also leading some provinces to make unusual decisions.\nFor example,\u00a0CBC\u00a0News has learned that the Saskatchewan Health Authority has decided to allow health care workers to start using expired N95 masks from its stockpile.\nThey were purchased during the\u00a0H1N1\u00a0outbreak in 2009-2010. The province says they expired after five years, meaning they've been expired for about five years.\nThe province told\u00a0CBC\u00a0News the masks were stored in optimal conditions and have been tested by an independent lab \"where they passed both inhalation/exhalation and filtration tests.\"\u00a0\nThe province pointed\u00a0CBC\u00a0News to\u00a0a Health Canada directive that said\u00a0while ordinarily, expired masks should be discarded,\u00a0in such unusual times, \"an expired mask can still be effective at protecting health care providers if the straps are intact, there are no visible signs of damage, [and] they can be fit-tested.\"\nCBC\u00a0recently reported that last May,\u00a0Ottawa threw two million expired\u00a0N95\u00a0masks into the Regina landfill when it emptied its medical supply warehouse in the city. Those masks had also been purchased around the time of the\u00a0H1N1\u00a0outbreak.\u00a0\nThe president of the Canadian Medical Association, Dr. Sandy\u00a0Buchman, says such exceptional measures make some doctors anxious.\n\"That sends a signal, a message to us, that we're getting substandard supply, and that is putting us and our patients \u2026 at risk,\" he said.\nBuchman\u00a0said he's been hearing from doctors from across Canada who are concerned about a lack of quantity and quality of\u00a0PPE.\u00a0\n\"In certain regions, specifically like in Alberta, the doctors felt the supplies were substandard, and they couldn't be used,\"\u00a0Buchman\u00a0said.\u00a0\nHe said this highlights a failure of government planning.\n\"If we had planned properly and monitored these provincial and federal\u00a0supplies of the equipment, we wouldn't be scrambling,\" he said. \"We would be stockpiled and ready to go.\"\u00a0\nOn April 22, Sally Thornton a vice-president with the Public Health Agency of Canada, which is responsible for the National Emergency Strategic Stockpile (NESS), told the federal standing committee on health that the stockpile was \"doing well.\"\u00a0\n\"The NESS had been actually monitored and stockpiled as it was mandated and funded to do,\" she said.\nThornton told the politicians that provinces and territories are primarily responsible for stocking their own supplies and Ottawa is merely there to provide \"surge capacity\" in a time of crisis.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut\u00a0Wesley\u00a0Wark, a national security expert from the University of Ottawa who's studied Canada's national stockpile,\u00a0said the pandemic has exposed a gaping hole in Canada's supply chain that urgently needs to be filled.\u00a0\n\"The NESS concept has failed Canada in this current crisis,\" he said.\nPatty\u00a0Hajdu, the federal health minister, has publicly acknowledged\u00a0Canada \"likely did not have enough\"\u00a0PPE\u00a0in its national stockpile.\nWatch: Health Minister Patty\u00a0Hajdu\u00a0addresses the need for personal protective equipment:\nWark\u00a0says Canada has made efforts to spur domestic production of\u00a0PPE but says that's more of a long-term solution.\u00a0\n\"We find ourselves in a position where China is our only hope,\" he said.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\u00a0is co-ordinating\u00a0the purchasing of\u00a0PPE\u00a0for the provinces and territories.\u00a0\n\"Over the coming weeks, some companies that required time to scale up their operations will begin delivering supplies on a regular basis,\" said an explanatory note attached to the May 1 update on Public Services and Procurement Canada's website.\u00a0\n\"Given the high global demand for these goods, there is a possibility that not all contracts will be entirely fulfilled.\"\nThornton\u00a0said once a supplier has been chosen, the products are visually inspected in China. Once they arrive in Canada, they're given more\u00a0rigorous\u00a0testing in\u00a0a lab.\nShe says Canada will need to exercise great due diligence in such an uneven market.\n\"I know what a Wild West market it is out there. It's very complicated,\" she said.\nThere have been a host of concerns about\u00a0PPE\u00a0from China.\nIn a meeting of the standing committee on government operations last month, Bill\u00a0Matthews, the deputy minister of public services and procurement, confirmed the government had received a shipment of one million masks from China that, when tested, were deemed to be substandard. He said the manufacturer \"is going to provide replacement product.\"\u00a0\nOn its list of received supplies, Canada notes that while it has received more than nine million\u00a0N95\u00a0respirators, \"a significant portion of these remain under testing.\"\u00a0\nOn April 18,\u00a0CBC reported that health care workers in Alberta\u00a0are complaining about the quality of masks brought in from China.\nAccording to\u00a0an April 27 report in the state-owned China Daily, market regulators seized 89 million masks and 418,000 other protective supplies.\u00a0\nThe country's\u00a0vice-minister of the state administration for market regulation,\u00a0Gan\u00a0Lin, is quoted as saying \"we mainly clamped down on those producing or selling fake, expired or [low-quality]\u00a0protective materials, including masks and disinfectants, and people who falsified others' trademarks to mislead consumers.\"\u00a0\nOn its website,\u00a0Makrite\u00a0Industries, one the manufacturers recently approved under the government's interim order to fast-track\u00a0PPE\u00a0to Canada,\u00a0has sounded the alarm about fraudulent products.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Please be warned that the 9500-N95\u00a0particulate respirator shown in the pictures is a counterfeit product. It is not manufactured by\u00a0Makrite,\" the company said in an April 8 news release.\nOng, the China specialist,\u00a0said that in normal times, China had well-established companies that provided the world with quality\u00a0PPE. But\u00a0the global pandemic has spurred many new entrants to the market, she said.\n\"It is only by going to the factory, looking at their quality and looking at the certification one by one, that you're able sort that out.\"\u00a0\nCanada says that's exactly what it's doing. Anita\u00a0Anand, the federal minister of public services and procurement,\u00a0told the standing committee on health that Canada has retained the accounting and auditing firm\u00a0Deloitte, which \"plays a role in vetting suppliers and helping us with our supply chain.\"\u00a0\nWhen asked why Canada doesn't get the supplies tested in China, Thornton said \"we do prefer to do them here. It's good to have our National Research Council, our own testing and our own engineers taking a look at it. [We are] very cautious about what we'd send out to health care workers.\"\nWhile there will be some challenges,\u00a0Wark\u00a0says, the Chinese government will work hard to ensure Canada gets quality products.\u00a0\n\"China wants to be able to retain a reputation not just as a mass supplier of goods but as a supplier of goods that work and of sophisticated goods,\" he said. \"That's important to China's self-reputation.\"\u00a0\nThornton said while Ottawa is playing the role of co-ordinator\u00a0in the ordering of\u00a0PPE\u00a0internationally, early on in the pandemic response, it was flying blind. There wasn't a clear picture of what supplies were held by each province and where the shortages might be.\u00a0\n\"We are not that familiar with what provinces had in their respective stockpiles,\" Thornton told the committee. \"So, very quickly, we got a heads-up in terms of where there would be national gaps.\"\nShe said in early February, provinces were asked to fill out a survey indicating what supplies they had and what they needed.\u00a0\nWark\u00a0said if Ottawa doesn't know what the provinces have, then \"you can't build NESS on the basis of being sure it's complementary to provincial stockpiles.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nIn addition, he pointed out, the provinces have no idea what Ottawa has in stock.\u00a0\n\"That is, it seems to me, a huge strategic problem,\" he said.\nHe said it's a problem politicians had better fix because public health officials are predicting multiple waves of\u00a0COVID-19 infections, which means this crisis could go on for years.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "City to look at new approach to creating affordable housing", "description": "The plan would offer interest-free loans to developers ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/community-improvement-plan-affordable-housing-london-1.5359508", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898140.1574795007!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/john-fleming.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Nov 14, 2019 1:18 PM ET", "2019-11-14T18:18:21.890Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As city politicians continue to look for ways to address the lack of affordable housing in London, a new approach to the problem has emerged.\nNext week, the planning committee will debate the merits of a community improvement plan, a legal device that allows municipalities to provide grants and loans to developers to spur the development of more affordable housing options.\nThe municipal contribution would then unlock access to a large pool of federal funding for affordable housing.\n\"The idea is to use our money wisely through a loan process, leverage affordable housing units, leverage the federal dollars, and ultimately increase the supply of affordable housing in our community\", said the city's director of planning, John Fleming.\nHe says the plan would encourage the development of housing options for people who don't qualify for public housing but can't afford the current housing market.\n\"It's another layer where we can get affordable housing for a variety of folks.

It's unfortunate that across Canada we are after losing such a large percentage of our farmers.\"\nNuMink is owned by the Newfoundland\u00a0seafood giant Barry Group, and it's just the latest operation to exit the fur industry amid one of the most painful global downturns to hit the sector.\nThe closure will impact 15 workers, but the company hopes to provide them employment in its growing seafood business.\n\"It has been our priority to make sure all of those people will be looked after within our fish plant,\" she explained.\nFarmers hoping they had seen the end of the market collapse are slowly losing hope for a turnaround, and it's led to a series of closures and consolidations, with Viking Furs in Cavendish, Trinity Bay, emerging as the dominant player. And in order to remain viable, Viking is trying to diversify by raising beef cattle.\n\"As this operational reorganization occurs, the industry that's left could be very, very strong. Very robust,\" said Fisheries and Land Resources Minister Gerry Byrne.\u00a0\"There still will be a demand for fur.\"\nNot long ago, there was a long list of mink and fox farmers in the province, supplying a booming market in places like China and Russia, and benefiting from soaring prices for their pelts.\nThat strong market inspired a surge in fur production, led by nations such as Denmark, resulting in a glut and subsequent market crash.\n\"Unfortunately it has dragged on longer than anybody would have anticipated,\" Moores\u00a0said.\nThe\u00a0Chinese market has softened because of a shift away from natural furs, and an increase in fur production in that Asian country.\nThe Russian market has also tanked because of a struggling economy, and soured trading relations over Russia's controversial annexation of Crimea.\nThe signs of a collapse are just about everywhere, with the fur industry continuing to be buffeted by critics who oppose the wearing of furs.\n\"There are no shortage of challenges right now that we're facing,\" said Moores.\nAnd when it comes to support, Byrne admitted the provincial government has other priorities: specifically, food production.\n\"As a province (that) only grows one-tenth of what we consume, we know there will be a very ready, strong marketplace, and a public policy good, to creating our own food security. That's why I as minister am really targeting food production,\" Byrne said.\nThe latest hit to the fur industry's reputation emerged last month, with word out of Buckingham Palace that Queen Elizabeth II is opting for fake fur in her outfits.\nSeveral large cities in the United States, including San Francisco, have banned fur sales.\nThe historic North American Fur Auctions is now in creditor protection, with the Toronto-based auction house getting out of the business of selling furs.\nAnd Nova Scotia, once the leading fur-producing province in the country, has had its industry decimated, plummeting from 125 to just 25 fur farms.\nFarmers in Newfoundland and Labrador have not been hit quite so hard, largely because they enjoy a competitive advantage when it comes to food supplies for their operations.\nByproducts from fish and poultry processing factories that would otherwise be sent to the landfill is recycled into nutritious feed stock for mink and other fur farms.\nAs a result, pelt production in the province has remained relatively stable.\n\"In all of Canada I'd have to think we're probably the only province that has been able to maintain our level of production,\" said Moores.\nAnd Moores\u00a0says there's an environmental argument to be made for supporting the fur industry because products are biodegradable\u00a0and animal welfare standards have never been higher.\nShe said most clothing is now made of synthetics, which means each times they are washed, plastic particles are drained into the oceans, and then consumed by marine animals that might end up in the food chain.\n\"We have to do a better job of getting our message out there,\" she said.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "Investors are paying bond sellers to take their money in these crazy economic times", "description": "Governments running up deficits that taxpayers must repay is an equally bad idea", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/negative-yield-and-deficit-spending-1.5310352", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4894414.1569639129!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cash-canadian-100-bills-money-stock.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 05, 2019 1:56 PM PT", "2019-10-06T01:44:47.512Z"], "source": null, "content": "Economist John Maynard Keynes famously said, \"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\"\nAnd the global bond market today certainly appears to be acting irrationally with\u00a030 per cent of government bonds\u00a0generating negative yields.\nNegative yields are when investors pay bond sellers\u00a0to take their money, instead of the other way around.

Guests told Vice they had trouble obtaining refunds from the company and were given bad reviews by the shady hosts.\nAnd on Tuesday, voters in Jersey City, New Jersey, approved restrictions on short-term rental companies in a referendum in one of Airbnb's most important markets.\nIn an e-mail sent to employees Wednesday, Airbnb Co-Founder and CEO Brian Chesky said the company will take its most significant steps to improve trust since its founding in 2008.\n\"People need to feel like they can trust our community and that they can trust Airbnb when something goes wrong,\" Chesky wrote.\nAirbnb plans to:\nThe company is under some pressure to improve its reputation as it eyes an initial public offering of stock next year.\n\"Most hosts do a great job, but guests need to feel like Airbnb has their back, and we believe this commitment is a necessary step in giving guests peace of mind,\" Chesky wrote.\nBut critics of the company say its efforts don't go far enough. David Wachsmuth, Canada research chair in urban governance at McGill University, told CBC\u00a0News that it remains\u00a0unclear how Airbnb will go about the task of verifying all of its listings are up to the newly announced\u00a0standards.\n\"There is no other way to look at this other than damage control after a rough week for [the company].\"\u00a0\nHowever,\u00a0Wachsmuth\u00a0remained optimist that, if controls are properly\u00a0implemented,\u00a0\"you could certainly imagine a scenario where a year from now there are dramatically fewer scams on the platform.\"\nIf Airbnb really wants to be a good neighbour, it would verify that listings are complying with local regulations, said Jessica Black, who leads a Texas group called Moms Against STRS, which backs regulation of short-term rentals.\n\"By not voluntarily removing illegal listings, Airbnb continues to outsource the costs of their business to cash-strapped cities,\" Black said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Air Canada plans to hire 350 pilots ahead of eventual Boeing 737 Max return", "description": "Airline had to cancel relatively few flights after Max grounding, but needed to lease planes", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-q3-earnings-1.5339141", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5339145.1572350594!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/air-canada-20191029.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 29, 2019 8:32 AM ET", "2019-10-29T20:22:41.187Z"], "source": null, "content": "Air Canada's shares hit an all-time high Tuesday even though its earnings fell slightly below expectations last quarter as the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max continues to weigh down the country's largest airline.\nThe Montreal-based company's earnings fell slightly below expectations last quarter, but shares hit a high of $48.09 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and sat at about four per cent or $1.83 at $47.55 in mid-afternoon trading.\nChief executive Calin Rovinescu said once authorities lift the airspace ban it could take up to a year for all 50 Max jetliners slated to be in operation by mid-2020 to hit the skies.

Ambrosia Corner Bakery, for instance, was an early adopter selling hard-to-find flour and yeast, as was\u00a0Little Mushroom Catering.\u00a0\n\"Some people come exclusively for the yeast,\" according to Stephanie Soulis of Little Mushroom. \"It helps pay some of the bills.\" \u00a0 While Caf\u00e9 Pyrus has been selling its core-brand vegan dishes online, owner Tyson Reiser says he's seeing steady growth in grocery items.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \"We're getting 20 to 25 orders per day, and I'd say 50 percent is grocery items that we normally wouldn't carry,\" Reiser said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFood purveyors have been forced to adapt to shut-downs in other sectors, where their former customers were before the pandemic.\u00a0\nUsually serving local tech companies with fresh food, Waterloo caterer Quantum Greens shifted about five weeks ago when tech companies sent staff home to work.\u00a0 \u00a0 While their meal kits have proven very popular, two weeks ago they started offering a half-a-dozen grocery box options of fresh fruit and vegetables. Quantum co-owner Erika\u00a0Siegner\u00a0is happy with the response.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \"We've taken about 34 orders so far, and it's growing. We're seeing repeat customers,\" she said.\u00a0\nRestaurants already have supply lines through various food service companies, so adding online orders of food is relatively easy.\u00a0 \u00a0 Cambridge Restaurant uses eggs, butter, milk and bread from local Azores bakery for restaurant dishes that customers order and pick up curbside.\u00a0 \u00a0 Chef-owner Josh Hayward says that customers pre-order these same grocery items that the restaurant kitchen would ordinarily use and pay through email transfer.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"We put out our list online at the beginning of each week and bring in items from our various suppliers to sell,\" said Hayward.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"It's catching on,\" he added. \"It makes for easy sales and a bonus on top or our menu items, baked goods and cook-at-home meals.\"\u00a0\nThe take-away ordering system with restaurants provides a sense of security, too.\u00a0 \u00a0 At Old Marina Restaurant and Gift Shop, co-owner Joel Cook says some people are scared to venture out into grocery stores and are relieved to be able to buy from the restaurant.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \"We've built a certain level of trust with our customers, and purchasing grocery items is easy since they're already ordering restaurant meals to take-out,\" Cook said.\u00a0 \u00a0 Located in Cambridge, the restaurant sells a grocery box of about a dozen items including apples, broccoli, onions and potatoes for $25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At Kitchener's Graffiti Market,\u00a0new grocery store items \u2013 small and large produce boxes of 17 or 18 items and seafood and deli boxes \u2013 are a new addition to the restaurant's business platform, one prompted by the novel coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"It's a first for us in terms of grocery, and we hadn't started our online platform at all prior to this,\" co-owner Ryan Craig-Lloyd said.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In Guelph,\u00a0Sugo\u00a0on Surrey, an Italian-Mediterranean restaurant, is open for curbside pickup of its menu items to connect with customers who want to maintain social distancing.\u00a0 \u00a0 They're currently selling grocery boxes with fresh produce, eggs, milk and butter as well as hand sanitizer, toilet paper and cleaning supplies.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"It's free delivery, so people don't have to leave their homes,\" according to owner Alex Tami.\u00a0\nThe sudden pivot to food delivery can be a challenge for many restaurants if their business has been\u00a0focused\u00a0on dining room service \u2013 unlike, say, pizza places that have delivery embedded into their business model.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"We're rookies in the takeout game, but we're slowly coming up with bigger and better ideas to serve our community in a drastically different capacity,\" said Tami.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Fat Sparrow Group, including The Stone Crock, is now offering a range of local products \u2013 Wellesley Apple Butter and Eby Manor Milk, as well bread, deli and produce \u2013 through online order and curbside pick-up.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"We're not trying to be a grocery store but an online marketplace which people could use in between store visits. We're trying to fill that gap,\" said Nick Benninger of Fat Sparrow Group.\u00a0 \u00a0 While it's not a restaurant, sauce-maker\u00a0Phlippens\u00a0collects local foods such as garlic, coffee, chicken stock, granola, nuoc\u00a0cham, cheese and even charcoal.\u00a0They're packaged into a \"Phlippens\u00a0Family Box.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Having taken over 300 orders in about eight days, owner Kris\u00a0Phippen\u00a0says he's filling a similar gap.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"It's an opportunity that won't happen again,\"\u00a0Phippen\u00a0said of the shift in his business. \"And it's a way for consumers to try something new at this time.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Filling a gap is an understatement during a few weeks when restaurants have lost as much as 70 percent of their pre-COVID revenue.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, they're surprised by the positive response and see the new revenue stream as having long-term potential, especially given the ups and downs\u00a0of the restaurant business.\u00a0 \u00a0 Phippen says he's \"rolling the dice\" on a long-term commitment to the family box, while Benninger says Fat Sparrow Group wants the online marketplace to be a big part of their business going forward.\u00a0 \u00a0 Tami at\u00a0Sugo\u00a0on Surrey sees the pivot\u00a0as inevitable given the precariousness of a restaurant's existence.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"Overall, every business has had to adapt with the change in demand,\" he said. \"The restaurant industry is no different.\"\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Air Canada plans to hire 350 pilots ahead of eventual Boeing 737 Max return", "description": "Airline had to cancel relatively few flights after Max grounding, but needed to lease planes", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-q3-earnings-1.5339141", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5339145.1572350594!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/air-canada-20191029.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 29, 2019 8:32 AM ET", "2019-10-29T20:22:41.187Z"], "source": null, "content": "Air Canada's shares hit an all-time high Tuesday even though its earnings fell slightly below expectations last quarter as the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max continues to weigh down the country's largest airline.\nThe Montreal-based company's earnings fell slightly below expectations last quarter, but shares hit a high of $48.09 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and sat at about four per cent or $1.83 at $47.55 in mid-afternoon trading.\nChief executive Calin Rovinescu said once authorities lift the airspace ban it could take up to a year for all 50 Max jetliners slated to be in operation by mid-2020 to hit the skies.

But for me, it's the running out of fresh produce that eventually gets me to the store again, even though I'm cutting the tops off carrots and beets and storing washed and spun lettuce in an air-tight container to make them last.\nWhich is why I'm starting to stock more canned and jarred vegetables in my pantry \u2014 along with dried beans and pulses \u2014 so I'll always have vegetables to swap into meals when my fresh supply gets low. This may seem antithetical to the fresh ingredients I usually urge you to cook with this time of year, but we're living in strange and uncharted times where even a trip to the grocery store can cause you more stress.\u00a0\nPlus what could be easier than cooking with canned vegetables, just open them up and rinse them well before eating or adding to recipes. But don't throw out that oil if you're using jarred vegetables; you can use that for salad dressings. To help get you excited about picking up more canned vegetables on your next grocery trip, here are a ton of ideas on how to use them.\nCanned baby corn\nToss sliced baby corn and diced cucumber together for a simple salad. (If you're without cucumber, frozen, shelled edamame makes a great substitution for this colourful dish.) Or use baby corn in almost any stir-fry, pairing it with other canned vegetables like water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, or jarred roasted red peppers.\u00a0\nCanned beets\nDice them up for a pink-tinged egg salad sandwich, or leave them whole and add them to any salad if you have greens on hand. They're also just fine on their own when tossed with olive oil and salt; serve them alongside roasted onions with a sprinkling of fresh dill if you've got it 'em.\u00a0\u00a0\nUse up canned artichokes in this White Bean, Garlic and Artichoke Dip.\nCanned artichokes\nKeep canned artichokes on hand for using in dips, soups, or as a topping for pizza. Look for them in the jar as well and sub them in for fresh artichokes in any salad. My favourite canned artichoke salad is one made with arugula and goat cheese in a simple lemon vinaigrette, topped with candied orange or lemon peel if I'm feeling fancy.\nCanned bamboo shoots\nAdd bamboo shoots to a pork or tofu stir-fry, to salads, or any curry, especially a coconut-based Thai green curry (look up any recipe online).\u00a0\nCanned chipotle chilies in adobo sauce\nMake a quick sauce for tofu, fish or chicken using these flavourful chilies, here's how. Soften an onion in oil, and add some red chili flakes, minced garlic during the last two minutes of cooking, when the onions are starting to brown. Sprinkle in a pinch of dried thyme, add a bay leaf and add three whole canned tomatoes cut to bite-sized. Add roughly 1 \u00bd tablespoons of finely chopped chipotles, along with a lot of (jarred!) capers and a generous splash of their brine. Simmer this all until it reduces into a spoonable sauce, and top your protein with it.\u00a0\nUse up jarred sun-dried tomatoes in Steven's Sun-Dried Tomato Pizza.\nSun-dried tomatoes\nStock sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil so you'll always have something to top your pizza or sandwiches with. Or puree them in your food processor with mayonnaise or thick yogurt along with other seasonings for a flavourful dip. Make a vinaigrette and add chopped sun-dried tomatoes to it, before tossing sweet potatoes in it to roast.\nCanned tomatoes \u00a0\nKeep canned whole tomatoes on hand for soup, and jars of strained pureed tomatoes (passata) on hand for easy pasta sauce, and so many other uses \u2014 check out this article!\u00a0\nWater chestnuts\nPair these crunchy canned vegetables with frozen or canned spinach to make a creamy spinach dip. Or riff on your favourite stir-fry by adding them in place of any or all of the fresh veggies you don't have.\u00a0\nCanned mixed vegetables\nThe most common mix of vegetable you may come across is peas, corn, and carrots, which are generally pretty adaptable when you're desperate for some vegetables. Stir them into a cheesy pasta sauce or turn them into a colourful Indian-inspired side dish. Here's how: toast cumin seeds in hot oil and fry a bit of onion in the spiced oil until soft. Add garlic and ginger (which you can also find jarred), and cook a couple more minutes. Add a splash of passata or diced fresh tomatoes if you have them. Cook that down until soft, adding water if your pan gets dry, then tip two jars of mixed vegetables into the mixture, cook for a few minutes more and season with salt and pepper to taste.\u00a0\nSwap in canned mushrooms in this Beef and Barley Soup.\nCanned mushrooms\nYou can swap in canned vegetables in many recipes that call for fresh, as long as the recipe requires you to cook the vegetables because they are already soft. Keep them on hand for eggs, soups, or stroganoff.\nBeans \u2014 but the green or wax variety\nWe probably don't have to tell you to have canned chickpeas of kidney beans on hand, but consider grabbing jarred or canned green beans too. They add texture to a wrap by spread with hummus. Or just add them to your mixed bean salad.\u00a0\nJackfruit\u00a0\nLook for canned young green jackfruit in brine or water and make vegan tacos or barbecue \"pulled pork\" sandwiches. Jackfruit's texture mimics meat and absorbs punchy sauces well \u2014 jackfruit curry is a go-to in some Indian and Sri Lankan kitchens. You'll find lots of vegan recipes online, as well as instructions for cutting the jackfruit properly for the best 'meaty' texture.\nUse canned callaloo in this Meatball Soup with White Beans and Greens.\nCanned callaloo\nCallaloo is a popular green in Caribbean and Southeast Asian cooking. Look up a recipe online, or swap this flavourful leaf in whenever a recipe calls for cooked spinach, like in strata, or meatball soup.\u00a0\nCanned okra\nIf you're finding fresh okra hard to come by, use canned in your succotash, stews and curries.\u00a0\nSwap in canned corn for these Crab and Corn Fritters.\nCorn\nUse canned corn wherever fresh or frozen corn is called for, like in risotto, chili, chowder, or fritters.\nCanned peas\nSure you may have a package of frozen peas, but you may want to start saving your freezer space for actual meals. Canned peas work just as well in most recipes that call for fresh and frozen. Or turn them into a vibrant spring dip for crackers by cooking the peas in a little chicken stock along with garlic and shallot until soft. Turn off the heat, add a handful of whatever herbs are growing on your windowsill, and puree the dip until smooth in your blender.\u00a0\u00a0\nJarred red cabbage\nMake a German-style braised cabbage dish by simmering jarred cabbage with a bay leaf and an apple, and a bit of red wine vinegar and bacon fat if you have it. Look up a recipe online to get the ratios right, then serve this as a side dish to sausages or another protein.\u00a0\nCanned ackee\nAckee is the national fruit of Jamaica, but is treated like a vegetable in savoury cooking.

It said the yuan's decline was driven by market forces.\nThe U.S.'s accusation of currency manipulation\u00a0is \"protectionist behaviour\" that will have \"a major impact on global finance,\" the People's Bank of China said on its website.\nBut later on Tuesday, China's central bank buttressed the yuan by fixing it at a slightly stronger rate, which ratcheted down the tensions a little.\nThe Chinese central bank governor, Yi Gang, tried to reassure investors, promising in a statement to stick to commitments\u00a0\"not to use exchange rates for competitive purposes.\"\nThe central bank is \"committed to maintaining the basic stability\" of the yuan \"at a reasonable and balanced level,\" Yi said.\nChina dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low.

It would raise borrowing costs by encouraging an outflow of capital from the world's second-largest economy.\nAs such, the move to strengthen the yuan,\u00a0along with\u00a0White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow's comment that President Donald Trump was planning to host a Chinese delegation for further talks in September, allayed fears of a further escalation in trade war.\nThe S&P 500, still reeling from last week's shock when Trump vowed to slap a 10 per cent\u00a0tariff on a further $300 billion in Chinese imports, is 5.6 per cent\u00a0away from its all-time high hit last month.\n\"Both sides are at that point where they must go back and renegotiate,\" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.\n\"Yesterday's big drop-off has allowed bargain hunters to find bargains.\"\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange, which was closed for a holiday on Monday, closed down almost one per cent to 16,149, off 122 points on the day.\nMarkets in New York all gained more than one per cent including the S&P 500 which gained 37 points\u00a0to close at\u00a0 2,881.

The House was poised to vote.\nAccess to testing has been a persistent source of concern.\u00a0Still, Trump said that officials don't want people taking the test unless they have certain symptoms. \"We don't want people without symptoms to go and do that test,\" Trump said, adding, \"It's totally unnecessary.\"\nHe also denied responsibility for the slow rollout of testing. \"I don't take responsibility at all,\" Trump said.\u00a0\nTrump took a number of other actions to bolster energy markets, ease the financial burden for Americans with student loans and give medical professionals additional \"flexibility\" in treating patients during the public health crisis.\nWATCH |\u00a0How Europe is reacting to Trump's COVID-19 travel ban:\nHe waived interest on federally held student loans and moved to prop up energy markets\u00a0by directing the Department of Energy to buy oil to fill the strategic petroleum reserve \"right up to the top.\"\n\"Through a very collective action and shared sacrifice, national determination, we will overcome the threat of the virus,\" Trump said.\nThe White House is under enormous pressure, dealing with the crisis on multiple fronts as it encroached ever closer on the president.\nThe virus has swept in alarming ways across American life, sending the financial markets into a dangerous slide and shuttering schools and sporting events and limiting everyday interactions in communities across the country.\nAnd a personal health scare intensified as White House officials worked to determine the level of exposure by the president and senior aides to several foreign officials who have since tested positive for the virus.\nTrump said he was gratified that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tested negative for the virus, after the pair sat next to each other for an extended period last weekend. A senior aide to Bolsonaro tested positive. \"We have no symptoms whatsoever,\" said Trump, who has not gotten tested for the virus or taken steps to self-isolate.\nHospitals welcomed Trump's emergency declaration, which they and lawmakers in Congress had been requesting. It allows the Health and Human Services Department to temporarily waive certain federal rules that can make it harder for hospitals and other health-care facilities to respond to an emergency.\nSuch rules include a Medicare requirement that a patient spend three days in the hospital before the program will pay for care in a nursing facility. Waiving the rule would make more inpatient beds available. Another rule requires doctors and other clinicians to be licensed in the state in which they are providing services. It can be waived if the physician is licensed in another state.\nThe American Medical Association said the emergency declaration would help ensure the health-care system has sufficient resources to properly respond to the ongoing outbreak.\nTrump's actions were also viewed favourably on Wall Street, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1,985 points, or 9.4 per cent, its best gain since October 2008. Stocks doubled their gains in the last half-hour of trading as Trump made his remarks.\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\nThe vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks.\nProviding sick pay for workers is a crucial element of federal efforts to stop the rapid spread of the infection. Officials warn that the nation's health-care system could quickly become overwhelmed with gravely sick patients, as suddenly happened in Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the virus.\nThe ability to ensure paycheques\u00a0will keep flowing \u2014 for people who stay home as a preventative measure or because they're feeling ill or caring for others \u2014 can help assure Americans they will not fall into financial hardship.\nA deal between Congress and the White House would cap a tumultuous week in which Washington strained for a comprehensive response to an outbreak that is testing the nation's political, financial and health-care systems.\nTrump has struggled to show he's on top of the crisis, after giving conflicting descriptions of what the U.S. is doing to combat the virus.\nThe House aid package builds on an emergency $8.3 billion US measure approved last week.\nWATCH |\u00a0How scientists at Johns Hopkins University are tracking COVID-19:\nPelosi promised a third coronavirus package will follow soon, though the House is leaving Washington on Friday for a previously scheduled recess. That measure will include more aggressive steps to boost the U.S. economy, which economists fear has already slipped into recession.\nBut there's little appetite within either party for Trump's proposal to suspend collection of the 6.2 per cent\u00a0Social Security payroll tax.

But underpinning all of the budget numbers is one key assumption: that the province's economy will not contract overall in the coming year \u2014an assumption that could prove quite wrong.\u00a0\n\"The COVID-19 outbreak has had a negative impact on the global, Canadian and Ontario economies,\" says the document, stating the obvious. \"The severity of the economic impact will depend on how widespread the outbreak becomes and how long it lasts.\"\u00a0\nIn other words, it's impossible to forecast what will happen to Ontario's economy over the next year, and the ripple effect on government revenues. But the government's spending plan must be based on forecasts, so the Ministry of Finance makes this one: that the province's GDP will neither grow nor shrink in 2020-21, but stay stagnant.\u00a0\nA senior finance ministry official says that forecast was made last week, and was pegged slightly below the average growth rate predicted by private sector economists at that time. But a week is an eternity in the rapid-fire spread of COVID-19, and that forecast is already looking rosy.\u00a0\nThe major banks have issued new updates in the past few days, all predicting economic contraction in 2020.\u00a0\nOn Wednesday, Scotiabank revised downward its forecast for Ontario, predicting the province's economy will shrink by 5.6 per cent in 2020. Also Wednesday, TD issued a new forecast for the Canadian economy, a 4.2 per cent retraction. RBC's latest forecast came on Tuesday, calling for a 2.5 per cent drop in Canada's GDP.\u00a0\nHere's the\u00a0problem for Ontario's budget: its revenue predictions are already based on outdated forecasts.\u00a0\nSome of the most optimistic assumptions in the fiscal plan are that COVID-19 will do relatively little to reduce government revenues in the coming year, compared with 2019-20.\nThe fiscal update forecasts a 0.8 per cent drop in personal income tax revenues, meaning just $300 million less in provincial coffers, despite the widespread layoffs announced in the past few weeks.\nThe government is predicting a 1.3 per cent drop in corporate tax revenue, just a $200 million hit to the treasury.\u00a0\nIf the economy does contract in 2020, those tax revenues could be billions less, making the deficit far higher than the $20 billion already forecast.\u00a0\nOntario is clearly hoping the economic hit from COVID-19 will be a very short, albeit sharp, shock, to be followed by a big rebound as non-essential businesses fire up again, driven by pent-up demand from consumers freed from the constraints of social distancing.\u00a0\nThere is also reason to believe that measures from the Bank of Canada, as well as Ottawa's $107\u00a0billion COVID-19 rescue package, will keep the bottom from falling out.\u00a0\nFinally, Ontario does have a strong, diversified economy when it isn't locked down by a virus, and it is well positioned to bounce back once the worst of the pandemic\u00a0is over. \u00a0\nBut the impact on provincial finances won't be clear for months. In the next two years, it will be fascinating to watch how the PC government deals with running a deficit that is far larger than Doug Ford likely ever dreamed would exist even under a spendthrift Liberal government.\u00a0\nOntario 2020-21 spending plan highlights\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Kevin Yarr", "title": "'Just nothing available,' says P.E.I. housing navigator", "description": "P.E.I. vacancy rate is at a record low", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-housing-navigator-shortage-1.5222860", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4055153.1553957643!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-rent-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 24, 2019 7:05 AM AT", "2019-07-24T10:27:25.672Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The woman charged with finding housing for Islanders on low to moderate incomes says even with all the resources of the province behind her she just can't find homes for people.\nLast fall CMHC recorded a record low vacancy rate in the province of 0.3 per cent.

Ottawa has said it is not yet ready to ban flavoured vaping products outright.\nMany adult vaping users maintain that the flavoured products have helped them transition from cigarettes to e-cigarette alternatives.\n\"We recently proposed new rules to prohibit the promotion of vaping products anywhere they can be seen or heard by youth, and are in the process of examining additional flavour restrictions using the best available evidence because we share the concerns that many Canadians \u2014 particularly parents \u2014 have about vaping,\"\u00a0Thierry B\u00e9lair, a spokesperson for Health Minister Patty Hajdu, said in an emailed statement.\n"}, {"author": "Amanda Pfeffer", "title": "Sky-high prices sending medical marijuana users to black market", "description": "Licensed supplier drops low-cost strain from online catalog", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/marijuana-prices-medical-black-market-1.5341619", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5341666.1572467607!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/shaun-gricken.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 31, 2019 12:02 PM ET", "2019-11-01T09:41:22.730Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Medical marijuana users\u00a0and their advocates say steep price increases since legalization, coupled with obstacles to access, are\u00a0forcing many patients to turn to the illegal market. \u00a0\nAccording to\u00a0a survey commissioned by the Arthritis Society, there are as many\u00a0medical cannabis users getting their prescriptions from illegal sources as legal ones, while two-thirds say they're rationing their supply of the drug due to worries about both access and cost.\nCBC has spoken to several patients who said they prefer procuring their cannabis through legal means, but have turn to illegal suppliers to subsidize their prescriptions and cut costs.\n\"We just believe that's not acceptable,\" said Janet Yale, President and CEO of the Arthritis Society.\n\"That really undermines the ability of patients to have secure access to a quality product that is consistent in form and dosage, and that allows them to really get the benefits from having medical cannabis.\"\u00a0\nCurrently, medical marijuana users must order their pot online, but the Arthritis Society is working with the Canadian Pharmacists\u00a0Association to lobby the federal government to allow pharmacies to fill prescriptions.\nMedical cannabis belongs in pharmacies, says Arthritis Society\n\"A thing that's a little bit bizarre, if not outrageous, is that it's harder to get medical cannabis, which was legal first, than it is to get recreational marijuana,\" Yale said.\nBut according to Shaun Gricken, soaring prices are the biggest impediment for people who rely on cannabis prescriptions.\nMedical cannabis is medicine and it should be treated as such.

But nearly all of the federal government's attention is still consumed by the profound challenges of containing a contagious disease and reopening communities amid an ongoing health threat.\nCivil society, though, is not waiting to push the Liberal government to focus any recovery plan on emissions-reducing and sustainable projects \u2014\u00a0a push that now includes a group of environmental, financial and political figures who are hoping to draft a set of recommendations over the next two months.\nThe independent \"task force on a resilient recovery\"\u00a0includes individuals who are already prominent in the discussion around moving toward a greener future, but also the former chief risk and strategy officer with the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (Barbara Zvan), the president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada (Don Forgeron), and a former deputy minister in the federal department of finance (Michael Horgan).\nAmong the group's 14 members are also three former political advisers: Mira Oreck, who was a senior official in the office of British Columbia Premier John Horgan; Mitchell Davidson, former director of policy for Ontario Premier Doug Ford; and Gerald Butts, former principal secretary to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nThe task force's\u00a0stated goal is to help seize a \"once-in-a-generation\"\u00a0opportunity to build back \"better,\" according to an announcement to\u00a0be released today.\nBruce Lourie, the environmentalist and author who is now president of the Ivey Foundation, which helped organize the group, told CBC News the impetus was twofold: both to make sure the government didn't take its eye off the ball and invest in the \"wrong kinds\"\u00a0of areas for the future, and to continue advancing work the foundation had already begun before the pandemic.\nThe task force's report will add to a growing supply of green-focused analysis. The Canada Green Building Council released a set of recommendations last week and a coalition of clean energy experts and operators has also written to the prime minister with suggestions.\nThe group launching on Tuesday also holds out the possibility of showing some cross-partisan support for a set of green ideas.\n\"A carbon tax is obviously what people think about when they think about green policy, but there's lots of other things that can be done that are still green,\"\u00a0said Davidson, who co-authored the Ontario Progressive Conservative party's platform in 2018.\u00a0\"I think that the question is, if we're doing recovery projects and we're keeping a focus on environmentalism, we should also keep a focus on things that matter to individuals as well which is getting them back to work, putting money into people's pockets.\"\nAhead of any final recommendations from his group, Lourie already sees some areas for potential action.\nFirst, the federal government could focus on plans to retrofit homes and buildings \u2014 which account for 12 per cent of this country's greenhouse gas emissions \u2014\u00a0to increase the energy efficiency of Canada's physical structures. Such an initiative would create work for tradespeople across the country\u00a0while reducing both energy costs and emissions.\nThe Liberal platform in last year's election already promised free energy audits and interest-free loans for homeowners and landlords as part of a plan to retrofit 1.5 million homes. But expanded funding could drive even faster and deeper change.\nAs part of a long-term project, the federal government could look to expand the production of hydrogen, particularly in Alberta, Lourie says \u2014\u00a0an idea that is now being studied by another group in that province.\nFederal funding for municipal transit systems could also be used to expand the use of electric buses.\nThe task force says it will evaluate ideas according to a three-part test \u2014 determining whether policies are economically timely and lasting, environmentally sound, and both equitable and feasible.\nThere are other issues that will come to bear on any recovery plan.\nThe current economic downturn has, for instance, disproportionately impacted women, service industries and low-wage workers. The health crisis has brought new attention to supply lines and how much Canada depends on international suppliers for important products like medical equipment.\u00a0The state of long-term care, particularly in Ontario and Quebec, has been exposed as a significant weakness.\nThere will no doubt be calls to address such concerns with new investments.\nThe timing and implementation of any recovery plan will also depend on how well COVID-19 is contained and how long significant health-related restrictions remain in place.\nBut there is significant pressure, both in Canada and abroad, to make sure that government stimulus is used to ensure long-term sustainability in the face of that other global threat \u2014\u00a0and that speaks to how much the climate conversation has advanced over the last 10 years.\nA decade ago, when policymakers were trying to counter that last significant recession, the focus was \"shovel-ready\"\u00a0projects \u2014\u00a0infrastructure projects that could begin quickly, providing employment and economic activity for the short term. Infrastructure Minister Catherine McKenna has already adopted that phrase to explain how her department is analyzing potential projects.\nIn this downturn, there is talk instead of pursuing \"shovel-worthy\" investments \u2014\u00a0projects that cannot only get started quickly, but that also deserve to be funded because they fit within larger goals like reducing emissions.\nIn the United States, the stimulus package of 2009 did include significant funding for clean energy. But climate change was largely relegated to a secondary concern once global stock markets started to crash.\nIn 2020, there is a clearer and more widespread understanding that climate change is a central and immediate issue, even amid a global health crisis and an unprecedented economic shock.\n\"Ten years later, we're much further along in terms of our understanding of the importance of having a more diverse economy,\"\u00a0Lourie\u00a0said.\u00a0\"And having an economy that's going to be one that will support our country in 10 years, not just in 10 weeks or 10 months.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jon Hernandez", "title": "From high-end to high-tech, budding cannabis companies undeterred by volatile start to legalization", "description": "Lift and Co.

Health Canada regulations currently require all cannabis requirements to be sold in plain packaging \u2014 something insiders hope will change over time.\n\"I would like to see more branding, a little bit more freedom from brands to differentiate themselves within the space,\" said Kevin Lee, business development manager for ND Supplies, a cannabis packaging company.\n\"The rules are rules.\u00a0Health Canada has rolled it out as best they can, it might not work for everyone, but at the same time, it's an evolving industry,\" he added. \"Changes will come.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1654820931701", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Conservation Council recommends more local food security as part of COVID-19 recovery plan", "description": "Group also calls for more protection of natural areas and more reliable, affordable electricity system ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/covid-19-conservation-council-new-brunswick-recovery-plan-1.5542646", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5332625.1571862453!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/louise-comeau.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 24, 2020 4:00 AM AT", "2020-04-24T14:13:26.821Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Conservation Council of New Brunswick is calling on the provincial government to encourage more local food security in agriculture and fisheries, to broaden protections for natural areas and water systems, and to reform the electricity system to make it more reliable and affordable.\nIt's all part of the organization's recommendations for a COVID-19 recovery plan.\nThe council marked Earth Week by sending an open letter to Premier Blaine Higgs\u00a0on Thursday focused on those three priorities.\n\"We really do think this is an opportunity for us to rebuild post-pandemic in ways that protect our health, our security, and make us safer from environmental threats as well as health threats like the pandemic,\" said\u00a0director of climate change and energy solutions\u00a0Louise Comeau.\n\"You know, going back to normal isn't going to make us safer, healthier and more resilient. So we're looking for solutions that are better than normal.\"\nThe\u00a0seven-page letter is\u00a0not so much a \"course correction\" as it is expanding upon\u00a0existing efforts, said Comeau.\nFor example, there are already calls from farmer organizations, farmer market operators, local food security advocates, and others that the province needs to bolster food security.\nThe conservation council agrees the province needs to \"increase dramatically\" the proportion of its food from homegrown sources.\nAs it stands, only about eight per cent of fruits and vegetables are grown locally.\n\"We need a balanced mix of New Brunswick-grown\u00a0and sustainably-managed community gardens, home gardens, hobby farms, and larger agriculture operations supplying not just produce, but most of the food we eat if we want to improve food security,\" the letter states.\nIt also recommends deploying land\u00a0suitable for growing food with programming targeting young people who want to start farming in 2020 and 2021.\nAs part of the focus on food security, the conservation council also wants to see increased wage subsidies for farm workers, as well as help for inshore fisheries and the fish-processing industry.\nTo build community and ecosystem resiliency, it's calling on the government to exceed its goal of protecting 10 per cent of natural areas by 2020 and instead develop a plan to protect 25 per cent of each of\u00a0the land and marine base by 2025.\n\"We need to learn from our recent history, including two back-to-back 100-year floods of the St. John River, Hurricane Dorian and Arthur and the 2017 ice storm and move rapidly to implement protection plans that ensure natural systems can protect us from extreme weather,\" the letter states.\nThis will also help create\u00a0jobs in protection and restoration, in building trades through infrastructure projects, and temporary work such as\u00a0beach debris cleanups.\nThe plan also deals with forestry, including better\u00a0protection of\u00a0Crown lands\u00a0by decreasing the average size of clear cuts\u00a0by about 80 per cent, and replacing aerial herbicide spraying with more labour-intensive silviculture practices, such as manual thinning and Acadian forest restoration.\nUnder electricity, the conservation council recommends an action plan that would include targets and timelines.\nIt suggests immediately retrofitting 100 per cent of New Brunswick\u00a0building stock over the next six years, which it says could result in a net increase of 3,460 jobs per year and a\u00a0net increase of $730 million in GDP per year.\nPremier Blaine Higgs said Thursday he\u00a0will share the province's COVID-19\u00a0recovery plan \"in the coming days.\"\nThe province will outline a series of phases similar to Saskatchewan's plan, where different levels of services are to begin to reopen while physical distancing is maintained, and there is a limit on how many people can gather at once.\n\"There's two factors. One is in relation to allowing people to get back to their normal way of life in the\u00a0new norm\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and then the phase of, how businesses recover and the economy,\" Higgs said.\nThursday marked the fifth day in a row of no new cases of COVID-19 in New Brunswick.\nThere are 14 active cases, including five people in hospital, one of whom is in intensive care.\nTo date, 104 people across the province have recovered from the disease.\nGoing back to the way things were before COVID-19 likely isn't an\u00a0option, said Comeau.\n\"Some things are not going to recover,\" she said. \"Changes in the energy sector may not be something you can just switch back onto.\"\nPolling also indicates a shift in attitudes, she said.\nPeople are more interested in\u00a0buying local\u00a0and\u00a0seed sales are \"skyrocketing.\"\nPeople are enjoying working from home and being closer\u00a0to family.\n\"I think these social changes that have emerged during the pandemic have the potential to create permanent change and opens a window to doing things differently,\" said Comeau.\nIn addition,\u00a0governments are co-operating, people are collaborating\u00a0are feeling empathy toward each other, she said.\n\"I\u00a0think we definitely have an opportunity.\u00a0Not only should we do better than normal, but people will want us to do better than normal.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Enbridge tops up Mainline capacity, boosting oil export options slightly for western Canadian producers", "description": "Calgary-based company says it'll soon be able to ship extra 100,000 bpd on Mainline system", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/enbridge-mainline-oil-shipments-pipeline-alberta-1.5353550", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4956998.1575074698!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/enbridge-energy-line-3.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 08, 2019 12:08 PM MT", "2019-11-08T21:45:08.380Z"], "source": null, "content": "Oil export options for western Canadian producers continue to expand in small increments as delays persist for major proposed pipeline projects.\nOn Friday, Calgary-based Enbridge Inc. said an optimization program on its Mainline system, which accounts for about 70 per cent of Canadian oil exports into the United States, is expected to add 100,000 barrels per day of additional capacity by year-end.\nThat's at the top end of its original target of 50,000 to 100,000 bpd and a 15,000 bpd increase over the 85,000 bpd expected by Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.\nEnbridge added it plans to bring on another 50,000 bpd of capacity in a smaller pipeline expansion early next year. Last summer, rival TC Energy Corp. held an open season to assign 50,000 bpd of added incremental capacity on its existing Keystone pipeline system into the U.S.\nOn a conference call, Enbridge CEO Al Monaco said having the Canadian side of its Line 3 replacement pipeline in service by Dec. 1 will help meet producer demand on a Mainline system that has been operating at near maximum capacity, clocking in at over 2.7 million bpd in the third quarter.\n\"On the Mainline, we expect to bring in about 100,000 barrels per day of incremental capacity by year-end. That extra 100,000 comes from capacity recovery, optimization of receipt and delivery windows, as well as leveraging Line 3 Canada,\" he said.\n\"We're also moving forward with a 50,000-barrel-per-day expansion of Express to serve PADD 4 (U.S. Rockies region). That should be ready in Q1.\"\nThe American part of the $9-billion Line 3 project could still be in service in 2020, as previously predicted, but timing is unclear after state utility regulators in Minnesota in October ordered further study on the potential effects of oil spills in the Lake Superior watershed.\n\"Once we have timelines from the PUC (Minnesota public utilities commission) and agencies, we will be able to provide the next key milestones toward the start of construction,\" said Monaco.\nCompletion of Line 3 would add 370,000 bpd of oil export capacity. Meanwhile, construction is proceeding on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to the Canadian West Coast but the Keystone XL pipeline has been delayed by court challenges in the U.S.\nThe failure of pipeline expansions to keep up with growth in oilsands production has been blamed for steep oil price discounts in Alberta.\nEnbridge shares rose on the Toronto Stock Exchange after it reported record third-quarter adjusted earnings and distributable cash flow driven by high levels of oil transported on the Mainline and input from new capital projects placed in service\nThe company says it earned $949 million in the third quarter, up from a loss of $90 million in the same quarter last year caused by a number of one-time charges.\nThe Calgary-based company says adjusted earnings worked out to $1.12 billion, or 56 cents per share, for the quarter ending Sept. 30, up from $933 million, or 55 cents per share last year.\nAnalysts had expected adjusted earnings of $1.09 billion, or 53 cents per share according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nIn a report, analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. welcomed the company's expectation to finish the year above the midpoint of financial guidance following a \"steady quarter\" ended Sept. 30 and despite delays in its Line 3 project.\n"}, {"author": "Kyle Bakx", "title": "Cupcakes, podcasts and Instagram: How churches are navigating the pandemic", "description": "The opportunities and challenges of providing worship amidst COVID-19", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/church-worship-mosque-coronavirus-1.5505239", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4477824.1518118750!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/muskeg-lake-church.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 22, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-22T16:03:14.103Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "No longer allowed to offer a church service, Fred Rink plans to go door-to-door to provide communion to members of his congregation who are stuck at home because of the spread of COVID-19.\nRink will leave a small cup of wine and a wafer on a napkin at the door, then step back about three metres before his parishioner comes outside.\n\"Say the Words of Institution, and pray with them and then bless them.

And unless they\u00a0live in Alberta, they may not notice this year's tax\u00a0changes at all (more on that\u00a0later).\n\"It's going to be very subtle. And\u00a0I'd be surprised, frankly, if anybody noticed, if nobody told them,\"\u00a0said Janet Gray, a personal financial planner from Orleans, Ont.\nThe basic personal amount\u00a0\u2014 the amount of annual income Canadians can keep\u00a0tax-free\u00a0\u2014 is slowly increasing over the next four years, to $15,000 by 2023. In previous years, this amount has been adjusted to\u00a0the rate of inflation, but Morneau's most recent enhancement\u00a0goes beyond that.\nFor\u00a0the\u00a02020 tax year, it's rising by $931, to $13,229.\nFor low-income Canadians who'd otherwise have to pay 15 per cent income tax on that amount, the annual tax savings could be about $140. Some of the poorest may no longer owe any tax at all.\n\"There is still about one million Canadians that earn less than that basic personal exemption,\" Gray said. \"So of course, that's going to be meaningful for them.\"\nFor Canadians in the middle-income\u00a0brackets, the annual savings could be up to $240.\nBut divide that across 26 bi-weekly pay periods and the income bump that starts appearing\u00a0on Canadian pay\u00a0stubs doesn't exactly look life-changing: it's enough for an extra cup of fancy coffee or, for higher earners, a food truck\u00a0lunch every two weeks.\nFor those earning more than $150,473 in annual income, the savings are partially clawed back,\u00a0or not offered at all for incomes over $214,368.\nFederal\u00a0tax brackets \u2014 the thresholds that\u00a0trigger higher rates of taxation as incomes rise \u2014\u00a0have been\u00a0adjusted for 2020 based on\u00a0a 1.9 per cent rate of inflation.\nGray points out that in several Canadian cities, particularly those with hot housing markets, the actual rate of inflation may be higher \u2014 which means that these tax brackets and sources of government income\u00a0like the Canada Child Benefit (also\u00a0indexed and rising slightly as of July 1,\u00a02020)\u00a0may not be\u00a0keeping up.\nWhen business or household budgets\u00a0are sensitive to things like rising food costs or higher\u00a0taxes on fossil fuels, the government's calculations fall behind taxpayers' lived reality.\n\"Some people are going to feel inflation more than others depending on their own lifestyle,\" Gray said.\u00a0\nFarther down the pay stub, deductions for Employment Insurance and the Canada Pension Plan are changing, too.\nEI\u00a0premiums are decreasing from 1.62 to 1.58 per cent in 2020, while the maximum insurable earnings will increase to $54,200 from $53,100.\nThat's a\u00a0saving, but don't spend it all at once: it amounts to\u00a0less than a dollar per bi-weekly paycheque.\nCPP premiums, on the other hand, are increasing from 5.1 to 5.25 per cent for employees (double that\u00a0for the self-employed)\u00a0and the maximum pensionable earnings\u00a0\u2014 the amount the government uses to calculate an employee's CPP contributions for the year \u2014 is going up to $58,700.\nFor those earning that much or more, deductions could increase by\u00a0about $5.73\u00a0per bi-weekly paycheque\u00a0(less for lower-income earners). But remember: today's CPP contributions become pension income at retirement, so CPP premiums are\u00a0a modest forced\u00a0savings program, not a tax.\n\"It's kind of painless, a little bit at a time,\" Gray said.\u00a0Young workers may find it difficult to save for retirement\u00a0and are\u00a0less likely than previous generations to have employer-sponsored pensions, so \"CPP is taking on a little bit more of that\u00a0job.\"\nThe problem, Gray said, is that many people max out their EI and CPP contributions before the end of the year, and get used to paycheques leading up to New Year's that have fewer deductions. When January comes around again, their net pay deposits drop\u00a0and \"it's a little bit of a shock.\"\nThis makes it harder to detect subtle deduction changes at the start of a new year.\nTaken together with Morneau's tax cut, \"I think it's going to be mostly a wash,\" Gray said.\nA few other tax items\u00a0change with the new calendar year.\nThe annual contribution limit for the tax-free savings account, which was launched in 2009,\u00a0doesn't change this year \u2014 it will be $6,000 as it was last year. Since your contribution room carries over year to year, eligible Canadians\u00a0will have a cumulative contribution room of\u00a0up to $69,500.\nFor those\u00a0considering upgrading professional skills, a new Canada Training Benefit allows\u00a0taxpayers to accumulate up to $250 per year toward a future tax credit to\u00a0offset\u00a0up to 50 per cent of eligible tuition costs.\nAnd those who spend some of their hard-earned income to support digital journalism will be able to\u00a0claim up to $500 in eligible subscriptions, for a tax credit worth up to $75, starting with their 2020 returns.\nAnother expected change was suddenly cancelled by Morneau's department late in the day on Dec.19: a move to start taxing stock options more like regular income.\nIn a press release, the department said that, following consultations with stakeholders,\u00a0\"the government will announce details on how it intends to move forward\" in the 2020 federal budget.\nPerhaps the most significant change for some Canadians is in the rebates they receive for living in provinces where they pay the federal carbon tax on things like gasoline and home heating fuels.\nAs of April 1, 2020, the federal price on carbon will rise from $20 to $30 per tonne of emissions. In line\u00a0with that, residents of four provinces will receive revised climate change incentives when they file their taxes this spring.\nIn Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the payments, based on household size, are higher than last year's.\nFor example, a single person in Ontario received $154 last year, but is eligible for $224 this year.\u00a0A family of four in Saskatchewan received $609 last year, but is eligible for $809 this year.\nNew Brunswick, which recently reached an agreement with the federal government on its carbon pricing\u00a0plan, will no longer be subject to the federal tax as of April 1 and its residents will not receive\u00a0rebates when they file their taxes.\u00a0\nGray said she doesn't think people make the connection between rising costs for things like gas\u00a0and the bonus they got at tax time.\n\"I don't know that it was a meaningful amount for many people, but it was still\u00a0nice to have,\" she said. \"It's a gift.\"\nWhich brings us to Albertans, who\u00a0will receive the federal incentive payments for the first time in 2020.\nTheir first payments are larger, to reflect three months when Albertans are paying a carbon tax based on $20 per tonne of emissions (January-March 2020) and twelve months when they're paying the $30/tonne price for 2020-21.\nAlberta\u00a0also generates relatively more carbon emissions that are now subject to the federal\u00a0tax, and the federal government pledged to return\u00a090 per cent of its carbon tax revenues.\nThe tax is meant to encourage households to consume less\u00a0carbon-polluting energy \u2014 so the\u00a0more people conserve, the more they benefit from the rebate.\nUnlike the provincial carbon pricing\u00a0scheme Premier Jason Kenney's government cancelled earlier this year, every Alberta household, regardless of income, is eligible.\nA single adult in Alberta will receive $444.

The Canada Green Building Council released a set of recommendations last week and a coalition of clean energy experts and operators has also written to the prime minister with suggestions.\nThe group launching on Tuesday also holds out the possibility of showing some cross-partisan support for a set of green ideas.\n\"A carbon tax is obviously what people think about when they think about green policy, but there's lots of other things that can be done that are still green,\"\u00a0said Davidson, who co-authored the Ontario Progressive Conservative party's platform in 2018.\u00a0\"I think that the question is, if we're doing recovery projects and we're keeping a focus on environmentalism, we should also keep a focus on things that matter to individuals as well which is getting them back to work, putting money into people's pockets.\"\nAhead of any final recommendations from his group, Lourie already sees some areas for potential action.\nFirst, the federal government could focus on plans to retrofit homes and buildings \u2014 which account for 12 per cent of this country's greenhouse gas emissions \u2014\u00a0to increase the energy efficiency of Canada's physical structures. Such an initiative would create work for tradespeople across the country\u00a0while reducing both energy costs and emissions.\nThe Liberal platform in last year's election already promised free energy audits and interest-free loans for homeowners and landlords as part of a plan to retrofit 1.5 million homes. But expanded funding could drive even faster and deeper change.\nAs part of a long-term project, the federal government could look to expand the production of hydrogen, particularly in Alberta, Lourie says \u2014\u00a0an idea that is now being studied by another group in that province.\nFederal funding for municipal transit systems could also be used to expand the use of electric buses.\nThe task force says it will evaluate ideas according to a three-part test \u2014 determining whether policies are economically timely and lasting, environmentally sound, and both equitable and feasible.\nThere are other issues that will come to bear on any recovery plan.\nThe current economic downturn has, for instance, disproportionately impacted women, service industries and low-wage workers. The health crisis has brought new attention to supply lines and how much Canada depends on international suppliers for important products like medical equipment.\u00a0The state of long-term care, particularly in Ontario and Quebec, has been exposed as a significant weakness.\nThere will no doubt be calls to address such concerns with new investments.\nThe timing and implementation of any recovery plan will also depend on how well COVID-19 is contained and how long significant health-related restrictions remain in place.\nBut there is significant pressure, both in Canada and abroad, to make sure that government stimulus is used to ensure long-term sustainability in the face of that other global threat \u2014\u00a0and that speaks to how much the climate conversation has advanced over the last 10 years.\nA decade ago, when policymakers were trying to counter that last significant recession, the focus was \"shovel-ready\"\u00a0projects \u2014\u00a0infrastructure projects that could begin quickly, providing employment and economic activity for the short term. Infrastructure Minister Catherine McKenna has already adopted that phrase to explain how her department is analyzing potential projects.\nIn this downturn, there is talk instead of pursuing \"shovel-worthy\" investments \u2014\u00a0projects that cannot only get started quickly, but that also deserve to be funded because they fit within larger goals like reducing emissions.\nIn the United States, the stimulus package of 2009 did include significant funding for clean energy. But climate change was largely relegated to a secondary concern once global stock markets started to crash.\nIn 2020, there is a clearer and more widespread understanding that climate change is a central and immediate issue, even amid a global health crisis and an unprecedented economic shock.\n\"Ten years later, we're much further along in terms of our understanding of the importance of having a more diverse economy,\"\u00a0Lourie\u00a0said.\u00a0\"And having an economy that's going to be one that will support our country in 10 years, not just in 10 weeks or 10 months.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "WeWork CEO stepping aside amid questions about how company is run", "description": "Wall Street has raised questions about the company's lack of profits ahead of planned IPO", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/wework-ceo-stepping-aside-1.5295915", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295928.1569356307!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/wework-ceo.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 24, 2019 4:23 PM ET", "2019-09-24T20:24:58.235Z"], "source": null, "content": "WeWork's charismatic but controversial CEO is stepping aside from the company he founded, another moment of reckoning between a fast-growing tech company and its disenchanted investors.\nThe New York-based company, which runs trendy communal office spaces, said Tuesday that Adam Neumann will remain on its board as non-executive chairman. WeWork's Artie Minson, formerly co-president and chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, formerly vice chairman, will become joint CEOs of the company.\nNeumann's magnetic personality and WeWork's carefully designed spaces and cool offerings \u2014 like free beer and meditation classes \u2014 gave it the aura of a tech company. It was initially valued at $47 billion US by private investors.\nBut Wall Street began raising questions after the company delayed a planned initial public offering earlier this month. The company was having trouble drumming up interest in the offering after revealing massive losses in its IPO filings. WeWork's revenue rose sharply to $1.8 billion in 2018, but the company lost $1.6 billion the same year.\nAdding to the problems were questions about Neumann's behaviour. He used some of his WeWork stock to secure a $500 million personal loan prior to the IPO. He also drew criticism after The We Company \u2014 WeWork's recently renamed parent \u2014 paid him nearly $6 million for the trademark \"We.\" He returned the money following the backlash.\nPotential investors also questioned the company's governance. Neumann owns four of the buildings WeWork leases, for example.\n\"While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,\" Neumann said in a statement.\nLeaders with strong personalities at other companies have taken a hard fall. Uber co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick was forced to resign in 2017 after allegations of sexual harassment at the company and an incident in which he yelled at an Uber driver. Silicon Valley investment firm Benchmark Capital, which pushed for Kalanick's ouster, is also the second largest shareholder for WeWork.\nUber's lacklustre IPO this year has caused some investors to look more sharply at tech darlings like WeWork. Some suggest WeWork isn't even a tech company at all, but a real estate company that integrates technology into its services.\nIn the end, skepticism about when or if WeWork will become profitable is the biggest reason for the public market's chilly reception, more than the concerns about Neumann, said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of institutional research and IPO funds.\n\"It's about the business,\" she said. \"They're going to need more than just that change if the goal is to try to tap the public market again.\"\nSometimes, investors are willing to be patient with companies that are losing money but growing rapidly. Amazon is the poster child for this, and it's become one of the most valuable companies in the world following years of losses.\n\"With WeWork, they weren't even showing that progression,\" Smith said.\nIsraeli-born Neumann co-founded WeWork in 2010 with one shared office in Manhattan. It now operates in 111 cities worldwide and serves 527,000 members.\nIn a joint statement, Minson and Gunningham said they are evaluating the optimal timing for an IPO.\n\"Our core business is strong and we will be taking clear actions to balance WeWork's high growth, profitability and unique member experience,\" they said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Chinese yuan falls to 11-year low amid trade tensions", "description": "After Trump pledges more tariffs, China allows currency to fall and threatens agricultural tariffs", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/chinese-yuan-falls-to-11-year-low-amid-trade-tensions-1.5236518", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4605274.1523054105!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trump-year-one.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 05, 2019 8:41 AM ET", "2019-08-05T19:21:14.262Z"], "source": null, "content": "China's yuan fell below the politically sensitive level of seven to the U.S. dollar on Monday,\u00a0adding to trade tension with Washington.\n The currency weakened to 7.0391 to the dollar by late afternoon, making one yuan worth 14.2 cents, its lowest level since February 2008.

State media were reporting\u00a0that China has not ruled out slapping tariffs on agricultural products from the U.S. bought since Aug. 3.\u00a0 Reuters says the Commerce Ministry has told Chinese companies to stop buying U.S. agricultural\u00a0products.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department declined in May to label China a currency manipulator but said it was closely watching Beijing.\nChinese leaders have promised to avoid \"competitive devaluation\" to boost exports by making them less expensive abroad. But regulators say they are\u00a0trying to make the state-controlled exchange rate more responsive to market forces, which are pushing the yuan lower.\nThe yuan, also known as the renminbi, or \"people's money,\" has lost four per cent since hitting a high in February of 6.6862 to the dollar.\nThat helps exporters cope with tariffs of up to 25 per cent imposed by Trump on billions of dollars of Chinese goods. But it raises the risk of inflaming American complaints.\nTrump rattled financial markets Thursday by announcing plans for 10 per cent\u00a0tariffs on $300 billion US of Chinese goods, effective Sept. 1. That would extend penalty duties to almost all U.S. imports from China.\nChina's central bank sets the yuan's exchange rate each morning and allows it to fluctuate by two per cent against the dollar during the day. The central bank can buy or sell currency \u2014 or order Chinese commercial banks to do so \u2014 to dampen price movements.\nThe Treasury report in May said U.S. authorities believe direct central bank intervention this year \"has been limited.\" However, it urged Beijing to \"take the necessary steps to avoid a persistently weak currency.\"\nA weaker yuan also might disrupt Chinese efforts to shore up weakening economic growth by encouraging an outflow of capital from the world's second-largest economy. That would raise borrowing costs.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Janyce McGregor", "title": "Are 2020's tax changes 'significant' or 'a wash'?", "description": "Liberals' promised tax cut may help 20 million Canadians - but only a little", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tax-changes-2020-1.5402975", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5408092.1577209393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/1589060428.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 31, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-31T17:33:08.257Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u00a0introduced a motion earlier this month to keep the\u00a0Liberals' election pledge to cut income taxes for the middle class, he called the measure\u00a0\"significant\" and said it would\u00a0impact\u00a020 million Canadians.\nBut most Canadians would\u00a0have\u00a0to study their pay stubs very closely after Jan. 1 to detect that tax cut and other changes to deductions that arrive\u00a0with the new year. And unless they\u00a0live in Alberta, they may not notice this year's tax\u00a0changes at all (more on that\u00a0later).\n\"It's going to be very subtle. And\u00a0I'd be surprised, frankly, if anybody noticed, if nobody told them,\"\u00a0said Janet Gray, a personal financial planner from Orleans, Ont.\nThe basic personal amount\u00a0\u2014 the amount of annual income Canadians can keep\u00a0tax-free\u00a0\u2014 is slowly increasing over the next four years, to $15,000 by 2023. In previous years, this amount has been adjusted to\u00a0the rate of inflation, but Morneau's most recent enhancement\u00a0goes beyond that.\nFor\u00a0the\u00a02020 tax year, it's rising by $931, to $13,229.\nFor low-income Canadians who'd otherwise have to pay 15 per cent income tax on that amount, the annual tax savings could be about $140. Some of the poorest may no longer owe any tax at all.\n\"There is still about one million Canadians that earn less than that basic personal exemption,\" Gray said. \"So of course, that's going to be meaningful for them.\"\nFor Canadians in the middle-income\u00a0brackets, the annual savings could be up to $240.\nBut divide that across 26 bi-weekly pay periods and the income bump that starts appearing\u00a0on Canadian pay\u00a0stubs doesn't exactly look life-changing: it's enough for an extra cup of fancy coffee or, for higher earners, a food truck\u00a0lunch every two weeks.\nFor those earning more than $150,473 in annual income, the savings are partially clawed back,\u00a0or not offered at all for incomes over $214,368.\nFederal\u00a0tax brackets \u2014 the thresholds that\u00a0trigger higher rates of taxation as incomes rise \u2014\u00a0have been\u00a0adjusted for 2020 based on\u00a0a 1.9 per cent rate of inflation.\nGray points out that in several Canadian cities, particularly those with hot housing markets, the actual rate of inflation may be higher \u2014 which means that these tax brackets and sources of government income\u00a0like the Canada Child Benefit (also\u00a0indexed and rising slightly as of July 1,\u00a02020)\u00a0may not be\u00a0keeping up.\nWhen business or household budgets\u00a0are sensitive to things like rising food costs or higher\u00a0taxes on fossil fuels, the government's calculations fall behind taxpayers' lived reality.\n\"Some people are going to feel inflation more than others depending on their own lifestyle,\" Gray said.\u00a0\nFarther down the pay stub, deductions for Employment Insurance and the Canada Pension Plan are changing, too.\nEI\u00a0premiums are decreasing from 1.62 to 1.58 per cent in 2020, while the maximum insurable earnings will increase to $54,200 from $53,100.\nThat's a\u00a0saving, but don't spend it all at once: it amounts to\u00a0less than a dollar per bi-weekly paycheque.\nCPP premiums, on the other hand, are increasing from 5.1 to 5.25 per cent for employees (double that\u00a0for the self-employed)\u00a0and the maximum pensionable earnings\u00a0\u2014 the amount the government uses to calculate an employee's CPP contributions for the year \u2014 is going up to $58,700.\nFor those earning that much or more, deductions could increase by\u00a0about $5.73\u00a0per bi-weekly paycheque\u00a0(less for lower-income earners). But remember: today's CPP contributions become pension income at retirement, so CPP premiums are\u00a0a modest forced\u00a0savings program, not a tax.\n\"It's kind of painless, a little bit at a time,\" Gray said.\u00a0Young workers may find it difficult to save for retirement\u00a0and are\u00a0less likely than previous generations to have employer-sponsored pensions, so \"CPP is taking on a little bit more of that\u00a0job.\"\nThe problem, Gray said, is that many people max out their EI and CPP contributions before the end of the year, and get used to paycheques leading up to New Year's that have fewer deductions. When January comes around again, their net pay deposits drop\u00a0and \"it's a little bit of a shock.\"\nThis makes it harder to detect subtle deduction changes at the start of a new year.\nTaken together with Morneau's tax cut, \"I think it's going to be mostly a wash,\" Gray said.\nA few other tax items\u00a0change with the new calendar year.\nThe annual contribution limit for the tax-free savings account, which was launched in 2009,\u00a0doesn't change this year \u2014 it will be $6,000 as it was last year. Since your contribution room carries over year to year, eligible Canadians\u00a0will have a cumulative contribution room of\u00a0up to $69,500.\nFor those\u00a0considering upgrading professional skills, a new Canada Training Benefit allows\u00a0taxpayers to accumulate up to $250 per year toward a future tax credit to\u00a0offset\u00a0up to 50 per cent of eligible tuition costs.\nAnd those who spend some of their hard-earned income to support digital journalism will be able to\u00a0claim up to $500 in eligible subscriptions, for a tax credit worth up to $75, starting with their 2020 returns.\nAnother expected change was suddenly cancelled by Morneau's department late in the day on Dec.19: a move to start taxing stock options more like regular income.\nIn a press release, the department said that, following consultations with stakeholders,\u00a0\"the government will announce details on how it intends to move forward\" in the 2020 federal budget.\nPerhaps the most significant change for some Canadians is in the rebates they receive for living in provinces where they pay the federal carbon tax on things like gasoline and home heating fuels.\nAs of April 1, 2020, the federal price on carbon will rise from $20 to $30 per tonne of emissions. In line\u00a0with that, residents of four provinces will receive revised climate change incentives when they file their taxes this spring.\nIn Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the payments, based on household size, are higher than last year's.\nFor example, a single person in Ontario received $154 last year, but is eligible for $224 this year.\u00a0A family of four in Saskatchewan received $609 last year, but is eligible for $809 this year.\nNew Brunswick, which recently reached an agreement with the federal government on its carbon pricing\u00a0plan, will no longer be subject to the federal tax as of April 1 and its residents will not receive\u00a0rebates when they file their taxes.\u00a0\nGray said she doesn't think people make the connection between rising costs for things like gas\u00a0and the bonus they got at tax time.\n\"I don't know that it was a meaningful amount for many people, but it was still\u00a0nice to have,\" she said. \"It's a gift.\"\nWhich brings us to Albertans, who\u00a0will receive the federal incentive payments for the first time in 2020.\nTheir first payments are larger, to reflect three months when Albertans are paying a carbon tax based on $20 per tonne of emissions (January-March 2020) and twelve months when they're paying the $30/tonne price for 2020-21.\nAlberta\u00a0also generates relatively more carbon emissions that are now subject to the federal\u00a0tax, and the federal government pledged to return\u00a090 per cent of its carbon tax revenues.\nThe tax is meant to encourage households to consume less\u00a0carbon-polluting energy \u2014 so the\u00a0more people conserve, the more they benefit from the rebate.\nUnlike the provincial carbon pricing\u00a0scheme Premier Jason Kenney's government cancelled earlier this year, every Alberta household, regardless of income, is eligible.\nA single adult in Alberta will receive $444. A household of four will receive $888.\nNew climate incentive payments\u00a0could add\u00a0more to Albertans'\u00a0bottom lines than the Liberal tax cut.\n"}, {"author": "Kyle Bakx", "title": "Cupcakes, podcasts and Instagram: How churches are navigating the pandemic", "description": "The opportunities and challenges of providing worship amidst COVID-19", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/church-worship-mosque-coronavirus-1.5505239", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4477824.1518118750!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/muskeg-lake-church.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 22, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-22T16:03:14.103Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "No longer allowed to offer a church service, Fred Rink plans to go door-to-door to provide communion to members of his congregation who are stuck at home because of the spread of COVID-19.\nRink will leave a small cup of wine and a wafer on a napkin at the door, then step back about three metres before his parishioner comes outside.\n\"Say the Words of Institution, and pray with them and then bless them.

It was the most Fed dissents in three years.\nThe divisions on the policy committee underscored the challenges confronting chairman Jerome Powell in guiding the Fed at time of high uncertainty in the U.S. economy.\nStock prices tumbled after the Fed issued its statement, reflecting disappointment\u00a0it had declined to indicate that more rate cuts are likely this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 150 points an hour later.\nThe economic expansion appears durable in its 11th year of growth, with a still-solid job market and steady consumer spending. But the Fed is trying to combat threats including uncertainties caused by President Donald Trump's trade war with China, slower global growth and a slump in American manufacturing. The Fed notes in a policy statement that \"business fixed investment and exports have weakened.\"\nThe Fed's modest rate cut irritated Trump, who has attacked the central bank and insisted it slash rates more aggressively. The president immediately signalled his discontent on Twitter\nJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No \u201cguts,\u201d no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\nUpdated economic and interest rate forecasts issued Wednesday by the Fed show that only seven of 17 officials foresee at least one additional rate cut this year. And at least two Fed officials expect a rate hike next year.\nNone of the policymakers foresee rates falling below 1.5 per cent\u00a0in 2020 \u2014 a sign the turbulence from a global slowdown and Trump's escalation of the trade war is viewed as manageable.\nThe median forecasts show the economy is expected to grow a modest 2.2 per cent\u00a0this year, 2 per cent\u00a0next year and 1.9 per cent\u00a0in 2021. Those forecasts are well below the Trump administration's projection that the president's policies will accelerate growth to 3 per cent\u00a0annually or better. But they also suggest policymakers do not envision a recession.\nUnemployment is projected to be 3.7 per cent\u00a0and inflation 1.5 per cent, below the Fed's target level of 2 per cent.\nA resumption of trade talks between the Trump administration and Beijing and a less antagonistic tone between the two sides have supported the view that additional rate cuts might not be necessary. So has a belief that oil prices will remain elevated, that inflation might finally be reaching the Fed's target level and that there are increasing signs that the U.S. economy remains sturdy.\nThe job market looks solid, wages are rising, consumers are still spending, and even sluggish sectors such as manufacturing and construction have shown signs of rebounding.\nYet no one, perhaps not even the Fed, is sure of how interest rate policy will unfold in coming months. Too many uncertainties exist, notably the outcome of Trump's trade war.\nTrump has in the meantime kept up a stream of public attacks on the central bank's policymaking, including referring to Powell as an \"enemy\" and the Fed's policymakers as \"boneheads.\" Even though the economy looks resilient, the president has insisted\u00a0the Fed slash its benchmark rate more deeply \u2014 even to below zero, as the European Central Bank has done \u2014 part to weaken the U.S. dollar and make American exports more competitive.\nPowell has said policymakers remain focused on sustaining the expansion and keeping prices stable without regard to any outside pressures.\nThe Fed is monitoring the global slowdown, especially in Europe, and the U.K.'s effort to leave the European Union. A disruptive Brexit could destabilize not just Europe but the U.S. economy, too.\nU.S. inflation, which has long been dormant, has begun to show signs it is reaching the Fed's two\u00a0per cent target and might remain there. If the Fed's policymakers conclude that inflation will sustain a faster pace, it might give them pause about cutting rates much further.\nThe most serious threat to the expansion is widely seen as Trump's trade war. The increased import taxes he has imposed on goods from China and Europe \u2014 and the counter-tariffs other nations have applied to U.S. exports \u2014 have hurt many American companies and paralyzed their plans for investment and expansion.\nIn recent days, the Trump administration and Beijing have acted to de-escalate tensions before a new round of trade talks planned for October in Washington. Yet most analysts foresee no significant agreement emerging this fall in the conflict, which is fundamentally over Beijing's aggressive drive to supplant America's technological dominance.\n"}, {"author": "Aaron Wherry", "title": "Trudeau's crisis calendar is overflowing - could climate change get pushed to the margins?", "description": "The government's ability to manage multiple emergencies is being sorely tested", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-climate-change-pipelines-blockades-1.5479623", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5480755.1582930436!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trudeau-black-history-month-20200224.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 01, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-01T09:00:00.569Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Rising in the House of Commons one night this past week, Elizabeth May sought to focus the conversation on the great crisis of the moment.\n\"This is a very important debate and, even at this late hour, I do want to discuss the emergency,\" the Green Party MP said.\nOfficially, the topic of the emergency debate was the withdrawal of the proposal to build the Teck Frontier oilsands mine in Alberta. But that wasn't what May wanted to talk about.\n\"Of course, I do not speak of this non-emergency that is the focus of tonight's debate,\" she said. \"I speak of the real emergency.\"\nShe wasn't talking about the\u00a0Wet'suwet'en\u00a0hereditary chiefs or the blockades snarling Canada's railways. She also wasn't talking about the coronavirus. And\u00a0when she spoke, it was too early for her to be worried about crashing global stock markets or the potential for armed conflict between Russia and Turkey.\nInstead, she reminded the House that, eight months earlier, it had declared a \"climate emergency.\" And she read from a recent letter addressed to Justin Trudeau from a group of Nobel prize winners.\n\"The response to the climate crisis will define and destroy legacies in the coming years,\" they wrote.\nWhatever her struggles as a party leader, May has served as the tireless voice of climate anxiety, forever tapping her fellow federal politicians on the shoulder.\nBut, in a season of crises, the climate crisis remains the largest and heaviest challenge\u00a0\u2014 the enduring emergency that won't be solved in a matter of days, weeks, months or even years.\nIt might also be where, above all else, Trudeau most needs to make and show progress now.\nThe climate crisis was supposed to be what this government and this Parliament would be about. It was the issue that seemed, finally, to rise to the forefront of public concern in the latter half of 2019. And it was the\u00a0biggest issue around which the Liberal minority government\u00a0might find common cause with Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, NDP and Green MPs.\nSince then, significant events have intervened.\nFirst, there was the escalation of hostilities between the United States and Iran and the shooting down of PS752 by Iranian forces. Then came the coronavirus outbreak in China, a rush to evacuate Canadian citizens and the need to deal with the disease's inevitable arrival in Canada. And then the dispute over the Coastal GasLink pipeline in\u00a0northern British Columbia led to rail blockades in Ontario and Quebec.\nIn the first eight weeks of the year, Trudeau has convened 11 meetings of the government's \"incident response group\"\u00a0\u2014 the internal body that coordinates government action on urgent matters.\nOf the three unforeseen crises of 2020,\u00a0the blockades have seen the Trudeau government struggle the most to offer a response. The Conservatives have\u00a0ridiculed him repeatedly as \"weak.\"\u00a0In a\u00a0poll by the Angus Reid Institute\u00a0this week, 70 per cent of respondents said Trudeau was doing a \"bad job\" dealing with the dispute, compared to just 21 per cent who said he was doing a \"good job.\"\nThe average citizen tends to object to anything that resembles discord or conflict, and likely just wants the government to resolve the situation in short order. By choosing neither to order an immediate\u00a0police crackdown\u00a0nor to capitulate to the protesters' demands, Trudeau also has failed to satisfy those who feel most strongly about the dispute.\nTrudeau can only hope that the talks currently underway in British Columbia produce a durable resolution \u2014 and that Canadians are more charitable when they look back a year or two from now at his handling of both this crisis and the larger issue of Indigenous-Crown reconciliation.\nBut as these events have unfolded for Canada, the larger forces of the climate crisis have continued to push and pull on a global scale.\nBlackRock, the American investment firm that manages more than $7 trillion in assets, announced in January that it would be emphasizing climate change in its future decisions. Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada, took up his new post as the UN's special envoy for climate action and finance\u00a0in February, with a focus on better incorporating climate risk into financial decision-making. Last week, economists at JP Morgan, the largest bank in the United States, sent a report to clients that warned of the potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change.\nFor years, climate change seemed to suffer politically from a lack of any real sense of urgency.\u00a0But now the pressure is coming not only from environmental activists, scientists and progressive politicians, but from markets and corporations.\nIn explaining the decision to walk\u00a0away from the Frontier oilsands project this week, Teck Resources chief executive Don Lindsay said that \"global capital markets are changing rapidly and investors and customers are increasingly looking for jurisdictions to have a framework in place that reconciles resource development and climate change, in order to produce the cleanest possible products.\"\nThat is both an invitation for politicians to get on with the discussion about climate policy in Canada and cover for them to act \u2014 not that they should need it at this point.\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau has suggested the spring budget could be focused on climate change and that could mean following through on a number of campaign commitments: new loans for home retrofits, rebates for the purchase of zero-emission vehicles, new funding for clean energy, a plan to plant two billion trees over the next 10 years.\nBut the Liberals also have promised significant new pieces of a broader climate agenda: new legislation that would hold the federal government accountable for meeting a series of emissions targets, a \"Just Transition Act\" to help\u00a0displaced energy workers, new flood maps\u00a0and a low-cost flood insurance program.\nTrudeau's Liberals are committed to not only\u00a0exceeding the current target for emissions reductions by 2030, but also to building a plan for getting the country to net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThat's\u00a0a lot to do in\u00a0what could end up being a two or three-year term.\u00a0And the government has not demonstrated much momentum since last fall's election.\nThe climate crisis also is likely to play a significant part in how Trudeau is judged at the next federal election.\nThe crises of the first two months of 2020 are significant, both practically and politically. And leaders are always judged on how they handle the unexpected.\nBut governments also need to show progress, provide direction and lay out a credible vision. Whenever the next election comes, climate change will be a significant factor\u00a0in how Canadians judge Trudeau's performance \u2014 what he has done\u00a0and how he has set up Canada for the future.\u00a0Canadians might wish he'd done something to more quickly resolve the\u00a0Wet'suwet'en protests, but his re-election is still more likely to depend on how he has dealt with climate change\u00a0and its related concerns.\nAny number of unforeseen events will intervene between now and then. Crises come and go. But the climate crisis is not going away.\n"}, {"author": "Sophia Harris", "title": "Trying to ward off the coronavirus?

But health experts warn\u00a0some of these items may be ineffective, especially if they're not used properly.\u00a0\nHere's what you need to know before stocking up on supplies during the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0\nThe best way to prevent the spread of infections is to keep your hands clean, so it's no surprise that as the coronavirus spreads, stores are running out of hand sanitizer. Fortunately, old-fashioned soap and water will also do the trick.\u00a0\nMicrobiologist Keith Warriner said, if you're using a hand sanitizer, it must contain at least 60 per cent alcohol \u2014 the ingredient that kills the virus.\u00a0\n\"If you haven't got\u00a0enough [alcohol] in there, it doesn't do anything. It has basically dried the virus onto your hand,\" said Warriner, a professor at the University of Guelph.\nEven if your sanitizer has the right ingredients, Warriner still believes washing with soap provides the best protection because it\u00a0washes the virus\u00a0away.\n\"You're actually physically removing it.\"\u00a0\nMedical microbiologist\u00a0Dr. Jocelyn Srigley argues that either soap or\u00a0hand sanitizer are equally effective \u2014\u00a0as long as when using either product, you cover all parts of your hands. That would include each finger, the fingernail area and the fronts and backs of your hands, all the way to your wrists.\u00a0\n\"If you're not following the proper technique, then it's not going to be as effective, regardless of which method you're using,\" said Dr. Srigley,\u00a0a practising physician and professor\u00a0at the\u00a0University of British Columbia.\nDr. Srigley said that face masks are best used if you are sick, and want to protect others from getting infected when you cough or sneeze.\nBut she said a mask\u00a0won't necessarily protect you from catching the coronavirus because the main way people get it is by touching an infected surface and then touching their mouth, eyes or nose.\u00a0\nShe points out that people often end up touching their face when putting on, taking off or adjusting a face mask, plus it does nothing to protect a person's\u00a0eyes.\u00a0\n\"It's actually not protecting you against the most common way the virus is spreading.\"\nIf you still want to wear a face mask, there are two main types on the market. One is the disposable surgical mask typically made of paper material which\u00a0Warriner warns is unable to completely block out the tiny coronavirus.\n\"It's certainly not foolproof,\" he said. \"You can't go and stand in the middle of a room with people with coronavirus and say, 'Look at me. I'm immune to it.'\"\nThe second type of mask is the called the N95 which has a firmer exterior. Warriner said it's effective in blocking the virus, but that many\u00a0people fail to wear it properly, allowing the virus to sneak in.\u00a0\nSome shoppers are also stocking up on disposable gloves, in hope\u00a0gloves will protect them from picking up the virus.\u00a0\nBut Dr. Srigley warns that wearing gloves\u00a0could provide a false sense of security where people let down their guard.\u00a0\n\"If you think you're protected because you're wearing a glove, but if you then touch your face with the glove, then you're at risk,\" she said.\u00a0\nRemoving dirty gloves without getting contaminated can also be tricky. Considering these complications, Dr. Srigley says that frequently sanitizing or washing hands is a better option.\u00a0\nSome Canadians are hoping they can ward off the coronavirus by boosting their immune system with vitamins or other supplements.\u00a0\nPeople with weak or compromised immune systems face a higher risk of getting seriously ill from the virus.\nWarriner said the best way to stay healthy is not by popping vitamins, but instead by staying rested and drinking plenty of liquids.\n\"The thing that really takes our immune system down is being dehydrated, being stressed, lack of sleep.\"\nAnd when it comes to stocking up on food, people should be wary of perishables that, if they\u00a0go bad, could compromise a person's health, said Warriner.\n\"Basically, avoid food poisoning because that knocks\u00a0our immune system [out].\"\u00a0\nThere have been reports across the globe that people are also stockpiling toilet paper. While the product is a staple\u00a0of daily hygiene, it won't help ward off the coronavirus.\nInstead, the run on toilet paper is likely caused by panic buying which\u00a0has caught on with many shoppers.\u00a0\nWarriner said people think \"if someone's buying it, then I have to buy it.\"\u00a0\nHe also wonders whether some people may be confusing the coronavirus with the norovirus \u2014\u00a0a different virus which causes diarrhea.\nWATCH |\u00a0Preparing for quarantine: Tips from an expert\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Prescribed version of heartburn drug Zantac recalled worldwide as a 'precaution'", "description": "U.S. regulator finds 'unacceptable' levels of probable cancer-causing impurity NDMA", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/zantac-recall-1.5313897", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5314877.1570640480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/zantac-and-generic-ranitidine.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 08, 2019 5:31 PM ET", "2019-10-09T21:53:39.263Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canadian consumers who grab Zantac and other medications containing ranitidine off the pharmacy shelf can continue to do so despite a global recall of the prescribed version.\nIn Canada, Sanofi is the only manufacturer of branded Zantac, and it's only available over-the-counter, the company said. Since prescription Zantac is not sold in this country, Tuesday's global recall by GlaxoSmithKline of prescription-only Zantac products does not apply in Canada.\n\"There were some impurities found in the manufacturing plant that is used to manufacture the prescription strengths of Zantac and ranitidine. It does not affect the non-prescription strengths because they're made at a different facility,\" said Barry Power, senior director of digital content at the Canadian Pharmacists Association.\nOver-the-counter ranitidine is approved to prevent and relieve heartburn associated with acid indigestion and sour stomach. The prescription versions are used to reduce stomach acid to prevent and treat conditions, such as heartburn, ulcers of the stomach and intestines\u00a0and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Health Canada said.\nRanitidine works by blocking the action of acid-producing cells in the stomach.\n\"Sanofi in Canada has not recalled Zantac, a lower dose, over-the-counter ranitidine medication. In order to comply with Health Canada's guidance, as a precautionary measure, Sanofi in Canada is holding all distribution of Zantac until further notice \u2013 no further action is required for product currently on the market,\" Sanofi Canada spokesperson Christine Homsy said Wednesday.\nThe affected products are under voluntary recall by generic companies or subject to distribution halts, where existing stocks can still be sold, because regulators worldwide have detected an impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA).\nNDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen, meaning long-term exposure to levels above what is considered safe could increase the risk of cancer. If someone was prescribed a medication containing ranitidine, contact your pharmacy, Power said.\nPeople can be switched to famotidine (brand name Pepcid) or another medication that achieves the same effect on stomach acids, he said.\nHealth Canada advised consumers:\nDr. Emily McDonald, an assistant professor of medicine at the McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, said this is\u00a0a good opportunity to check if the medication is still needed.\u00a0\n\"People can try and come off of it and see how they feel and see if their reflux symptoms return.

A thread <a href=\"https://t.co/nMuhuBhVUf\">https://t.co/nMuhuBhVUf</a>\nAnd many independent observers say it is very likely that the fossil fuel industry's days are numbered. The debate is mostly how long it's got.\nMark Kamstra, a finance professor at the Schulich School of Business, a specialist in risk, is skeptical that society will quickly\u00a0abandon\u00a0fossil energy.\n\"Everyone can see the future and, sure, it's not really bright for oil 50 years from now, or even maybe 30 years from now,\" said Kamstra.\nHe compares oil companies to Kodak, which faded away due to changing technology and new consumer needs. But he sees investment opportunities in the meantime.\u00a0Rather than investing as much in exploration, oil and gas producers will return profits to shareholders resulting in higher dividends yields.\u00a0Also, psychology can play a part.\n\"You can't go to a party and boast about making money on oil stocks right now,\" jokes\u00a0Kamstra.\nAs shareholders divest to demonstrate their disapproval, they may have the unintended effect of making fossil fuel share prices\u00a0lower than returns would justify, something observed with so-called sin stocks such as tobacco and liquor companies.\nBut despite warnings of a climate emergency, the \"extinction rebellion\" and the student marches following the example of teenage climate champion Greta Thunberg, Kamstra\u00a0believes the petroleum industry is simply too entrenched in economic life for the world to make a speedy pivot.\u00a0\n\"I just don't think people will be willing to make personal sacrifices. It's got to be win-win,\" said Kamstra.\nMatthew Klippenstein, a chemical engineer with a long history in the clean-energy sector,\u00a0sees a win-win for the Alberta oil and gas industry as the world moves\u00a0to\u00a0low carbon.\nKodak went bankrupt partly because it was terrified of undermining its own principal business\u00a0that depended on film. But Klippenstein sees a way around that conundrum.\u00a0\nSophisticated players in the oil and gas sector including Suncor\u00a0are already looking for ways to avoid the Kodak mistake,\u00a0for example by installing high-speed electrical vehicle chargers in the company's Petro-Canada service stations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nKlippenstein, who recently worked on an innovation report for\u00a0Zen Clean Energy Solutions, told me last week\u00a0that Alberta's high-tech energy sector should use\u00a0its skills and wealth, for example, in the young but growing hydrogen sector, which David Layzell at\u00a0Canadian Energy Systems Analysis Research says is already feasible. It's a low-carbon\u00a0technology that will grow as oil and gas gradually declines.\n\"Yes, [Alberta's] energy sector and infrastructure are for now fossil-focused,\" wrote Klippenstein\u00a0in a recent tweet.\u00a0 \"But that's incidental, not intrinsic.\"\nLike Kamstra, Klippenstein sees the demand for Canadian oil and gas continuing for decades. But the companies that survive and prosper will not be those that dig their heels in and refuse to change.\nIf the low-carbon revolution actually happens, the companies that will still be worth owning\u00a0in 30 years and the places that will attract investment\u00a0will be those now\u00a0making\u00a0the effort and the investment to find ways to\u00a0adapt.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "As global recession fears rise, it's time to look at your money, finance expert says", "description": "'Money continues to be the number one source of stress,' Kelley Keehn says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/checkup/what-s-giving-you-economic-jitters-as-we-near-the-election-1.5256167/as-global-recession-fears-rise-it-s-time-to-look-at-your-money-finance-expert-says-1.5259599", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4465792.1519251580!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cash-money-currency-economy-canadian-dollars.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 26, 2019 11:52 AM ET", "2019-08-26T15:52:55.475Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "With economists predicting a recession may be on the horizon, finance expert Kelley Keehn says\u00a0Canadians should take stock of their money.\n\"If you're already feeling a little uneasy with a recession coming, this is a great time,\" Keehn, a consumer advocate for FP Canada, told Cross Country Checkup host Duncan McCue.\nIn recent weeks, economists have pointed to global forces \u2014 like trade tension between the U.S. and China and an inverted yield curve in the markets \u2014 as a sign that Canada could\u00a0be susceptible to a downturn.\u00a0\nWhile Canada's economy is doing well, generally, the cost of living is top of mind for Canadians.\nOn Sunday, Checkup asked Canadians what worries they have for their pocketbook going into the October federal election.

Those payments are jumping by more than $200 million.\n\"Certainly the choices weren't as hard this year as they were last year,\" Steeves said, though he credited prudent management by the Tories more than the injection of cash from Ottawa.\nThe rosier financial picture will allow the province to spend more money,\u00a0including an increase of five per cent in the three main social assistance programs affecting single recipients.\nAbout 15,000 people in the three programs, or about two-thirds of all recipients, will see the increase May 1.\nA year later, the rates in those three categories will be indexed to the consumer price index, meaning they'll rise automatically at the rate of inflation. Other rates will stay the same.\nGreen Party Leader David Coon had been calling for increases and his vote could be key to the budget passing or being defeated in a vote expected March 20. A rejection of the budget would trigger a provincial election.\nCoon told reporters that he liked some of the measures in the budget but they don't go far enough.\nHe said he and his two fellow Green MLAs were not ready yet to decide how they'll vote.\n\"The balance of power has shifted in this legislature toward the Green caucus, so we take that responsibility very seriously,\" he said.\n\"So we're going to take our time to reflect on the budget, discuss it, and in the end come up with a decision that in our view is in the best interests of our province.\"\nHealth spending will also increase by 3.9 per cent, with some of that increase paying for 26 new nurse practitioner positions around the province.\nThe Progressive Conservatives also plan\u00a0to begin gradually reducing some taxes in the coming year, a move the People's Alliance has been calling for.\nStarting in April, the so-called \"double taxation\" of apartment properties will start to be reduced with a goal of cutting it in half over four years.\n\"We're very pleased to see it's a decrease,\" said People's Alliance Leader Kris Austin. \"It's not as much as we'd like.

Those payments are jumping by more than $200 million.\n\"Certainly the choices weren't as hard this year as they were last year,\" Steeves said, though he credited prudent management by the Tories more than the injection of cash from Ottawa.\nThe rosier financial picture will allow the province to spend more money,\u00a0including an increase of five per cent in the three main social assistance programs affecting single recipients.\nAbout 15,000 people in the three programs, or about two-thirds of all recipients, will see the increase May 1.\nA year later, the rates in those three categories will be indexed to the consumer price index, meaning they'll rise automatically at the rate of inflation. Other rates will stay the same.\nGreen Party Leader David Coon had been calling for increases and his vote could be key to the budget passing or being defeated in a vote expected March 20. A rejection of the budget would trigger a provincial election.\nCoon told reporters that he liked some of the measures in the budget but they don't go far enough.\nHe said he and his two fellow Green MLAs were not ready yet to decide how they'll vote.\n\"The balance of power has shifted in this legislature toward the Green caucus, so we take that responsibility very seriously,\" he said.\n\"So we're going to take our time to reflect on the budget, discuss it, and in the end come up with a decision that in our view is in the best interests of our province.\"\nHealth spending will also increase by 3.9 per cent, with some of that increase paying for 26 new nurse practitioner positions around the province.\nThe Progressive Conservatives also plan\u00a0to begin gradually reducing some taxes in the coming year, a move the People's Alliance has been calling for.\nStarting in April, the so-called \"double taxation\" of apartment properties will start to be reduced with a goal of cutting it in half over four years.\n\"We're very pleased to see it's a decrease,\" said People's Alliance Leader Kris Austin. \"It's not as much as we'd like.

of American decision-makers\u00a0following the recent attack\u00a0on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, experts say.\u00a0 \u00a0\nIndustry and government leaders around the world are still assessing the impact of Saturday's\u00a0drone strikes on the state-owned Saudi Aramco\u00a0facilities.\u00a0\nThe attack\u00a0disrupted about five per cent of global crude supplies, sending oil prices soaring.\nThe news also saw Canadian energy stocks surge by double digits during Monday's trading amid concerns\u00a0the impact on\u00a0oil markets could last months.\u00a0\nCanadian crude \u2014\u00a0overshadowed by soaring U.S.\u00a0shale oil production in recent years\u00a0\u2014\u00a0could\u00a0receive\u00a0greater focus with renewed discussion about secure energy\u00a0supplies, said Rory Johnston,\u00a0\u00a0a commodity economist at Scotiabank.\n\"Historically, we've\u00a0seen more of the sentiment toward the Canadian oil sector as being couched in terms of oil security, which as\u00a0a concept has kind of fallen by the wayside,\" Johnston said.\u00a0\n\"This will likely raise that energy security narrative back to the forefront of public discussion, which all else equal, should benefit the Canadian oilpatch as a source of secure supply \u2014 politically\u00a0secure and right next door to the United States.\"\nWhile Canadian pipeline constraints make it difficult for oil companies to get more Alberta oil\u00a0to market currently, Johnston said, a shift in the conversation\u00a0could fuel further political pressure to build projects like\u00a0Keystone XL, which has struggled in the face of legal, environmental and political challenges in the U.S.\n\"It wouldn't necessarily accelerate the timeline of these types of projects being built,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"I think what this does is just lessens\u00a0the risk that we're going to see further delays.\"\nAberta Premier Jason Kenney, who was\u00a0in New York on Monday to meet with\u00a0institutional investors, also emphasized\u00a0the message that Alberta is \"the most secure major source of energy\" in the world.\n\"The strike on Saudi refineries should be a wake-up call,\" he\u00a0posted to\u00a0social media.\nKenney was also reported Monday to be looking at easing mandatory oil production cuts in Alberta following those attacks.\nAmerican interest in secure supplies of oil from Canada was particularly strong\u00a0after the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, said Christopher Sands, an expert on energy policy at\u00a0Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C.\nThat changed during the Obama administration, he said, with greater emphasis on the environment.\nSands said the situation with Saudi Arabia may have Americans looking at Alberta, but it could\u00a0underscore for some\u00a0lawmakers how important it is Canada build on its own pipeline capacity and ensure security\u00a0of its oil.\n\"You don't have enough capacity, and this makes us think you need redundant capacity because what if something goes wrong?\"\u00a0said Sands, adding that ensuring the\u00a0security of existing energy infrastructure is key.\nTim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said the current situation in Saudi Arabia may provide more\u00a0incentive to expedite projects like Keystone XL and Enbridge's Line 3,\u00a0which would carry more oil from Alberta to the U.S.\nBut he added that even with President Donald Trump \"pushing these projects, it has been a challenge with the U.S. court system and some of the other delay tactics that opponents are using.\"\nThough McMillan said he's confident those projects will be built, he added he was \"less confident\" that the U.S. legal system will move any faster.\n\"But why on earth is Canada so beholden to the United States when we have the world's second-largest coastlines, where we have a close connection to the growing markets in Asia?\" he added.\nWhile Canadian producers\u00a0still face\u00a0challenges in getting oil to market, whether by pipeline or by rail,\u00a0Ian\u00a0Nieboer, managing director at\u00a0RS Energy Group, said\u00a0they should benefit from higher oil prices.\u00a0\nThe question everyone is trying to answer, he said, is how long will the situation last.\n\"The outage itself and its duration is probably the first and most pronounced fundamental impact,\" he said.\n\"The longer term and more structural piece is, is there\u00a0some sort of risk premium [on oil prices] that maybe enters the market as you think about the politics of the Middle East and now really the circumstances that led to this weekend's attack,\" Nieboer\u00a0said.\nAs for gasoline prices, Roger McKnight, chief petroleum analyst at En-Pro International, says it likely means higher gasoline prices in Canada as early as Wednesday. He said\u00a0it's unclear how long it's going to last.\n\"We have no idea\u00a0\u2026 where this thing is going to\u00a0go because it's completely out of anyone's control,\" McKnight said.\n\"And the Saudis are going to keep things kind of close to the vest because they don't want to really upset the market completely. But the facts are facts. Five per cent of crude supply goes off the market, and prices have to go up.\"\n"}, {"author": "Ian Froese", "title": "Manitoba promises payroll tax cut for 1,000 employers", "description": "Businesses with total salaries below $1.5M will be exempt from the tax as of next year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-cuts-payroll-tax-one-thousand-employers-1.5492467", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5493243.1583883937!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/scott-fielding-manitoba-finance-minister.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 1:47 PM CT", "2020-03-11T00:48:26.579Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Manitoba government is pledging to cut the payroll tax for an estimated 1,000 employers in the province.\nFinance Minister Scott Fielding announced Tuesday that the province will exempt businesses with payrolls under $1.5 million from paying the tax\u00a0beginning on Jan. 1, 2021.

But despite their official independence, political directives\u00a0and market expectations are telling the Federal Open Market\u00a0Committee, who make the final rate decision, that their hands are tied.\nAccording to most economists, low and negative interest rates of the kind Trump advised\u00a0are a special tool reserved for dire circumstances.\nWhen central banks slashed rates\u00a0in the aftermath of the 2007-08 credit crunch they\u00a0were widely applauded. But the\u00a0idea that something similar is happening now\u00a0would be terrifying. That is, if we believed it.\nPuzzling out the true meaning of the\u00a0president's tweets is never easy. Perhaps it is a madcap idea to\u00a0satisfy his base. Or\u00a0it's just another way of feathering his own nest, a standard Democratic complaint.\nCertainly low rates help property companies with large loans and tend to help rich people with assets such as real estate and stock.\u00a0\nThe level-headed folks at the FOMC\u00a0will know that whatever rational\u00a0arguments there may be\u00a0for rate cuts, there are many, many reasons to wait as data pours in showing the economy is nowhere near collapse and recession.\nThe single\u00a0biggest fear for the U.S. economy has been its trade war with China, and last week there was clear evidence that both sides are taking steps back from the brink.\nFiring national security adviser\u00a0John Bolton, seen as the Trump administration's most hawkish hawk, may offer economic dividends and draws the U.S. back from economically destabilizing regional conflicts.\n\"In the world's hot spots from Iran to North Korea \u2014 and even among allies \u2014 some see opportunity in President Donald Trump's firing of his national security adviser,\"\u00a0reported\u00a0Associated Press last week.\u00a0\u00a0Of course all bets are off following the weekend attacks on Saudi oil production that some U.S. officials have blamed on Iran, something that country has denied.\nPerhaps most significant for the Fed,\u00a0whose two prime mandates\u00a0are to boost employment and keep inflation under control, were numbers last week showing inflation is not dead after all.\nWhile the headline price level was up only slightly, core inflation, the measure\u00a0chopping out\u00a0volatile goods such as energy, was well above target at 2.4 per cent, and higher than market expectations.\u00a0Gas prices that have been holding inflation down may be set to soar following the Saturday attack, which is expected to cause a\u00a0major drop in Saudi\u00a0oil output.\nThe surge is a warning and a reminder\u00a0that at some point the Fed will again\u00a0have to raise rates. Surely FOMC members will not forget the theatrical wailing from markets last time the Fed felt forced to hike rates to fight inflation. Perhaps the memory will give them\u00a0second thoughts about making cuts that might\u00a0have to be reversed.\nThe other strong technical argument for refusing to cut rates frivolously is that the bank is wasting fire power for when a recession actually hits. If Powell follows Trump's advice and cuts when the U.S. economy is strong, the FOMC must show what tools they will use\u00a0once it is not.\nSpeaking in a British context, last week Canadian author Margaret Atwood described a growing medievalism where politicians who disagree with their mad king fear they will be next on the chopping block.\nBeing subject to Congress, not the administration,\u00a0means that Powell has the freedom to contradict Trump and declare that the U.S. economy is vibrant and strong. In\u00a0what Princeton economist Robert Shiller\u00a0has described as\u00a0\"narrative economics,\"\u00a0Powell may have\u00a0the power to shift the narrative.\nIf he agrees with Trump and others who claim a weakened United States needs rate cuts, consumers and businesses are more likely to believe him than Trump, whose interests are opaque.\nBut if Powell can honestly tell investors and consumers that a strong U.S. is not showing signs of recession and does not need lower interest rates, that a young and vigorous workforce hired by\u00a0innovative companies still has room to grow, invest\u00a0and prosper,\u00a0he\u00a0may be able to boost the North American\u00a0economy far more than he could with a quarter or even a half percentage point cut in rates.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Kathleen Harris", "title": "What's next for Canada if the WHO calls COVID-19 a pandemic?", "description": "Schools could close and elective surgeries could be cancelled as officials work to stop spread of virus", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/coronavirus-covid19-tam-pandemic-preparations-1.5480034", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5480525.1582925403!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-pharmaceuticals.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 28, 2020 7:34 PM ET", "2020-02-29T16:49:40.528Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As global tensions mount over the spread of COVID-19, Canada is crafting its own plan to respond to what could become a pandemic.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, an international health emergency.

Gardham said that now makes Canada better prepared than many other countries to respond to a pandemic \u2014 with the caveat that most of the country's hospitals are now at 100 per cent capacity.\nDecisions on how to isolate\u00a0infected persons will be made by local and provincial health authorities. Their approaches\u00a0could range from recommended self-isolation, to hospitalization, to quarantine.\nTam said public health systems are adept at assessing and isolating people who are contagious and managing infectious diseases.\n\"So you might see certain settings where exposures could have occurred and that local public health officials will make a determination, and groups of people may need to be in a quarantine,\" she said during a briefing with reporters this week.\nToronto's Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa said that in the event of a pandemic, the city would operate\u00a0under emergency response protocols. Legislative powers for quarantines come under the Provincial Health Protection and Promotion Act, she told\u00a0CBC News.\nSteps to limit spread of the virus would be assessed and taken after officials weighed the\u00a0need to prevent\u00a0the spread of infection against the need for communities to function.\n\"We are closely watching the global epidemiology and response measures elsewhere including the effectiveness of increased public health measures such as postponing large gatherings,\" de Villa said.\n\"Other actions that could be considered could include postponement of events,\u00a0or limiting places where people gather in large numbers.\u00a0This action is a significant measure and can be very disruptive to people and their everyday lives.\"\nIt's not clear at this point whether Canada's current stockpile of masks, gloves, respirators and other supplies and equipment is large enough to respond to a pandemic.\nTam said federal and provincial officials are now taking stock of the inventory, but the responsibility for setting aside adequate supplies lies with each province and territory.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) co-ordinates the overarching plan for health emergencies. Tam said that as a result of the \"changing landscape\" due to COVID-19, officials at all levels are now \"pulling together\" information.\n\"Of course, we have to adapt to ... the evolution of the outbreak in order to fine-tune some of these estimates ... that's the kind of exercise that's being undertaken right now. But the granularity of the system's preparedness is, of course, left to the provinces and territories,\" she said.\nThere are now at least 60 countries affected by the coronavirus, some with isolated cases and others with serious outbreaks.\nOfficials have said closing borders is ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus, so it's\u00a0unlikely that Canada would impose a total travel ban. But international travellers\u00a0could be at heightened risk of being exposed to the virus, or being stranded by a quarantine situation,\u00a0if they travel to a zone affected by the COVID-19.\nForeign Affairs Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne has encouraged Canadians to check Global Affairs Canada's travel advisories before planning a trip. The advisories are updated as\u00a0new information becomes available.\u00a0\nTam told Power & Politics\u00a0that every Canadian should consider various factors as the busy March Break travel period approaches, such as their underlying health and age and their planned destination. She stressed the\u00a0importance of being aware of any symptoms upon returning to Canada, and of self-isolation to avoid exposing others.\nThere is no vaccine yet for the novel coronavirus.\u00a0\nPHAC says Canadians should protect themselves against infection by washing their hands frequently with soap, staying home when sick, covering their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing, and avoiding touching their eyes, nose, or mouths with unwashed hands.\n\"Although these sound like your basic things that you do every flu\u00a0season, it is really important for you to rehearse, to talk to your kids and your family and keep practising these kind of measures,\" Tam told P&P.\nTam and Health Minister Patty Hajdu\u00a0also have suggested preparing as you would\u00a0for a natural emergency such as a severe snowstorm\u00a0\u2014 by setting aside\u00a0a week's supply of food, medicine and other household supplies.\u00a0\nTam also recommended having back-up plans for child care and work in the event someone in the household becomes sick.\u00a0\nInfectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch\u00a0stressed the importance of getting reliable information about the coronavirus from authoritative sources, and said Canadians should take the opportunity to address chronic health care issues and fill outstanding prescriptions.\nHe told the CBC's Front Burner\u00a0podcast that\u00a0Canadians are feeling daunted by the thought of being at the\u00a0\"precipice of a pandemic.\" He offered what he called a uniquely Canadian message.\n\"You keep your head up and your stick on the ice,\" he told host Jayme\u00a0Poisson.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Kathleen Harris", "title": "What's next for Canada if the WHO calls COVID-19 a pandemic?", "description": "Schools could close and elective surgeries could be cancelled as officials work to stop spread of virus", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/coronavirus-covid19-tam-pandemic-preparations-1.5480034", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5480525.1582925403!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-pharmaceuticals.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 28, 2020 7:34 PM ET", "2020-02-29T16:49:40.528Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As global tensions mount over the spread of COVID-19, Canada is crafting its own plan to respond to what could become a pandemic.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, an international health emergency.

Their approaches\u00a0could range from recommended self-isolation, to hospitalization, to quarantine.\nTam said public health systems are adept at assessing and isolating people who are contagious and managing infectious diseases.\n\"So you might see certain settings where exposures could have occurred and that local public health officials will make a determination, and groups of people may need to be in a quarantine,\" she said during a briefing with reporters this week.\nToronto's Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa said that in the event of a pandemic, the city would operate\u00a0under emergency response protocols. Legislative powers for quarantines come under the Provincial Health Protection and Promotion Act, she told\u00a0CBC News.\nSteps to limit spread of the virus would be assessed and taken after officials weighed the\u00a0need to prevent\u00a0the spread of infection against the need for communities to function.\n\"We are closely watching the global epidemiology and response measures elsewhere including the effectiveness of increased public health measures such as postponing large gatherings,\" de Villa said.\n\"Other actions that could be considered could include postponement of events,\u00a0or limiting places where people gather in large numbers.\u00a0This action is a significant measure and can be very disruptive to people and their everyday lives.\"\nIt's not clear at this point whether Canada's current stockpile of masks, gloves, respirators and other supplies and equipment is large enough to respond to a pandemic.\nTam said federal and provincial officials are now taking stock of the inventory, but the responsibility for setting aside adequate supplies lies with each province and territory.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) co-ordinates the overarching plan for health emergencies. Tam said that as a result of the \"changing landscape\" due to COVID-19, officials at all levels are now \"pulling together\" information.\n\"Of course, we have to adapt to ... the evolution of the outbreak in order to fine-tune some of these estimates ... that's the kind of exercise that's being undertaken right now. But the granularity of the system's preparedness is, of course, left to the provinces and territories,\" she said.\nThere are now at least 60 countries affected by the coronavirus, some with isolated cases and others with serious outbreaks.\nOfficials have said closing borders is ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus, so it's\u00a0unlikely that Canada would impose a total travel ban. But international travellers\u00a0could be at heightened risk of being exposed to the virus, or being stranded by a quarantine situation,\u00a0if they travel to a zone affected by the COVID-19.\nForeign Affairs Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne has encouraged Canadians to check Global Affairs Canada's travel advisories before planning a trip. The advisories are updated as\u00a0new information becomes available.\u00a0\nTam told Power & Politics\u00a0that every Canadian should consider various factors as the busy March Break travel period approaches, such as their underlying health and age and their planned destination. She stressed the\u00a0importance of being aware of any symptoms upon returning to Canada, and of self-isolation to avoid exposing others.\nThere is no vaccine yet for the novel coronavirus.\u00a0\nPHAC says Canadians should protect themselves against infection by washing their hands frequently with soap, staying home when sick, covering their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing, and avoiding touching their eyes, nose, or mouths with unwashed hands.\n\"Although these sound like your basic things that you do every flu\u00a0season, it is really important for you to rehearse, to talk to your kids and your family and keep practising these kind of measures,\" Tam told P&P.\nTam and Health Minister Patty Hajdu\u00a0also have suggested preparing as you would\u00a0for a natural emergency such as a severe snowstorm\u00a0\u2014 by setting aside\u00a0a week's supply of food, medicine and other household supplies.\u00a0\nTam also recommended having back-up plans for child care and work in the event someone in the household becomes sick.\u00a0\nInfectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch\u00a0stressed the importance of getting reliable information about the coronavirus from authoritative sources, and said Canadians should take the opportunity to address chronic health care issues and fill outstanding prescriptions.\nHe told the CBC's Front Burner\u00a0podcast that\u00a0Canadians are feeling daunted by the thought of being at the\u00a0\"precipice of a pandemic.\" He offered what he called a uniquely Canadian message.\n\"You keep your head up and your stick on the ice,\" he told host Jayme\u00a0Poisson.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Erik White ", "title": "Ring of Fire was 'overhyped,' but still 'worth the effort' says Noront Resources", "description": "Current plan is for construction of mine to start in 2021 and to open in 2024", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/ring-of-fire-10-years-later-1.5479300", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3806978.1476548437!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/esker-camp-aerial-view.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 02, 2020 6:00 AM ET", "2020-03-02T11:00:00.361Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In the spring of 2010, a place called \"The Ring of Fire\" was mentioned in the provincial budget speech.\nIn the months that followed, the Ontario government talked up the remote mineral cluster as the next big thing, maybe even as big as the Sudbury or Timmins mining camps.\nIn 2012, a company called Cliffs Natural Resources announced plans to mine chromite in the Ring of Fire and process it at a new smelter to be built north of Sudbury. It was all supposed to be up and running by 2015\n\"I always thought the timelines people were putting out were way too short,\" says Garry Clark, president of the Ontario Prospectors Association.\n\"The politicians were treating it as if\u00a0you were walking through the muskeg and came to a little hill and crawled up on your belly and looked over top of the hill there's a mine sitting there just waiting for the road and it's not like that at all because there's no infrastructure there at all. There's just a bunch of drill holes in the ground and that's all there is.\"\u00a0\nSince then, the Ring of Fire has become a story of delay, with political parties blaming each other for not getting the access road built and the mines up and running.\n\"Like with anything that is overhyped, people are usually disappointed,\" says Alan Coutts, CEO of Noront Resources, which is now the main player in the Ring of Fire.\nNoront\u00a0is now looking to develop the same chromite deposit Cliffs once owned, plus several other chromite and nickel properties in the area, with the hope of starting construction in 2021, pulling out the first minerals in 2024 and the building of a new smelter in Sault Ste. Marie to process the ore in 2025.\u00a0\n\"If these were just kind of so-so projects you might ask 'Is this really going to happen?'

The question is at what cost.\nMarkets notoriously hate uncertainty, and yesterday they indicated they are more, not less, concerned that Brexit chaos will continue.\nAlthough it recovered some of its losses later in the day, the British pound plunged by one per cent on the announcement that Johnson would ask the\u00a0Queen to prorogue Parliament. The Queen did as her PM\u00a0requested, and the break will\u00a0be\u00a0longer than usual, ending just in advance of Britain's deadline to depart the European Union, with or without a deal.\nPerversely, the large stocks in the London market's high-profile FTSE\u00a0100 index were stronger as a lower pound made their mostly overseas revenue higher in pounds. The FTSE 250, which includes more domestic companies, declined.\nThe hope\u00a0that swift and decisive action would cauterize the suppurating\u00a0wound that is Brexit\u00a0appears forlorn.\n\"The prime minister's decision to suspend Parliament\u00a0\u2026 increases the downside risks to the economy and the pound by decreasing the chances of a further delay to Brexit and increasing the chances of a no-deal Brexit on 31st October,\" wrote\u00a0Paul Dales, chief U.K. economist at Capital Economics.\nLeaving the EU without a deal is a bugaboo even for many who favour Brexit, leading to anxiety about years of trade disruption, the loss of important markets,\u00a0an unresolved Irish border and new rules for British people who want to travel or do business on the continent.\u00a0\nInstead of calming things down,\u00a0the storm of outrage over Johnson's action actually raised the temperature in the hostile divide over whether, or how, Britain would step outside the EU.\nThe PM's statement that shutting down Parliament, the longest in 400 years,\u00a0was not\u00a0Brexit-scheming but\u00a0merely a way to\u00a0introduce a \"very exciting agenda\"\u00a0seems to have been believed by almost no one.\n\"We will help the National Health Service, fight violent crime, invest in infrastructure and science and cut the cost of living,\" wrote Johnson, in a letter to MPs\u00a0justifying his request to the Queen.\nOpposition members and many in the prime minister's own Conservative Party accused him of using the break to bypass Parliament, which a current tally shows would stand\u00a0solidly against a no-deal Brexit\u00a0if it were presented for a vote.\nThe roar of fury against Johnson was eye-watering.\u00a0\nParliamentary Speaker John Bercow called it a \"constitutional outrage,\" but there were plenty of stronger comments.\n\"Following in the steps of other dictators, this is the desperate act of a man who knows Parliament opposes No Deal Brexit but will push it through regardless of parliamentary sovereignty,\" tweeted Naomi Long, Northern Irish member of the European Parliament.\n\"Everyone can see this for what it is, a grubby attempt to force No Deal,\" tweeted former Conservative cabinet minister Justine Greening.\nThere were calls for a new round of street demonstrations and calls,\u00a0by MPs\u00a0no less, for a public occupation of Parliament.\u00a0\nOstensibly, Parliament will still have a chance to block Johnson's move. But by sending MPs home early, the British PM has disrupted cross-party\u00a0plans to pass a law blocking a no-deal Brexit and has limited\u00a0possible strategies to thwart him. Some Brexit watchers say the move may strengthen his hand in negotiations with Europe.\nOne suggestion is that forcing the cross-party alliance against him into a no-confidence vote would frighten off those, especially\u00a0Conservatives,\u00a0worried about what would happen in a resulting election.\nAt the very least the surprising move will put his opponents on the back foot. Apparently, Johnson's top adviser is a student of Sun Tzu's\u00a0The Art of War and according to London's Financial Times, it fits with the master's suggestion to \"confuse and demoralize the enemy with disorienting moves, feints, bluffs.\"\nWith so much at stake for markets, economic commentators\u00a0are weighing in to imagine what could happen next. A\u00a0flow chart from ING Economics shows a worrying\u00a0chain of possible outcomes, but adds the proviso \"list of scenarios is not exhaustive.\"\n\"The U.K. government's decision to suspend Parliament means the Brexit process is likely to go down to the wire,\" says the ING's evaluation of the new Johnson plan.\u00a0\"'No deal' has become more likely, although we still narrowly think a no-confidence vote, which leads to an Article 50 extension and early elections, remains the most probable scenario.\"\nWhatever happens, most British commentators see years of political and economic uncertainty ahead. Some market analysts are suggesting getting out of U.K. investments until Brexit is resolved.\nJohnson's latest move\u00a0has received a vote of confidence from U.S. President Donald Trump, a fan of heavy-handed leaders.\nBut as fear of a global recession grows, Britain finds itself adding to the confusion, no closer to knowing how a prolonged and destabilizing\u00a0period of Brexit chaos may finally end.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Federal Reserve holds key interest rate steady \u2014 but its patience is wearing thin", "description": "U.S. central bank keeps benchmark rate in range between 2.25% and 2.5%", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/federal-reserve-interest-rate-1.5181652", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5161424.1559657489!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/federal-reserve-powell.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 19, 2019 2:20 PM ET", "2019-06-19T19:19:33.280Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The U.S. central bank has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate right where it is, in a range between 2.25 and 2.5 per cent.\nThe Federal Reserve made the announcement Wednesday following a two-day policy meeting.\nEconomists weren't expecting any change, but there was some thought that the bank could move to cut rates as it has faced pressure to do so.\nThe central bank raises its rate when it wants to cool down an overheated economy.

The province's budget, passed in the legislature last July, had predicted a surplus of $1.8 million.\nAs UPEI economics Prof. Jim Sentance explained the situation for P.E.I., it isn't good but could be worse.\n\"Like everybody, we're taking a hit economically because a lot of things are shut down. I think in some ways P.E.I. is maybe a little better off than some provinces,\" he said.\nOne plus Sentance sees for the Island: the preponderance of government jobs, where workers are largely still being paid, even if they're not always able to actually do their work.\nHe said provincial revenues from things like income tax and HST will suffer, but said the province comes into this from a strong fiscal situation, posting recent budget surpluses in the tens of millions and with a favourable debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\"We can run up a fair deficit, and really I don't see any issue with that.

The ultimate severity and duration of the closures and social distancing restrictions are unknown and will depend on evidence of community transmission of the virus.\"\nBased on figures from May 2019, when 80,300 Islanders were employed according to Statistics Canada, the losses the province is considering could represent up to one quarter of all employment on P.E.I.\nWhat's not clear is whether the forecast\u00a0anticipates the potential impact from programs like the federal government's revised wage subsidy program, which will pay 75 per cent of a worker's salary for businesses that qualify, encouraging them to bring laid-off workers back on the payroll.\nOn Thursday, Statistics Canada will release its job numbers for March, providing the first official figures to show how employment in the country has been affected by the pandemic.\nAt a media briefing Tuesday, Premier Dennis King explained, not for the first time, that P.E.I.'s \"three core industries\"\u00a0of agriculture, fishing and tourism, all seasonal industries which would normally be gearing up this time of year, \"have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis.\"\n\"As we've come to know these past few weeks, this is anything but a normal year.\"\nCavendish Farms, the province's biggest private employer, is facing reduced demand for french fries as a result of the pandemic, while there are questions as to whether P.E.I. lobster fishermen will take to the water this spring, and what a depressed market would mean for the value of catches if they do.\nOn Tuesday, King said if the lucrative spring lobster fishery doesn't go ahead, \"we would need a very significant package from the federal government to compensate those who would be, I would have to say would be devastated by not having that ability to fish here, but I don't think that we're there yet.\"\nBanks have begun revising their economic forecasts, and some are predicting the P.E.I. economy will shrink in 2020.\nThat comes after years where P.E.I. had one of the fastest-growing economies in the country, largely buoyed by immigration through the province's provincial nominee program, also put on hold by the pandemic.\n(Source: P.E.I. government)\nThe province says \"the longer social distancing measures are in place, the greater the negative effect will be on the economy.\"\nMeanwhile, cabinet has authorized new borrowing for the province, including a provision allowing up to $900 million in treasury notes to be issued, the first time those have been authorized by the province since 2012.\nThat's a short-term financing measure meant to help the government bridge anticipated shortfalls between revenues and expenditures.\n\"During these uncertain times with government deferring payments and providing many short-term funding programs, the Department of Finance deemed it prudent to raise the limit for short-term borrowings to ensure that there was sufficient cash available,\" a spokesperson from the department\u00a0explained.\nOn March 21, cabinet authorized a further $250 million in borrowing, which government said was to re-finance existing debt coming due this fall at favourable rates, and secure financing for capital projects over the next two construction seasons.\nOn Friday, the province provided a revised estimate for the 2019-20 fiscal year, which closed March 31, projecting an operating deficit of $3.8 million. The province's budget, passed in the legislature last July, had predicted a surplus of $1.8 million.\nAs UPEI economics Prof. Jim Sentance explained the situation for P.E.I., it isn't good but could be worse.\n\"Like everybody, we're taking a hit economically because a lot of things are shut down. I think in some ways P.E.I. is maybe a little better off than some provinces,\" he said.\nOne plus Sentance sees for the Island: the preponderance of government jobs, where workers are largely still being paid, even if they're not always able to actually do their work.\nHe said provincial revenues from things like income tax and HST will suffer, but said the province comes into this from a strong fiscal situation, posting recent budget surpluses in the tens of millions and with a favourable debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\"We can run up a fair deficit, and really I don't see any issue with that. Things will recover in the longer term [if we] behave ourselves.\"\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\nCommon symptoms include:\nBut more serious symptoms can develop, including difficulty breathing and pneumonia, which can lead to death.\nHealth Canada has built a\u00a0self-assessment tool.\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\nIsolate yourself and call 811.

It's a see-saw with an elephant on one end and a mouse on the other.\nIf Kenney had wanted to choose one fight to win and one to lose, he would have swapped them around.\nHe's certainly happy enough the Alberta Court of Appeal's 4-1 decision found the federal government's carbon tax was an intrusion on provincial jurisdiction.\u00a0However, the carbon tax will remain in place as the legal battle continues.\nThat fight is already bound for the Supreme Court because the governments of both Ontario and Saskatchewan, after losing their own legal fights, launched appeals. Based on the fact that senior courts in two provinces have already upheld the federal tax, Canada's highest court could yet disappoint Kenney.\nThe Teck decision, though, is final.\nOn Sunday, company president Don Lindsay issued a letter saying he was cancelling the mega-project that was projected to create 7,000 construction jobs and 2,500 permanent jobs, as well as pour $70 billion worth of taxes into government treasuries over 40 years.\nKenney warned Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a few weeks ago that cancelling the Frontier mine would be disastrous for the Alberta economy. But back then Kenney, and everybody else, was thinking the fate of Teck's project lay with the federal cabinet approving or rejecting the project by the end of February.\nNobody was talking about Teck throwing its own project off a cliff.\nIf this is a disaster for Alberta's economy, it's just as disastrous for Kenney politically.\nAfter campaigning on a promise of jobs, but watching the economy continue to sputter, Kenney\u00a0is desperate to show Albertans some good financial news.\nBut who to blame for Teck's bad news?\nAh, that's become a political football.\nTake a moment to read the carefully worded letter from Teck abruptly cancelling the Frontier oil sands proposal and tell me what you see.\nIt is the Rorschach inkblot test of Alberta politics.\nIf you're Kenney, you see in the wording the insidious spectre of Trudeau deliberately knifing the $20-billion project in the back.\n\"Weeks of federal indecision on the regulatory approval process and inaction in the face of illegal blockades have created more uncertainty for investors looking at Canada,\" Kenney\u00a0said. \"We did our part, but the federal government's inability to convey a clear or unified position let us, and Teck, down.\"\nHowever, if you're Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley, you see the project being beaten to death by the harmful policies of the Kenney government.\n\"The heated rhetoric and constant conflict generated by Jason Kenney and the UCP is the primary reason for withdrawal of Teck's application,\" said Notley. \"That project has been spiked and the premier himself is the one to blame.\"\nIn fact, the letter from Teck president Don Lindsay doesn't overtly blame Trudeau or Kenney. It is written so carefully there is a whiff of a Greek oracle about it. Parse it closely enough and you can make the statement say just about anything.\nBut parse it down to single words and one stands out: \"climate.\"\nLindsay mentions the word eight times, including five times in the term \"climate change,\" as in, \"global capital markets are changing rapidly and investors and customers are increasingly looking for jurisdictions to have a framework in place that reconciles resource development and climate change.\"\nAs Lindsay points out, that framework is not in place. And so we have politicians blaming each other. Conservatives blaming the Liberals for not doing enough to promote resource development and the NDP blaming Conservatives for not doing enough to combat man-made climate change. It is the merry-go-round from hell.\nIt's not about to stop anytime soon.\nOf course, there is a third party to blame: a climate-changed world trying to be less reliant on fossil fuels.\nLindsay said weeks ago that even if the federal government approved the Frontier project, it might not go ahead. Teck needed three conditions to continue: the completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, a higher price for oil and a partner.\nTrans Mountain's twinning is going ahead but the price of oil would have to be about double what it is now. And there was no guarantee Teck could find a partner, especially when we hear stories about nervous investors avoiding oil stocks in general and the oilsands in particular.\nTeck's Frontier project, first envisioned a decade ago, might not have made economic sense a decade from now.\nWhere does that leave us in Alberta?\nWith a premier who is as combative as ever, predictably blaming Ottawa for Alberta's troubles, and warning of a rise in western alienation even as he stokes the fires himself.\nBut a new twist on Monday: Asked if the Alberta government would consider buying Teck's Frontier lease in the oilsands, Kenney responded, \"We're ruling nothing out.\"\nReally? The hands off, free-enterprise United Conservative government investing directly into the oilsands?\nIf nothing else, this reveals the depth of Kenney's desperation to show he can create jobs and kick-start the economy.\nHe may have won a legal battle Monday but he lost the war over Teck.\nAnd Kenney will find new wars to fight starting Tuesday when the spring sitting of the Alberta legislature opens with a throne speech and moves quickly into what promises to be a controversial provincial budget on Thursday.\nThis column is an opinion.

We'll publish a selection of answers every weekday online\u00a0and also put some questions to the experts during\u00a0The National\u00a0and on CBC News Network. So far, we've received more than 37,000 emails from all corners of the country.\u00a0\nDogs have long been used to help detect diseases,\u00a0like cancer and Parkinson's disease,\u00a0through scent. Richard A. wonders if they can be trained to detect COVID-19.\nThere's no definitive answer, but university researchers are studying whether it's possible.\nThe veterinary school at the University of Pennsylvania is trying to train\u00a0dogs to sniff out COVID-19 by detecting low concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), found in human saliva, blood, urine and on breath.\u00a0\n\"The potential impact of these dogs and their capacity to detect COVID-19 could be substantial,\" said Dr. Cynthia Otto, director of Penn Vet Working Dog Center\u00a0in a news release.\n\"This study will harness the dog's extraordinary ability to support the nation's COVID-19 surveillance systems, with the goal of reducing community spread.\"\nIt's hoped the dogs will help quickly test large groups of people \u2014 including asymptomatic carriers of the virus, and especially in environments like office buildings and hospitals.\u00a0\nThe centre says the dogs could be ready for preliminary screening of humans as early as July.\u00a0\nNo such study has been announced in Canada.\u00a0But Glenn Ferguson, director of Cancer Dogs \u2014 an organization that uses canines to detect cancer \u2014 says past successes show how helpful this could be to curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\"One of the key things about training dogs to detect [COVID-19] is how quickly you can deploy them,\" Ferguson said. \"Dogs may be the easiest and quickest way to get some level of classification happening.\"\nFerguson says he thinks dogs could be trained to detect the VOCs for COVID-19 in the same way he trains dogs to detect cancer, and that the training could be done quickly.\u00a0\n\"I'm talking about training dogs to do this in a week,\" he said. \"You could train dozens of dogs a day at the same place.\"\n\"I think, yes, it should be done, even if it's just from an experimental point of view and you don't use the dogs. This won't be the last and only outbreak.\"\nThe research is still in its early stages, and more work is needed to determine whether dogs can accurately detect COVID-19.\u00a0\nMeat-packing plants have been at the centre of some of Canada's largest COVID-19 outbreaks, killing and sickening\u00a0employees and forcing some sites to close.\u00a0David E. asks, is\u00a0our meat supply chain at risk?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe problem isn't having enough meat, but rather, having enough staff to process it.\n\"There's plenty of stock for everyone,\" said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University with expertise in food distribution, security and safety.\n\"The biggest problem, as far as I'm concerned, are the backlogs,\" caused by the closures, he said.\u00a0\nLast week, the president of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, Bob Lowe, told a Commons committee he estimates \"between 6,000 and 9,000 head of cattle of day\" are being backed up in Canada's beef supply.\u00a0\nBut those disruptions have had little or no effect on price, says\u00a0Charlebois.\nMeat prices started going up in January and have now stabilized, he says.\u00a0\"We're not expecting prices to go higher until the fall.\"\u00a0\nDemand is also down because people aren't going out as much.\u00a0\n\"We've been at home since March. That's putting a lot less pressure on the market,\" he said.\u00a0\nIn addition,\u00a0McDonald's Canada said it will import its beef from the U.S. to help alleviate pressure on the Canadian supply.\nMany of you have also asked if you should be concerned about the virus living on meat. You can read more about it here.\nBecause some COVID-19 symptoms are similar to those of seasonal allergies, Beatrice asks if allergy sufferers should stay home from work, rather than risk catching the coronavirus and not realize\u00a0it?\u00a0\n\"You should be OK,\" according to Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease physician at University of Alberta, provided you have \"the classic [allergy] symptoms\" like itchy eyes.\u00a0\n\"Seasonal allergies are often accompanied by a lot of itching.\"\u00a0\nBut take note, said Saxinger, whether those symptoms respond to antihistamine medication. If they don't, they might be a sign of something more serious.\nIf there's any doubt, an \"excess of caution, right now, is reasonable,\" she said.\nIf your symptoms start to transition to those of COVID-19 \u2014 a dry cough, for example \u2014\u00a0\"it's not a bad idea to pay attention to who you've been around and where you've been, to help with contact tracing,\" she said.\u00a0\nInfectious disease specialist, Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, who suffers from seasonal allergies himself, agrees that if you start developing symptoms that are different from those you're used to, you should stay home from work and go to a COVID-19 assessment centre to get tested.\u00a0\nWe're also answering your questions every night on The National.

For Barack Obama, a global economic panic was melting down the financial system even before his first week in office.\nDonald Trump's defining crisis arrived in the 163rd week of his presidency. When it hit, it hit hard.\nIn a falsehood-filled prime-time television address\u00a0earlier this week, Trump confused Americans, annoyed allies, and failed to calm financial markets. While he was still talking, they started flopping.\nStocks kept sinking overnight\u00a0and into the next day\u00a0in their worst one-day collapse since 1987.\nBack then, Tom Hanks was a budding young film actor.

Not even Trump's Amen corner was singing his praises. The morning\u00a0after his initial address, his former campaign manager called it Black Thursday.\u00a0\nSteve Bannon said capital markets were making clear the president needs a better co-ordinated response with other G7 allies to handle the health crisis.\u00a0\n\"There was a lot of confusion,\" Bannon said in his podcast, reacting to the speech.\n\"We've had basically, essentially, a meltdown from global financial markets immediately at the end of the speech.\"\nFuture generations will judge what the president does next, he said: \"This is going to be the most significant thing\u00a0not just of his administration\u00a0[but] of modern American \u2026 history.\"\nTrump indeed ratcheted up his response later in the week.\nThe markets bounced back Friday\u00a0after\u00a0Trump declared a national emergency and promised a slew of other health and economic measures \u2014 from drive-thru testing facilities\u00a0to financial assistance for people\u00a0to help\u00a0for the beleaguered oil sector.\nBut even at that news conference\u00a0Trump rejected the idea that he botched the early response to the crisis, though he'd downplayed it for weeks before it suddenly became\u00a0a national emergency.\n\"No, I don't take responsibility at all,\" Trump\u00a0said Friday\u00a0when asked about snags in delivering screening tests.\nTrump was getting blasted at home and abroad.\nBeing a great leader has many attributes.

Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Thursday that Canada also got no\u00a0warning.\nIn his own defence, Trump said he had to move quickly, as Europe was still allowing travel from China. (Note to Canadians: that's also true of\u00a0Canada.)\nWATCH: EU slams Trump's coronavirus travel restrictions\nTrump then skipped to another gripe he's got with the Europeans: They don't play fair on trade. \"I mean, when\u00a0they raise taxes on us they don't consult us.\"\nWhat triggered additional consternation from critics and allies alike\u00a0was the barrage of blatant falsehoods in an address that was supposed to offer clarity about America's game plan.\nTrump got fundamental details wrong, sending the White House cleanup crew scrambling to mop up the mess of misconceptions created in the Oval Office.\nIn a formal address to the country, in prime time Wednesday, read from a Teleprompter, Trump:\n\"No, it was pretty casual,\" said Zaid Shoorbajee, who was arriving Thursday at Washington's Dulles Airport from Saudi Arabia, after his planned trip to Egypt got cancelled.\n\"I saw a couple of signs \u2014 messages on the screen saying, 'If you feel sick, self-quarantine for two weeks.' But nobody asked us personally.\"\nOther travellers tweeted similar observations. Andreas Grobeli, who arrived last Saturday from Switzerland and was headed home early, told CBC\u00a0News he didn't notice any screening.\nWATCH: Trump TV address on COVID-19\nThat's after the biggest, most enduring falsehood of them all: Trump's repeated insistence in recent weeks that coronavirus was no big deal and would soon be over.\nThat no-worry attitude had an effect, with friendly media allies spending weeks dismissing the panic as a Democratic-orchestrated hoax to hurt the president.\u00a0\nOne example of the genre, a few days ago, was a Breitbart\u00a0tweet above an article: \"LOL. Cancel Trump rallies? Dream on!\" According to opinion polls, Republican voters are now far likelier to shrug off the whole crisis.\nThen there was the less-discussed matter of how Trump arrived at his choice of countries targeted for travel bans.\u00a0\nWhen asked why the ban didn't apply to the United Kingdom, Trump replied that it's doing \"a very good job,\" with few cases of coronavirus. But the U.K. has more cases than Belgium, Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Iceland, Finland, Portugal, Slovenia, Armenia, Poland, Slovakia\u00a0and a few other eurozone nations subjected to the ban.\nThe Politico news site noted Trump's travel order happened to miss European countries where he owns golf courses.\u00a0\nFor weeks, critics have also been sounding the alarm that Trump eliminated the government's entire pandemic response chain of command.\u00a0\nWill this succession of blunders sink Trump's presidency?\nAfter all, this is a president whose approval ratings are a bit like a goldfish moving around a bowl \u2014 always wiggling, never moving too far.\nHis daily polling averages entered the crisis having dipped, within that narrow band, to a lower level than in previous weeks.\nOne survey showed presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden with his largest lead over Trump in a while.\u00a0\nMost Americans, however, long ago made up their mind about Trump.\u00a0\nNot even economic shocks move votes like they used to in this polarized environment, where opinions are deeply entrenched, said Robert Griffin, who researches American public opinion at the Democracy Fund's Voter Study Group.\n\"My own take is it's still going to affect [Trump] \u2014 but less than we might think,\" Griffin\u00a0said.\nSo a White House that three months ago survived an impeachment, and two months ago avoided war with Iran, and one month ago went to war with its own Justice Department, still has nearly eight whole months to ride out this crisis.\nAlready, more Americans have started getting coronavirus tests.\u00a0\nWhile the process has been notoriously slow and problem-plagued in the U.S., tests are ramping up at state-run labs.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has promised to buy $1.5 trillion US in assets, and there's talk of a possible bipartisan deal in Congress for an emergency legislative package.\nEven Trump's\u00a0family has promised help.\u00a0\nPresidential daughter\u00a0and presidential staffer Ivanka Trump said Thursday the administration is working with states to get sick-leave benefits for people with the virus.\u00a0\nTrump's likely general-election adversary, meanwhile, rolled out his own proposals Thursday for dealing with the crisis.\nIn a speech, Biden listed measures he said should be taken, including the most basic one: keeping citizens informed about a pandemic.\n\"Let me be crystal clear:\u00a0The coronavirus does not have a political affiliation. It will infect Republicans, Independents and Democrats alike,\" Biden said.\n"}, {"author": "Alex Soloducha", "title": "How Sask. businesses are 'navigating the unknown' and adapting to stay afloat during COVID-19", "description": "From food and drink to working out, nearly everything has changed because of the pandemic", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-businesses-adapt-covid-19-1.5538710", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5538813.1587412812!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/glenn-valgardson.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 20, 2020 3:22 PM CT", "2020-04-21T18:30:57.320Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Saskatchewan has started talking about how to get some industries back in business, but many have had to adapt to continue operating in the age of COVID-19.\u00a0\nSome Regina businesses have taken a creative approach to safely reach customers and stay afloat.\nTim Schultz runs Local and Fresh and Local Market, which includes a hyper-local grocery store, eatery and event centre.\nHe stocks baked goods, meats\u00a0and produce from greenhouses year round along with\u00a0prepared foods like frozen pizzas from Ogema and homemade perogies.\u00a0\nYou can no longer browse around, but you can go in and ask for items or get your grocery order delivered.

They've done chemistry and psychology and statistics on it. They've used algorithms and microscopes. They've masturbated in MRI machines. And they've got a lot to say.\u00a0\nFor Valentine's day this year, we've drawn up a list of some of the best books in the science of love and sex. \"Science\" is not a singular voice. There are contributions from mathematicians, psychologists, and anthropologists (among others). Some authors are interested primarily in empirical puzzles. Some are interested in applying the science to help people enjoy better sex and romantic lives. But all of them share the conviction that clear analysis and lots of data are the best tools to learn about love.\nDataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One's Looking) by Christian Rudder\nYour dating apps have been watching you. And they've learned a lot of things that might surprise you. For example: you'll do better at dating if some people think you're unattractive, and men are much more open-minded about women's appearance than the other way around.\nChristian Rudder is a co-founder of the popular dating site OKCupid and leader of its analytics team. Dataclysm digs into data sets from other dating sites as well as giants like Facebook and Google and comes out with some sparkling insights. What makes this approach so interesting is that while survey research reveals how people describe themselves to researchers, our online behaviours reveal what we do when we (naively) think no one's looking.\u00a0\u00a0\nSex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What It Means for Modern Relationships by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jeth\u00e0\nChristopher Ryan and Cacilda Jeth\u00e0 think that the science of sex is dominated by a false \"traditional narrative\": Men desire sexual promiscuity. Women want security and resources to protect the children they're presumed to have. Monogamy is the uncomfortable compromise between these two reproductive strategies.\u00a0\nSex at Dawn draws on findings in anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychology to argue that our natural state is closer to communal free-love than to monogamy.\nThe book is deeply controversial and its claims have been critiqued by scientists and non-scientists alike. That said, it's an eye-opening read for many and does a good job of showing that the monogamous reproductive pair-bond may not be as natural as many people think.\nBonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex by Mary Roach\nIf you want to laugh out loud learning about sex science, read Bonk. Mary Roach is one of the most entertaining science writers in the business, and this follow-up to her hit Stiff is one of her best.\u00a0\nMany of the books on this list have a feeling of scientific detachment, presenting the data but never gossiping about individuals. Roach reads very differently. She delves into the careers and personalities of sex researchers as well as the results of their studies. The result is a book that will teach you about the findings of modern sex science, but also entertain you with a cast of lab-coated eccentrics, improbable experiments, and bizarre facts. You'll read about the best research on: whether dead men can achieve an erection; why Viagra doesn't work on women or pandas; and the long history of medical masturbation.\u00a0\nCome as You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life by Emily Nagoski\nEmily Nagoski has made it her life's mission to teach women to live with confidence and joy inside their bodies.\u00a0\n\"Come as You Are\" is both the title of Nagoski's evidence-based sexual self-help guide, and its mission statement. Nagoski wants her readers to know that women's bodies and sexualities are hugely variable and nearly all of the variations should be called \"normal.\" Therefore, they should worry less about trying to live up to whatever standards have found their way into their brains, and more about enjoying their unique sexuality.\nHow surprising you'll find the science depends on what you already believe. Some women may already suspect that \"stress, mood, trust, and body image are not peripheral factors in a woman's sexual wellbeing; they are central to it.\" Nonetheless, Nagoski does a great job of providing scientific legitimacy for these claims.\nThe Mathematics of Love: Patterns, Proofs, and the Search for the Ultimate Equation by Hannah Fry\nHannah Fry is clearly in love with math. \"Mathematics is the language of nature,\" she writes, \"It is the foundation stone upon which every major scientific and technological achievement of the modern era has been built. It is alive, and it is thriving.\" And this makes her the perfect person to write a book about the math of love.\u00a0\nLove may seem unique and unpredictable, but it follows patterns. And math is the study of patterns. If math can tell us something about the weather and the behaviour of stock markets, Fry reckons it can tell us something about love. Specifically, it can tell us: how many people to reject before settling down to max-out our chances of finding \"the one\" (chapter 7); how to maximize a night on the town (chapter 3); and how to live happily ever after (chapter 9). With clear and accessible writing and juicy subject matter, Fry makes math even sexier than usual.\u00a0\nThe All or Nothing Marriage by Eli Finkel\nEli Finkel is a social psychology professor who's published over 150 scientific papers. His first book, The All-or-Nothing Marriage, argues that even though people hold marriage to higher expectations than ever, today's best marriages are better than at any time in history.\nFinkel's grand thesis is that, since the 1960's, the emphasis of marriage has shifted from love and companionship to self-expression and personal growth. Before, people's main expectation of their spouses was that they would love and cherish them. Today, we look for partners in a voyage of self-realization and personal growth.\nThe book mixes scientific research with practical advice, including both overall strategies for achieving a \"summit marriage\" as well as \"love hacks,\" which are low-effort tactics that can yield major results.\nAnatomy of Love by Helen Fisher\nHelen Fisher is a biological anthropologist, chief scientific advisor to Match.com, and the woman who explained what \"stashing\" is to us. Originally published in 1992,\u00a0Anatomy of Love delved into our evolutionary history to show that humans are \"built for love.\" In 2016, Fisher released this revised second edition, updated with reams of new research into brain science and online dating.\u00a0\nThe result is a scientifically-informed but sensitive view of human love. Fisher explains how we fall in love and out of love; how we form attachments; and how different historical and economic conditions contribute to changing relationships. She follows our love lives from its origins in Africa 20 million years ago, through the monogamy-promoting development of agriculture; to today's world of online dating where\u00a0she sees young people moving into a new world of \"slow love.\"\nThe book is both an update of a classic and the result of a lifetime of research into the science of love.\nSex by Numbers: What statistics can tell us about Sexual Behaviour by David Spiegelhalter\u00a0\nSir David Spiegelhalter,\u00a0superstar statistician, brings snappy writing and statistical mastery to bear on the data gathered for the Natsal Survey 2010, the largest sexual behaviour survey since the Kinsey Report.\nSex by Numbers will teach you as much about statistics as it will about sex (which is a lot). He provides the numbers, but instead of sensationalizing them, he rates their reliability and is careful to explain the limitations of the studies upon which they're based. This both helps to debunk oft-repeated statistics (\"men think about sex every seven seconds,\" for example) as well as to make his own conclusions more reliable.\nFor a taste of the insights and infographics available in Spiegelhalter's book, check out this summary at the Wellcome Collection.\n\u00a0Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller\nAttachment theory is a psychological theory originally developed to explain the distress experienced by infants separated from their parents. In Attached, Amir Levine and Rachel Heller applied this theory to adult relationships, and popularized a new way of thinking about relationships.\u00a0\nAccording to Levine and Heller there are three main attachment styles: anxious (insecure and need a lot of assurance); avoidant (have trouble forming close attachments); and secure (can be attached while maintaining individuality).\u00a0Attached explains the characteristics of these different types; which types match well and poorly with each other; and how to improve your relationships no matter what your and your partner's attachment style.\nClifton Mark writes about philosophy, psychology, politics, and other life-related topics.

In retaliation for the tariffs the White House placed on imported steel and aluminum, the European Union increased import duties on U.S.-manufactured Harley bikes to 31 per cent\u00a0from 6 per cent\u00a0last June.\nSimilarly, China's tariffs on the bikes exported from the U.S. have increased to 55 per cent from 30 per cent\u00a0as a result of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies.\nThe incremental tariffs cost the company $34.4 million US in the June quarter, contributing to a 12.5 per cent\u00a0plunge in retail sales in Europe.\nOverall, worldwide sales in the quarter were down 8.4 per cent\u00a0from a year ago. However, in a sliver lining for the American company, sales in emerging market were up 7.6 per cent\u00a0year on year.\nTo mitigate the EU tariffs, Harley said it got the approval from the trading bloc to ship bikes from its Thailand facility.\nIn the latest quarter, Harley's profits declined to $1.23 per share from $1.45 per share a year ago.

It invested in We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January, yet stock market investor skepticism led to the start-up considering a potential valuation in the IPO earlier this month of as low as $10 billion, Reuters reported.\nWhat was the venture capital world's biggest upset is now morphing into one of corporate America's most high-profile boardroom dramas.\nSome We Company board directors are deliberating how to replace Neumann as CEO, the sources said. The exact number of directors opposed to Neumann is not clear. Venture capital firm Benchmark Capital, another big investor in We Company, would also like Neumann to step aside, one of the sources said.\nBenchmark, SoftBank and Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital each have one representative on We Company's seven-member board, that includes Neumann. Hony Capital's position on whether Neumann should remain CEO could not immediately be learned.\nA formally unaffiliated We Company board director, retired Goldman Sachs Group Inc investment banker Mark Schwartz, previously sat on SoftBank's board.\nNo challenge to Neumann has yet been tabled, the sources said. A We Company board meeting will be held this week, and the issue of his leadership could be raised then, the sources added.\nOne option that SoftBank is considering is asking Neumann to become interim CEO while a headhunting firm is hired to find an external replacement, the first source said.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. We Company and SoftBank declined to comment, while Neumann, Schwartz, Benchmark Capital and Hony Capital could not be immediately reached for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on SoftBank exploring ways to replace Neumann as CEO.\nAs co-founder of the We Company, Neumann holds special voting shares that enable him to dismiss dissident board directors and shoot down any challenge to his authority. However, SoftBank could choose not to back We Company's IPO or provide it with more funding. It has already funded the cash-burning start-up to the tune of $10 billion US, and was discussing committing another $1 billion US to the IPO.\nWe Company said last week it is aiming to become a publicly traded company by the end of the year.\nIn a sign of souring relations between SoftBank and WeWork, Neumann did not participate in a gathering of executives of companies backed by SoftBank that took place in Pasadena, California, last week and was organized by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nWere a board challenge against Neumann to prove successful, it could follow the template of Uber Technologies Inc.\nUber co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO of the ride-hailing start-up in 2017 after facing a rebellion from his board over a string of scandals, including allegations of enabling a chauvinistic and toxic work culture. Uber replaced Kalanick with an outsider, former Expedia Group Inc CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and completed its IPO last May.\nIt is not uncommon for founders of fast-growing start-ups to be eccentric and control their companies tightly, even as they seek to attract stock market investors. Neumann, however, was criticized by investors and corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.\nThese included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donates to charitable causes.\nNeumann also entered into several transactions with We Company over the years, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent. He has also secured a $500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.\nFollowing criticism by potential investors, Neumann agreed to some concessions without relinquishing majority control. He agreed to give We Company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has entered in to with the New York-based start-up.\nNo member of Neumann's family will be on the company's board and any successor will be selected by the board, scrapping a plan for his wife and co-founder, Rebekah Neumann, to help pick the successor.\nThese changes did little to address concerns about We Company's business model, which rents out workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent for them itself under long-term leases. This mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue raised questions among investors about how the company would weather an economic downturn.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Get informed on the top stories of the day in one quick scan", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/morning-brief-march-30-2020-1.5512053", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 30, 2020 6:44 AM ET", "2020-03-30T10:44:10.520Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Good morning!

Although the Zaandam was allowed\u00a0to pass through the Panama Canal, passengers still don't know for certain where the cruise ship will dock, and when they'll be able to return home.\u00a0  That's because while the ship has plans to dock and let passengers disembark in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., county officials in the region are concerned about letting in a coronavirus-hit ship.  \"They're not wanting us there, so where are we going to go?\" said passenger Cheryle Stothard of Toronto.\u00a0She and her husband have been confined to their cabin for the past week\u00a0because of the illness outbreak.\u00a0\"Going through the Panama Canal is useless if we can't get off in Florida,\" said the 71-year-old.  Michael Udine, the commissioner of Broward County, which includes Fort Lauderdale, \u00a0told CBC News that the county is already overrun with COVID-19 cases\u00a0\u2014 more than 1,000 to date \u00a0\u2014 so he's apprehensive about letting in a ship that will add to its problems. \"We're a hot spot here. Our medical facilities are taxed,\" said Udine.  The Zaandam began its cruise on March 7 and had initially planned to dock on March 16 in Punta Arenas, Chile, to let passengers off early. However, the country refused to allow passengers to disembark, so the ship set course for Fort Lauderdale.\u00a0Read more about the cruise ship here..\n(Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images)\nPolice inspector Rajesh Babu, centre, wears a coronavirus-themed helmet as he speaks to motorists at a checkpoint on March 28 in Chennai, India during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown as a preventive measure against the spread of the novel coronavirus.\nThere's no scientific evidence that chiropractic care can boost your immune system, but that hasn't stopped some chiropractors from touting the practice\u00a0as a tool to prevent infection from the novel coronavirus. The problem is so widespread that one Ontario man has filed at least 34 complaints against chiropractic clinics in the province alone in the past few weeks. Across the country, provincial governing bodies have issued warnings to their members not to spread misinformation about chiropractic care and COVID-19. The Canadian Chiropractic Association has also warned members about making unsubstantiated claims.\u00a0Read more about\u00a0the claims being put forward by some chiropractors.  Some viable organs have not been recovered from deceased donors in Ontario due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\u00a0as hospitals in the province temporarily scale back procedures that aren't deemed essential, according to a leading transplant specialist in Toronto. Hospitals across the province have hit pause on many transplant procedures, involving both live and deceased donors, unless the recipient patient's life is considered to be at risk. Organs from a deceased donor need to be transplanted quickly after death, but since some transplant procedures are now on hold, viable organs are not being \"procured\" from deceased donors' bodies.\u00a0Read more about the reduction in organ transplants..  While it may be easier than most for farmers to self-isolate in their tractors and farmyards, they too are unable to hide from the widespread impacts of the coronavirus. Just as stock markets have plunged, so have prices for many farm products. Wheat prices, for instance, fell by about 15 per cent in early March, but have started bouncing back in the last two weeks. Wheat, canola and corn prices have been especially volatile. The unpredictability comes at a time when most farmers are choosing what to plant, since spring seeding begins in about a month.\u00a0Read more on how the coronavirus outbreak is affecting farmers.

Now for some good news to start your Monday:\u00a0A longtime family restaurant in Toronto is trying to help people who've lost their jobs during the COVID-19 outbreak by giving out free meals to anyone in need \u2014 no questions asked. Like many restaurants, Little India is facing a major financial loss after stopping dine-in service to slow the pandemic's spread. But when former customers started asking if they could eat now and pay later, the owners knew they had to pay it forward. \"We existed in this community for more than 20 years. This community gave us everything,\" said general manager Sri Selvarasa, who runs the restaurant with his three brothers.\u00a0\"Whatever we are today, it's because of this community. And now it's time.\"\u00a0Read more about why the restaurant is giving out free meals.\nGovernments around the world are making extraordinary moves to get COVID-19 under control \u2014 including the curtailing of individual freedoms. In most countries, people are willing to go along with these measures, as long as they're temporary. But what about when leaders use the coronavirus to grab more power?

It's not really in our mandate, it's not something that we do, but it kept coming up,\"\u00a0said Andy Daggett, chair of the club's small donations committee.\u00a0\n\"So it was something we had to ask the question, like why is this such an issue\u00a0and \u2026 is there anything we can do to help?\"\u00a0\nAccording to statistics from the Canadian Real Estate Association, the median home price in eastern P.E.I. has nearly doubled in the last decade\u00a0\u2014 from $79,516 in 2009\u00a0to $151,000\u00a0in 2019.\u00a0\nThe survey was conducted for the club by MRSB Consulting in May and June of this year. It was available to people in eastern P.E.I. at 13 retail locations and online and received 529 valid responses, according to the company. Respondents were not required to answer every question, meaning the respondent numbers vary from question to question.\u00a0\nThe boundaries of the study encompassed most areas east of the Hillsborough Bridge\u00a0that links Charlottetown with eastern P.E.I.\nThe survey asked a range of questions\u00a0related to household makeup, income and finances\u00a0and people's satisfaction with their current housing.\u00a0\nWhile most homes in eastern P.E.I. have three or\u00a0more bedrooms, the survey found that more than half of households have one or two occupants.\u00a0\nAnd while most residents own their own home\u00a0rather than renting, not everyone is able to find suitable housing. The survey found 27 per cent of people have had to couch surf at some point. Thirty per cent of those under age 35 live with family or are currently couch surfing.\u00a0\nMeanwhile 40 per cent of respondents said it is difficult to meet their financial needs.\u00a0\nThe report also looks at\u00a0barriers\u00a0to increasing\u00a0the housing supply \u2014 and what solutions might exist.\u00a0\nCanada's 2016 census indicates a 2.2 per cent population growth in eastern P.E.I. over 2011. Meanwhile, numbers from\u00a0the Canadian Real Estate Association indicate that the number of new real estate listings has been declining.\u00a0\nThe MRSB study looked at Airbnb listings\u00a0and found 581 entire homes for rent in eastern P.E.I. in July 2019.\u00a0\nThe report concludes that the inventory of affordable housing needs to be increased, but that developers face barriers \u2014\u00a0including many people not able to pay market rates\u00a0and a lack of availability of financing from banks and government.\u00a0\n\"It's harder to do smaller units in the rural areas, and that seems to be certainly adding to the issue.

An opening that has already been delayed a month because they are missing one key ingredient.\nHemant Bhagwani: I can't find the staff. It's been a tough ride. We've advertised on Job Bank, Indeed, I mean a lot of these places and no resumes.  Aaron Saltzman: Not one single applicant, and this is not an extreme example.  David Lefebvre / Restaurants Canada: There used to be in labour shortages, now there's some places in the country we call them 'labour outages.'  Aaron Saltzman: In Canada, the number of job vacancies in restaurants and bars is the highest it's been in nearly five years. The overall job market is tight, so that the problem starts there, but the restaurant business is also facing some specific challenges. Young people, traditionally the core of the food-service industry, are finding jobs in other sectors.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the food industry itself is exploding, with incoming international restaurant chains, high-end hotels, grocery stores with food counters, even ghost kitchens, all competing for staff.\u00a0 And food delivery service is also driving up demand. Here at the country's largest culinary program, George Brown College, for every student, there are six paid field placements available.  (Speaking to Tony Garcia): It's a good time to be in this program, isn't it?  Tony Garcia / George Brown College:\u00a0 It is a great time to be in this program because there's definitely work out there.  Aaron Saltzman: But even with so many options, some are still looking elsewhere.  A student of George Brown College:\u00a0 I will go to Europe to work in there at a Michelin Star restaurant.  Aaron Saltzman: Others say the labour shortage is partly the industry's own making.  Student of George Brown College: I feel like the workers are out there. They are there. It's mainly just holding onto them. You know working conditions for restaurants, fair pay, stuff like that.\u00a0 I feel like it really deters people from staying at locations.  Aaron Saltzman: In fact, competition for staff is forcing employers to offer higher wages, shorter hours, more flexible schedules -- unheard of in an industry known for cheap labour and demanding work environments.  Tony Garcia:\u00a0 It hasn't completely changed, but that shortage has created that kind of change.  Hemant Bhagwani: The bar has been put in at a different way here, right?\nAaron Saltzman: Hemant Bhagwani has offered ownership shares, profit sharing.

But more work will have to be done on key differences in later negotiations, including U.S. allegations that China forces foreign countries to hand over trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market.\nThe U.S. and Chinese negotiators have so far reached their tentative agreement only in principle. No documents have been signed.\nPresident Donald Trump announced the trade truce in a White House meeting with the top Chinese negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He. The news followed two days of talks in Washington.\n\"You're very tough negotiators,\" Trump said to the Chinese delegation.\nTrump has yet to drop plans to impose tariffs Dec. 15 on an additional $160 billion in Chinese products, a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the United States. The December tariffs would cover a wide range of consumer goods, including clothes, toys and smartphones and would likely be felt by American shoppers.\nWhile providing scant details of just what was agreed to Friday, the White House said Beijing has pledged to be more transparent about how it sets the value of its currency, the yuan. The Trump administration has accused China of manipulating the yuan lower to give its exporter a price advantage in foreign markets.\nChina has agreed to open its markets to U.S. banks and other financial services providers, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.\nEarlier Friday, China announced a timetable for carrying out a promise to allow full foreign ownership of some finance businesses, starting with futures traders on Jan. 1, as Beijing tries to make its slowing economy more competitive and efficient.\nOwnership limits will be ended for mutual fund companies on April 1 and for securities firm on Dec. 1, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said. Until now, foreign investors have been limited to owning 51 per cent\u00a0of such businesses.\nFor now, the two sides have come to \"almost a complete agreement\" on both financial services and currency issues, Mnuchin said.\nThe trade war has inflicted an economic toll on both countries. U.S. manufacturers have been hurt by rising costs from the tariffs and by uncertainty over when and how the trade hostilities may end.\n\"They're trying to de-escalate,\" said Timothy Keeler, a former chief of staff at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives. \"I think it serves both sides' interests because both sides were feeling pain.\"\nStock prices had been up substantially all day, mainly in anticipation of a significant trade agreement. But once the White House announced the contours of the tentative accord, the market shed some of its gains. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had risen more than 500 points at its high, closed up 319.\nThe U.S. and Chinese negotiators did not deal this week with a dispute over the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Huawei, saying it poses a threat to U.S. national security because its equipment can be used for espionage. Trump has said he was willing to use Huawei as a bargaining chip in the trade talks.\nThe United States still has in place tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports and is set to hit an additional $160 billion in December. What changed Friday was that Trump suspended plans to raise the existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products from 25 per cent\u00a0to 30 per cent\u00a0next week.\n\"This is an encouraging first phase,\" said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. \"We await word on how implementation will be measured and in what timeframe, as well as details on scheduling subsequent phases\"\nAmong the skeptics of Friday's agreement is Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute, who suggested that the deal amounted to merely a temporary pause in the conflict.\n\"The president is acting as if a lot of Chinese concessions have been nailed down, and they just haven't,\" Scissors said.\nThe two countries were close to a more comprehensive deal in early May. But talks stalled after the U.S. accused China of reneging on earlier commitments. Trump acknowledged that Friday's deal has yet to be put down on paper but said that wouldn't be a problem.\n\"China wants it badly, and we want it also,\" Trump said. \"We should be able to get that done over the next four weeks.\"\nGregory Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics, said the partial nature of the deal won't relieve much of the uncertainty surrounding trade policy that has discouraged many American companies from investing in new equipment and expanding.\n\"For businesses this will mean less damage, not greater certainty,\" Daco said in a research note.\nDaco has estimated that the trade fight will cut U.S. growth by about 0.6 percentage point in 2020. Friday's pact might reduce that slightly to 0.5 percentage point, he said. \"While market reacted positively to the news, we caution that beyond the promises and niceties, the deal doesn't address key underlying issues,\" Daco wrote.\nThe two countries are deadlocked primarily over the Trump administration's assertions that China deploys predatory tactics \u2014 including outright theft \u2014 in a sharp-elbowed drive to become the global leader in robotics, self-driving cars and other advanced technology.\nBeijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy the administration. Doing so would likely require scaling back China's aspirations for technological supremacy, which it sees as crucial to its prosperity.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "U.S. corporate leaders swing left to fix 'frayed' American dream: Don Pittis", "description": "But critics call 11th-hour conversion a smokescreen to block new rules and taxes", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/business-roundtable-environment-workers-1.5251909", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5252187.1566236048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-stocks.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 20, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-08-20T14:24:04.268Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In what's\u00a0being described as a radical departure from their single-minded focus on pushing short-term share prices ever higher, a powerful group of U.S. business leaders say they are expanding their remit to include \"generating good jobs, a strong and sustainable economy, innovation, a healthy environment and economic opportunity for all.\"\nTraditional liberal\u00a0thinkers may say that's what free markets are supposed to do anyway.\u00a0\nBut the fact that nearly 200 members of the Business Roundtable \u2014 a group which includes star CEOs\u00a0like Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon\u00a0and Mary Barra of General Motors \u2014 signed the new \"Statement of Purpose of a Corporation\" may show they think the existing capitalist model is flawed.\nThat would be no surprise to social activists and politicians on the left. From leaders of the biggest companies in the U.S., it comes as\u00a0an epiphany.\nThe new\u00a0statement is merely a change in wording and\u00a0by no means binding,\u00a0but the world's business news organizations seemed flabbergasted by Monday's\u00a0announcement.\nThe powerful group, whose history goes back to 1972, has previously fought anti-trust legislation, fought to weaken labour laws, backed favourable tax cuts and successfully lobbied to dilute restrictions on executive compensation.\nThe language of its mission statement has been tweaked over the years.\nBut every version, since 1997, \"has endorsed principles of shareholder primacy \u2014\u00a0that corporations exist principally to serve shareholders,\" the group said in a statement.\nThe new one \"supersedes previous statements and outlines a modern standard for corporate responsibility,\" the group said.\u00a0\nThe new statement \u2014 especially the parts about good jobs and economic opportunity \u2014\u00a0seems to reflect the same kind of disenchantment that swept U.S. President Donald Trump to power. Even though interest rate cuts and lower taxes have sent stock prices\u00a0higher under Trump, there are still plenty of complaints that shareholder wealth is not trickling down to ordinary people and to the broader economy.\nIt suggests\u00a0even\u00a0those secure in their personal wealth and position realize that a failure\u00a0to share the wealth is having an impact on the wider state of the U.S. economy;\u00a0that corporate leaders have finally realized that the long-term success of business depends on the long-term success of society and that, in many ways, that society is in trouble.\n\"The American dream is alive, but fraying,\" said Dimon in a statement. \"These modernized principles reflect the business community's unwavering commitment to continue to push for an economy that serves all Americans.\"\nIn the past, some business thinkers worried that a growing economic divide would mean large portions of society won't be able to afford the products corporations produce, a reversal of the idea that Henry Ford made his Model T cars cheap enough for his own workers to buy them.\n\"What that gave us was an industrial middle class, and an economy that was driven by consumer demand,\" labour economist Harley Shaiken once told U.S. broadcaster\u00a0National Public Radio.\nThe new policy statement may show the business leaders are adopting the views of French economist Thomas Piketty who, in his 2014 book Capital in the Twenty-First Century\u00a0said the survival of capitalism depended on a certain amount of redistribution of wealth from the richest to ordinary people.\nRather than just handouts, Piketty\u00a0suggested one of the essential things countries must do is improve education for the poorest, something that would have a long-term impact on relative wealth. As others have said, a more widely educated population does not just create consumers, it\u00a0is\u00a0more likely to create wealth.\nReference to the environment may also show a split between corporate leaders and Trump, whose policies have pulled the teeth from environmental rules and withdrawn the U.S. from its Paris climate change commitments.\nMany credible international studies\u00a0have shown climate change and other kinds of environmental degradation are eroding the natural\u00a0wealth that corporations depend upon. The new statement may show business leaders have come to a similar realization.\nOf course critics are skeptical. Instead of actually wanting to change their ways, the statement may just be public posturing \u2014 saying \"Don't worry, we've got it covered,\" as legislators try to\u00a0force corporations into being better public citizens.\n\"I'm wary,\" Larry Summers, the economist who served in high-profile roles in Democratic administrations told the Financial Times. \"I worry the Roundtable's rhetorical embrace of stakeholders is in part a strategy for holding off necessary tax and regulatory reform.\"\nIt may also hint at their fear that previous periods of skewed wealth and power, such as the gilded age of the late 19th century, ended in marginal tax rates for the rich of more than 75 per cent. In North America's golden age of the\u00a01950s, the marginal tax rate on the richest was more than 90 per cent.\nBut as the world fears a painful recession \u2014 that would likely\u00a0lead to a decline in stocks and a public backlash against the business elites\u00a0responsible \u2014 maybe it's a good time to claim high share prices are not the be all and end all.\nFree market critics\u00a0point out the new plan\u00a0flies in the face of the view that, for the sake of efficiency, companies should be single-minded in maximizing\u00a0the bottom line, leaving governments to develop the set of rules corporations\u00a0operate under.\nBut taken at face value, the new statement of purpose may represent the first step in the realization that giant corporations can't go on eating their seed corn. Instead, long-term profits and long-term survival depend on nurturing the health of the\u00a0society they depend on to survive, even if that requires being open to new government restraints.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Rafferty Baker", "title": "Pandemic panic sees seed sales spike", "description": "Seed distributors are struggling to keep up with sudden demand amid reduced labour", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/seed-demand-spikes-amid-pandemic-1.5524298", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5524322.1586232186!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ubc-farm-seeds.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 07, 2020 3:00 AM PT", "2020-04-07T10:00:00.897Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has left the economy strewn with companies struggling to stay afloat and keep staff employed, as governments restrict what sort of business is allowed, and people quickly change their behaviour to maintain physical distance between them.\nHowever, it's a different story completely for seed distributors, which have seen a significant increase in business, ever since the pandemic really hit Canada.\n\"I don't know if it's fear,\" said\u00a0Alex Augustyniak, general manager at Delta-based West Coast Seeds. \"I think they're thinking it's going to be like other staples that are on the shelves, people were clearing out toilet paper, they were clearing out canned goods.\"\nAugustyniak\u00a0said in early March, demand went through the roof, with seven to 10 times the orders the company was getting the same time last year.\nHe said the physical distancing rules meant West Coast Seeds had to reduce output at its packaging and shipping areas.

Both are regarded as highly likely to support Trump's drive to lower rates.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "How produce stickers contribute to climate change", "description": "Also: The biggest players in battery storage", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-fruit-stickers-climate-change-1.5462794", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4865457.1540993844!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/what-on-earth-logo.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 14, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-02-14T19:02:58.599Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Hello, people!\u00a0This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world.\u00a0(Sign up here\u00a0to get it in your inbox every\u00a0Thursday.)\nThis week:\nAbout three years ago, Susan Antler was at a composting facility in B.C. when a truck full of rotting avocados pulled up.\nIt was \"51 feet, 52 feet [approx. 14 metres] \u2014 like, [a] massive truckload,\" said Antler, executive director of the Compost Council of Canada. \"And the facility just wouldn't accept it.\"\nWhy? Because each of those thousands of rotting avocados was \"contaminated\" by a little plastic PLU (or price\u00a0look up) sticker. It carries a number, standardized around the globe, that identifies the type of produce and whether it's conventionally or organically grown, to help cashiers enter the right price at the supermarket checkout.\nJane Proctor, vice-president of policy and issue management at the Canadian Produce Marketing Association, said while the stickers are voluntary, most chain supermarkets require them. \"It is not a regulatory requirement,\" she said. \"It's a business requirement.\"\nThe stickers are too small to be screened out in the waste sorting process, but don't break down during composting. Antler said they end up sprinkled as \"foreign matter\" through the finished product \u2014 compost that's destined to be used to enrich soils in places such as gardens, farmland and parks.\u00a0\nThe stickers aren't toxic and don't harm the compost \u2014 although presumably they add microplastics to the environment \u2014 so it's mostly a cosmetic issue, Antler acknowledged. But there are strict guidelines about how much foreign matter is allowed in compost, especially higher grades. And too much can make compost unmarketable.\nMindful of the old adage \"garbage in, garbage out,\" composting plants that want to produce and sell higher grades of compost need to be careful about what raw materials they take.\nIn the case of the B.C. facility, Antler offered to remove the stickers from the avocados, but the composting plant manager declined. \"He just sent the truck away, so that material went to landfill.\" She's pretty sure it happens all the time. \"The scale of waste is massive.\"\nIt's not just a waste \u2014 it could also speed up climate change.\u00a0\nAt a compost plant, organic matter typically decomposes in the presence of oxygen, generating CO2 and compost that can nourish plants. At a landfill, it decomposes without oxygen into methane, a greenhouse gas that has about 30 times the global warming impact of CO2 over a century. (Some organics plants use anaerobic digestion, which also generates methane, but it is captured and burned so it doesn't go into the atmosphere.)\nBut there are solutions, including other ways to affix the PLU to bulk fruits and veggies, such as:\nPaper stickers or certified compostable plastic stickers, which have been successfully tested in the U.S.\nInk stamps like the ones used to label eggs.\n\"Branding\" with lasers.\nProctor said produce sellers often don't see the extra investment as worthwhile when many customers don't have access to municipal composting. She added that the recent introduction of scannable barcodes on PLU stickers \u2014 which Canadian stores are expected to adopt soon \u2014 requires the labels to show fine detail and maintain durability, which only plastic enables.\nIn the meantime, you can help by making sure you take the little stickers off your fruit and veggie peels and rinds before tossing them in your green bin at home.\n\u2014 Emily Chung\nEmily Chung's piece on wood buildings last week garnered a lot of feedback from readers, some of whom were concerned about the safety of the material itself. \"I have reservations regarding wooden highrise buildings,\" said Bob Miller. \"These include: Wood burns. Wood is not recyclable. Wood is subject to rot.\"\nThis article from last year highlights the concerns of some fire chiefs and also includes a comment from a senior researcher at Natural Resources Canada.\nOther readers were concerned about where all the wood would come from.\n\"Are you seriously promoting the denuding of our planet's trees as a green solution! Methinks this is seriously flawed logic,\" wrote Simon Faunt.\n\"We already cut and clear-cut, unfortunately, too many forests,\" said Joan Thompson. \"Can and will we replant enough trees to maintain the natural wildlife spaces, clean our air and prevent soil erosion... I'm not sure. We build and we build and we build. There are no restrictions. We need to consider each option carefully \u2014 pros and cons.\"\nLast week in this space, we discussed the stock market slide for a number of the best-known oil and gas companies. This week, we're highlighting some of the biggest players in lithium-ion battery storage, which will be a key industry in the global transition away from fossil fuels. All of these companies supply car manufacturers (as well as electric utilities). In addition to upstart Tesla, there are a couple of Chinese newcomers \u2014 Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and BYD \u2014 as well as more established names like South Korea's LG Chem and Japan's Panasonic. The chart below reflects 2018 figures for each company's total storage capacity.\nOil companies are having a rough spell, and so are countries dependent on the profits from extracting oil. According to a report by the International Monetary Fund, as fossil fuel demand decreases, the wealth of Gulf oil producers like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates could dry up in 15 years. \nBrad McLaughlin says it should be easy for a northern country like Canada to build the kind of home that is so efficient it makes more energy than it uses.\nBut McLaughlin, the general manager of MCL Construction Ltd. in Quispamsis, N.B., is beginning to wonder if reducing residential greenhouse gases is really a priority in this country.\nHis certified net-zero home has maxed out energy efficiency. The house has insulated concrete walls, triple glazed windows, 44 solar panels and a backup rechargeable battery system.\nOn a sub-zero February afternoon, it's sending excess electricity back to the provincial grid in exchange for NB Power credits to be used on the coldest days, or at night when the sun is down.\nBut the three-bedroom, two-bath home stubbornly refuses to sell. It has been on and off the real estate market since 2017.\n\"It hasn't moved,\" McLaughlin said. \"We had a lot of people through it.\"\u00a0\nStarting out, McLaughlin's asking price was $695,000. By May 2019, he had lowered it to $570,000. This week, he put the two-storey house back on the market at $495,000.\nMcLaughlin points to mortgage \"stress tests\" and indifference from bank-hired appraisers as obstacles pushing buyers away from these higher-than-average priced homes. McLaughlin feels the federal government could do more to kick-start construction of these kinds of homes.\nHis first suggestion would be to revamp the mortgage stress test introduced to cool red-hot housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto. McLaughlin said the test lacks flexibility and is locking people out of the net-zero-carbon housing market by denying them mortgages for homes with higher purchase prices, without allowing for the fact the buyer won't have any heating and electricity costs.\nHe said appraisers are at a loss when it comes to a sustainable house like this.\n\"Around here, they just don't know how to value it.\u2026They just say, 'Well, there's a similar house down the street,'\" he said. \"Well, sure it might look the same, but it's a lot different.\"\nMcLaughlin isn't alone in his thinking. The Canadian Home Builders Association and the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) are also calling for changes to the system. CREA national president Jason Stephen, who is a Saint John realtor, said the stress test should be adjusted to suit regional markets across the country.\n\"If this was a system that was brought in to address escalating housing prices, month over month, or year over year, we just don't have that, which is why we always say there's not one housing market [across] the whole country,\" Stephen said.\nDuring the 2019 election campaign, the federal Liberals promised to introduce a $5,000 grant to buyers of net-zero homes and to offer interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to homeowners and landlords for energy saving retrofits. The program has yet to be introduced.\nOther efficiency programs are already available to builders and buyers in New Brunswick. NB Power offers as much as $10,000 in incentives for construction of energy-efficient homes, and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has a 15 to 25 per cent discount on mortgage insurance costs, depending on the level of efficiency of the home.\u00a0\n\u2014 Connell Smith\nAre there issues you'd like us to cover?

Such a statement is pure fiction,\" Feinberg said in an email on Friday. \"Compensation has not even been discussed in the global mediation discussions.\"\nThe shares, which had shed some gains before Feinberg's statement, declined further and were trading only two\u00a0per cent\u00a0above Thursday's close when North American stock markets opened.\nBayer, which acquired Roundup and other glyphosate-based weed killers as part of its $63-billion takeover of Monsanto last year, declined to comment on the initial Bloomberg news report and\u00a0Feinberg's response.\nBayer\u00a0CEO Werner Baumann last week said the company would consider settling with U.S. plaintiffs only on reasonable terms, and if it \"achieves finality of the overall litigation.\"\nHe added at the time the group was \"constructively engaging\" in a court-ordered process with mediator Feinberg on the cases heard in Federal Court. Most of the pending cases, however, have been filed with U.S. state courts.\nBayer shares have lost more than a third \u2014\u00a0or roughly $34 billion US\u00a0\u2014 of their\u00a0value since last August, when a California jury, in the first such lawsuit, found Monsanto should have warned of the alleged cancer risks from Roundup.\nThe German drugs and pesticides company has engaged in negotiations with plaintiffs' lawyers, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nBayer said this week the next U.S. glyphosate lawsuit scheduled to be heard in St. Louis, Mo., would likely be postponed,\u00a0and the company added on Friday that the St. Louis case slated for September had been postponed.\nThe German company may benefit from having cases heard in the city where Monsanto was headquartered and where Bayer now manages its global seeds business \u2014\u00a0but Missouri is also known for juries that often hit companies with huge damages.\nBloomberg said the delays had been pursued by Bayer to allow for undisturbed settlement talks.\nThe initial unfavourable court rulings in the first three glyphosate cases, heard in California, have at times dragged Bayer's market value below what it paid for Monsanto, although the shares are now trading above that level.\nThe company, which says regulators and extensive research have found glyphosate to be safe, has previously said it was banking on U.S. appeals courts to reverse or tone down three initial court rulings that have so far awarded tens of millions of dollars to each plaintiff.\nBloomberg cited three sources familiar with the discussions as saying that Bayer's lawyers are seeking an accord to resolve all current and future cases. Talks over cases that have yet to be filed were particularly tricky, the report added.\nWhile Bayer has indicated it could pay $6 billion to $8 billion, plaintiffs' lawyers want more than $10 billion to drop their claims, the report said.\n\"Progress on settlement is a clear positive to potentially remove what has been the key overhang in shares for a year,\" Bank of America analysts said in note.\nAn estimate of a $20-billion hit from the litigation has previously been reflected in the share price, while a likely litigation settlement liability was in the mid-single-digit billion-dollar range, they added.\nBut they kept a neutral rating on the stock, citing uncertainty over Bayer's fortunes in the appeals process \u2014\u00a0with the first appeals verdict expected by the end of the year \u2014\u00a0and whether a settlement could be achieved before that.\nThe number of U.S. plaintiffs blaming Roundup and other glyphosate-based weed killers for their cancer continued to rise by 5,000 to 18,400, Bayer said last week, as a litigation wave showed no sign of letting up.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Taiwan's election being watched closely in Beijing, Washington", "description": "Backlash against Beijing pressure aimed at Taiwan, Hong Kong could propel Tsai Ing-wen to new term", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/taiwan-election-tsai-han-1.5421878", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5421881.1578661988!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/taiwan-election-tsai-comeback.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 10, 2020 8:55 AM ET", "2020-01-10T13:55:26.651Z"], "source": null, "content": "Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen urged her supporters to turn out at the polls in force as campaigning for national elections wrapped up Friday with last-minute stumping and rousing rallies before this weekend's election.\n\"We all must go home and vote!\" she said. \"Do not doubt yourselves. Our path is the right one!\" she said while out campaigning.\nTsai, of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, was leading by a comfortable margin in most polls and was expected to triumph Saturday over her Nationalist Party rival, Han Kuo-yu, and James Soong, of the smaller People First Party.\nThe Nationalists, however, were hoping to erode the DPP's 68-seat majority in the 113-member legislature, where Nationalists hold 35 seats. Minor parties and Independents hold the rest of the seats.\nTaiwan elections are lively events that generally revolve around economic, public welfare and social justice issues, though China's threat to annex the self-governing island by force always looms large in the background.\nAfter losing badly in local elections 14 months ago, Tsai's party has gotten a boost from hostile words and actions\u00a0from Beijing. Months of sometimes violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong have helped convince many in Taiwan that Beijing's \"one country, two systems\" formula for governing that city is untenable.\nStill, it is likely that further deadlock and heightened pressure from China will result if Tsai wins a second\u00a0four-year term.\nAfter a day of patrolling markets and city streets appealing for votes, Tsai's supporters gathered Friday evening for rousing campaign rallies.\nIn Taipei's city centre, Tsai's backers waved pink and green flags and chanted, \"2020, let's win!\" and \"Ing must triumph!\"\nTsai's campaign has focused on the need to protect the island's thriving democracy, which she says should be a model for Hong Kong, rather than the other way around.\nA rebound in Taiwan's high-tech economy has also helped Tsai's cause. Stock prices have remained robust and wages have risen slightly, partly thanks to Taiwanese exporters relocating from China to cut costs and avoid the bruising effects of the U.S.-China trade war.\nAside from its key role in the global supply chain as a high-tech manufacturer, mostly notably as an Apple Inc. supplier, Taiwan is in a strategic location just off the coast of China and on the edge of the Pacific.\nIt is a potential military flashpoint between China and the United States, which sells arms and provides other assistance to Taiwan.\nBeijing has taken an especially hard line against Tsai since her 2016 inauguration, infuriated by her refusal to endorse its claim that Taiwan and the mainland belong to a single China.\nBeijing cut off all formal ties with her government, restricted visits by Chinese tourists, excluded Taiwan's representatives from international gatherings and peeled away more of the island's dwindling diplomatic allies, leaving it with just 15.\nStepping up its threats, Beijing has in recent months held military exercises across the Taiwan Strait, sailed both of its aircraft carriers through the waterway that divides Taiwan from the mainland, and flown air patrols around the island.\nHowever, in an apparent effort to avoid antagonizing voters, Chinese leader Xi Jinping didn't renew the threat of using force against Taiwan during his annual New Year's Eve address, even though he reiterated China's firm opposition to Taiwan's formal independence. Chinese state media have been notably silent on the election.\nAnalysts say the low-key approach masks a more subtle campaign to back Han and Nationalist candidates for the legislature through media manipulation and social media campaigns.\nSeeking to scupper such attempts, the legislature last month passed an anti-infiltration bill laying out fines and prison sentences for those seeking to manipulate Taiwan's political system on behalf of China or other foreign powers.\nHan has slumped in the polls following a series of gaffes and allegations of shady financial dealings, however. He has clung to a pro-China policy despite widespread distrust of the mainland and the backlash against Beijing's handling of the Hong Kong protests.\nIn comments to the media on Thursday, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Tsai's government doesn't plan to rock the boat with a formal declaration of independence.\n\"Maintaining the status quo is in the best interest of everyone concerned. We will not provoke any conflict with China, but we are absolutely determined to defend Taiwan's democracy,\" Wu said.\nAlthough Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.\nIt has taken no position on who should win, but has expressed concern at Chinese efforts at intimidation and influence.\nTaiwan enjoys strong bipartisan support in Washington, and the Trump administration has approved billions in new arms sales.\n"}, {"author": "Anna Desmarais", "title": "'This is a crisis': N.W.T. survey shows worsening housing conditions", "description": "2019 NWT Community Survey says 42% of all households have at least one major problem", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/this-is-a-crisis-n-w-t-survey-shows-worsening-housing-conditions-1.5377616", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5378622.1575053884!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fort-simpson.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Nov 29, 2019 6:00 AM CT", "2019-11-29T19:16:32.327Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Housing in every community throughout the Northwest Territories is getting worse.\u00a0\nThe 2019 NWT Community Survey says 42 per cent of all houses in the territory have at least one major problem, up from 20 per cent in the 2016 federal census.\u00a0\nCBC compared the results of the 2019\u00a0NWT Community Survey\u00a0with the 2016 census results and found a dramatic change in the number of households with core housing needs \u2014\u00a0a term used by national housing authorities to determine the number of households that are too expensive for residents or are not suitable in other ways, like overcrowding or in need of major repairs.\nIn Canada, the number of households with core housing needs was\u00a013 per cent in 2016, according the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\u00a0\nIn Fort Simpson, the number of households without basic amenities like running water, or homes in need of major repair,\u00a0tripled over three years, from 40 in 2016 to 127 in 2019.\u00a0\nFort Simpson Mayor Sean Whelly said there's no easy solution to making sure everyone has an affordable and adequate home in his village.\u00a0\n\"You've got a lot of problems when you're talking about housing,\" he said. \"The housing stock is getting older, there hasn't been a lot of new construction here.

All \"non-essential\" leaves for helping youth in custody reintegrate into the community are being restricted.\nMore businesses are opting to voluntarily close down for the time being.\u00a0\nSome Starbucks locations will be closed, as will all GoodLife and Fit4Less fitness centres.\u00a0\nAs of today, Cadillac Fairview malls\u00a0\u2014 including Eaton Centre, Sherway Gardens, and Fairview Mall\u00a0\u2014 are among those limiting their hours to 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.\nThe Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario is also strongly recommending that non-essential and elective dental services be suspended.\u00a0\nLate on Sunday, it emerged that an officer with\u00a0Canada Border Services Agency\u00a0(CBSA) at Toronto Pearson airport had\u00a0tested positive for the coronavirus.\u00a0\nThe agency says it doesn't know when or where that employee became infected, but says another group of workers who may have had contact with them are now \"self-monitoring for symptoms.\"\u00a0\nCBSA is also stepping up its COVID-19 measures, with additional officers, extra signage,\u00a0and a new requirement that travellers coming from international destinations acknowledge they are being asked to self-isolate upon their return.\u00a0\nNo Ontario cases have been confirmed by health authorities as resulting from community transmission, though some experts say it's likely that this kind of spread is already underway.\u00a0\nDr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, says the province's current cases are all related to travel.\n\"They didn't get it from a community source yet at this time,\" he said.\u00a0\nCanada's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Theresa Tam said Sunday that 25,000 COVID-19 tests have been done across the country to date and there has been a \"rapidly increasing\" number of cases,\u00a0particularly in Ontario, B.C. and Alberta.\n\"Our window to flatten the curve of the epidemic is narrow,\" Tam said.\u00a0\nHere's the key section of the Ontario government's news release giving specifics of how workers will be helped by planned new legislation aimed at blunting the financial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak: <a href=\"https://t.co/MFNHRq5A8f\">pic.twitter.com/MFNHRq5A8f</a>\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U.S., China grant trade concessions as fresh talks loom", "description": "Trump announced 2-week delay to increased tariffs on Chinese imports 'as a gesture of goodwill'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/us-china-trade-concessions-1.5280599", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280632.1568295430!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-us-trade.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 12, 2019 9:48 AM ET", "2019-09-12T15:04:59.879Z"], "source": null, "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday welcomed China's decision to exempt some U.S. anti-cancer drugs and other goods from its tariffs and announced a short delay to scheduled tariff hikes on billions worth of Chinese goods.\nStock markets in Asia rose on the news in early Thursday trade, as the concessions came days ahead of a planned meeting aimed at defusing the escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies.\nChina's decision to exempt some U.S. goods was a \"big move\" by Beijing and a positive gesture before trade negotiators from both countries meet in Washington, Trump told reporters at the White House.\nChina on Wednesday announced its first batch of tariff exemptions for 16 types of U.S. products, including some anti-cancer drugs and lubricants, as well as animal feed ingredients whey and fish meal, according to a Ministry of Finance statement on its website.\n\"They made a couple of moves \u2026\u00a0that were pretty good,\" Trump said at an unrelated event on vaping. \"I think it was a gesture, OK? But it was a big move.\"\nOn Wednesday, Trump wrote in a post on Twitter that the United States had agreed to delay increasing tariffs on $250 billion US worth of Chinese imports from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15 \"as a gesture of goodwill.\" The tariffs were set to increase to 30 per cent from 25 per cent on the goods.\nTrump said he hoped to reach a trade agreement with China following more than a year of tit-for-tat exchanges of tariffs that have roiled global markets.\n\"I deal with them and I know them and I like them,\" he said. \"I hope we can do something.\"\nAsian stocks rose on Thursday, while China's yuan currency was also up 0.27 percent in offshore trade, as investors hoped for a thaw in U.S.-China trade frictions.\nDeputy trade negotiators are due to meet in Washington in mid-September, with minister-level talks to follow in October. Exact dates for the meetings have not been released.\nThe gestures may ease tensions ahead of the negotiations, but some analysts don't see it as a signal that both sides are readying a deal.\n\"The exemption could be seen as a gesture of sincerity towards the U.S. ahead of negotiations in October but is probably more a means of supporting the economy,\" ING's Greater China economist Iris Pang wrote in a note.\n\"There are still many uncertainties in the coming trade talks. An exemption list of just 16 items will not change China's stance,\" she said.\nIndeed, the exempted list pales in comparison to over 5,000 types of U.S. products that are already subject to China's additional tariffs. Moreover, major U.S. imports, such as soybeans and pork, are still subject to hefty additional duties, as China has ramped up imports from Brazil and other supplying countries.\nBeijing has said it would work on exempting some U.S. products from tariffs if they are not easily substituted from elsewhere. The United States is by far China's largest supplier of whey, which is an important ingredient in piglet feed and difficult to source in large volumes from elsewhere.\nAnalysts say that with its duties on soybeans and U.S.-made cars, China is taking aim at a key political support base of Trump, mainly the factories and farms across the Midwest and South at a time of receding momentum in the world's top economy.\nChina has imposed several rounds of duties on U.S. goods in retaliation against U.S. Section 301 tariffs, beginning last year in July and August with a 25 per cent levy on about $50 billion of U.S. imports.\nIn all, the United States and China have slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods in a bitter trade war that has raised the spectre of a global recession, with further tariffs slated to take effect in coming months.\nThe items on the two tariff exemption lists \u2014\u00a0posted on the ministry's website \u2014\u00a0will not be subject to additional duties imposed by China on U.S. goods \"as countermeasures to U.S. Section 301 measures,\" the ministry said in its statement.\nThe exemption will take effect on Sept. 17 and be valid for a year through to Sept. 16, 2020, it said. Beijing said in May that it would start a waiver program, amid growing worries over the cost of the protracted trade war on its already slowing economy.\nING's Pang noted the United States had also exempted imports of 110 Chinese products from tariffs in July, including high-value items such as medical equipment and parts.\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to meet in early October in the U.S. capital, but key officials are tamping down expectations for a major accord.\nFor two years, the Trump administration has sought to pressure China to make sweeping changes to its policies on intellectual property protection, forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms, industrial subsidies and market access.\nBeijing and Washington were close to a deal last spring but U.S. officials said China backed away from an agreed text over a reluctance to change laws to address U.S. complaints.\nThe South China Morning Post reported, citing an unidentified source, that China was expected to buy more agricultural products in hopes of a better trade deal with the United States.\nSenior White House adviser Peter Navarro this week urged investors, businesses and the public to be patient about the trade dispute.\nEarlier on Wednesday, a survey by a prominent American business association showed the trade dispute was souring the profit and investment outlook for U.S. companies operating in the world's second-biggest economy.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Province to spend $629K on new affordable housing units over 3 years, $12M on repairs", "description": "Rent supplements cut to spend $2M on emergency shelter beds with 500 people across New Brunswick homeless", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/affordable-housing-new-brunswick-dorothy-shephard-repairs-rent-1.5390547", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5148612.1582562042!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/dorothy-shephard.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 10, 2019 7:12 PM AT", "2019-12-11T01:22:04.249Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Social Development Minister Dorothy Shephard\u00a0acknowledges the province's plan to create 151 affordable housing units in the first three years of a new\u00a0housing agreement with Ottawa doesn't sound like much, given the 500 people who are currently homeless and the more than 5,000 households on the waiting list for affordable housing.\nBut she\u00a0says the decision was made to put more money toward repairs\u00a0and renovations of\u00a0existing affordable units as quickly as possible.\n\"We have many, many units that are out of service because they can't be renovated under the current budget. So it was really important to put money in the budget to not only maintain what we have\u00a0\u2026 but we also have units that are in enough disrepair from damage that we can't utilize them,\" she said.\n\"So we need to maximize our opportunities to get every single unit available for housing.\"\nThe province will\u00a0spend\u00a0$629,000 on building the\u00a0new housing units, compared to more than $12 million on upgrades over the next three years\u00a0\u2014 $7.2 million on public housing and $4.9 million on non-profit housing.\nDepartment officials could not\u00a0immediately say how many units\u00a0are in such disrepair that they can't be used, or how many will become available through the upgrades,\u00a0but Shephard said there are \"many\" in the northern part of the province and the Saint John region.\n\"So it's a constant struggle to keep up with it all.\"\nEarlier this year, the province signed a $299.2 million, 10-year agreement with the federal government under the National Housing Strategy.\nThe 2019-2022 New Brunswick Action Plan calls for an average of 50 new affordable housing units to be built in each of the first three years\u00a0\u2014 a mixture of NB Housing and private units with housing agreements \u2014 across the province.\nShephard said that's about 10 more per year than the previous plan and was negotiated in\u00a0consultation with stakeholders, clients and other departments.\nAn additional 1,111 units are expected to be\u00a0created in the final seven years.\nMeanwhile, to help address\u00a0homelessness this year, the department spent $2 million on\u00a0extra emergency shelter beds in Moncton and Fredericton, but\u00a0cut about 65 to 70 rent supplements, Shepard confirmed.\nIt's \"unfortunate,\" but necessary, she said.\n\"When you have 500 people living on the street, you have to try to provide them with enough resources to at least keep them safe.\"\nThe cuts to rent supplements is temporary, according to the minister. She expects the agreements with private landlords to subsidize units and make them available to people in need will be restored in the next budget.\n\"We have to work within our means and we're doing more than we've done before. So we need to make gains wherever we can. And when the opportunities arise, we need to maximize those opportunities.\"\nAsked about Montreal's proposed\u00a0bylaw that will compel\u00a0developers to build a certain number of affordable and social housing units, or contribute to a fund that will finance social housing, Shephard\u00a0called the idea \"interesting.\"\nShe said the majority of affordable housing units in New Brunswick are\u00a0already built by the private sector with the government's help to make a certain percentage of them subsidized units.\n\"But I think it's interesting that we could put that into policy and I think with the help of our municipalities that it's worthy of looking at.\"\nShe said the municipalities have been quite willing to be at the table to discuss the homelessness issue.\n\"So I think that they would welcome the conversation,\" said Shephard.\n\"Once we explore,\u00a0you know, the pros and the cons of it, I'm not sure where it will come out, but I think it's worthy of a discussion.\"\nShe is willing to commit to that discussion \u2014 or anything else that could benefit the housing strategy, she added.\nThe bylaw was\u00a0adopted by Montreal's executive committee in June and is going through public consultations now, said Coun. Craig Sauv\u00e9, the councillor responsible for housing.\n\"We think that in one year of signing this bylaw we'll be able to create 600 units of social housing and other several hundred units of affordable under-market housing and family housing,\" he said. \"That's just from this bylaw alone. So it's a pretty powerful tool and a lot of people are very excited about it in Montreal.\"\nOther jurisdictions are excited about it too, according to\u00a0Sauv\u00e9. Neighbouring municipalities are considering adopting it, he said, and he's been fielding\u00a0calls from officials across Canada, asking for details.\nThe bylaw is complex, said\u00a0Sauv\u00e9, but it makes it more expensive for developers to do the pay-out option, so they're more likely to build some turn-key affordable housing units.\nThat's\u00a0the \"best possible scenario\" for the city because it avoids the headache\u00a0of dealing with a construction project and delivers the units to citizens\u00a0in need sooner.\nIt's often referred to as the 20-20-20 bylaw, said\u00a0Sauv\u00e9, because it calls for 20 per cent non-profit housing, 20 per cent affordable sub-market housing and 20 per cent \"family housing,\" which means three bedrooms or more to create more housing stock for families to live within the city core.\nThe initiative comes amid a housing crunch in Montreal.\nThe rental market has become increasingly competitive, due to increased demand and rising real estate prices, leaving low-income families especially vulnerable.\nSauv\u00e9\u00a0said the bylaw\u00a0may not be a so-called magic bullet to solve homelessness, but he does believe it's a \"piece of the puzzle.\"\nMontreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante wants the bylaw, which still needs to be approved by council,\u00a0to be in effect by Jan.\u00a01, 2021.\n"}, {"author": "Rachel Cave", "title": "'Don't come in if you're sick': NB Pharmacists try to manage COVID-19 rush", "description": "Customers complain 30-day limit on refills triples their drug costs.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/pharmacists-manage-covid-rush-1.5503700", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5503747.1584654799!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pills.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 19, 2020 7:45 PM AT", "2020-03-19T22:45:36.748Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "New Brunswick pharmacists say they're trying to manage a surge in requests for prescription refills and other demands from patients who can't get through to Telecare or see their family doctors.\nThey say traffic into their drugstores has as much as tripled and people are coming in sick, coughing and asking about fevers.\nThey're pleading with the public \u2013 that anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 \u2013 please stay away.\nAt the Jean Coutu pharmacy on Union Street in Fredericton, staff have literally walled themselves in.\nThey've used plastic sheeting to build a droplet barrier to protect themselves from potentially infectious customers.\nThat's where pharmacist Greg MacKay works.\nHe says he's hoping the improvised shield will help his staff stay healthy, especially when there's such a flood of need.\n\"If people thought they had a problem with toilet paper and other supplies, then they start thinking about other things they need to keep on hand, like their important medication,\" said MacKay.\n\"So, they say, okay, that's the next thing on my list.\"\nHowever, people who want to stock up, can't.\nOn Tuesday, the New Brunswick College of Pharmacists directed all refills to be capped at a 30-day amount.\nThe College said this would help to ensure a stable supply for everyone \"as this situation evolves.\"\nBut it also means those who pay fees on refills could see their costs triple, if this measure stays in place for a significant length of time.\n80-year-old Fredericton resident Herb Walsh says that would be a hit on his fixed income.\nSince he's had his heart valve replaced, he has six medications, for which he co-pays 11 dollars per refill.\nNormally, those refills last 90 days.\nNow he says, he'll be charged every 30 days and that will jack up his out-of-pocket costs from $66 to $198 for the same amount of medicine.\nWalsh also questions the wisdom of any policy that could cause people to go to the store more often, when New Brunswick has declared a state of emergency and public health is begging people to stay home.\nIn response to all the complaints, the New Brunswick Pharmacists' Association issued a statement Thursday evening on behalf of Interim Executive Director Janet MacDonnell.\n\"We hear you.

It is a big deal,\" Governor Mark Carney said, adding that the BoE's measures were equivalent to \"north of 1 per cent\" of economic output.\nCarney, in his final days in the role, said the Bank was co-ordinating with the government to have \"maximum impact.\"\nBritain's economy unexpectedly flat-lined in January even before the impact of the coronavirus kicked in, according to official data published on Wednesday.\nSunak said he would be able to meet the fiscal rules set by his predecessor Sajid Javid although the rush to come up with measures to fight coronavirus meant the full stimulus cost was not yet included in borrowing forecasts.\nBritain's independent budget forecasters lowered their forecasts for economic growth this year and that estimate does not yet include an updated estimate for the impact of the virus.\nBut Sunak said growth over the next two years would be 0.5 percentage points higher than it would have been without his stimulus plan.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/alberta/west-of-centre/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Hadeel Ibrahim", "title": "Saint John police target property owners renting to cannabis dispensaries", "description": "At least one dispensary will stop selling after police warned of property seizure if cannabis sales continue", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/saint-john-police-cannabis-dispensaries-1.5367053", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4436121.1530719072!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/58684301.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 21, 2019 5:30 AM AT", "2019-11-21T09:30:00.401Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Saint John police are trying to clamp down on private cannabis dispensaries by targeting their landlords.\nA letter shared with CBC\u00a0News addressed to Giggles Gaming Cafe says the location at 102 Union St. is \"an instrument of unlawful activity,\" because police believe the cafe is selling cannabis illegally.\nThe letter, sent on Nov. 14, says the cafe has two weeks to stop selling cannabis. If it doesn't, the Saint John Police Force\u00a0will use the Civil Forfeiture Act to seize the property.\nLawyer John Barry says this is the first time he's seen this provincial civil law used in cannabis enforcement.\n\"It's very well thought out,\" Barry said.\nThe Civil Forfeiture Act was created in 2010. If the police suspect a property is being used for an illegal purpose, such as a brothel, unlicensed alcohol or gambling establishment, they can get consent from the attorney general to seize that property, close it down and sell it.\u00a0\nThey can begin the process based on suspicion, and it's up to the property owners to prove that no illegal activity was taking place, or that they were completely unaware of it.\n\"Within the field of policing, they're leading the province,\" Barry said.\nMultiple stores and property owners have received the letter, said police spokesperson Jim Hennessy, but he would not say exactly how many.\nIn the winter of 2017, police raided six medical dispensaries and charged 12 people, including owners and employees from King Canna. But multiple King Canna locations have continued to operate in the province since the raids.\nBarry said this strategy could be more effective at curbing the cannabis grey market because it's making it more difficult for the stores to find places to rent.\n\"When you go in and seize a person's property and shut it down, then you're hitting their pocketbooks,\" he said.\n\"I would suspect that a number of landlords are giving termination notices.\"\nCannabis can only be legally purchased through the provincially owned Cannabis NB stores.

They will only sell accessories for a month before they either move or shut down.\nNorthrup said he will abide by the law and will stop renting to the store if they keep selling cannabis, but he said the business has been providing a \"service\" to people in the community.\nCustomers \"just weren't getting it at the government stores,\" he said.\u00a0\nHennessy said the purpose of the letter is to \"educate\" both property owners and business owners that \"there is and continues to be illegal activity taking place on the property.\"\nHe said the police will monitor the situation but he couldn't say exactly what will happen if the property and business owners don't comply.\n\"We'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Connell Smith", "title": "Land-based salmon farm proposed for Grande-Anse", "description": "Fish would spend their entire lives \u2014 from eggs to harvest \u2014 on land", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/aquaculture-salmon-atlantic-effluent-discharge-disease-environment-1.5394506", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5394564.1576186499!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/rc-organic-northern-products-inc.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 13, 2019 5:00 AM AT", "2019-12-13T09:00:00.507Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A Maisonette company is proposing to build a completely land-based salmon aquaculture business on\u00a0the site of a vacant lobster processing plant in Grande-Anse on the Acadian Peninsula.\nIn an environmental impact assessment application to the province, RC Organic Northern Products Inc. says the fish would be hatched from eggs and grown to adult size in the plant.\u00a0\nAn existing building on the Route 11 site would be used as the hatchery for the operation, while a new, 100-metre-long building would be constructed to house the fish in saltwater tanks until they are \"grown to market size and harvested.\"\nThere are currently no completely land-based Atlantic salmon aquaculture operations in New Brunswick.\nSustainable Blue in Centre Burlington, N.S., has been producing fish on land for a number of years.\nMeanwhile, a Norwegian company, Nordic Aquafarms, which has land-based salmon operations in Norway and Denmark, has applied to build a massive, $500 million US plant in Belfast, Maine.\nService New Brunswick lists Romeo Cormier of Maisonette as sole director of RC Organic Northern.

It's something that's very, very low margin, especially in coastal Labrador.\"\nThe price of gas has dropped almost 20 cents in the last two days in Newfoundland and Labrador.\nThe move comes after a \"significant downward shift\" in global oil prices according to the Public Utilities Board.

As a result of ordering gas earlier this week, Lethbridge estimates he lost $8,500 overnight because of the price drop.\n\"To see a \u2026 19.8-cent drop over the last two days on that stock that we purchased when the price was higher, I mean, you just can't swallow that pill,\" Lethbridge said. \"It would take us years to recover from a loss like what we were facing yesterday.\"\nLethbridge said making a change to the way gas is delivered to the station is easier said than done, as the station is four hours away from the supplier. He is also unable to order a smaller load to save money, as it would most likely be an unviable trip for suppliers.\nAccording to Lethbridge, the gross margin on an order of gas is about 10 cents per litre. The station then loses about half its margin due to the costs involved with processing debit and credit cards. Once all is said and done, Lethbridge said he's\u00a0left with about three to four cents a litre to use for the store.\n\"It's going to come to a point where private operators are not going to want to sell gas,\" Lethbridge said. \"It's just too volatile.\"\nLethbridge said the PUB needs to change.\n\"I think they're going to have the look at the model that they're using for us small volume retailers,\" Lethbridge said.\n\"Because of the restrictions of the PUB, as far as I'm concerned, that's why Black Tickle and Rigolet don't have viable gas supply at the retail level.\"\n\"Black Tickle hasn't had supply now for two years, and I think you can buy gas in Rigolet three mornings a week from the [Nunatsiavut] government.

Domestic businesses accounted for 66 per cent\u00a0of its $16.7 billion US in revenue in the quarter ending in June.\nChinese retailing faces uncertainty amid a tariff war that has raised the cost of U.S. imports.\nGrowth in online sales decelerated to 17.8 per cent\u00a0in the first half of 2019 amid slowing Chinese economic growth, down from 2018's full-year rate of 23.9 per cent.\nAlibaba says its revenue rose 42 per cent\u00a0over a year earlier in the quarter ending in June to $16.7 billion and profit rose 145 per cent\u00a0to $3.1 billion. Still, that was off slightly from 2018's full-year revenue growth of 51 per cent.\nThe total amount of goods sold across Alibaba's e-commerce platforms rose 25 per cent\u00a0last year to $853 billion. By comparison, the biggest U.S. e-commerce company, Amazon.com Inc., reported total sales of $277 billion.\nAlibaba's deputy chairman, Joe Tsai, told reporters in May the company is \"on the right side\" of issues in U.S.-Chinese trade talks. Tsai said Alibaba stands to benefit from Beijing's promise to increase imports and a growing consumer market.\nAlibaba is one of a group of companies including Tencent Holding Ltd., a games and social media giant, search engine Baidu.com Inc. and e-commerce rival JD.com that have revolutionized shopping, entertainment and consumer services in China.\nAlibaba was founded at a time when few Chinese were online. As internet use spread, the company expanded into consumer-focused retailing and services. Few Chinese used credit cards, so Alibaba created the Alipay online payments system.\nMa, known in Chinese as Ma Yun, appears regularly on television. At an annual Alibaba employee festival in Hanzhou, he has sung pop songs in costumes that have included blond wigs and leather jackets. He pokes fun at his own appearance, saying his oversize head and angular features make him look like the alien in director Steven Spielberg's movie E.T. The Extraterrestrial.\nThe company's $25 billion initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2014 was the biggest to date by a Chinese company.\nThe Hurun Report, which follows China's wealth, estimates Ma's fortune at $38 billion.\nIn 2015, Ma bought the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's biggest English-language newspaper.\nMa's successor as chairman is CEO Daniel Zhang, a former accountant and 12-year veteran of Alibaba. He previously was president of its consumer-focused Tmall.com business unit.\nAlibaba's e-commerce business spans platforms including business-to-business Alibaba.com, which links foreign buyers with Chinese suppliers of goods from furniture to medical technology, and Tmall, with online shops for popular brands.\nAlipay became a freestanding financial company, Ant Financial, in 2014. Alibaba also set up its own film studio and invested in logistics and delivery services.\nMa faced controversy when it disclosed in 2011 that Alibaba transferred control over Alipay to a company he controlled without immediately informing shareholders including Yahoo Inc. and Japan's Softback.\nAlibaba said the move was required to comply with Chinese regulations, but some financial analysts said the company was paid too little for a valuable asset. The dispute was later resolved by Alibaba, Yahoo and Softbank.\nCorporate governance specialists have questioned the Alibaba Partnership, which gives Ma and a group of executives more control over the company than shareholders.\nMa has said that ensures Alibaba focuses on long-term development instead of responding to pressure from financial markets.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Staff vacancies, 'favourable weather' behind Edmonton's $20M surplus in 2019", "description": "City took in less than expected in transit fares, construction permits, taxes", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-city-council-1.5491717", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491753.1583792352!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/city-hall.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 09, 2020 5:17 PM MT", "2020-03-09T23:17:15.228Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The City of Edmonton posted a $20-million operating surplus in its 2019 budget, in part by holding off on filling vacant staff positions and spending less than expected on snow and ice control, city council heard at a meeting Monday.\n\"The City of Edmonton is responsibly managed and a $20-million surplus, which is small in the grand scheme of things, is a reflection of that tight management,\"\u00a0Mayor Don\u00a0Iveson\u00a0told reporters outside council chambers at city hall Monday.\u00a0\nThe city spent $2.44 billion on operating costs instead of the $2.52 billion it budgeted for last year, managers outlined in a update to council.\u00a0\nBut the municipality also took in millions less than it had anticipated in areas like transit, recreation facilities, construction permits and taxes.\nPart of the surplus came from $9.7 million in savings in snow and ice control \"as a result of favourable weather conditions and efficiencies achieved in the snow and ice management process,\" the budget report said.\nHowever, January and\u00a0February\u00a0saw more snow,\u00a0which will show up in the financial results for 2020, Iveson\u00a0said.\nThe city also saved\u00a0$15.5 million in holding off in filling staff vacancies in fire rescue services, transit, fleet and facility branches and the open city and technology department.\nCoun.

What do they want to talk about?\nSo this year, from the luxury of semi-retirement, I did something different \u2014 for me at least.\u00a0I let the voters tell me what was on their mind.\u00a0It was a sobering experience. I travelled to, among other places, a stock car race in Hope, B.C.; a farmer's market in Fredericton; a rodeo in Binbrook, Ont.; a Greek pastry shop in Montreal and an arts fair in Hamilton.\nI didn't tell anyone I was coming. I just arrived, set up two chairs and invited people to sit down and talk.\u00a0And they did.\u00a0A lot. Sometimes they even lined up to talk.\u00a0I rarely had to wait.\nMany of the issues were familiar: climate change, pipelines, health care, Indigenous affairs, jobs, education costs.\u00a0\nBut there was an undercurrent running through most of their comments. It didn't matter what their issue was or which party they were likely to support.\u00a0\nIn a word, and to be kind in my choice of that word, it was \"frustration.\"\u00a0Not frustration with the times, but frustration with the people, the politicians to be specific, who were fighting to represent them.\nWhen I walked through an outdoor market in Kelowna, B.C., one Wednesday morning in September, I met Mike Elliot. \"Mike the musician\" we called him because he was playing guitar with a little band, giving entertainment to those buying fresh fruit and vegetables.\u00a0\nI was unsure about Mike at first. He seemed a little like that odd duck you encounter at times like this.\u00a0Kind of unfocused, or so it seemed. Bit of an anarchist, or so it appeared.\u00a0Until I started talking to him and listened beyond the message track he'd developed over the years.\u00a0\nIn fact, the more we talked, the more sense he started to make, and the more in sync he was with a lot of more, what should I say, average, reasonable people I met across the country.\nMike is part of a band called The Tree Huggers that travels across Canada. He's\u00a0far from your typical Canadian following the election,\u00a0but he sure captured a feeling I would keep encountering.\u00a0\nHere are a few moments from a much longer conversation, beginning after he told me he's not going to vote when Canadians go to the polls on Oct. 21.\nMansbridge:\u00a0\"OK, so what's the point of not voting?\"\nMike:\u00a0\"None of them speak my language. None of them support me and none of them say anything I have to say, none of them. So why would I vote for the least evil, you know? That's what it's come down to, which is really sad.\"\nI asked why didn't he run himself.\nMike:\u00a0\"No way. I feel in this society we suppress rebellion and that turns into violence because these kids aren't being listened to. So they break windows when the G20 summit happened and I was tempted when I was young to do all that kind of stuff and I'm like \u2026\u00a0that doesn't actually do anything. Just makes you look like an idiot.\"\u00a0\nMansbridge:\u00a0\"But I mean, they're saying, he won't run himself. He doesn't like anybody who is running. Doesn't like any of the parties. So\u00a0what do you want?\u00a0 How do you change the system?\"\nMike:\u00a0\"Yeah, that's a great question, something I'm still working on, but obviously one thing is community self-love. We don't love ourselves enough. If we loved ourselves enough, we wouldn't be reaching out to people to answer all these questions for us and understand all these things we don't understand. I know that didn't exactly answer what we need to do but I would say in summary, go back to nature.\"\u00a0\nMike describes why he doesn't vote\nI showed Mike a list of five issues and asked him to tell me which was the most important to him personally.\nMike:\u00a0\"Climate change is pretty important. Pipelines tie into that. Health care ties into that \u2026 without the climate, we don't have anything, so climate. If we're not alive, if we're not taking care of our mother, then we don't have anything. I would say climate change.\"\nI asked him if anybody is saying anything to him that makes sense on climate change.\nMike:\u00a0\"Absolutely not.\u00a0They're all trying to use these things like: 'Oh, let's just make it a little less bad.' You want to stop. You know, if you're feeling bad, you have to stop doing the things that make you feel bad\u2026. There's no just kind of doing it. You \u2026 better stop doing it.\"\nBut there's a dilemma with Mike's argument, and I told him that. If you want change, you have to participate. You have to be there.\nI've\u00a0seen a lot of bad politicians. But deep down, I have a lot of time for politicians because they actually believe, at least initially.\u00a0When they first enter the arena, I think they believe that there's something they can do to make our lives better.\nWe may not agree with what they say. But that's their belief. That takes courage, and they go through a lot to win a seat, getting the nomination, fighting other people from other parties and laying their whole lives out in front of everybody.\nBut they know that they've got to take part in the process to even have a chance to do something.\nI really enjoyed the back and forth with Mike.\u00a0And I learned a lot more than I thought I would when the conversation started, because I do think he echoes many of the comments I was hearing from one side of the country to the other.\u00a0\nFor many, even those who will vote and know how they'll vote, they're frustrated at what they fear will come to pass when the new government is formed.\u00a0\nMike's afraid people like him will be forgotten, the promises made will be ignored, any bond formed will be broken.\u00a0\nNot everyone is so pessimistic about the future relationship between the politicians and the people.\u00a0They want to believe that this time a new crop of elected officials will prove the doubters like Mike wrong.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0They don't have long to wait now.\n"}, {"author": "Mark Gollom", "title": "Boeing takes 'good step' with CEO ouster, but recovery could be years away: analysts", "description": "Boeing's board of directors forced out Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Dennis Muilenburg", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-chief-executive-officer-737-max-1.5406828", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5339285.1577142439!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/senate-boeing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 24, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-24T10:16:06.754Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Ousting Boeing's chief executive officer was\u00a0just one of the\u00a0steps\u00a0the beleaguered\u00a0American manufacturer had to take as it continues to deal with\u00a0the fallout of\u00a0the 737 Max aircraft crisis, analysts said.\u00a0\nBut industry observers say it could be years before the company starts to significantly recover financially.\n\"I think it's a good first step,\" said Paul Argenti, a professor at the Tuck School of Business\u00a0at\u00a0Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.\u00a0\"I think it is a very long term process ...\u00a0to try to dig its way out of its hole.\"\nOn Monday, Boeing's board of directors forced out chief executive officer\u00a0Dennis Muilenburg, saying they needed to\u00a0restore confidence in the company as it works to repair relationships with regulators and stakeholders following two deadly crashes.\n\"They should have gotten rid of the CEO when it was really clear that\u00a0management was not as adept at dealing with the crisis as they should have been,\"\u00a0Argenti said.\u00a0\nThe company has announced that in January it will suspend production of the 737\u00a0Max, which\u00a0was grounded worldwide back in\u00a0March after the second of two crashes that killed a combined total of 346 people.\u00a0\nInvestigators said\u00a0that in both crashes\u00a0a faulty sensor caused the aircraft's\u00a0MCAS system to push the nose of the plane down and pilots were unable to regain control.\nSome have criticized\u00a0Muilenburg's leadership after the disasters, blaming Boeing for allowing the 737 Max to stay in service after the first crash.\n\"Getting rid of [the CEO]\u00a0is a good way of saying, 'OK, we get it. We need to have new leadership and move in a different direction,'\" Argenti said.\n\"But you're looking at five to 10 years of misery. Maybe in a couple of years things will start to look better, but it's really five years before financially you start to get back.\"\nBoeing faces financial pressures as it\u00a0continues to produce 737 Max jets at a rate of 42 per month and purchase parts from suppliers at up to 52 units per month, even though deliveries are frozen until regulators approve the aircraft to fly commercially again.\nLast Friday, more problems hit the company as Boeing's new Starliner space capsule went off course on a planned trip to the International Space Station, heading into the wrong orbit due to a timing error.\nMeanwhile, the firm's stock price has fallen more than 20 per cent over the past nine months, erasing\u00a0billions in market capitalization;\u00a0orders for\u00a0planes are down;\u00a0and for\u00a0its third quarter, Boeing\u00a0reported\u00a0a 53 per\u00a0cent\u00a0drop in quarterly profit.\nChanging the CEO following crises is certainly a way\u00a0to signal to shareholders, stakeholders and customers that the company is taking the issues seriously,\u00a0said\u00a0Tim Hubbard, an assistant professor of management and\u00a0organization at the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame.\nStudies show that\u00a0chief executive officers\u00a0typically account for about 20 per cent of the variance in a firm's performance, he said.\nChanging the culture of a corporation\u00a0can take approximately five years or so, and removing the CEO is one of those \"big events\u00a0in which the company can actually change the trajectory in a faster way,\" Hubbard said.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut if too many Boeing employees are set in their ways,\u00a0specifically regarding safety and innovation, \"then it's going to be a long time until they're able to actually turn things around,\" he said.\nWhile board chair\u00a0David Calhoun will take over as CEO on Jan. 13. finding a permanent replacement will be challenging, Argenti\u00a0said.\n\"Someone who could really pull this company out from under is going to be an extraordinary human being.\"\nIan Lee, an associate\u00a0professor\u00a0at the Sprott School of Business at Carleton University, said Boeing\u00a0needs to recruit a \"really, really strong CEO who is going to transform the culture at the top.\"\nHe said the new CEO will likely purge many senior managers.\n\"Large numbers of people will be fired ultimately,\" Lee said. \"But it will be part of the regeneration and transformation process.

Premier\u00a0Jason Kenney\u00a0spoke after markets closed, shifting his government's emphasis on restraint to the protection of the economy and jobs \u2014 even if that means spending\u00a0\u2014 and said the UCP would consider a number of options. Opposition Leader Rachel Notley's NDP demanded the UCP withdraw its budget.\nThe latest crisis\u00a0started Friday, when OPEC tried to get Russia to agree to production caps in order to stabilize oil prices. When Russia refused, Saudi Arabia opened the taps, increased supply and contributed to the price crash.\u00a0\nNorth American stock markets were halted shortly after opening on Monday morning as circuit breakers designed to slow down panic selling kicked in within minutes.\nThe panic started on Sunday evening after Saudi Arabia kicked off the\u00a0all-out price war in the oil market.\nThat move sent the price of crude tumbling more than 25 per cent, and came on top of existing fears over the coronavirus currently spreading around the world.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude\u00a0finished the day down $10.26 US to $31.02 US a barrel. Western Canadian Select closed\u00a0at $17.80 US,\u00a0down $10.08.\nIt was the largest single-day drop since the beginning of the Gulf War in\u00a01991.\nDemand for energy is falling as people cut back on travel around the world. The worry is that the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak will slow economies sharply, meaning even less demand.\n\"We're seeing the outcome of a one-two punch in terms of a demand shock from the coronavirus \u2026 and on top of that this weekend's news of a price war started after the breakdown of OPEC plus Russia arrangements,\" said Blake Shaffer, an assistant professor of economics and public policy at University of Calgary.\nShaffer said the demand-side drop was expected but the more recent development of a price war is a supply-side issue that's hammering the market.\nThe oil market has seen arguments like this before. In 2014, OPEC held off production cuts in order to hold onto market share in the face of a resurgent U.S. oil industry. That led oil to tumble from over $100 US a barrel to below $40 by 2015.\nBut experts say this drop is much more dramatic.\n\"This is a really big move. I was an energy trader for 15 years.\u00a0I don't have all the daily moves in my head, but this would definitely be one of the biggest ones I've seen,\" Shaffer said.\nMartin Pelletier, a portfolio manager with Trivest Wealth Council in Calgary, said this is a \"nuclear-sized event\" for an already-hurting Alberta, and if not contained, the economic malaise could spread to the rest of the country.\n\"This could be the knock-out punch for Alberta, unfortunately,\" Pelletier said, adding that some companies might not survive the hit.\n\"We're going to really need to see some leadership coming out of Ottawa, and I mean both the Bank of Canada and [Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau and the government \u2026 This is a crisis;\u00a0this is a very serious event.\"\nPelletier said he'd like to see both a large fiscal spending program tailored to impacted provinces and an emergency rate cut.\nRichard Masson, the chair of the World Petroleum Council, said some Canadian companies are in a better spot than their U.S. counterparts because of a pipeline crunch that has forced them to contain growth, pay down debts and look for efficiencies.\u00a0\nStill, he too thinks the federal government needs to get involved to prevent a crisis, as financing continues to dry up.\u00a0\n\"We're going to need some support, or we're going to lose a lot of our native companies, and we won't be able to bounce back when prices recover,\" said Masson.\n\"One of the things they're probably going to have to look at is can they provide loans to companies to get them through?\"\nThe Alberta government's recent spring budget forecasts WTI will average $58 US a barrel in the coming year, and Shaffer said this is bad news both for the economy as a whole and for the province's royalty revenues.\n\"Roughly every dollar [per barrel] is about $350 million to the government \u2026 We're talking about a $7 billion decline in revenue expectations,\" Shaffer said, adding that about $2 billion is made up from the improved differential and the Canadian dollar, so the net hit would be about $5 billion.\nThe weight of that impact softened the fiery tone of Alberta Premier\u00a0Jason Kenney.\u00a0\nJust over a week ago, his United Conservative Party government introduced a budget that relies heavily on the well-being of the energy sector.\u00a0\nSpeaking in Calgary on Monday just after markets closed with cratering oil prices threatening to drain billions of dollars from the province's bottom line, the premier shifted from an emphasis on restraint to the protection of the economy and jobs \u2014 even if that means spending.\nThe premier said the Alberta government would look at a\u00a0range of choices that include borrowing money for more capital\u00a0spending to boost jobs, a return to tax incentives to lure high-tech\u00a0startups and directly subsidizing a barrel of oil.\n\"Our priority is protecting jobs. Our priority is protecting the economy,\" he said.\n\"If that means we need to borrow money to make that happen, we will do so.\"\nKenney said he would appoint a panel of experts led by economist Jack Mintz\u00a0with the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary \u2014 who also sits on the board of directors of Imperial Oil \u2014 on how to navigate the economic storm.\u00a0\n\"All options will be on the table. I repeat: all options will be on the table to do everything that we can within our capacity to help protect jobs and Albertans,\" said Kenney.\nHe\u00a0wants the federal government to step up as well.\n\"This is not just about Alberta. As Alberta goes, so goes the national economy,\" Kenney said.\nKenney is to meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday at the first ministers meeting in Ottawa.\nHe said he'll be asking for a range of relief measures, including financial incentives to help create jobs in reclaiming orphan wells, changes to payroll taxes and removal of a cap on fiscal stabilization transfers that would return about $2.6 billion to Alberta.\nKenney, saying now is not the time for partisan politics, said he'll be reaching out to rival politicians, including Opposition NDP Leader Rachel Notley, for advice.\nEarlier in the day,\u00a0Notley called for an immediate reconsideration of the provincial budget, in consultation with her NDP.\nNotley\u00a0said the budget was based on \"irresponsibly optimistic\" oil forecasts and that the UCP government tossed away programs meant to encourage economic diversification that she wants reinstated.\n\"Now more than ever, we know how important that task is and we are all reminded what a necessity it is,\" she said.\nNotley also called\u00a0on the federal government to step in and help the province though actions like lifting the cap on the fiscal stabilization program, designed to buoy sagging provincial economies.\u00a0\nNotley said the low prices will conservatively send the projected deficit for 2020-21 to almost $11 billion from $6.8 billion.\nShe said Kenney has left Alberta vulnerable by slashing corporate income taxes last year and using wildly optimistic oil revenue projections in the budget.\nShe also said Kenney was wrong when his government dismantled tax incentives last fall designed to lure more diversified businesses, including high-tech companies, to Alberta.\n\"Premier Kenney's belief in his corporate (tax) handout has always been magical thinking, but today it has been exposed as pure fantasy,\" said Notley.\n\"It would be profoundly irresponsible for the premier to press forward with this budget when the assumptions it is built on have been proven to be false.\"\nKenney said he will not be withdrawing his budget. He noted it's three weeks until the end of the fiscal year and said the province needs a budget in place. He said the government will revisit projections in the summer when the fiscal situation becomes clearer.\nKenney also resisted Notley's call to revisit an almost three per cent cut to operational spending. He said it remains a realistic goal given that Alberta spends more per capita than comparable jurisdictions.\nAlbertans pay the lowest overall taxes in Canada and there is no provincial sales tax. Both Kenney and Notley dismissed any increases, saying it would be catastrophic to an already hurting economy.\nKenney's UCP won last April's election on a promise to focus on revitalizing oil and gas while eradicating a string of multibillion-dollar deficits and getting the rising debt under control.\nAt the time, Kenney criticized the NDP for what he characterized as mismanaging the economy by borrowing billions of dollars, thereby running up debt interest payments that would cripple future generations.\nKenney said last week that his government's goal of balancing the books by 2023 might not happen.\nSome experts are predicting even lower numbers could be on the way.\nAli Khedery, a former Exxon adviser and now CEO of strategy firm Dragoman Ventures, tweeted \"$20 oil in 2020 is coming\" after news broke of Saudi Arabia's plans to hike production.\nShaffer said seeing such a wide difference in price forecasts after the province's budget dropped just weeks ago makes a strong case for the government to change how royalty revenues are budgeted and push for further economic diversification.\n\"If this is prolonged, you'll see continued job layoffs and effects on families.

WeWork is at the forefront of this revolution,\" SoftBank's founder Masayoshi Son said in a statement.\nGalloway, a marketing professor at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business,\u00a0first\u00a0rang alarm bells about WeWork's unsustainable business model\u00a0in 2017, and wrote a scathing takedown of the company on his personal website in August.\nHere is part of his conversation with\u00a0As It Happens guest host Helen Mann.\nI would love to hear what you think of the $1.7-billion payout that it seems Adam Neumann is now in line for?\nEBay acquired PayPal,\u00a0one of the most successful payment platforms in history, for\u00a0$1.5 billion. I mean, this is a budget greater than the budget for the National Endowment for the Arts or the Peace Corps combined.\nSo $1.7 billion comes out to about $850,000 per employee that is about to be laid off at WeWork. So by any stretch of the imagination, this is an unprecedented payout.\nAt one time, WeWork was valued at $47 billion dollars. What made the company so attractive to investors?\nThere's sort of what could be best described as a certain level of consensual hallucination between investors and founders. They're chasing sort of this halcyon effect of trying to find the next Google or Facebook.\nBut realistically, even though SoftBank may have valued internally WeWork at $47 billion ... arguably, the company was really never worth that.\nRegardless of what the actual value should have been, what was it that that drove those numbers?\u00a0You know, it looks like it was a real-estate company. It would lease, I think, office space, maybe buy some up, rent it out to others, sometimes tech entrepreneurs. It envisioned itself as something else. It called itself \"the largest physical social network\" in the world. But I'm wondering how\u00a0you get the value from that?\nIn the U.S., there's a kind of an algorithm of hallucinogenic value where profits have been replaced by technology, or a technology overlay, and growth.\nSo this is a company growing very fast. It was growing 70, 80 per cent a year. But it was also scaling its losses just as fast.\nThen they used the word \"technology\" 123 times in their S-1 [the form companies file to\u00a0U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission when going public], trying to position themselves as, in fact, a technology company.\nSo as long as the markets are willing to buy that story, companies will continue to try and position themselves as technology companies and replace profits with top-line growth.\nBut I think the markets have finally said this doesn't make any sense, and the music has stopped and there's obviously too few chairs here. So this might be coming to an end.\nWas it ever a technology company?\nNo. I mean, the closest they have to\u00a0technology was they had an app for reserving conference rooms.\nDid it ever actually own any of the workspaces?\nNo. As a matter of fact, one of the reasons this company's probably worth less than zero is that they have $42 billion\u00a0in long-term lease commitments over the next 15 years. And they leased other people's\u00a0office space.\nAs a matter of fact, that $47-billion number meant that the one floor they leased in,\u00a0say, a 10-storey building was being valued more than the entire building they were leasing one floor in. So this never made any sense.\nDo you see any similarities to the Theranos story?\nI think Adam Neumann\u00a0will go down in history, actually, as one of the greatest poker players and negotiators in history who was able to lose $17 billion in someone else's money and get a 10 per cent commission on that, or even a 20 per cent commission, and walk away with $2.5 billion.\nBut I don't think there's outright evidence of fraud. He wasn't hiding anything here. I think he was just taking advantage of a moment in time.\nYou started to poke holes in the company back in 2017. What was it about WeWork that made you skeptical at that time?\nI brought a core competence to the situation called math. And I just saw a company that for every $1 in revenue\u00a0it was taking, it was spending $2.\u00a0\nI don't claim to have any special skill here other than basic arithmetic. This company never made any sense.\nIt kind of buttresses the notion that a lot of these unicorn companies are a conspiracy between their founders and their IPCs, trying to pump the company up with corporate communications executives, a very charismatic CEO, an incredibly compelling story and then foist, quite frankly, what I'll refer to as their unicorn feces on unwitting public market investors.\nYou mentioned SoftBank, and this is the Japanese investment bank that's basically bailing out the company or taking it over. Why are they doing that given the valuation questions that you're raising here?\nI think some of it is cultural, and that is\u00a0Masayoshi Son, founder of the $100 Billion Vision Fund, which is the largest growth fund ever assembled, to have his largest investment be taken over by American banks and sold for pieces or sold for scrap, I think ... would be a tremendous loss of face.\nSo this wasn't an investment in WeWork\u00a0as much as it was an investment in the reputation and the face-saving of Masayoshi Son and SoftBank.\nDo you think this unraveling would have happened so quickly if the company hadn't tried to go public and had to publish the share sale prospectus?\nNo. The\u00a0autopsy on this company will assign death by S-1, and that is you have to credit the disclosure requirements of the SEC,\u00a0forcing them to put their numbers down on paper, their corporate governance down on paper, give academics and analysts in the media the opportunity to do real diligence on this company.\nAnd once that was in black and white on paper, the marketplace had a collective gag reflex on this company.\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press.

The incident was later diagnosed as\u00a0a case of sudden infant death syndrome.\n\"My attempts at giving her CPR didn't work,\" Paquette\u00a0told CBC News from her home in Chilliwack. \"I had to call on my son Lucas to help...\u00a0and he saved her life.\"\nThough Eleanor survived, the baby,\u00a0now just over six months old, suffered severe brain damage. She's partially blind and has been diagnosed with epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Paquette says she spends many of her days travelling to medical appointments across\u00a0the region.\nBut\u00a0she has four other kids to care for, and the family is in dire financial straits. Paquette couldn't afford to pay the December rent on her three-bedroom apartment as she grapples with health, food and living costs.\nPoverty advocates say Paquette's\u00a0situation has become all too common in the Fraser Valley and beyond, as the unaffordability crisis hits families across the province.\n\"As the cost of living increases, the cost of housing, the cost of child care \u2014 particularly for children with special needs \u2014 people are falling into poverty,\" said Helesia Luke, a spokesperson with the poverty advocacy group First Call B.C.\nA recent provincial report card found that\u00a0one in five children in B.C. are in poverty.\n\"This is not a problem exclusive to the metro region at all,\" said Luke, \"As people leave those urban centres to get more affordable housing, housing prices in those [other]\u00a0areas go up as well.\"\nPaquette hopes\u00a0her family will get accepted\u00a0into an affordable home provided by B.C. Housing. But after sitting on the provincial registry for more than two years, she worries they will end up on the street.\n\"It's very difficult. A mother should never ever have to be put in this position \u2014 to really be faced\u00a0to look at paying expenses and bills, or paying your rent,\" she said. \"It's really hard.\"\nPaquette is a former support worker for vulnerable women, now\u00a0off work and collecting a monthly disability payment.\nThe family moved to Metro Vancouver from Cranbrook, B.C. in 2017, where they lived in subsidized housing. Leaving that behind was a tough decision for Paquette, but she felt it was necessary.\nHer six-year-old son Boden\u00a0has autism and she said there are more health services available for him in B.C.'s Lower Mainland.\n\"We left B.C. Housing for market rental \u2014 and we've just been trying to survive ever since,\" she said.\nSince then, she's had three more kids.\u00a0Eleanor\u00a0and her twin brother, Max, were born in June. The family of six has since settled in Chilliwack.\nTreating both Boden and Eleanor's disabilities on a limited income has been a\u00a0challenge. Paquette\u00a0has to make weekly trips to Vancouver for medical services, often for days at a time. The costs of food, fuel, accommodations, and medications have piled up.\n\"I'm just overblown with the amount of appointments we have make,\" she said. \"We see a pediatrician once a month, a neurologist once a month, physiotherapy, occupational therapy. We see a dietitian, we see an ophthalmologist... It's put us into a financial crisis.\"\nPaquette asked to be\u00a0issued an eviction notice prior to the day before her rent was due, knowing she couldn't afford it.\nThe document allows her to apply for a $700\u00a0crisis supplement\u00a0from the Ministry of Children and Family Development. She's hopeful she can put the dollars toward a delayed rent payment.\nPaquette has been working closely with housing advocates at the Salvation Army. Captain Matt Kean said the organization has been working\u00a0to find housing options for her.\nB.C. Housing would not comment on the circumstances due to confidentiality, but noted there are more than 20,000 people on its registry whose needs are assessed on a case-by-case basis. The agency offers subsidized units to families \u2014\u00a0but advocates say they can be difficult to access.\nViveca Ellis, a community organizer for the B.C. Poverty Reduction Coalition, said single mothers with more than three children struggle to find adequate housing in Metro Vancouver and across the province.\n\"They end up waiting on the affordable housing lists for a very long time, because there is not enough large family stock in British Columbia.\"\nIt's a future that feels fragile, and uncertain. But Paquette draws inspiration from her daughter.\n\"This is all for her. It is absolutely all for her,\" she said.\n\"Life is just too short, and when you have such a miracle such as her, you have to cherish every moment. I just look at her, and I'm just extremely blessed,\" she said.\n"}, {"author": "Amanda Pfeffer", "title": "Pot producers implore Ontario to open more stores", "description": "Just 24 legal retailers open in Ontario compared to 324 in Alberta", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/pot-producers-implore-ontario-open-stores-1.5357101", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5198403.1573660844!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ont-cannabis-store-20190401.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 13, 2019 11:14 AM ET", "2019-11-13T19:20:52.424Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canadian cannabis producers are stepping up pressure on the Ford government to speed up the distribution of retail licences\u00a0in Ontario as\u00a0poor sales continue to dog the industry.\n\"Our ability to continue to invest and sustain the jobs that we have created is being severely challenged by the province's current retail cannabis policy framework,\" states a letter to the premier\u00a0from the Cannabis Council of Canada.

And despite a list of problems awaiting attention, including most immediately a rail strike that if left unresolved will soon begin to do long-term damage in numerous\u00a0sectors, the country continues to have many, if\u00a0poorly distributed,\u00a0advantages.\nBut however Canada deals with its internal problems it must do so in the context of a global economy that continues to struggle.\nOf course when\u00a0scrying the economic future, everyone has a different crystal ball.\u00a0Among those who sounded a less optimistic note at the end of last week was Laurence Boone, chief economist at the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, often seen as the rich countries' economic think-tank.\n\"The outlook for the global economy is worrying and policy-makers should be worried,\" Boone, ominously, began her video presentation on the OECD's latest outlook with the less-than-stirring title\u00a0Weak trade and investment threaten long-term growth.\nLike the Bank of Canada's Stephen Poloz, Boone believes the disruption in global trade, caused at least partly by U.S. President Donald Trump's attempt to get what he saw as a better deal, has done long-term damage. Repeated\u00a0and continuing\u00a0trade scares\u00a0have meant businesses that would otherwise have borrowed at current bargain rates to invest\u00a0have put off those decisions due to uncertainty.\nBoone's solution is a new round of fiscal spending by governments\u00a0on things like \"21st-century\u00a0infrastucture,\" partly to replace that private sector investment but intended\u00a0also to reduce uncertainty enough so that businesses once again feel they can borrow to expand with confidence.\n\"We can escape long-term stagnation by combining social reforms with targeted spending and tax policies, at lower interest rates, and raise investment confidence,\" said Boone in a call for concerted action by global governments. \"But everyone must recognize that the time to turn the tide is now.\"\nA more optimistic outlook came in market analysis from the London Financial Times\u00a0in an attempt to explain the recent surge in stocks, that included record highs for Canada's main index,\u00a0and an increase in short-term bond earnings quite different from the inverted yields so recently considered a recession warning flag.\nThings are looking up says FT. <a href=\"https://t.co/5zB29PyCIw\">https://t.co/5zB29PyCIw</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2VZXIkLCpw\">pic.twitter.com/2VZXIkLCpw</a>\nThe idea is that unlike concerns from people like Boone, and similar gloom from the IMF and World Bank, which are based on data that has already been collected, markets act as an\u00a0indicator of future expectations as traders load up in anticipation of better returns ahead.\nBut even after assembling a collection of data, including a chart that shows a gentle upturn in the economic outlook for major world economies including Canada, their conclusions are\u00a0less than enthusiastic.\n\"So far\u00a0the evidence suggests the slide in the global economy is coming to an end, but the pace of recovery is still expected to be weak,\" said the FT analysis.\nThe feeling is echoed in the deliberations released last week of the U.S. central bank in the run-up to its latest interest rate move where Fed chair Jerome Powell assured us this was his last cut for a while. Unless of course the economy weakens again, possibly due to a stalemate in the trade talks between the U.S. and China.\nSuch conditional parsing is always the way of economic forecasts. The ability of\u00a0markets, or any forecaster,\u00a0to tell us with reliability what is around the corner is far from certain.\nIn the meantime, the new cabinet is getting plenty of advice over how to squeeze the most out of an uncertain economy.\nFrom\u00a0Margaret McCuaig-Johnston at the Macdonald-Laurier\u00a0Institute comes the advice that Canada must make it a priority to reset its own trade and political relationship with China, including making a concerted effort to diversify Canada's Asian trade.\u00a0From David Parkinson at the Globe and Mail, that reappointed finance minister Bill Morneau must overhaul the tax code.\nAt a speech to the Ontario Securities Commission billed as a \"fireside chat,\" the Bank of Canada's Poloz\u00a0hinted at\u00a0two aspirations for his political masters\u00a0that may end up in conflict. One was a liberalization\u00a0in Canadian interprovincial trade, and the other a new awareness of how climate change represents a risk to the financial system.\nBut while the government will have its work cut out for it in synthesizing its perceived election mandate to reduce carbon with the oil-producing regions'\u00a0insistence on increasing the export of carbon fuels, it will do so with a few ace cards in its hand.\nOne is the strong consumer economy both in the U.S. and here at home prompted by job and wage growth that has helped allow North Americans to live in a bubble of relative prosperity.\nLast week the Canadian Federation of Independent Business revealed that despite a steady drip of immigration, more than 430,000 jobs have gone unfilled in the Canadian private sector. Statistics Canada provides its own\u00a0jobs update Dec. 6.\nA second is core inflation\u00a0\u2014 the measure of price rises with volatile sectors removed\u00a0\u2014 of more than two per cent that remains the envy of rich countries around the world, including the United States, meaning that Canada can reserve interest rate cuts for when the economy really needs them.\nAnd finally, despite the social complications it creates, Canada has the advantage of\u00a0a seemingly insatiable demand for housing that has led to a resurgent building boom that, so long as the economy continues to\u00a0inch\u00a0ahead, shows no sign of ending.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Thandiwe Konguavi", "title": "New picture book about the ABCs of aviation aims to inspire little girls and boys to fly", "description": "Main character honours one of Canada's first Indigenous female commercial pilots", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/aviation-abcs-book-inspires-girls-and-boys-to-fly-1.5244714", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5244727.1565653399!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/andre-alis-the-aviator.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 13, 2019 1:00 PM MT", "2019-08-13T19:00:00.457Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Five years ago, author and aviation enthusiast Danielle Metcalfe-Chenail was looking for a book to read to her two-year-old son Andre when she discovered a gap in the children's book market.\u00a0\n\"I realized that there weren't a lot of aviation ABC books on the market for kids that were wiggly and squirmy and spirited like he was,\" Metcalfe-Chenail said in an interview on CBC Edmonton's Radio Active on Tuesday.\nMetcalfe-Chenail, now based in Houston, Tex.,\u00a0is the former president of the Canadian Aviation Historical Society and a former historian laureate for the City of Edmonton.\u00a0\nShe is the author of two popular aviation histories for adults, Polar Winds: A Century of Flying the North\u00a0and For the Love of Flying.\nHer new book, Alis the Aviator, launched last week in Edmonton, is her first picture book.

Donations can be made online\u00a0and at the CBC Sing-In.\nMost of the kids and teens just nod to librarian Paula Lebrasseur on their way to the computers behind her, but some stop for a hug and she stands to welcome them \u2014 like a family member.\n\"Some kids have called me 'mom' by accident,\" Lebrasseur says.\nIn the grey area between guardian and librarian, she sometimes finds herself worrying about the regulars if they don't show up after school.\nIn those cases, sometimes she'll call the parents or they'll call her.\nThe Montreal's Children's Library, located in Villeray\u2014Saint-Michel\u2014Parc-Extension, moonlights as a free, safe, after-school activity centre for kids in the area.\nIt has been that way since 1929, when reading was combined with activities like puppet shows and ballet at different branches of the library.\nThat list of activities has since been updated to offer workshops in coding and filmmaking.\nBut the organization's precarious financial situation\u00a0has been ongoing and it shuttered two of its last three branches \u2014 in Little Burgundy and Shaughnessy Village \u2014 in 2016.\u00a0\nIn September 1929, seven women wanted to bring children's libraries to less privileged areas of the city, since only Westmount Library had offerings for children at the time.\nSo they founded the library, running primarily on donations.\nAccording to the library's archives, its first head librarian, Violet Mary McEwan, said the stock market crash \u2014 only a month after they opened \u2014 took a toll on what they were hoping to accomplish.\n\"Nevertheless, we have managed to carry on,\" McEwan said.\nDespite struggling during the Depression, over the years 11 branches opened around the city.\nOrganizers prioritized opening branches in communities where there were many low-income families, immigrant families and children with poor reading skills who would benefit from having access to a librarian.\nDecades ago, a membership fee of five cents helped offset costs, but that was dropped in 1968 because it created a barrier for the most underprivileged children to access the library.\nIt has been completely free ever since.\nIts one remaining branch operates\u00a0out of a large room in the Villeray\u2014Saint-Michel\u2014Parc-Extension cultural centre.\nThe library is open six days per week and Lebrasseur, 30, is one of only a handful of employees.\nWhile it looks like fundraising drives, donations\u00a0and a grant from the borough will keep this last branch open \u2014 the distance between surviving and thriving is noticeable to those involved.\nThe library's space seems secure, but it\u00a0needs more staff to help children with their reading and homework.\nLebrasseur concedes that it's not the kind of request that gets donors excited.\n\"Needing more library staff isn't 'sexy' but it's necessary,\" she said.\nLebrasseur herself took a pay cut to work there.\nWith a master's degree in library science, she would earn twice as much in the public system.\nBut if the long commute from\u00a0Verdun to Saint-Michel doesn't deter her, that won't either.\nAlong with the funds needed to hire more staff, the library is looking to get more tablets so that kids can have access to reading apps and e-books.\nIt also hopes to revamp its small theatre space, and needs filmmaking and editing equipment. Workshops at the library currently rely on Lebrasseur's personal cell phone to film content.\n"}, {"author": "Angelica Cooper", "title": "Your guide to August long weekend events in Toronto", "description": "Dance, eat and relax at events across the city", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/civic-holiday-august-long-weekend-toronto-2019-1.5232971", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4774667.1564675350!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/toronto-caribbean-parade-20180804.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 02, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-08-02T09:00:00.004Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Toronto's at the height of the\u00a0lazy, hazy days of summer, and the August long weekend presents a perfect opportunity to explore all that the city\u00a0has to offer.\nEnvironment Canada forecasts a warm weekend, with daytime temperatures hovering in the mid-20s.\nIf you haven't given much thought to your plans, CBC Toronto has you covered.\u00a0\nNo matter where you are in the city, there is sure to be an event to satisfy your curiosity.\nThe 52nd\u00a0edition of the annual Toronto Caribbean Carnival kicks off on Saturday.\u00a0The festival spans four weeks and celebrates all that the Caribbean has to offer.\nTens of thousands of people will line the streets for the Grand Parade.\u00a0The festivities begin\u00a0at 8:30 a.m. Saturday at Exhibition Place and Lakeshore Boulevard before the parade makes its\u00a0way eastbound.

Doctors initially mistook the 10-centimetre\u00a0growth on her liver for a cancerous tumour.\u00a0\nTo prevent the parasite from regrowing, Armstrong was prescribed a drug called albendazole, a common medication used to treat several tropical parasites.\u00a0While albendazole has been on the market in other countries since 1975, it is not approved in Canada.\u00a0\nArmstrong is recovering in Edmonton and receiving the tablets on a compassionate basis\u00a0from other patients' supplies, but she doesn't yet have a steady supply.\nShe has enough pills to last her until the end of February. Her doctor has applied\u00a0to the Health Canada for access to the drug through a special-access program.\nPhysicians have been frustrated by the lack of access to albendazole and other rare disease medications in Canada\u00a0for decades.\u00a0\nThe J.D.\u00a0MacLean Centre for Tropical Diseases, located at\u00a0Montreal's McGill University, must\u00a0apply for medication once a week through the federal Special Access Programme, according to associate director Dr. Brian Ward.\nIn many cases, it's for patients who need immediate access to survive, he said.\u00a0\nBecause there\u00a0are so few individuals in Canada with maladies requiring treatment with albendazole, there is no economic incentive for pharmaceutical companies to bring the drug to the Canadian market.\u00a0\nWard said it was a similar situation with ivermectin, a Nobel-prize winning drug that was inaccessible in Canada until 2018. For years, he would have to apply for the drug to treat patients who picked up a worm while walking on tropical beaches.\u00a0\n\"You have blisters and red, incredibly itchy, areas and the treatment\u00a0is simple, safe, licensed in virtually every other country in the world,\" he said.\u00a0\"But ivermectin was unavailable in Canada for decades ... not because it's a dangerous drug, but because only 25 people in Canada need it every year.\"\nIvermectin came to market in Canada eventually.\nBut not albendazole.\nWard said he convinced regulatory agencies to waive the fees for licensing albendazole, but the company that makes it, GlaxoSmithKline, couldn't justify the cost to stock it, he said.\u00a0\n\"It was an eight-year project that failed,\" Ward said. \"It still makes me really angry that it failed.\"\nIn 2019, 161 people received albendazole through the special-access program, according to Health Canada.\u00a0\nIt remains one of several medications on the World Health Organization model list of essential medicines\u00a0unavailable in Canada.\u00a0\n\"It's one of the most basic drugs for global health,\" said Adam Houston, a lawyer and PhD candidate in health law at the University of Ottawa.\u00a0\n\"When you can get better access to a drug in Zimbabwe than you do here, that says something,\" he said.\u00a0\nAdvocacy groups have called on the Canadian government to develop a rare-disease strategy. The 2019 federal budget set aside $1\u00a0billion\u00a0to establish a program by 2022, which would help people receive necessary treatment for rare disease.\u00a0\nFor now, Armstrong's\u00a0doctor will have to reapply every six months to maintain her treatment.\nShe warned that while her parasite is rare in Canada, it has\u00a0become established in Canada's wildlife population and will continue to spread to other people.\u00a0\nThe province has become a hotspot for the parasite with 15 documented human cases, and it remains difficult to diagnose with few visible symptoms until it grows to a potentially deadly size.\u00a0\n\"We need to come up with a better system,\" she said. \"There will be more cases, so we need to make access to this drug easier.\"\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "Vancouver is still in a housing crisis.

But sometimes, it's hard to get people to agree on what that meaning is.\u00a0\nTake the words \"balanced\" or \"crisis.\"\u00a0They've been used ad nauseam in the last four years in Vancouver as home prices soared to record heights, upending governments and dominating political discussion.\u00a0\nBut they aren't words with strict definitions (like \"recession\") or with legislative implications (like \"emergency\"), which gives them a certain rhetorical vagueness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"I'll continue to watch the housing trends closely but am cautiously optimistic that the housing market is returning to balance,\" tweeted Carole James\u00a0Wednesday, a day where the\u00a0benchmark price for properties overseen by the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver\u00a0dropped below a million dollars for the first time since early 2017.\u00a0\nLeft unsaid by James was what defines a \"balanced\" market.\u00a0\nOn one hand, it's a bit of an abstract debate.\u00a0On the other hand, much of the discussion while the market was skyrocketing up\u00a0was whether politicians agreed we were in a \"crisis\" or not.\nAnd\u00a0if home prices continue to fall for much longer, we'll likely be having that same conversation again.\u00a0\nAfter last week's real estate statistics\u00a0came out, showing the lowest home sales for June since 2000, we talked to a number of economists and leaders in the housing industry\u00a0and asked a simple question: when would we know Vancouver is out of a housing crisis?\u00a0\nCould it be linked to benchmark home prices or average home prices? Vacancy rates or Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) rental averages? The \"million-dollar line\" for detached homes being at Main, Commercial, or Boundary?\u00a0\nEveryone agreed Vancouver was still in a housing crisis. But nobody could put a set metric to it.\u00a0\nSimon Fraser University\u00a0economist Josh Gordon said ending the crisis isn't the same as Vancouver suddenly becoming affordable to everyone.\u00a0\n\"A return to conditions of 2014 [when home prices were around 10 to 30 per cent lower than they are now]\u00a0would represent the end of the crisis, but it wouldn't represent the\u00a0solution to all our affordability problems,\" Gordon said.\u00a0\u00a0\nA point repeated by University of British Columbia economist Tom Davidoff.\n\"No matter what government does in the long run, Vancouver is going to be an appealing place for people to work, and it's going to be a hard place to build. So affordability is always going to be a problem for government to handle,\" Davidoff said.\nMeanwhile, Central\u00a01\u00a0deputy chief economist\u00a0Bryan Yu said, \"I don't think it's a term I necessarily use because ...\u00a0I can't really define it very easily,\" while B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association CEO Jill Atkey\u00a0provided a more circuitous response.\n\"We can say we're no longer in a crisis when people are no longer experiencing a crisis within the housing system,\" she said.\u00a0\nFun fact of the day: average price of a Greater Vancouver house has increased as much in the past six months as it did from 1980 to 2006.\nEven though the monthly sales statistics are a main\u00a0barometer for talking about the housing market, those surveyed said there are better places to look for determining how much of a crisis the market is in.\u00a0\n\"The rental market is where the affordability issue is most critical,\u00a0because of course low-income people struggle the most with affordability, and they're most prone to be renters rather than owners,\" said Davidoff.\u00a0\nAtkey agreed, and said that while vacancy rates remain low, changes could be on the way, as governments at all three levels have been building rental stock and affordable housing at levels not seen in decades.\u00a0\n\"With every crisis there's a turning point. And I think what's interesting and and in some ways unique here in B.C. is that we are very much at that turning point and the stars are aligning,\" she said.\u00a0\nBut she's hopeful that the end of the crisis\u00a0\u2014 whenever that comes\u00a0\u2014 doesn't mean an end to current government funding and incentives for below-market housing.\u00a0\n\"Once we have it solved I'm really really hoping that we've got enough collective memory to prevent ourselves from getting back here again,\" she said.\u00a0\nAs for James?

You just smear paper around on your butt and then and then you just go walking around like that?'\"\nHardisty said it's hard something like a bidet to catch on, because private bathrooms are not visible to many people. Nor are bidets appropriate conversation topics for cocktail parties.\u00a0\n\"With any kind of new innovation or change, one of the big factors is how observable it is,\"\u00a0he said.\u00a0\nHardisty hopes Canadians do warm to the bidet, at least for the sake of the environment.\u00a0\nWhile single-use plastics have been more-or-less socially blacklisted, there's been comparatively little discussion about the impacts of toilet paper, which can contain up to 40 per cent virgin fiber pulp from Canada's boreal forest.\u00a0\n\"The production of pulp, the foundational ingredient\u00a0of tissue products, is a substantial driver of logging in\u00a0the Canadian boreal forest,\" said a\u00a02019 report by the environmental non-profit Natural Resources Defence Council. \"Virgin pulp accounts for 23\u00a0per cent of Canada's forest product exports.\"\nAccording to the report, the average American uses 141 rolls of toilet paper annually.\u00a0In France, believed to the the birthplace of the bidet, people use half as much. The report didn't have statistics for Canada.\u00a0\nBidet users generally use less or no toilet paper, depending on personal preference.\u00a0\nBidet\u00a0devices come in many forms. In Europe, the bidet might be a\u00a0porcelain bowl installed next to a toilet. In Japan, the bidet-toilet combination might\u00a0have multiple washing and drying settings\u00a0and even the choice of music for added privacy.\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the simple hand-held hose\u00a0or the systems that attach\u00a0to a toilet seat. All\u00a0draw\u00a0clean water from the same pipe as the faucet.\u00a0\nHome Hardware sells three bidet products, ranging\u00a0from $63 for a hose attachment, to more than $600 for a seat with various nozzle positions and other bells and whistles.\nMegan Manion, who manages\u00a0plumbing at the store's\u00a0Whitehorse location, said\u00a0there's so little interest in these products \u2014 they don't even stock them.\n\"We have ordered bidets in the past but it's\u00a0nowhere near popular,\" she said, noting that Whitehorse is usually about five years behind the rest of the country in buying trends.\u00a0\nWhile bidets may be slow to come to the North and the rest of Canada, they appear to be gaining traction in the United States, according to one company.\nMiki\u00a0Agrawal\u00a0of Tushy, which makes toilet seat attachments, said her company has seen exponential growth\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0since she founded the company in 2015. Agrawal said less than 10 per cent of Tushy's sales come from Canada, but she is working to secure a warehouse on this side of the border and expand into the market.\u00a0\nAgrawal's main argument for using the bidet is simple: \"Why have we been indoctrinated to believe that ... dry paper properly cleans the dirtiest part of our body? The bidet is just an obvious 'duh' choice.\"\u00a0\nThose who use bidets tend to agree.\u00a0\n\"I couldn't live without it,\" said Josie St. Amour, who lives in Montreal. She bought a Tushy product two years ago, after being introduced to bidets on a trip to Europe.\n\"I'm surprised that nobody uses them on our side of the world.\"\nHer advice for first time users? Go easy on the water pressure.\n\"Don't put it in full force otherwise you'd be surprised, just like my son did the first time,\" she laughed.\u00a0\nAlthough St. Amour said she doesn't think she uses much less toilet paper before, Omar Zitoun said he uses none. He lives in London, Ont., but grew up in Egypt and the Middle East, and has always had a bidet in his home.\u00a0\nHe said people who use toilet paper are flushing money down the drain.\n\"People spend crazy amounts of money on toilet paper.\"\u00a0\nThat's a hard point to argue.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Sidney Cohen", "title": "'We are not in a crisis': New N.W.T. government delivers $1.9B budget", "description": "Fiscal situation is 'not what was hoped in the last budget but it is manageable,' says finance minister", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/19th-legislative-assembly-first-budget-1.5475739", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5475778.1583192022!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/caroline-wawzonek.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Feb 25, 2020 3:54 PM CT", "2020-02-28T21:31:31.452Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Northwest Territories government proposes to spend $1.9 billion on operational costs in the next fiscal year, but little new funding has been allocated in key areas said to be in crisis by several residents, advocates and front-line government workers.\nThe proposed budget includes no major spending increases in the Child and Family Services division or Education, and a decrease in spending on the NWT\u00a0Housing Corporation.\nAhead of her budget speech, Finance Minister Caroline Wawzonek told reporters the money that is being spent in these areas are amounts that departments need in order run existing programs. It's \"not reflective, necessarily\" of the government's 22 new mandate priorities, she said.\u00a0\nAccording to this budget, the government plans to spend $25 million on its mandate goals over the next three and a half years of this Legislative Assembly, $10 million of which it proposes spending in the upcoming fiscal year.\u00a0\n\"Anyone in government is going to sit here and say we'd always like to have more money,\" said Wawzonek, adding that it's what government does with the money it has that matters.\u00a0\n\"The Northwest Territories economy is stable, but it is not growing,\" Wawzonek said in her budget speech on Tuesday afternoon.\nWith that in mind, the government is proposing to spend $1.983 billion on operational costs in the 2020-21 fiscal year, up from the $1.87 billion it pitched to spend in the year prior. Meanwhile, it's projecting to make about $2.186 billion in revenues.\nThough the government expects to bring in about $203 million more than it will spend on delivering programs and services in the next fiscal year, this doesn't mean it's sitting on a pile of extra cash.\nThat operating surplus will be put toward the $398.6-million capital budget, which has already been approved by the assembly.\nThis leaves the government with a cash deficit of $195.6 million \u2014 money it will have to borrow, pushing the territory closer to its federally-imposed borrowing limit.\nThe government estimates its borrowing will reach nearly $1.2 billion in 2020-21. The debt cap is set at $1.3 billion.\u00a0\nFinance officials said on Tuesday that the government is in talks with the federal government about raising the borrowing limit, which last went up in 2015.\u00a0\n\"Our immediate fiscal situation is not what was hoped in the last budget but it is manageable,\" Wawzonek told the legislative assembly.\n\"We are not in a crisis.\"\nThere are no new taxes in the 2020-21\u00a0budget, but finance officials said property tax mill rates in the smaller communities that don't collect their own property taxes, and in \"the hinterland\" which includes the diamond mines, as well as some fees, will rise with inflation on April 1.\nThe vast majority of the government's revenues \u2014 82 per cent \u2014 is expected to come from the federal government. This includes a $1.4-billion territorial formula financing payment, which is meant to help the territorial government administer programs and services comparable to those in the provinces.\nAs was always the plan, the carbon tax will rise to $30 per carbon-equivalent tonne of greenhouse gas emissions on July 1, with plans to return a majority of that money through rebates\u00a0to residents and businesses.\nNotably, the government raised just $317,000 from the cannabis excise tax in 2019-20, less than half of what it initially projected. This coming year, it expects to bring in $331,000 from cannabis sales.\u00a0\nThe government also estimates it will get about $33 million in royalties and fees from mining and oil and gas operations. This is down about $6 million from 2019-20 estimates.\u00a0\nFinance officials said the decrease is due in part to market conditions, and to discrepancies in forecasting by the companies themselves.\u00a0\u00a0\nThose looking for major changes in the areas of education, child and family services or housing, won't find them in this budget.\nDespite public and internal outcry over a Child and Family Services division in which staff say they are overworked and under-resourced, the government proposes increasing the division's budget by just $280,000 from the year before.\nEarlier this month, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment was subject to a critical review of the Auditor General of Canada, in which it was called out for not providing all students in the territory equal access to quality education.\nIt's unclear whether any changes were made to this budget as a result, but the budget does propose $604,000 to bring the Northern Distance Learning program \u2014 in which students take courses that aren't offered in their own schools via video conferencing \u2014 to five more schools.\nThere is also $129,000 to expand \"northern studies curricula.\"\nTo the NWT\u00a0Housing Corporation, the government is planning to contribute about $2 million less than it did in the previous fiscal year.

Wages were boosted by a $7.2 billion adjustment to account for General Motors strike pay and payments associated with a new contract for members of the United Automobile Workers union.\nWith spending outpacing income growth, savings fell to $1.29 trillion from $1.34 trillion in September.\nOrders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 1.2 per cent last month, the largest gain since January, after falling 0.5 per cent in September. These so-called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery, computers and electronic products and fabricated metals.\nEconomists had forecast core capital goods orders would drop 0.3 per cent in October. Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.8 per cent last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.\nCore capital goods shipments fell 0.8 per cent in September.\nBusiness investment dropped at a 2.7 per cent rate in the third quarter, rather than contracting at a 3.0 per cent pace as previously reported. The declines in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells, were not as steep as previously estimated.\nA report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Nov. 23. Claims had been stuck at a five-month high over the previous two weeks, pointing to some easing in the labor market.\nStill, the labour market remains on solid footing, helping to underpin consumer spending. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was unrevised at a 2.9 per cent rate in the third quarter.\n"}, {"author": "Alex Migdal", "title": "B.C. seniors face up to 2-month wait for more effective flu vaccine", "description": "Fluzone High-Dose vaccine produces a stronger immune response in seniors who are vulnerable to the flu", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/high-dose-flu-vaccine-supply-1.5313848", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4471196.1514991590!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/spain.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 09, 2019 3:00 AM PT", "2019-10-09T10:00:00.897Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Seniors in B.C. will have to wait longer for a flu vaccine that offers them better protection, because the province doesn't cover the vaccine, according to the vaccine's manufacturer.\nThe Fluzone High-Dose vaccine isn't expected to land on shelves in B.C. until the end of November or early December, the B.C.

The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced a second death, a\u00a069-year-old man, on Thursday.\u00a0He\u00a0became ill on Dec. 31, 2019.\nThe outbreak comes just ahead of the lunar new year when many Chinese travel. Officials say the virus is not considered highly contagious.\nGiven that there's a\u00a0small number of cases, it is hard to be definitive, cautioned Dr. Allison McGeer, a clinician scientist in infectious diseases at Sinai Health in Toronto.\u00a0\n\"It looks like this virus is less severe than MERS and SARS, which is a good thing,\" McGeer said of other coronavirus infections, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. \"It's also a situation of the virus itself may be changing, so it's really too early to be confident about what the disease looks like.\"\nDr. Issac Bogoch is an infectious disease physician at Toronto Western Hospital who is tracking and predicting the spread of the new coronavirus\u00a0based on factors such as travel volumes from Wuhan.\u00a0\n\"It's extremely important that we be wary of infections acquired from distant lands that might land on our doorstep,\" Bogoch said. \"We should have systems in place that will facilitate the rapid identification and management of imported infections.\"\nTo that end, German researchers said Thursday\u00a0they have developed the first diagnostic test for a new virus that has emerged in central China.\nThe virus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year and cases have since also been reported in Thailand.\nDr. Christian Drosten, the director of the Institute for Virology at Berlin's Charite hospital, said the test developed by his team will allow labs to reliably diagnose the so-called novel coronavirus \"in a very short period of time.\"\nThe test protocol is being made available through the World Health Organization, and laboratories can order a molecule from the German team to compare patient samples with a positive control, he said.\n\"We have just started receiving orders and are now starting to post the molecule,\" Drosten told The Associated Press.\nSo far, doctors have only been able to perform a general virus test and then had to sequence and interpret the genome, said Drosten. Large, well-equipped public laboratories are able to do this but smaller labs would struggle to do so, he added.\n\"We're more concerned about labs in countries where it's not that easy to transport samples or staff aren't trained that thoroughly, or if there is a large number of patients who have to be tested,\" said Drosten, citing the epidemic of SARS, which killed hundreds in 2002 and 2003.\nDrosten, who was one of the co-discoverers of SARS, said the two viruses are so closely related that laboratories which have control samples for SARS in stock can use it to diagnose the new virus, cutting the time required to create a functioning test.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said the Chinese gene sequencing will allow Canadian scientists to develop diagnostic tests for the\u00a0novel coronavirus.\nThe agency has issued a\u00a0Travel Health Notice\u00a0for individuals travelling to and returning from China, including recommendations for travellers to Wuhan, such as avoid\u00a0farms, live animal markets, and areas where animals may be slaughtered.\u00a0\nCanadians should always tell their health-care providers about their travel if they become ill after returning.\u00a0\n\"The possibility of cases being identified in other countries, including Canada, would not be unexpected given global travel trends,\" a PHAC spokesperson said in an emailed response to questions.\nSurveillance systems are on alert and precautions such as routine infection and prevention control at hospitals as well as routine traveller screening at Canadian ports of entry are in place, the agency added.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Terry Roberts", "title": "New Halifax-Argentia weekly marine cargo service to launch on Friday", "description": "Dartmouth company TMSI to compete with Oceanex, Marine Atlantic", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/marine-cargo-argentia-1.5314461", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5314780.1570637466!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/nolhan-ava-tmsi.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 09, 2019 4:15 PM NT", "2019-10-09T18:50:16.568Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A Nova Scotia company says it plans to begin a new Halifax-to-Argentia marine cargo service on Friday, adding another option for those wanting to ship goods to and from Newfoundland.\nBut industry insiders are quietly skeptical that a new service is viable.\nThe private Darmouth-based company is called TMSI Ltd., and will operate a 120-metre vessel called the Nolhan Ava, which has\u00a0the capacity to carry more than 400, 20-foot equivalent unit containers, which are referred to as\u00a0TEUs.\nThe vessel will make its first commercial run Friday, with plans to arrive in Placentia Bay on Sunday.\nSome of those behind the venture are also involved with a separate cargo service between Halifax and St-Pierre-Miquelon, on Newfoundland's south coast, and see an opportunity to expand.\n\"We had been approached before by various customers and interested parties to have another service into Newfoundland.

She is caring for her seven-year-old son while her husband recovers from a workplace injury. If she doesn't come up with rent by the second week of April, she says her landlord will issue an eviction notice.\u00a0\nOn top of that, the landlord is raising rent by $400 a month on their northeast Edmonton home starting in June, she said.\u00a0\n\"I have to choose between going out and finding a new place \u2026 or waiting until we're forced out. Both of those things put us at risk for contracting COVID-19,\" she said.\n\"I'm asking Jason Kenney to help us feel safe. Protect the renters. We're begging you.\"\u00a0\nStone and two other tenants joined an NDP news conference Tuesday morning, where Opposition Leader Rachel Notley called on the government to ban eviction orders during the public health emergency.\nOntario, Quebec and Nova Scotia are among the provinces to either freeze orders or suspend eviction hearings.\u00a0\nIn Alberta, the government has yet to announce any specific protections for over 400,000 households that pay rent, including roughly 120,000 in Edmonton.\u00a0\nIn the absence of legislated protections during the outbreak, the Alberta government has said renters can look for relief from compassionate landlords, while noting it could take several weeks before eviction notices\u00a0are adjudicated by a provincial tribunal.\u00a0\nPremier Jason Kenney said the government is considering a short term stay on eviction enforcement, but offered no immediate plan at a news conference on Monday.\nLandlords must be able to protect their property value from bad tenants, he said, but they should also extend relief wherever possible.\u00a0\n\"It makes no economic sense for them to evict tenants for missing April rent given the effective shutdown of our economy because who else is going to fill those units,\" Kenney said. \u00a0\nThe Premier asked landlords who benefit from mortgage payment and property tax deferrals to pass those savings on to tenants.\nThe Alberta Residential Landlord Association, which represents over 75,000 rental units in the province urged its members to suspend eviction during the crisis in a statement posted to its website Friday.\nWhen asked whether rental giant Boardwalk supports a suspension on eviction orders during the pandemic, as other provincial governments have done, a spokesperson said, \"100 per cent we support exactly that.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \"In fact, our company has talked with other housing providers in other regions precisely about that point,\" said Boyd Belisle, director of community and corporate culture, in an interview with CBC News Monday.\u00a0\nBelisle said the company's only requirement would be to ensure there is recourse against illegal activity or activities that jeopardized health and safety.\u00a0\nBut CEO Sam Kolias walked back that statement on Wednesday. Boardwalk does not support a government imposed eviction suspension, he said in an interview with CBC News.\u00a0\n\"We fully support the Premier's position on leaving the tribunals and access to our legal system open to maintain law and order and peaceful enjoyment,\" Kolias said.\u00a0\nThe company, Kolias said, would work with every tenant facing financial hardship during the pandemic on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0\n\"We believe self-regulation is much better than government regulation,\" he said.\nBut it's not enough to rely on the goodwill of landlords during a crisis, says Sarah Eadie, a staff lawyer at the Edmonton Community Legal Centre.\u00a0\n\"It's a disaster waiting to happen,\" she said.\u00a0\nWhile the vast majority of tenants can fight eviction notices before a provincial tribunal, others cannot, Eadie said. Renters who live in the same unit as their landlord or people who live in mobile home parks, for example, are not covered by provincial tenancy law.\u00a0\n\"Now is the time that the government needs to step in and protect citizens because the open market is not going to work here,\" she said.\u00a0\nDemands for more aggressive tenant protections, beyond banning eviction orders, have swelled in recent days. Over 600,000 people have signed an online petition calling on the federal government to cancel rent and mortgage payments.\u00a0\nA Facebook group for Edmonton renters to share legal resources and support tenants facing evictions has gathered more than 200 members since Saturday. The page's co-administrator Kay Del Rio says renters are frustrated as they watch political leaders urge big banks to defer mortgage payments for property owners without any protections extended to tenants.\u00a0\n\"The best thing the government can do is to increase rent protections right now,\" Del Rio said.\u00a0\nACORN Canada, a national advocacy organization for low-income families, also called on the federal government last week to suspend rent payments. Supporters say it's not enough to put off eviction orders until after the crisis, without regard for whether a tenant will have the means to pay arrears.\u00a0\nPremier Kenney shot down those suggestions on Monday. He said barring landlords from collecting rent during the pandemic could collapse the province's housing stock.\u00a0\nIn addition to an eviction ban, Notley said the province should consider income top-up measures to supplement federal benefits such as EI, which covers 55 per cent of a person's insurable wage, to ensure tenants can keep up with payments.\nThe province announced it will offer a one-time payment of $1,146 to bridge the gap until federal benefits arrive in April, although applications have not yet opened. Residents can also defer utility payments for 90 days, while Alberta student loan repayment has been paused for six months.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Fed chair sees North America as an economic oasis in 2020: Don Pittis", "description": "Solidifying our trade link with the U.S. means optimism could spread north next year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fed-economy-future-1.5391444", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5393240.1576103971!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-fed.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 12, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-12T09:00:00.793Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A positive outlook for the North American economy means the U.S. Fed has largely taken rate cuts off the table in 2020.\u00a0But for Canadians looking for new mortgages and renewals, the good news is that rate hikes are unlikely, too.\nAs usual, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell added the proviso that the central bank would not hesitate to stimulate the economy again if the U.S. were to be hit by an unpleasant economic\u00a0surprise.\u00a0\nBut unlike U.S. President Donald Trump and many market commentators,\u00a0Powell and his advisers foresee no need for more interest rate cuts in the coming year.

But one of the most successful New Democrats at the provincial level feels alienated by that position - so you can imagine how a lot of non-New Democrats in the province feel.\nNotley wasn't alone in taking aim at federal parties over the election's result. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe came out swinging the morning after; both wrote letters telling the prime minister to drop the federal carbon tax, for a start.\nI don't own a crystal ball, but I'd bet my nicest purse that Justin Trudeau won't do that. More people voted for parties in favour of the carbon tax than voted for the parties opposed to it.\nIs there something else Trudeau and his government could do to calm the waters? His post-election press conference offered a hint. He was firm about moving ahead with the TMX expansion, placing more emphasis on it than he had during the campaign. The pipeline expansion still faces court challenges, but it looks like it has an ally in the federal government. But it might not be enough.\nAlberta and Saskatchewan have premiers who are ideologically opposed to Justin Trudeau. So are a lot of the people they represent. I'm not saying it's right or wrong - but the name 'Trudeau' carries a lot of baggage, especially in Alberta (I'll take 'National Energy Program' for a thousand, Alex). I honestly don't know that building ten pipelines under a Trudeau government would make a lot of difference.\nQuebecers also felt their interests were under siege in this election - which explains why the Bloc is back in a big way. The party's leader knows he has leverage in the new Parliament, but says he wants it to last.\n\"The responsibility of the prime minister and the Liberal Party is to make this Parliament work,\" Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet said. \"There is a law that says the mandates are supposed to last four years and (the Liberals) should do what it takes, in complete respect of the decisions of Canadians and Quebecers, to make this work.\"\nThe Liberals are still represented in Quebec; in fact, they won the popular vote there. So re-building bridges in that province likely won't be difficult.\nAlberta and Saskatchewan are a different story. I don't know exactly what could be done to temper their anger. I just know there's a lot riding on it.\nVassy Kapelos is host of Power & Politics, weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on CBC News Network.\nAfter 29 issues focused on the federal election, our weekly newsletter is undergoing some changes.\nNow that the campaign itself is over, we're changing our focus to the election's aftermath. How will Justin Trudeau govern without a majority? How might rising regional tensions affect the federal political scene? And what does the future hold for each of the political parties and their leaders?\nThose are just some of the questions we'll be tracking in the new version of this weekly bulletin.

L\u00e2che pas!\n\u00c9ric Grenier, CBC Polls Analyst\nAfter 40 long days, it is finally time to put the Poll Tracker to bed.\nFor now.\nWhen will it be back?\nIf Justin Trudeau's government is not defeated in the House of Commons, and if the prime minister doesn't pull the plug himself, the next election will take place on Oct. 16, 2023.\nHistory suggests we won't have to wait that long.\nThe average time between elections in minority Parliaments has been 692 days, or about 23 months. It has averaged 653 days since the 1950s, when minority governments became more common.\nThat would put the next election around August 2021.\nBut the length of time between elections can vary greatly. The governments elected in 1957, 1962 and 1979 each lasted for less than a year, while those elected in 1963, 1965, 2006 and 2008 lasted for more than two and a half years.\nOnly one lasted a full four years: Mackenzie King's Liberal government elected in 1926, which survived with the support of the Liberal-Progressives. All the others were cut short, either by defeat in Parliament or by choice.\nShort-duration minority governments tended to be followed by the defeat of the party in power. Longer-lived ones were more likely to be re-elected.\nSo maybe the Liberals have an interest in making this Parliament last as long as possible. That's not a foolproof strategy, though. After governing for four years in a minority Parliament, King was defeated in 1930 when the country was in the early stages of the Great Depression.\nHad he gone to the polls before the stock market crash in 1929, maybe he would have been re-elected. But then he would have borne much of the blame for the ravages of the Depression, which could have ended his political career in the early 1930s. Instead, he returned to power in 1935 and led the country through the Second World War.\nIn politics, timing can be everything. So keep an eye on that calendar and we'll keep the Poll Tracker at the ready, just in case.\nHouse of Commons offers defeated MPs up to $15K for career help, tuition\nWhile dozens of incumbents who weren't re-elected in Monday night's federal election are still taking stock of their losses, they can take some comfort in the House of Commons transition program.

She is caring for her seven-year-old son while her husband recovers from a workplace injury.

Both of those things put us at risk for contracting COVID-19,\" she said.\n\"I'm asking Jason Kenney to help us feel safe. Protect the renters. We're begging you.\"\u00a0\nStone and two other tenants joined an NDP news conference Tuesday morning, where Opposition Leader Rachel Notley called on the government to ban eviction orders during the public health emergency.\nOntario, Quebec and Nova Scotia are among the provinces to either freeze orders or suspend eviction hearings.\u00a0\nIn Alberta, the government has yet to announce any specific protections for over 400,000 households that pay rent, including roughly 120,000 in Edmonton.\u00a0\nIn the absence of legislated protections during the outbreak, the Alberta government has said renters can look for relief from compassionate landlords, while noting it could take several weeks before eviction notices\u00a0are adjudicated by a provincial tribunal.\u00a0\nPremier Jason Kenney said the government is considering a short term stay on eviction enforcement, but offered no immediate plan at a news conference on Monday.\nLandlords must be able to protect their property value from bad tenants, he said, but they should also extend relief wherever possible.\u00a0\n\"It makes no economic sense for them to evict tenants for missing April rent given the effective shutdown of our economy because who else is going to fill those units,\" Kenney said. \u00a0\nThe Premier asked landlords who benefit from mortgage payment and property tax deferrals to pass those savings on to tenants.\nThe Alberta Residential Landlord Association, which represents over 75,000 rental units in the province urged its members to suspend eviction during the crisis in a statement posted to its website Friday.\nWhen asked whether rental giant Boardwalk supports a suspension on eviction orders during the pandemic, as other provincial governments have done, a spokesperson said, \"100 per cent we support exactly that.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \"In fact, our company has talked with other housing providers in other regions precisely about that point,\" said Boyd Belisle, director of community and corporate culture, in an interview with CBC News Monday.\u00a0\nBelisle said the company's only requirement would be to ensure there is recourse against illegal activity or activities that jeopardized health and safety.\u00a0\nBut CEO Sam Kolias walked back that statement on Wednesday. Boardwalk does not support a government imposed eviction suspension, he said in an interview with CBC News.\u00a0\n\"We fully support the Premier's position on leaving the tribunals and access to our legal system open to maintain law and order and peaceful enjoyment,\" Kolias said.\u00a0\nThe company, Kolias said, would work with every tenant facing financial hardship during the pandemic on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0\n\"We believe self-regulation is much better than government regulation,\" he said.\nBut it's not enough to rely on the goodwill of landlords during a crisis, says Sarah Eadie, a staff lawyer at the Edmonton Community Legal Centre.\u00a0\n\"It's a disaster waiting to happen,\" she said.\u00a0\nWhile the vast majority of tenants can fight eviction notices before a provincial tribunal, others cannot, Eadie said. Renters who live in the same unit as their landlord or people who live in mobile home parks, for example, are not covered by provincial tenancy law.\u00a0\n\"Now is the time that the government needs to step in and protect citizens because the open market is not going to work here,\" she said.\u00a0\nDemands for more aggressive tenant protections, beyond banning eviction orders, have swelled in recent days. Over 600,000 people have signed an online petition calling on the federal government to cancel rent and mortgage payments.\u00a0\nA Facebook group for Edmonton renters to share legal resources and support tenants facing evictions has gathered more than 200 members since Saturday. The page's co-administrator Kay Del Rio says renters are frustrated as they watch political leaders urge big banks to defer mortgage payments for property owners without any protections extended to tenants.\u00a0\n\"The best thing the government can do is to increase rent protections right now,\" Del Rio said.\u00a0\nACORN Canada, a national advocacy organization for low-income families, also called on the federal government last week to suspend rent payments. Supporters say it's not enough to put off eviction orders until after the crisis, without regard for whether a tenant will have the means to pay arrears.\u00a0\nPremier Kenney shot down those suggestions on Monday. He said barring landlords from collecting rent during the pandemic could collapse the province's housing stock.\u00a0\nIn addition to an eviction ban, Notley said the province should consider income top-up measures to supplement federal benefits such as EI, which covers 55 per cent of a person's insurable wage, to ensure tenants can keep up with payments.\nThe province announced it will offer a one-time payment of $1,146 to bridge the gap until federal benefits arrive in April, although applications have not yet opened. Residents can also defer utility payments for 90 days, while Alberta student loan repayment has been paused for six months.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The battle to keep this country together will be harder in some provinces than others", "description": "The Canada Votes newsletter has been your tip-sheet for the 2019 federal election.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-votes-newsletter-issue29-keep-country-together-provinces-1.5336390", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5335930.1572030641!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-trudeau-20191023.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 27, 2019 8:00 AM ET", "2019-10-27T12:00:00.515Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Vassy Kapelos, host of Power & Politics\nWhen you look at a map showing how the various regions of our country voted, the colours tell a story that's impossible to miss.\nBright red in the middle, a solid swath of bright blue to the left, a lighter blue covering much of Quebec.\nHas the map looked that way before?

But Mar said it's just opening the project up to further scrutiny.\n\"It remains to be seen whether they'll have the commitment necessary to make sure that this project goes through to completion,\"\u00a0Mar\u00a0said. \"I won't be optimistic until I see it constructed.\"\nOne group says it's not as monumental a decision as it may seem, as both tanker traffic and approvals for major oil and gas projects could be impacted by two bills, C-48 and C-69, that are likely to be approved this week.\u00a0\nThe Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors says the decision to OK Trans Mountain is trivial in light of that pending legislation.\n\"This industry is on life support.

Effectively, Powell\u00a0said, after successive cuts totalling\u00a0three-quarters of a per cent, the central bank will now sit tight and wait for the effect of that stimulus to kick in.\u00a0\n\"One thing that we're mindful of is that we've cut rates three times since July,\" Powell told a gathering of reporters at yesterday's\u00a0monetary policy news conference. \"And we do believe that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and that it will take some time before the full effects of those actions are seen in the economy.\"\nPrevious research has shown that while rate cuts have an immediate impact on stock and bond markets, their stimulus effect can take six months to\u00a0a year to work their way into the wider economy. And like\u00a0cannabis edibles, you don't want to have too many before you've seen the effect.\nThe group of bankers who participate in making the interest rate decision were not only confident in their outlook, dropping the word \"uncertainties\" from their statement, but in agreement, approving the policy unanimously.\nOne of the uncertainties that seems to be off the table is the North American trade agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico\u00a0\u2014\u00a0now revised with the support of Democrats\u00a0\u2014\u00a0into what some are now calling\u00a0NAFTA 2.1.\nThe final resolution of that agreement, which is expected to be ratified by Congress in the new year, secures Canada's close integration with what Powell sees as a strengthening U.S. economy.\nWhile the percentage of Canadian jobless rose in the latest November figures, that could change if an apparent worker shortage in the U.S. continues to disseminate north across the border.\nU.S. unemployment figures fell to 3.5 per cent the last time around and wage growth was well above inflation. As one report noted, the rate of wage increases\u00a0outpaced the mortgage rate for the first time since 1972.\u00a0\nPowell expects unemployment to stay low and wage growth to stay relatively high.\nQuestioned as to why the low jobless rate and rising wages had not pushed inflation back up to the central bank's target of two\u00a0per cent, Powell noted the weakening relationship between\u00a0falling unemployment and rising inflation. He also seemed to say the official unemployment rate was an imperfect measure of how many workers were available to be enticed into the U.S. labour force.\n\"Even though we're at 3\u00bd\u00a0per cent unemployment, there's actually more slack out there,\" said Powell, noting that the risk of keeping rates low to draw more people into the workforce is not something to be feared.\nIn fact, Powell once again said that a lack of inflation was a greater risk. In a circular phenomenon, he said, persistently low inflation led to low inflationary expectations, which led to lower inflation, and thus lower interest rates.\nAnd persistently low rates make it impossible to stimulate the economy with cuts once a downturn comes.\u00a0\nPowell hopes to break that cycle.\nAs noted previously, Canada has a relatively healthy rate of inflation, though the statistics for calculating the Canadian core rate are different than\u00a0those used by the Fed.\nBut one of the reasons sometimes given for Canada's higher inflation rate is that poorer people get a bigger slice of the income pie, meaning they spend instead of saving, helping to push prices higher.\nFor Canadian homeowners or those looking to buy, the prospect of\u00a0U.S. interest rates remaining low may be reassuring, because no matter what the Bank of Canada does, five-year mortgage rates are heavily influenced by the U.S. central bank rate.\nTrump may be disappointed that Powell did not add more stimulus, but the 2020 election may tie Powell's hands even further. By tradition, central bankers avoid hiking or cutting in the immediate run-up to an election on the grounds that they do not want to be seen as interfering in politics by boosting or weakening the economy in a way that may offer one party advantage.\nPowell noted the positive effects of a North American trade deal in reducing investment uncertainty. He also\u00a0implied that the greater danger for the U.S. economy was not the resolution of NAFTA 2.1, but\u00a0the much more dangerous dispute between the biggest\u00a0global trading powers:\u00a0China and the U.S.\nAnd the fact is that\u00a0while it is reassuring that the team formulating yesterday's outlook were both unanimous and moderately optimistic, it is useful\u00a0to recall that a year ago,\u00a0the Fed got things quite wrong,\u00a0as Powell described in his look-back at events of 2019, when it was forced to bail out an unexpectedly weak economy.\n\"Rather than modestly increasing the target rate for the\u00a0federal funds rate this year, as\u00a0seemed appropriate a year ago, we reduced it by three-quarters of a percentage point,\" he said.\nWhile it may not have been intended that way, the description was a salutary reminder that no one\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not even the U.S. Federal Reserve\u00a0\u2014 can reliably predict the economic future.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The battle to keep this country together will be harder in some provinces than others", "description": "The Canada Votes newsletter has been your tip-sheet for the 2019 federal election.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-votes-newsletter-issue29-keep-country-together-provinces-1.5336390", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5335930.1572030641!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-trudeau-20191023.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 27, 2019 8:00 AM ET", "2019-10-27T12:00:00.515Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Vassy Kapelos, host of Power & Politics\nWhen you look at a map showing how the various regions of our country voted, the colours tell a story that's impossible to miss.\nBright red in the middle, a solid swath of bright blue to the left, a lighter blue covering much of Quebec.\nHas the map looked that way before?

Things got so busy she had to shut down her website for a week to catch up with orders.\nAfter three decades\u00a0producing organic vegetable and flower seeds, Kryger was hoping to retire after this year. But instead of winding things down, she's dealing with three to four times the usual demand, all thanks to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"I could close today and\u00a0have enough for my whole year of living,\" she said. \"People say they're scared they won't have enough food.

That's an issue when it comes to certain vegetables such as broccoli, kale and beets, which require two years to produce their own seeds.\u00a0\n\"There might be some shortages over the next couple of years in some things, depending on what decisions companies made. Those conversations will be happening,\" Rothermel\u00a0said.\nKitchen Table Seeds has also been fielding more questions than usual from beginner gardeners, she said. In response, some Kingston-area master gardeners have started a new online resource for aspiring green thumbs.\n\"There's been some articles that say seeds are the new TP,\" joked Rothermel, referring to the hoarding of toilet paper that was occurring earlier in the pandemic.\n\u00a0\nManish Kushwaha said\u00a0he's getting another shipment of seeds soon to keep up with his orders at Ottawa's Gaia Organics. But he's also worried about what this explosion in popularity means for the long-term seed supply.\n\"This pandemic is a serious test of our seed supply chain. With all honesty, seed companies weren't pandemic-ready, and we have to take a very serious look and discuss what system can be put in place\u00a0so we are better equipped to handle this sort of demand next time,\" he warned.\nIt's a concern Moe Garahan shares, noting that much of Canada's seed supply comes from elsewhere.\n\"So when there is an issue in other countries that we buy from, whether a climate issue, warfare or pandemic, it reduces access to seed that Canadians have relied on,\" said Garahan, who leads Just Food, a local non-profit focused on farming and food security.\nIt's added several virtual workshops on how to plant and grow your garden, expanding into Spanish, Arabic and Mandarin-language webinars.\nIt also runs a local seed library, preserving seeds produced by households and non-profits across the city. This year, it's expanding those efforts, purchasing thousands of seeds that will be sent out through school boards and community gardens.\nPeople are asked to plant them, save the seeds, and send them back at the end of the season.\n\"We'll also be putting out videos to instruct people on how to save their own seeds, to assist with the demand which we expect will continue to rise for the next years,\" Garahan\u00a0said.\nFor Wallenburg, this\u00a0sudden interest in vegetable gardening is an\u00a0unexpected\u00a0upside to the current crisis.\n\"If that's what comes of this time \u2014\u00a0people taking more of an interest in where their food comes from and growing it, too\u00a0\u2014 I\u00a0think that's great, honestly.\"\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "Housing group wants city to license landlords", "description": "Renters, neighbours, landlords asked to fill out survey by Sept. 4.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-rental-accommodation-study-survey-1.5261705", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3348795.1449156434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/refugee-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 29, 2019 9:01 AM ET", "2019-08-29T13:02:52.361Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "An advocacy group for low-income tenants is urging the City of Ottawa\u00a0to crack down on shabby living conditions by licensing landlords, but landlords say that will just worsen the capital's rental housing crunch.\nThe city plans to come up with\u00a0new\u00a0rules this fall that could affect all\u00a0private\u00a0rental properties, from traditional apartments and rooming houses to student housing and short-term rentals like Airbnb.\nMembers of the advocacy group Acorn Ottawa have been going to public meetings to argue people shouldn't have to live with bed bugs, cockroaches or unresponsive landlords.\nAcorn's\u00a0solution is to license all landlords who own more than three units, and subject them to regular city\u00a0inspections.\n\"Bad landlords don't exist in just one area, or a couple of areas. They're throughout the city,\" said Acorn's Blaine Cameron.\nBut the Eastern Ontario Landlords Organization\u00a0says\u00a0the city simply needs to better enforce the bylaws it already has,\u00a0and target the\u00a0few problematic buildings for which it regularly gets\u00a0noise and property\u00a0complaints.\n\"Let's address those problems. Let's not bring in all kinds of regulations and\u00a0all kinds of cost and bother to the 95 per cent of landlords who behave\u00a0well and are maintaining their buildings well,\" said its chair John Dickie.\nBroad licensing\u00a0of landlords would be counterproductive, he added.\n\"It would discourage people from renting out units, which at this point, that's the last thing that should be done,\" said Dickie.\nAn\u00a0analysis of the rental market for the City of Ottawa describes how rents rose\u00a0sharply between 2016 and 2018, and the 1,123\u00a0new units that came on the market in that time couldn't keep up with 5,388 more renters.\nThe affordability\u00a0and supply of rental housing are\u00a0big issues but are more likely to be dealt with through the new official plan and homelessness strategy.\nMaclaren\u00a0Municipal Consulting, which the city hired\u00a0to\u00a0take\u00a0stock of Ottawa's wide-ranging rental issues, offered the city more policy choices to deal with housing conditions\u00a0in a report this month.\nToronto, for instance, has a registry of large apartment buildings and requires them to deal with pests. Oshawa actually licenses rental housing, but only near its post-secondary campuses.\nAnother option would be to have bylaw officers write tickets when they see an\u00a0unkempt property, the same way they write parking tickets, instead of only following up on\u00a0complaints.\nResidents have until Sept. 4 to fill out a survey\u00a0with their feedback, which will feed into what regulations or enforcement staff recommend to\u00a0city councillors this fall. Any new regulations will not extend to social housing or long-term care homes.\nA second survey on options for regulating\u00a0short-term rentals, such as Airbnb, closes\u00a0the same day.\n"}, {"author": "Lukas Wall", "title": "Old store, new life: How plants and patterns are reviving a historic St. John's building", "description": "The 150-year-old Templeton's building has some new tenants", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/old-store-new-life-1.5202689", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5203941.1562607925!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/historic-templeton-s-bldg.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 08, 2019 10:00 AM NT", "2019-07-08T12:30:40.235Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A downtown St. John's building that was home to a hardware store for more than 150 years is now welcoming new customers, with two new businesses opening up and working together \u2014 and\u00a0possibly more on the way.\u00a0\nThe Templeton's building, sitting between Water Street and Harbour Drive, housed Templeton's hardware store, selling paint and flooring to townies for over a century.\nBut due to a sluggish economy\u00a0and an increase in competition, Templeton's closed up shop in early 2017, leaving the iconic building that bears the family's name sitting mostly empty.\nNow, the old building is seeing some new life with the East Coast Quilting Co. occupying the Water Street side of the building and the Seed Company by E.W.

Iran denied blame and said it was ready for \"full-fledged war.\"\nTwo sources briefed on the operations of state oil company Saudi Aramco said\u00a0it might take months for Saudi oil production to return to normal. Earlier estimates had suggested it could take weeks.\nBrent crude futures settled at $69.02 US a barrel, up\u00a0$8.80, or 14.6 per cent, its largest one-day gain since at least 1988. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, rose Monday by $8.05 US, or 14.7 per cent to $62.90 US per barrel. It was WTI's largest one-day percentage gain since December 2008.\nThe attacks have possibly curtailed as much as one\u00a0million barrels per day of Aramco's refining capacity, Energy Aspects said, although this could not be confirmed and it was not clear to which Saudi Aramco refineries it was referring.\nPrices eased after Trump announced that he would release U.S. emergency supplies, and producers around the world said there were enough stocks stored up to make up for the shortfall.\n\"There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\" Trump said on Twitter on Sunday.\nU.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry pinned the blame squarely on Iran for \"an attack on the global economy and the global energy market.\n\"The United States wholeheartedly condemns Iran's attack on Saudi Arabia and we call on other nations to do the same,\" he said in a speech to an annual meeting in Vienna of the United Nations\u00a0nuclear watchdog IAEA.\nPerry said he was confident the oil market \"is resilient and will respond positively.\"\nWhile Iran has denied blame for the attacks, its Yemeni allies have promised more strikes to come. Houthi military spokesperson\u00a0Yahya Sarea said the group carried out Saturday's pre-dawn attack with drones, including some powered by jet engines.\n\"We assure the Saudi regime that our long arm can reach any place we choose and at the time of our choosing,\" Sarea tweeted. \"We warn companies and foreigners against being near the plants that we struck because they are still in our sights and could be hit at any moment.\"\nU.S. officials say they believe the attacks came from the opposite direction, possibly from Iran itself rather than Yemen, and may have involved cruise missiles. Wherever the attacks were launched, however, they believe Iran is to blame.\n\"There's no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there's no escaping it. There's no other candidate,\" a U.S. official said on Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nSaudi Arabia also pointed the finger\u00a0at Iran, saying in a statement that initial investigations have indicated that the weapons used in the attack were Iranian, without offering further details.\n\"The kingdom condemns this egregious crime, which threatens international peace and security, and affirms that the primary target of this attack is global energy supplies,\" the Saudi Foreign Ministry said Monday.\nSaudi Arabia and Iran have been enemies for decades and are fighting a number of proxy wars, including in Yemen where Saudi forces have been fighting against the Houthis for four years.Tension in the oil-producing Gulf region has dramatically escalated this year after Trump imposed severe U.S. sanctions on Iran aimed at halting its oil exports altogether.\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\nFor months, Iranian officials have issued veiled threats, saying if Tehran is blocked from exporting oil, other countries will not be able to do so either. However, Iran has denied any role in specific attacks, including bombings of tankers in the Gulf and previous strikes claimed by the Houthis.\nForeign Ministry spokesperson\u00a0Abbas Mousavi called the U.S. accusations of Iranian involvement in Saturday's attacks \"unacceptable and entirely baseless.\"\nRussia and China both said it was wrong to jump to hasty conclusions about who was responsible for the attack. Britain also stopped short of ascribing blame but described the assault as a \"wanton violation of international law.\"\nWashington has imposed its \"maximum pressure\" strategy on Iran since last year when Trump pulled out of an international deal that gave Tehran access to world trade in return for curbs on its nuclear program.\nU.S. allies in Europe oppose Trump's strategy, arguing it provides no clear mechanism to defuse tensions, creating a risk the foes could stumble into war.\nTrump has said his goal is to force Iran to negotiate a tougher agreement and has left open the possibility of talks with President Hassan Rouhani at an upcoming UN meeting. Iran says there can be no talks until Washington lifts sanctions. Rouhani would not meet Trump, its Foreign Ministry said on Monday.\u00a0\nThe giant Saudi plant that was struck cleans crude oil of impurities, a necessary step before it can be exported and fed into refineries. The attack cut Saudi output by 5.7 million barrels a day, or around half.\nSaudi Arabia is the world's biggest oil exporter and\u00a0has a unique role in the market as the only country with enough spare capacity to increase or decrease its output by millions of barrels per day, keeping the market stable.\nBig countries such as the United States and China have reserves designed to handle even a major outage over the short term. But a long outage would make markets subject to swings that could potentially destabilize the global economy.\nMartin Griffiths, the UN\u00a0envoy for Yemen, is appealing for an urgent move toward peace in the war-ravaged country, saying the latest attack on key Saudi Arabian oil facilities \"has consequences well beyond the region\" and risks dragging Yemen \"into a regional conflagration\" at a minimum.\nGriffiths told the UN\u00a0Security Council on Monday that the attack and military escalation \"makes the chances of a regional conflict that much higher,\" and with Yemen linked in some way \"this is frankly terrifying.\"\nHe said\u00a0\"it isn't entirely clear\" who was behind Saturday's attack, but said\u00a0it's \"bad enough\" that Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are fighting the Saudi-led coalition supporting the government, claimed responsibility.\nChina's Foreign Ministry also expressed concerns, saying\u00a0authorities have noted reports the U.S. blamed Iran for the strikes.\nHua Chunying, spokesperson\u00a0at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said \"given the absence of a conclusive investigation and result, I think it is irresponsible to determine who should assume responsibility for it.\"\nHua also on Monday reiterated China's position opposing \"any expansion and intensification of conflicts.\"\nRaveesh Kumar, India's External Affairs Ministry spokesperson, expressed India's resolve to \"oppose terrorism in all its forms and manifestations\" in a short statement Monday.\nSaudi Arabia is India's second-largest oil supplier after Iraq.

Gaze moving into the old Templeton's warehouse on Harbour Drive.\nThe East Coast Quilting Co. is a consortium of fabric and quilting businesses \u2014\u00a0the Fabric Merchant, Sew Many Stitches and the Quilted Stash \u2014 that have pooled their inventory, skills and experience into one company, under one roof.\nCorey Follett, one of the company's owners, says each of the businesses bring different strengths in training and experience.\n\"We all bring something different to this giant quilt that we've made together,\" Follett said.\n\"It was the perfect coming together of four people.\"\nThe store stocks more than 1,500 different types of fabric and offers quilting classes as well as sewing machine sales and repairs.\nFollett said there is plenty of interest in quilting in St. John's to support the large store.\n\"This isn't confirmed, but I have also heard from a distributor that we may be the largest quilting store east of Alberta,\" he said.\u00a0\nThe building's long history also adds a special charm to the store, Follett said.\nWith the Seed Company downstairs, and the possibility of Wooden Walls Distillery setting up shop in the future, it's becoming a hot spot for local business.\u00a0\n\"Just being in this building brings a richness in tradition and character,\" he said.\n\"Below us is Gaze Seeds, our new neighbours \u2014 we figure if the distillery moves into the space directly below us, we will have cornered the market. It's a one stop shop for some quilters.\"\nCo-owner Debbie Northover said that connection with other shops is a big benefit.\n\"By being downtown, we're going to build partnerships with some of the local businesses and encourage the growth of those businesses as well,\" she said.\nWhile the quilting shop is new to shoppers, the Seed Company by E.W. Gaze, originally called Gaze Seed Company, has been open in the downtown since 1925.\nPeter Byrne, owner and great-grandson of founder Ernest Gaze, said the store's new retail space is double the size of its old location on Buchanan Street, making room to bring in some new products.\nThe original post and beam construction and other signs of the building's history have also been made a part of the new store.\n\"The workmanship that's in this building \u2014 you would never be able to get it done today,\" said Byrne.\nAnother local business in the same building has been a benefit, Byrne said, with the two stores sharing shoppers.\n\"We're bouncing customers back and forth off of each other. We had people in our store yesterday that didn't know the quilting shop existed upstairs,\" he said.\n\"We send customers up to them and they've sent customers down to us.\u2026 We're just getting our groove going as two destination shops coexisting in the same building.\"\nAnd Byrne said the Seed Company is leaving room for future additions to the new local retail hub.\n\"We purposely left open a door so that we could coexist with the distillery if the distillery moves ahead,\" he said.\n\"I think this is an excellent move for Gaze Seed Company.\"\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "Housing group wants city to license landlords", "description": "Renters, neighbours, landlords asked to fill out survey by Sept. 4.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-rental-accommodation-study-survey-1.5261705", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3348795.1449156434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/refugee-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 29, 2019 9:01 AM ET", "2019-08-29T13:02:52.361Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "An advocacy group for low-income tenants is urging the City of Ottawa\u00a0to crack down on shabby living conditions by licensing landlords, but landlords say that will just worsen the capital's rental housing crunch.\nThe city plans to come up with\u00a0new\u00a0rules this fall that could affect all\u00a0private\u00a0rental properties, from traditional apartments and rooming houses to student housing and short-term rentals like Airbnb.\nMembers of the advocacy group Acorn Ottawa have been going to public meetings to argue people shouldn't have to live with bed bugs, cockroaches or unresponsive landlords.\nAcorn's\u00a0solution is to license all landlords who own more than three units, and subject them to regular city\u00a0inspections.\n\"Bad landlords don't exist in just one area, or a couple of areas. They're throughout the city,\" said Acorn's Blaine Cameron.\nBut the Eastern Ontario Landlords Organization\u00a0says\u00a0the city simply needs to better enforce the bylaws it already has,\u00a0and target the\u00a0few problematic buildings for which it regularly gets\u00a0noise and property\u00a0complaints.\n\"Let's address those problems. Let's not bring in all kinds of regulations and\u00a0all kinds of cost and bother to the 95 per cent of landlords who behave\u00a0well and are maintaining their buildings well,\" said its chair John Dickie.\nBroad licensing\u00a0of landlords would be counterproductive, he added.\n\"It would discourage people from renting out units, which at this point, that's the last thing that should be done,\" said Dickie.\nAn\u00a0analysis of the rental market for the City of Ottawa describes how rents rose\u00a0sharply between 2016 and 2018, and the 1,123\u00a0new units that came on the market in that time couldn't keep up with 5,388 more renters.\nThe affordability\u00a0and supply of rental housing are\u00a0big issues but are more likely to be dealt with through the new official plan and homelessness strategy.\nMaclaren\u00a0Municipal Consulting, which the city hired\u00a0to\u00a0take\u00a0stock of Ottawa's wide-ranging rental issues, offered the city more policy choices to deal with housing conditions\u00a0in a report this month.\nToronto, for instance, has a registry of large apartment buildings and requires them to deal with pests. Oshawa actually licenses rental housing, but only near its post-secondary campuses.\nAnother option would be to have bylaw officers write tickets when they see an\u00a0unkempt property, the same way they write parking tickets, instead of only following up on\u00a0complaints.\nResidents have until Sept. 4 to fill out a survey\u00a0with their feedback, which will feed into what regulations or enforcement staff recommend to\u00a0city councillors this fall. Any new regulations will not extend to social housing or long-term care homes.\nA second survey on options for regulating\u00a0short-term rentals, such as Airbnb, closes\u00a0the same day.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Energy prices spike after Saudi oil attack, U.S. blames Iran", "description": "Trump says U.S. 'locked and loaded' to respond, Iran calls U.S. claims 'maximum lies'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/saudi-oilfield-attack-energy-prices-spike-1.5284835", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5284851.1568628002!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/saudi-aramco-fire.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 16, 2019 3:13 AM ET", "2019-09-16T21:28:29.128Z"], "source": null, "content": "An attack on Saudi Arabia that shut five per cent of global crude output caused the biggest surge in oil prices in nearly three decades, after U.S. officials blamed Iran and President Donald Trump said Washington was \"locked and loaded\" to retaliate.\nThe Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls Yemen's capital claimed responsibility for the attack, which damaged the world's biggest crude oil processing plant. Iran denied blame and said it was ready for \"full-fledged war.\"\nTwo sources briefed on the operations of state oil company Saudi Aramco said\u00a0it might take months for Saudi oil production to return to normal. Earlier estimates had suggested it could take weeks.\nBrent crude futures settled at $69.02 US a barrel, up\u00a0$8.80, or 14.6 per cent, its largest one-day gain since at least 1988. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, rose Monday by $8.05 US, or 14.7 per cent to $62.90 US per barrel.

Wherever the attacks were launched, however, they believe Iran is to blame.\n\"There's no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there's no escaping it. There's no other candidate,\" a U.S. official said on Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nSaudi Arabia also pointed the finger\u00a0at Iran, saying in a statement that initial investigations have indicated that the weapons used in the attack were Iranian, without offering further details.\n\"The kingdom condemns this egregious crime, which threatens international peace and security, and affirms that the primary target of this attack is global energy supplies,\" the Saudi Foreign Ministry said Monday.\nSaudi Arabia and Iran have been enemies for decades and are fighting a number of proxy wars, including in Yemen where Saudi forces have been fighting against the Houthis for four years.Tension in the oil-producing Gulf region has dramatically escalated this year after Trump imposed severe U.S. sanctions on Iran aimed at halting its oil exports altogether.\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked.

Britain also stopped short of ascribing blame but described the assault as a \"wanton violation of international law.\"\nWashington has imposed its \"maximum pressure\" strategy on Iran since last year when Trump pulled out of an international deal that gave Tehran access to world trade in return for curbs on its nuclear program.\nU.S. allies in Europe oppose Trump's strategy, arguing it provides no clear mechanism to defuse tensions, creating a risk the foes could stumble into war.\nTrump has said his goal is to force Iran to negotiate a tougher agreement and has left open the possibility of talks with President Hassan Rouhani at an upcoming UN meeting. Iran says there can be no talks until Washington lifts sanctions.

WeWork is at the forefront of this revolution,\" SoftBank's founder Masayoshi Son said in a statement.\n\"Since the vision remains unchanged, SoftBank has decided to double down on the company by providing a significant capital infusion and operational support. We remain committed to WeWork, its employees, its member customers and landlords,\" he said.\nWeWork has been scrambling for cash since its attempt to enter the stock market floundered last month, a stunning fall from grace for a company that has until recently been considered one of the most highly valued startups in the U.S.\nThe deal throws WeWork a lifeline as it attempts to turn around a money-losing business model that had repelled potential Wall Street investors. But it comes at a steep cost for SoftBank, which already owns one-third of WeWork and has sunk $10 billion into the company.\nSoftBank's takeover would value WeWork at $8 billion, a fraction of the $47 billion valuation SoftBank had assigned the company in its last round of financing in January.\nThe contours of the deal mean SoftBank now has more money invested in WeWork than the company is worth.\n\"This is where the math gets confusing because they've put in more money than the valuation of the company,\" said Larry Perkins, founder and CEO of SierraConstellation Partners, a management advisory firm that specializes in helping companies navigate difficult turnarounds. \"That would be the question going forward: Is this good money after bad money or a preservation of their investment?\"\nSoftBank will pay Neumann $1 billion for his shares in the company and extend him $500 million in credit to help him repay a loan from J.P. Morgan., the Wall Street Journal reported. SoftBank also will pay Neumann a $185 million consulting fee, it said.\nNeumann stepped down as CEO under pressure last month, but he retained a controlling share of the company, making his approval necessary for any deal. He will step down from WeWork's board of directors but retain a small stake in the company.\n\"He gets a golden helicopter that lets him get out of this, and that is just remarkable,\" Perkins said.\nThe SoftBank deal eases WeWork's immediate cash crunch, but the company faces a long road ahead to address its deeper challenges, namely finding ways to curtail its staggering spending.\nWeWork mostly makes money by leasing buildings and subdividing them into office space that it sublets on a short-term, flexible basis.\nSince the failed IPO, WeWork has taken steps to shore up that core business and move away from the meandering direction it had taken under Neumann.\nNeuman, who grew up partly in a kibbutz, had dazzled private investors with his vision of creating workspaces that foster communality and cater to the overall well-being of its members. The company launched side businesses including a fitness company called \"Rise by We\" and the co-living rental company \"WeLive.\"\nThose projects now appear on the chopping block. Last week, WeWork announced it would close WeGrow, its newly launched Manhattan elementary school. Days later, the company scrapped a deal with a top Seattle real estate firm for a building that would combine its WeWork offices spaces with its WeLive communal apartment rentals.\nWeWork, which has locations in 111 cities around the world, is also slowing its expansion plans. Last week, the company cancelled plans to lease space in U.S. Steel Tower, Pittsburgh's tallest building.\nBut the company could face an uphill battle to curb costs related its future lease obligations, which amounted to $47.2 billion as of June 30. Most of its leases don't have provisions to let the company end them early, and the average initial term of its U.S. leases is 15 years.\n\"It's a huge liability. There's a very blunt option called bankruptcy that I'm sure everyone wants to avoid. It would be a last resort, but I'm sure it's an option that is on the table if they can't get out of leases peacefully,\" Perkins said.\nWeWork had few palatable options after pulling out of the IPO, which the company had been counting on to raise $9 billion in stock and related debt financing.\nThe company decided to accept SoftBank's offer over a high-risk debt-financing proposal from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., which had been the lead underwriter of the failed IPO.\nWeWork was sitting on $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of June, but it burned through nearly $199 million in the first six months of the year just operating its business.\nOn top of that, it spent $2.36 billion on new leases and other investments, an amount that had been offset by $3.43 billion raised though venture capital and high-yield debt. A person familiar with the negotiations said WeWork had been on track to run out of cash by the end of November without the new financing.\n"}, {"author": "Zach Goudie", "title": "How a fire at at St. John's food bank warmed hearts across the province", "description": "In early 2019, disaster struck Community Food Sharing Association.

A fire had torn through the warehouse, leaving walls charred, supplies burned, and all the food contaminated.\u00a0\nLater that morning, a visibly distraught Walters addressed the gathered media.\n\"We have absolutely no food. We don't even have one can of soup that we could distribute.\" he said.\nThe new year was barely a month old, but the food bank fire was instantly one of the biggest news stories of 2019. Now, as the year draws to a close, CBC is raising funds for local food banks through its annual Warm Hearts campaign. Click here to learn more.\nWalters has long been the public face of food banks in Newfoundland and Labrador. He's served as general manager of the Community Food Sharing Association since it was founded in 1992. His long\u00a0white beard puts you in mind of another well-known character who's\u00a0famous for giving. But on that January morning, Walters hit rock bottom.\n\"I've been with Community Food Sharing for 27 years, and it's the worst thing that ever happened to me in those 27 years.\" he said. \"I shake now when I get under stress.\u2026 To say that it was devastating and stressful would be an understatement.\"\n\"My stomach was right up in my throat. To see that, and to know what was in the warehouse. And to wonder, what's going to happen tomorrow?\"\nWalters wasn't the only person feeling that way.\n\"I think I burst into tears immediately,\" laughed CFSA board chairperson Wanda Hillier, who remembered being at work when Walters\u00a0called. The first thing that came to her mind was that the following Tuesday was shipping day.\n\"This is like four days from then. So I'm thinking, how do you not have those doors open for a food bank that is out of food?\" Hillier said.\nThose food banks were wondering the same thing. There are 56 groups in Newfoundland and Labrador that operate food banks\u00a0that are part of the CFSA network. Each of them aims to stock its shelves with locally donated food, but all of them depend to some degree on CFSA to supplement the\u00a0donations. If a food bank runs short, it's CFSA they call.\u00a0\nThe Single Parent\u00a0Association of Newfoundland\u00a0is just one of those\u00a0groups. The day before the fire, it had collected a seemingly huge supply of food from CFSA. But SPAN's\u00a0Elaine Balsom said it was barely enough to last for a couple of days.\u00a0\n\"We may have to scale back what we give in our hampers to make things go further\u00a0or \u2014 hopefully it won't come to it, but we may have to have a day that we won't have the food bank actually open, until Community Food Sharing gets back on its feet again.\" Balsom said at the time.\nAs a fellow food bank organizer, Balsom's heart\u00a0went out to Walters.\n\"Just getting the news yesterday was heartbreaking, it was just such a shock.\" she said then. \"I can certainly empathize with how Eg must be feeling, because it's devastating to know that you have these people depending on you, and maybe next week we might have to look at some people coming in for food hampers and say, we don't have food to give you.\"\nThe fire was out, but the threat of thousands going hungry was hanging in the air.\nThe morning after the fire, a different kind of spark was kindled. All over the province, people sprang into action, looking to help out in ways big and small. Seemingly every town, every business, every club and association was looking for ways to raise funds, food or both.\nAt the St. John's Farmers' Market, vendors donated proceeds from sales.\n\"I'm in the food business, you could say,\" said Jonathan Richler, owner of the\u00a0Jewish Deli. \"What better use of my resources than to help other people eat?\"\nPublic libraries started accepting food donations in place of fines for overdue library books. The corporate community broke out the giant cheques, handing over four- and five-figure sums as fast as the ink could dry.\nTwo days after the fire came the biggest donation of all: a new warehouse, provided rent free by the provincial government. The space had just been vacated by Eastern Health, which had used it to prepare hospital meals \u2014 so it was already fully equipped with everything a food distribution centre needs.\u00a0\n\"All we had to do was change the phone number,\" said Walters.\nThe sudden flurry of public appreciation was an emotional experience for longtime volunteers like Hillier.\u00a0\n\"We realized, 'OK, Newfoundland and Labrador has our back!\" she said. \"You've got Food Banks Canada calling, [saying] 'How many tractor-trailer loads can you take?' You've got companies calling that are not even in Newfoundland saying, 'We've got food, how much do you want?' To the point that we were delaying trucks because we couldn't accommodate all that was coming in.\"\nJust one week after the fire, after being left without a single can of soup, the Community Food Sharing Association was up and running again, the lost food more than made up for.\nThe work of local food banks, and the people behind them, doesn't get celebrated every day. But in those hectic early days of 2019, people in this province showed how much that work\u00a0means.\n\"I think what it did was it reawakened the generosity, the generous spirit of Newfoundlanders throughout the whole province and on the mainland as well.\" said Walters. \"All we had to do was tell the story. We didn't say, 'We want this, we want that, we want something else.'

A fire had torn through the warehouse, leaving walls charred, supplies burned, and all the food contaminated.\u00a0\nLater that morning, a visibly distraught Walters addressed the gathered media.\n\"We have absolutely no food. We don't even have one can of soup that we could distribute.\" he said.\nThe new year was barely a month old, but the food bank fire was instantly one of the biggest news stories of 2019. Now, as the year draws to a close, CBC is raising funds for local food banks through its annual Warm Hearts campaign. Click here to learn more.\nWalters has long been the public face of food banks in Newfoundland and Labrador. He's served as general manager of the Community Food Sharing Association since it was founded in 1992. His long\u00a0white beard puts you in mind of another well-known character who's\u00a0famous for giving. But on that January morning, Walters hit rock bottom.\n\"I've been with Community Food Sharing for 27 years, and it's the worst thing that ever happened to me in those 27 years.\" he said. \"I shake now when I get under stress.\u2026 To say that it was devastating and stressful would be an understatement.\"\n\"My stomach was right up in my throat. To see that, and to know what was in the warehouse. And to wonder, what's going to happen tomorrow?\"\nWalters wasn't the only person feeling that way.\n\"I think I burst into tears immediately,\" laughed CFSA board chairperson Wanda Hillier, who remembered being at work when Walters\u00a0called. The first thing that came to her mind was that the following Tuesday was shipping day.\n\"This is like four days from then. So I'm thinking, how do you not have those doors open for a food bank that is out of food?\" Hillier said.\nThose food banks were wondering the same thing. There are 56 groups in Newfoundland and Labrador that operate food banks\u00a0that are part of the CFSA network. Each of them aims to stock its shelves with locally donated food, but all of them depend to some degree on CFSA to supplement the\u00a0donations. If a food bank runs short, it's CFSA they call.\u00a0\nThe Single Parent\u00a0Association of Newfoundland\u00a0is just one of those\u00a0groups. The day before the fire, it had collected a seemingly huge supply of food from CFSA. But SPAN's\u00a0Elaine Balsom said it was barely enough to last for a couple of days.\u00a0\n\"We may have to scale back what we give in our hampers to make things go further\u00a0or \u2014 hopefully it won't come to it, but we may have to have a day that we won't have the food bank actually open, until Community Food Sharing gets back on its feet again.\" Balsom said at the time.\nAs a fellow food bank organizer, Balsom's heart\u00a0went out to Walters.\n\"Just getting the news yesterday was heartbreaking, it was just such a shock.\" she said then. \"I can certainly empathize with how Eg must be feeling, because it's devastating to know that you have these people depending on you, and maybe next week we might have to look at some people coming in for food hampers and say, we don't have food to give you.\"\nThe fire was out, but the threat of thousands going hungry was hanging in the air.\nThe morning after the fire, a different kind of spark was kindled. All over the province, people sprang into action, looking to help out in ways big and small. Seemingly every town, every business, every club and association was looking for ways to raise funds, food or both.\nAt the St. John's Farmers' Market, vendors donated proceeds from sales.\n\"I'm in the food business, you could say,\" said Jonathan Richler, owner of the\u00a0Jewish Deli. \"What better use of my resources than to help other people eat?\"\nPublic libraries started accepting food donations in place of fines for overdue library books. The corporate community broke out the giant cheques, handing over four- and five-figure sums as fast as the ink could dry.\nTwo days after the fire came the biggest donation of all: a new warehouse, provided rent free by the provincial government. The space had just been vacated by Eastern Health, which had used it to prepare hospital meals \u2014 so it was already fully equipped with everything a food distribution centre needs.\u00a0\n\"All we had to do was change the phone number,\" said Walters.\nThe sudden flurry of public appreciation was an emotional experience for longtime volunteers like Hillier.\u00a0\n\"We realized, 'OK, Newfoundland and Labrador has our back!\" she said. \"You've got Food Banks Canada calling, [saying] 'How many tractor-trailer loads can you take?' You've got companies calling that are not even in Newfoundland saying, 'We've got food, how much do you want?' To the point that we were delaying trucks because we couldn't accommodate all that was coming in.\"\nJust one week after the fire, after being left without a single can of soup, the Community Food Sharing Association was up and running again, the lost food more than made up for.\nThe work of local food banks, and the people behind them, doesn't get celebrated every day. But in those hectic early days of 2019, people in this province showed how much that work\u00a0means.\n\"I think what it did was it reawakened the generosity, the generous spirit of Newfoundlanders throughout the whole province and on the mainland as well.\" said Walters. \"All we had to do was tell the story. We didn't say, 'We want this, we want that, we want something else.' All we did was say, 'This is what happened,' \u2014 and we kept the faith.\"\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Get informed on the top stories of the day in one quick scan", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/morning-brief-may-7-2020-1.5557351", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["May 07, 2020 6:51 AM ET", "2020-05-07T10:51:35.879Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Good morning!

As CBC science correspondent Kelly Crowe writes, it's a pandemic paradox: The nasty pathogen that drove us inside is still spreading \u2014 but now we're told it's time to go out and face the risk.

The mantra of \"eat less and exercise more\" does not seem to work.\nThat is because it is a simplistic formula that does not take into account many other factors that affect our body weight and our health, according to Jennifer Kuk. She is a professor in the department of kinesiology and health science at York University and spoke with Michael Enright, host of The Sunday Edition, about common myths, misunderstandings and misconceptions around weight loss.\nThese are highlights of their conversation, edited for length and clarity.\nI'm very fortunate to work with a weight management physician in the local area, and we took all his weight management patients and looked at who is most successful at losing weight, males versus females, older versus younger. When we first started we thought that younger patients would be able to lose more weight. They tend to be healthier and have fewer conditions that might impair their ability to lose weight, and they probably do more exercise. And they're on fewer medications that tend to promote weight gain. So we were a bit surprised that we saw the older individual patients were actually better able to lose what we deem to be a clinically significant amount of weight.\nThere are many generational factors. One of them would be your ability to cook and grocery shop. Older individuals are more likely to be able to cook from raw ingredients, as opposed to from a box that's prepared that you just preheat. That allows you to control the fat content, the salt content, the sugar content of your food much better, and then you're more aware of what you're actually consuming. One of the things that we see is that music or being elite in sports or getting good grades is more emphasized than having life skills.\nThere's more stress. When you take a look at our permanently plugged-in environment, you never get a break from work. You're always plugged in. Kids are the same way, in the sense that they're always communicating with their friends. They have to constantly update their Facebook or whatever it is or they lose their social standing. All of that stress also influences your ability to control your appetite, to make those good choices and also manage your body weight. Long-term stress will tell your body that you need to conserve. Your resting metabolic rate will actually go down and your fat stores will actually go up in response to chronic stress.\nSocial networks have also been linked with your likelihood of gaining weight. The more people that are within your close social network who have obesity or are gaining weight, the more likely you are also going to gain weight.\nIndividuals who are close eat together, they engage in the same type of activities, they have the same type of stressors in their life \u2026 so many of the things that are been shown to contribute to weight gain might just be affecting both parties.\nIf there are environmental pollutants or pesticide exposures that we have in our food sources, they are also going to influence it as well. The areas where we live will influence our walkability, our perception of access to physical activity options, that sort of thing.\nWhen you take a look at the number of medications that the population is on, it's increased astronomically. And when you look at the number of medications that say weight gain is a side effect, it's not a trivial amount. Even if it was only five pounds or a couple pounds, when you add up all of those medications across an entire population, I think that a large proportion of the weight gain is due to the fact that we have medications that promote weight gain.\nIf you think of your body weight as a savings account, what you deposit minus what you take out is your balance. But what we're learning is that your physiology is not like a savings account, it's more like the stock market or your RRSPs. And so there are instances where you can put in money and you have a great year and you gain lots of money or you have years where you lose lots of money. It's the same thing with your physiology. You can eat less and sometimes your body will compensate and burn fewer calories. You can have your physiology flux between something like a monster truck to a Prius.\nThere is a large British study that's quite famous that essentially shows the more exercise you do, the more you eat. And once you get beyond this sedentary level, usually your intake matches your energy expenditure. So you have this nice equilibrium. Unfortunately, because we've engineered physical activity out of our lives, there's many things that we no longer have to do manually \u2013 simple things like cars, not having to roll down your windows, remote controls on our TVs \u2013 so even sedentary activities are more sedentary now. And so we're all within this very sedentary state, which causes a disregulation between our energy intake and our appetite, which makes us eat more or feel hungrier because we're sedentary.\nPeople do gain more weight in the wintertime. One fantastic way to increase your appetite is through cold exposure. If you sit outside for a while in the cold and you come in, the first thing you think of is, \"I'm starving.\" So the body reacts to that cold exposure by saying, \"I need to deposit fat stores.\" So that actually triggers your hunger hormones.\nI think the largest is that if you eat less and move more you can lose all the weight that you want. The people who are able to do that are equivalent to people who have won the lottery. I think that we all know that there are people that win the lottery but not everybody does. And the people who win the lottery and are able to lose weight through diet and exercise are screaming at everybody else saying, \"Why can't you do it? I did it.\" But it would be the same as the lottery winner saying, \"I won the lottery. Why didn't you win the lottery?\" We see the absurdity of that, but we don't see it when it comes to weight loss.\nI think that probably the best way is to pick the right parents. If you have the right genetic makeup, it defends against weight gain. There's a study that had many people eat a thousand calories extra, which is about a third more than what they normally ate, and there are some individuals in that study who gained nothing, despite not exercising more.\nObesity has been now termed a chronic condition disease by the World Health Organization, so it's important to recognize that they are people first and not a disease. So we don't say \"obese people,\" we say \"people with obesity;\" just as we wouldn't say, \"a cancerous person,\" we'd say, \"this is a patient with lung cancer\" or \"a patient with heart disease.\"\nI don't know if weight loss should be the ultimate goal. I think that the question is wrong. So the right question is, \"How do you get healthier?\" You should not equate weight with health. They're not the same thing.\nYou can lose a very small amount of weight and get significant health benefits, but when people look at you you're still going to have obesity. They're still going to think you need to lose another five, 10 or 50 pounds, but that's not reality. So in order for you to improve your health, the amount of weight that you need to lose is very small. Most people with obesity, if they lost five per cent, they would get healthier, they'd feel better they'd have more energy, but they would still be classified as having obesity. And people would look at them and still say you know if you lost a few pounds you'd be healthier. Bariatric surgery is the best obesity treatment that we have, and most patients after bariatric surgery still have obesity.\nClick 'listen' above to hear the full interview.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Julia Stiles on Hustlers, nostalgia and her legacy as a '90s teen icon", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/thursday-sept-12-2019-julia-stiles-michiel-huisman-and-more-1.5279633/julia-stiles-on-hustlers-nostalgia-and-her-legacy-as-a-90s-teen-icon-1.5279708", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Sep 12, 2019 12:40 PM ET", "2019-09-12T16:46:35.652Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "You might know Julia Stiles best from her roles in a string of romantic teen comedies in the '90s, such as 10 Things I Hate About You\u00a0and Save the Last Dance, but since then, she's shifted into more dramatic roles.\nWhen Stiles\u00a0read the script for her latest film Hustlers, she knew she had to be\u00a0a part of the project\u00a0in one way or another.

I didn't take it very seriously, but it was\u00a0from\u00a0a white person who called me the \"N-word lover.\" Something like that, you know, hateful, horrible stuff. Probably the person was crazy. It's disappointing, really, but it's not going to change what I do.\nHustlers just had\u00a0its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. It opens in theatres everywhere today.\nThis transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

And what comes after the holidays? Sometimes, a lot more waste that we have to manage,\" Synowiec told CBC Toronto. \"It's really important at the City of Toronto that people are knowing how to recycle and dispose of their waste materials properly.\"\nIf recyclable material is contaminated, it cannot be processed properly, and if non-recyclable materials are placed in Blue Bins, it can ruin good recyclable material, she said.\n\"When we have dirty recycling, that contaminates these recyclables and then that's not a good enough feed stock to be reprocessed. It doesn't have that opportunity to become another product.\"\nSynowiec said residents, particularly those who celebrated the most recent festive season, need to look at items that are made of many materials when sorting through items to be discarded.\n\"In our recycling, we want to make sure that all of our recycling is clean,\" she said.\n\"Around the holiday season, we know that we often generate a lot of waste. That's why it's important during this season that we look for proper ways to sort our waste, as well as find opportunities to reduce and reuse what we already have.\"\nHoliday gift bags, for example, are often made up of paper, bows and string. The bows and string needs to be removed before they can be recycled. But she said the bags themselves\u00a0could also be reused next year.\nOrange crates are made of wood, paper, metal and plastic mesh. The crate, in the form in which it is sold, cannot be recycled, she said.\n\"Markets are not there for recycled wood, especially with multi-materials on it,\" she said.\nTinsel, on the other part, can be reused because it has \"good craft potential,\" she said.\nIn a demonstration at Nathan Phillips Square, Synowiec went through a bag of material to illustrate how residents need to sort their trash. \u00a0If it is not going to be reused and if it cannot be recycled, it must go into the garbage, she said.\u00a0\nBut if, for example, it's an old plastic toy in good shape, it could have a bit of life in it yet and could be donated.\nFood can contaminate recycling material, she reminded residents. And black garbage bags do not belong in Blue Bins.\n\"If you do have extra recycling during the season, which a lot of us do, then we want to make sure that it's not it in a black garbage bag. We need to be able to see that\u00a0it's clean recyclables in the bag, so we ask that you put it in a clear, transparent bag.\"\nOn its website, the city has online resources to help resident sort through their trash. One is the Waste Wizard. Residents can use this resource to find out which items go where.\nThe city, through its tweets, is also urging residents to be more green in 2020.\nWaste less in 2020 by being mindful of the waste you create each day. Then try to refuse, reduce, reuse, repair and repurpose where you can. Making small changes by rethinking what we take, make and throw out can make a big difference. <a href=\"https://t.co/r99zr8amO3\">https://t.co/r99zr8amO3</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/sPvXSZFt3y\">pic.twitter.com/sPvXSZFt3y</a>\nWant to add reducing waste to your <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/2020NewYear?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#2020NewYear</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/goals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#goals</a>?

That can turn tonnes of other perfectly good recyclables into garbage or at least lower their value and make them more difficult to sell to offset the cost of recycling programs.\nJo-Anne St. Godard, executive director of the Recycling Council of Ontario, says people need to take stock of their habits, think very clearly about their needs and purchase very purposefully.\n\"I know we're all busy and I know that we are quite reliant upon convenience, but think about what you're purchasing in the grocery store,\" St. Godard told CBC Toronto via Skype on Sunday.\n\"Does it need a package? Does it need a bag? Are you buying more than you actually can consume and therefore ending up to throw out food in particular or the packaging that comes with the food?  \"I think it's about purposeful buying and it's not just about contributing as individuals, but it's sending a signal back to the companies that we're purchasing from that we want better and we're prepared as consumers to reward better,\" St. Godard added.\n"}, {"author": "Amanda Stellisano", "title": "The cosy checklist: How shopping local can help bring the hygge\u00a0", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/pov-the-cosy-checklist-amanda-stellisano-1.5454696", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Feb 16, 2020 8:00 AM NT", "2020-02-16T11:30:00.355Z"], "source": null, "content": "I wrote recently about how cosiness is the key to handling harsh Newfoundland winters. Admittedly, fully embracing the spirit of hygge \u2014 that's the Danish and Norwegian way of living built around cosiness, comfort and coming together \u2014 may mean stocking up on certain things you may not have just lying around your house.\u00a0\nSome hygge supplies you'll want are warm clothes, candles, blankets, socks, and slippers, to name a few. To make it even more special and comfortable, look past the box stores and online warehouses to beautiful and unique pieces from here in Newfoundland and Labrador.\u00a0\nThere are so many reasons why buying locally made is a thoughtful choice.\u00a0\nYou support community creators, you help the environment and you keep money in your local economy.\nWhen you buy from a local creator, you are directly helping a person in your own community. Chances are there are very few hands between yours and the creators. The price you pay, after covering supplies and labour, goes into their pockets. You help them afford their bills, their necessities, and further grow their business.\nWhen you buy from local individuals, you have a much smaller impact on the environment. There's no mass production, there's minimal waste, and there's no major carbon footprint from items shipped around the world.\u00a0\nOn top of that, it benefits our own community. Buying locally builds a strong social and economical investment. Keeping money in our own economy creates jobs. Local makers are also local shoppers. They know what goes into being a small business and they want to strengthen others where they can. Therefore, supporting even one small business supports the community as a whole.\u00a0\nHere are some ideas on how to build your hygge collection locally.\u00a0\nLocally printed clothing has become a hugely popular trend in recent years. One of the most popular clothing brands is Figgyduff Dory. Based in Port de Grave, the company\u00a0uses common Newfoundland and Labrador phrases and images to make fun and stylish clothes. You can buy online, or at local retailers across the province.\nThe shop\u00a0Salt has a minimalist style and is highly sought after. They mainly sell staples of style and comfort such as sweatshirts, t-shirts, and beanies. Occasionally, they team up with local artists for unique and gorgeous clothing designs. They have locations in St. John's and Grand Falls-Windsor, or you can order online.\nOne of the most recognizable names in locally made candles is Foggy Island Candles. All their products are made in this province.\u00a0Their scents are all inspired by life in Newfoundland, from berries to toutons, and even the common RDF. For those who can't burn candles, they also have wax melts and scented room sprays to warm your heart. If you can't get to their St. John's storefront, retailers across the province carry their products. You can also shop their website.\nTv\u00e5l Skincare has been a staple of downtown St. John's for more than 15 years. Their products are made in-house using mostly natural ingredients, and you can get just about anything there. You'll find soaps, bath bombs and soaks, cosmetics, shampoo and conditioner, men's skincare, and more. Their products come in absolutely delectable scents, or unscented if you prefer. You can find Tv\u00e5l Skincare products at their Water Street location or on their website.\u00a0\nBubblePixie Soap Co. started with an Etsy shop and market tables, and have grown to include a brick and mortar location! They hand make their bath and body products, and they carry just about everything you'll need. Their Etsy shop lists products such as bath bombs, lotions, salt scrubs, bar soaps, beard oil, and so much more. If you visit their physical location in Grand Falls-Windsor, you can also find lots of other gift products like ornaments, mugs, socks, and other fun treats!\nA warm blanket is\u00a0a 100 per cent\u00a0must have. Jandy Quilts, located in Corner Brook, has your cosy covered. Their website and Etsy store offer a variety of Newfoundland-inspired quilts, with the ability to customize, and free shipping to boot! You can get every size from baby to king, and there's even pillow covers if you'd like a full set.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou'll also want any and all knitted goods for optimal comfort. Head To Toe Knits, located in Gander, has something for everyone in the family. They offer socks, mitts, boot cuffs, and even household items like dishcloths and kitchen towels. Their knitted goods are sure to keep you, your family, and guests comfy from head to toe!\nHere's a bonus if you are a knitter yourself: buy a locally designed pattern! Knit Sprite, run by local designer Katie Noseworthy, carries patterns for all kinds of warm knits. Whether it's a shawl, socks, or mitts, you'll enjoy having a beautiful new project to get through the winter. Plus, wearing something you knit yourself keeps you twice as warm. Ask any knitter. It's a fact!\nBlankets and socks can keep you comfortable. But if you want that extra warm, fuzzy feeling this winter, stock your home with locally made goods. You'll be supporting your community, supporting the environment, and you'll have the coziest house on the block!\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Colin Butler", "title": "Posh corner of London to get 55 affordable apartments, thanks to local church", "description": "The units will bolster the well-heeled northwest, an underserved section of the city", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-affordable-housing-1.5262750", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5262751.1567020582!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/gateway-apartments.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 29, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-08-29T08:00:00.899Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A London church is helping tackle the city's worsening poverty problems by building dozens of affordable apartments in the northwest area of the city.\nGateway Church\u00a0received city council's blessing last month to build two L-shaped buildings with a total of 80 apartments units, 55 of which will be offered at an affordable rate\u00a0on a five-acre parcel of land on London's Bluegrass Drive.\u00a0\nThe badly needed project comes at a time when the city is experiencing an\u00a0ever-deepening housing affordability crunch.\nNot only is the waiting list for some form of social housing thousands of names long, a recent report out of city hall said London's fleet of public housing stock is badly mismanaged with too many vacant units sitting idle thanks to\u00a0overlapping housing agencies that provide inadequate\u00a0oversight.\u00a0\nReport slams slow turnover, duplication in community housing\nAll of this is set against a backdrop of intensifying poverty and drug addiction made worse by\u00a0rising rents and booming real estate prices in the city.\u00a0\nIt's why the church wants to keep costs low, so people can live \"in dignity,\" according to\u00a0Rick Boyes, the lead pastor at Gateway Church.\n\"We will purposely keep the rents, most of the rents, to a thousand dollars and under,\" he said, noting the exact rate will be determined by the City of London.\u00a0\nThe project is being called \"inter-generational\" and looks to include a mix of older people, aged 55 and up, and younger people including young mothers and couples looking to start a family.\u00a0\nBoyes said the property will also include parks, gazebos, a soccer pitch, a splash pad and a skating rink in the winter.\u00a0\n\"We want it so that people will actually want to live here,\" he said, noting the entire community was designed with only one thought in mind.\u00a0\n\"If you don't want your family member in there then we don't want to build it,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nSteve Lehman, the councillor whose ward 8 constituency includes Gateway Church and some of the city's most well-heeled neighbourhoods, said the new affordable units are badly needed in his part of the city.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We actually have 133 affordable units in my ward, which out of 8,000 units across the city\u00a0is not a great representation,\" he said, noting that despite the shortage, it still took some convincing to calm jittery neighbours.\u00a0\n\"There is a stigma attached and people in the neighbourhood expressed concern that it would be attracting recovering drug addicts or a criminal element or some unfounded concerns,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"What they don't see is that affordability is affecting everybody. There are many people that are trying to get by or are having trouble paying the rent.\"\nRick Boyes said there were a lot of misperceptions from the community when it came to what the church was trying to accomplish.\nMost people couldn't tell the difference between the\u00a0affordable housing Gateway Church was trying to build and the geared-to-income housing offered by public housing agencies in places, such as Limberlost\u00a0Boulevard or Boulee Street.\u00a0\n\"What we've found is to get rid of the stigma you need to mix your housing,\" Rick Boyes said.\u00a0\"By mixing the housing price points you get a stronger community.\"\u00a0\nIt means neighbours living in the new units won't have any idea who is paying rent at or below the market rate.\u00a0\n\"We're trying to get it right, we're trying to be inclusive,\" Boyes said.\n\"We're trying to elevate what we're trying to create here so that there's a dignity to everybody that would live so that they're part of the community and part of the neighbourhood.\"\nGateway Church hopes to get shovels in the ground within the next year, with the first tenants moving in by 2021.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Auxly Cannabis signs $123M deal with tobacco giant Imperial Brands", "description": "Vancouver firm will get global licences to the British tobacco company's vaping technology", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/auxly-cannabis-deal-with-tobacco-giant-imperial-brands-1.5224955", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5224967.1564074563!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/e-cigarettes-colorado-crackdown.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 25, 2019 1:19 PM ET", "2019-07-25T20:04:51.454Z"], "source": null, "content": "Imperial Brands is the latest multinational company to step into the Canadian pot industry, signing a $123-million investment deal with Auxly Cannabis Group that includes a research and development partnership and gives the Vancouver firm the global licences to the British tobacco giant's vaping technology.\nThe deal announced Thursday would give London-based Imperial Brands a 19.9 per cent stake through a debenture convertible into Auxly equity, with a conversion price of 81 cents per share.\nThat is 11 per cent higher than Auxly's share price on the TSX Venture Exchange on Wednesday, of 73 cents.\n\"The strategic partnership really enhances our ability to execute on our business strategy accelerates our growth plan,\" said Auxly's president Hugo Alves in an interview.\n\"So we are taking in a significant capital injection at a premium to our share price in a difficult market.\"\nShares of Auxly, which has a portfolio of cannabis brands and products, jumped by more than 20 per cent in early morning trading Thursday to 89 cents after the announcement.

The bank went three straight years without turning an annual profit, before recording positive earnings of \u20ac341 million ($500.5 million) for 2018. CEO Christian Sewing took over last year and promised faster restructuring after predecessor John Cryan was perceived to have moved too slowly.\nDeutsche Bank shares rose 2.5 per cent on Friday to \u20ac7.18 ($10.54) as markets anticipated a restructuring announcement. That is far below levels from mid-2015, when the shares traded over \u20ac30\u00a0($44) per share. Shareholders received a dividend of only 11 cents ($0.16) per share for 2017 and 2018.\nThe bank said one-time charges from the changes would mean a net loss of \u20ac2.8 billion\u00a0($4.1 billion) in the second quarter. Excluding the charges, net profit would have been about \u20ac120 million\u00a0($176 million).\nThe restructuring follows the failure in April of merger talks with German rival Commerzbank. Deutsche Bank said the combination would not make business sense, but that left open the question of what strategy the bank could pursue to make its business leaner and more profitable.\nAs part of the restructuring, the bank said it would create a separate unit to dispose of billions in investments that are less profitable or no longer fit its strategy. The bank said it did not expect to have to raise additional capital from shareholders.\nWhen complete, the job cuts are to reduce the workforce to 74,000. The bank would not say where the cuts would fall; many of its investment banking activities are carried out in New York and London.\nThe bank paid billions in fines and settlements related to behaviour before and after the global financial crisis, including a $7.2 billion US settlement in 2017 with the U.S. Justice Department over selling bonds based on mortgages to people with shaky credit.\nBut that hasn't ended the negative headlines. Two U.S. congressional committees have subpoenaed Deutsche Bank documents as part their investigations into President Donald Trump and his company.

It is not even necessarily evidence of an active or official investigation. In fact, there is reason to believe an investigation was not pursued.\nBut the news on Friday that the former minister of justice and attorney general spoke with someone from the national police force in the spring punctuates\u00a0another difficult moment for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government.\u00a0\nAnd it stirs echoes of the events, nearly 14 years ago, that doomed the last Liberal government.\nThe fact that Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion proceeded with, and completed, his investigation would seem to suggest that the RCMP has not been actively pursuing the matter. The Conflict of Interest Act dictates that the commissioner \"shall immediately suspend an examination\" if it is discovered that the subject of his investigation is also the subject of a police investigation.\nIn 2014, for instance, the ethics commissioner suspended an investigation into the Mike Duffy affair once it became clear that the RCMP was investigating the same people and events.\nDion is also obligated to suspend his investigation and notify the relevant authorities if he has reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been committed.\nIn regard\u00a0to the SNC-Lavalin affair, it is unknown whether the RCMP spoke to anyone other than Wilson-Raybould. According to a spokesman for the prime minister, no one from the Prime Minister's Office has spoken with the RCMP.\u00a0\nIt is possible, at least in theory, that Dion's report on Wednesday added some new piece of information that could tweak the RCMP's interest\u00a0\u2014 a spokeswoman for the police force said this week that the RCMP is \"examining this matter\u00a0carefully.\"\nBut it's also possible that the RCMP, for the sake of doing their due diligence, spoke with Wilson-Raybould\u00a0and soon thereafter decided that no further action was warranted.\nBut the unresolved hint of an official investigation can be a politically dangerous thing.\nIn the fall of 2005, suspicious stock market activity raised concerns that details of the federal government's decision to not tax income trusts had been leaked and exploited. An NDP\u00a0MP,\u00a0Judy Wasylycia-Leis, asked the RCMP\u00a0to investigate.\nFour weeks later, in the middle of a federal election campaign, the commissioner of the\u00a0RCMP\u00a0sent a letter to Wasylycia-Leis to tell her that the force had reviewed the matter and decided to commence a criminal investigation.\u00a0\nAfter the NDP\u00a0publicized the letter, the RCMP issued a news release that specifically referred to Ralph Goodale, the finance minister at the time.\u00a0\nThe Liberals, still struggling to shake off the sponsorship scandal, were suddenly faced with another suggestion of wrongdoing. Stephen Harper, leader of the Conservative Party, called on Goodale to resign. The Conservatives, who had been trailing the Liberals,\u00a0took a lead in opinion polls that they would not relinquish, winning power in January 2006 and holding government for nearly a decade.\nThe post-script is probably worth keeping in mind.\nThe RCMP's\u00a0investigation ultimately resulted in charges against a public servant in the finance department. But Goodale was cleared of wrongdoing. By then he and the Liberals were sitting on the opposition side of the House of Commons.\nA review by the RCMP's complaints commissioner later found that the police force's policies for dealing with such situations were inadequate.\n\"I am recommending that the\u00a0RCMP\u00a0develop a specific policy concerning disclosure of information relating to highly sensitive investigations,\" the commissioner wrote.\u00a0\"This policy should include clear guidelines and be based upon a\u00a0rebuttable presumption against disclosure.\"\u00a0\nThe RCMP could be in another difficult spot now, with an election campaign just days away. So long as even the possibility of an official investigation exists, Conservatives and New Democrats might publicly hold it over the Liberals' collective heads. Ideally, if the RCMP\u00a0has decided (or does decide) to not pursue the matter, it might find a way to say so before the writ is officially dropped next month.\nFor the Liberals, it is at least another reminder to avoid getting themselves into situations such as this. One thing leads to another and suddenly the letters R, C, M and P are in the headlines.\nIn a court of law, everyone is entitled to a presumption of innocence. But politics is not generally concerned with such niceties.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Zulekha Nathoo", "title": "SoulCycle's billionaire investor has fashion ties you might not know about", "description": "Those calling for boycott due to Stephen Ross's Trump ties might have to re-evaluate other connections", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/marvel-nyfw-where-does-boycott-end-1.5242814", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5242379.1565384982!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/1160392452.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 11, 2019 8:00 AM ET", "2019-08-11T12:53:25.121Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Those calling for a boycott of companies like SoulCycle and Equinox following a controversial fundraiser for Donald Trump might find themselves battling a long list of beloved companies with similar ties.\nCelebrities, including active social media players\u00a0Chrissy Teigen and comedian Billy Eichner, called out the upscale gym chains after learning the billionaire chairman of the brands' parent company, Stephen Ross, was hosting a high-end fundraiser for Donald Trump on Friday.\nThe companies, which pride themselves on promoting inclusion and equality,\u00a0have tried to distance themselves from their investor but are still facing backlash as a result.\nBut people who try to put their money where their mouth is when it comes to\u00a0brands and politics might be faced with some tougher decisions than just finding a new place to sweat.\nRoss has a stake in some significant fashion enterprises as well, including the star-studded spectacle that is New York Fashion Week.\nThe tycoon is behind the multimillion-dollar Hudson Yards real-estate project in New York City. According to fashion insider\u00a0and editor-in-chief of Out magazine, Phillip Picardi, a venue called the Shed arts centre, which is housed at\u00a0Hudson Yards, will soon become the home to the majority of collections shown at the annual event.\n\"The fashion industry has really been built by queer people, people of colour, and immigrants,\" said Picardi. \"Celebrities who attend NYFW, models who are walking in NYFW, agencies who are booking for NYFW, should be wary of placing their clients or themselves in the Shed and in Hudson Yards because of its ties to Stephen Ross.\"\nRoss is also a major investor in the PR firm Derris,\u00a0which represents clothing company\u00a0Everlane (remember that signature tote Meghan Markle sported in Toronto during the Invictus Games?), the popular millennial makeup company Glossier (even Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0is a fan!) and Reformation (whose dresses are often snapped up by celebrities).\nSo as the list grows,\u00a0it can be difficult for consumers to stay away from it all.\n\"Rather than boycotting every single company, what certain groups of people have done is boycott the companies that they feel the most betrayed by,\" said Picardi.\nAnd those consumer boycotts\u00a0can have an impact.\u00a0Ivanka Trump was forced to close\u00a0down her fashion line after becoming the target of protest movements when she became\u00a0part of the Trump administration.\u00a0Department stores such as Nordstrom, Bed Bath & Beyond and The Bay pulled her line, they said, due to lack of sales.\nJoanne McNeish, an associate professor at Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Management, says consumer boycotts work best on publicly traded companies because stock markets react to negative press and on small businesses, which\u00a0lack the resources to maintain\u00a0damage control \u2014 not the case for those affiliated with Ross, she says.\n\"My belief is that a few people will quit SoulCycle, for example, and a few companies will disassociate themselves in the short term,\" said McNeish, whose research interests include branding, advertising and consumer marketing. \"However, the companies associated with Stephen Ross have the ... resources to manage during the crisis and afterwards.\"\nIn reaction to the recent fundraising controversy, Ross said\u00a0he's known Trump for 40 years and has always been \"an active participant in the democratic process.\"\n\"While we agree on some issues, we strongly disagree on many others and I have never been bashful about expressing my opinions,\" he said in a statement.\nRoss isn't the only wealthy target with open ties to Trump and the entertainment industry.\n\"While everyone seems to be on this Equinox thing, it might be a good time to mention that one of Trump's largest financial contributors is the chairman of Marvel Entertainment,\" Armie Hammer, who starred in the Oscar-nominated Call Me By Your Name, tweeted Friday.\nHey, while everyone seems to be on this Equinox thing, it might be a good time to mention that one of Trump\u2019s largest financial contributors is the chairman of Marvel Entertainment (Isaac Perlmutter)..... jussayin.\nHammer was referring to Isaac Perlmutter, an Israeli-American entrepreneur. According to the\u00a0Hollywood Reporter, Perlmutter\u00a0contributed\u00a0$1 million US\u00a0to Trump's campaign in 2016 and according to the New York Times, the businessman has remained an informal adviser to the president.\u00a0\nMarvel Entertainment runs Marvel Comics, Marvel Animation and Marvel Television.

Under its current\u00a0branding, Marvel Studios has also moved to incorporate more diversity and strong female leads\u00a0into its upcoming features.\nIn other words,\u00a0most superheroes\u00a0are still safe even if the boycott calls\u00a0go further\u00a0\u2014 and that's a big if.\n\"I don't think that in this case, the emotions will run hot enough and long enough for any long term damage to be done to the brands,\" said McNeish.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "CannTrust stops selling all of its cannabis as Health Canada probe continues", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canntrust-health-canada-1.5209566", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5208226.1562860574!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canntrust-niagara-greenhouse.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 12, 2019 10:39 AM ET", "2019-07-12T17:07:42.310Z"], "source": null, "content": "CannTrust Holdings Inc. says it has put a hold on product sales and shipments of all its cannabis products as a precaution while Health Canada reviews its Vaughan, Ont., manufacturing facility.\n\"CannTrust is working closely with the regulator through the review process and expects to provide further detail of the duration of the hold and other developments as they become available, the company said in a release late Thursday.\n\"At this time, the impact of these matters on CannTrust's financial results are unknown until the regulatory review process is complete.\"\nThe company said it has also established a special committee of its board of directors to do its own investigation.\nCannTrust said Monday it had been notified by Health Canada that the regulator had discovered unlicensed cultivation at its Ontario greenhouse between October 2018 and March 2019, before the five rooms received the appropriate licences in April 2019.\nIt said as a result, Health Canada put on hold roughly 5,200 kilograms of CannTrust products from that facility, and the licensed producer put a voluntary hold on an additional 7,500 kilograms of pot products which were also linked.\nCannTrust's chief executive Peter Aceto has said that represented the \"majority\" of its inventory and warned of potential shortages ahead.\nOn Thursday, Stenocare, CannTrust Holdings Inc.'s Danish partner, quarantined more medical pot products linked to illegal cultivation at the Canadian company's greenhouse and warned of possible shortages in Denmark as a result.\nStenocare said contrary to the initial information it got from the licensed producer, it has now received documentation that shows that five batches of the Danish company's inventory originated in growing rooms that did not have government approval.\n\"As a result of the new information, all products delivered from Stenocare relating to the batches in question will be put in quarantine, which means that they will be isolated and blocked from being sold until the Canadian health authorities, Health Canada and the Danish Medicines Agency have concluded in the matter,\" the company said in a statement.\nStenocare, which caters to medical cannabis patients, added that \"most, yet not all\" of the CannTrust products in its inventory and that it has supplied to the Danish market since June 10 are linked to the unlicensed cannabis cultivation.\nIt was a reversal of Stenocare's comments earlier this week when it said only one \"very small\" batch was connected to the unlicensed growing, which Health Canada continues to investigate.\nCannTrust announced a joint venture with Stenocare that saw it receive a 25 per cent equity stake in the Danish company in March 2018 and made its first shipment of cannabis oil to Denmark in September 2018.\nThe company was not immediately available to comment on Thursday. Peter Aceto said on Monday that \"mistakes\" were made but CannTrust is working to get back into compliance with Health Canada and is conducting a thorough review to determine what transpired.\nStenocare said it was in close dialogue with the Danish Medicines Agency, which regulates medicinal products in the country, about the matter.\n\"The most likely consequences from this new situation is that there will be a temporary shortage of medical cannabis products to the Danish market,\" the company said in a statement. \"This will have negative financial consequences to Stenocare irrespective of the fact that CannTrust is contractually committed to deliver fully licensed and approved products.\"\nCannTrust's shares traded down another 11 per cent\u00a0to $3.60\u00a0a share Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday.

The structural engineer, who specializes in masonry restoration, also worked on the terracotta dome replacement.\nAt the time, he got caught up in the stories from that era when Alberta was just beginning, and the artifacts left behind.\u00a0\nHe discovered old newspapers from the time of the original construction\u00a0stuffed behind the backup walls of the dome.\nAnd his biggest find? An old cigarette package from the day that he passed on to the Alberta Museum.\nBut what eluded Pacholok then\u00a0was the discovery of a hidden time capsule.\u00a0\nPacholok recounted a story he heard about two men from Vaudeville who came to Edmonton looking for work during the construction.\u00a0\n\"The rumour is they made their own time capsule and hid it,\" Pacholok said.\n\"We were doing a lot of demolition we thought we might find that old time capsule but we never did so,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"Rumour is it's still here.\"\nThere will be a lot of opportunity to keep looking for that time capsule.\u00a0\nThe restoration now being set up on the southwest corner of the building, will move next to the southeast corner then to the final stage on the north side in three years.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Oil prices jump 15% following drone attack on Saudi facility", "description": "Trump authorized use of emergency U.S. oil stockpiles to ensure stable supplies", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-prices-jump-after-attack-1.5284708", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5284714.1568591429!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/saudi-aramco-attacks-official.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 15, 2019 8:03 PM ET", "2019-09-16T00:03:29.925Z"], "source": null, "content": "Oil prices surged more than 15 per cent\u00a0at the open on Sunday on\u00a0worries over global supply and soaring tensions in the Middle\u00a0East.

As such, some materials that were ordered and were in transit prior to the court decision are being received at locations in B.C. and Alberta and safely stored and secured for future use,\" a spokesperson for the company said.\nBut the regulatory work on the project is far from over. The company will first have to make some required notifications and meet\u00a0pre-construction conditions,\u00a0the spokesperson said.\nAnd while it's difficult to pinpoint when it will meet those unspecified conditions,\u00a0the company likely will have to participate in a series of additional hearings with the National Energy Board (NEB) to secure approvals for the company's preferred route.\nCabinet first approved the project in November 2016, when it was still owned by energy giant Kinder Morgan, but\u00a0the NEB only allowed construction work to\u00a0begin\u00a0in August 2018 \u2014 and only on the project's first leg, from the Edmonton terminal to its Darfield pump station near Kamloops, B.C. \u2014\u00a0after months of regulatory meetings.\nThe NEB typically is tasked with signing off on specific corridors \u2014 the TMX project has been divided into four geographically distinct components \u2014\u00a0after considering the best way to mitigate risks to the environment and the people who live along the route.\nBy that measure, construction start dates could still be months away.\nColdwater First Nation, a reserve in the B.C. Interior, has long sought a route change for the project to protect against an oil spill in its only aquifer, which supplies 90 per cent of the reserve's water. The First Nation prefers the \"west alternative\" route that would take the project through another area, farther away from the reserve.\nThe company has opposed this change,\u00a0saying the current route\u00a0is the \"best corridor\" as it uses the existing right-of-way and would not require any crossings of the Coldwater River.\nThe NEB is the entity that adjudicates\u00a0such route disputes. When asked Monday what role the NEB expected to play in the\u00a0future with respect to pending regulatory approvals, a spokesperson declined to comment.\n\"The NEB is not able to speculate as to a Governor in Council decision for the Trans Mountain Expansion Project and is therefore unable to speak to what could follow as a result,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe company already had started digging along the project's route last August when, only days later, the Federal Court of Appeal quashed cabinet approvals and halted construction amid a legal challenge from some First Nations and environmentalists.\nThe court said the federal government did not adequately consult with Indigenous groups and failed to adequately consider how the project would affect marine life in the waters off\u00a0B.C.'s lower mainland.\nThe decision forced workers to down tools and halt all construction activity underway on the massive $7.4 billion project.\nThe project's legal woes are tied in part to the government's failure to \"meaningfully consult\" with Indigenous peoples that would be affected by construction.\nThe government retained retired Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci to reboot the consultation process with Indigenous peoples so the government could meet its constitutional duty to consult with them before making a final cabinet decision.\nThe court called past\u00a0Crown consultation teams \"glorified note-takers\" who documented Indigenous concerns but made few recommendations to cabinet to actually address those concerns.\nThe previous Crown consultation team believed, erroneously, that it could not add more conditions to the project than those the NEB\u00a0already imposed as part of its consultation, the court found.\nThis time, Iacobucci\u00a0and his team of 60 consultants have been told to turn feedback into action\u00a0where possible.\nIf built,\u00a0the 1,150-kilometre expansion project would nearly triple the existing pipeline's capacity to 890,000 barrels a day. It would allow pipeline shipments from Alberta's oilpatch to coastal B.C., and then to markets in Asia. Tanker traffic from the Westridge Marine Terminal near Burnaby, B.C., would increase from about five vessels a month to one a day.\nIn issuing its second \"reconsideration report,\" the regulator\u00a0imposed 156 conditions on the project while also handing Ottawa 16 new non-binding recommendations it said would help address marine safety risks that could result from the addition of more vessels.\nThe cabinet could make its approval conditional on the implementation of those additional recommendations.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Get informed on the top stories of the day in one quick scan", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/morning-brief-february-6262020-1.5476351", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Feb 26, 2020 6:48 AM ET", "2020-02-26T11:51:07.255Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Good morning!

All the major oilsands players have cancelled projects,\u00a0indefinitely delayed final decisions, or dramatically scaled back investments in recent months.\u00a0The industry is facing a perfect storm of low oil prices, legal challenges, regulatory uncertainty, Indigenous opposition, constrained pipeline capacity and a government in Ottawa seized with stopping and reversing the disastrous effects of climate change.  Oil remains Canada's most valuable export, and the volume this country sells abroad is still growing year-over-year, thanks to companies squeezing more from existing operations.\u00a0But long-term growth prospects are in doubt, analysts say.  \"A lot of companies are saying, 'Why bother with Canada, forget it, we're going elsewhere,'\" said Laura Lau, who helps manage $2 billion in assets at Brompton Corp. in Toronto.\u00a0The Frontier project may be the last open-pit mining operation ever pitched in Canada, she said.  \"The political morass we're in, it's a mess,\" said Harrie Vredenburg, a professor of global energy at the University of Calgary's school of business.\u00a0\"What you have are investors or directors of a company like Teck who are saying, 'This isn't the kind of place we want to be investing in.'\"  Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan said Ottawa isn't abandoning the sector.\u00a0 However,\u00a0 the list of projects that companies say they're willing to build is literally shrinking by the day.

Formerly the head of Alberta's prosecution service, Lepp wrote a series of letters to The Fifth Estate in January and February disagreeing with a high-profile defence lawyer\u00a0who had accused the provincial justice ministry of burying evidence that might have exonerated his former client.

Canada will conduct its own flight tests to examine whether\u00a0the grounded Boeing 737 Max fleet is safe to fly after two deadly crashes, the country's top aviation officials say. For decades, countries around the world have relied on the United States to take the lead and certify Boeing aircraft, as they are manufactured there. Other countries then validate that work. But Transport Canada says it is putting in place additional measures to give Canada more independence in scrutinizing the 737 Max fleet, which was grounded in the wake of the crashes. Read more here about Canada's plans to test the aircraft.  Global Affairs briefing papers released by a\u00a0 Commons committee show that Canada's diplomatic corps has been warning politicians for some time that it's dangerous for Ottawa to get too close to China.

Its stock price is under $1.\nThe purchase is part of a plan to move Alberta gas to a yet-to-be-built, $10-billion liquefied natural gas plant in Nova Scotia, from where it would be shipped to Europe. Pieridae says it is eligible for a $4.5-billion loan from the German government for the project.\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator must approve the transfer, a decision it must make as it copes with a growing list of wells, pipelines and other infrastructure abandoned by companies that went bankrupt during the energy price slump.\nSince January, the number of wells transferred to the Orphan Well Association has increased to 3,400 from 3,100. Alberta's cleanup spending is budgeted at $70 million by 2023 \u2014 a more than 50-per-cent increase in otherwise belt-tightening times.\nThe regulator has promised a closer eye on licence transfers to ensure purchasers are able to cover reclamation costs.\n\"We ... are broadening our assessment processes to allow for a more holistic approach to assess a company's ability to address its end-of-life obligations,\" said an email from regulator spokesman Shawn Roth.\n\"The AER will assess the proposed transfer to determine whether regulatory requirements have been satisfied and whether a security deposit will be required.\"\nThe Shell-Pieridae sale is a test case, suggested Shaun Fluker, a University of Calgary law professor.\n\"You would think these assets fit under that discussion,\" he said. \"They keep talking about wanting to rework the existing policy they have for ensuring assets are properly looked after. At some point they're going to have to be proactive and take steps to make sure that happens.\"\nPieridae spokesman James Millar said in an email that Shell will cover any contamination from when it owned the sites \u2014 although that doesn't include the cost of reclaiming the sites themselves.\nMillar wrote that Pieridae is \"still working through\" those costs.\n\"We did consider the asset retirement obligation of the assets before we purchased them.\"\nHe points out that Shell had planned to close the field, which would have been a severe blow to nearby communities such as Pincher Creek. Pieridae plans a new drilling program and says the purchase would be profitable almost right away.\nFluker said Albertans deserve more than company assurances that those who profit from the province's resources are able to clean up their mess. This sale is a chance to establish clear, publicly understood rules for such transfers, he said.\n\"Why not ... impose what [the regulator]\u00a0says it's looking at, which is real timelines for reclamation and things like that? It's a good opportunity.\"\nJudd just wants to be able to believe that the wells and pipelines pumping toxic sour gas near his home will be cleaned up safely.\n\"Our children and our grandchildren are going to end up with an environmental cleanup that is way beyond their capability to deal with,\" he said.\n\"We in Alberta have gotten way too used to backroom deals and backroom regulators that are not transparent.\"\n"}, {"author": "Rhianna Schmunk", "title": "Advent of luxury calendars means the Christmas countdown isn't just for kids anymore", "description": "Traditional 24-day calendars are now filled with alcohol, cheese, even jewelry \u2014 and they're selling", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/holiday-advent-calendar-2019-1.5372650", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5373482.1574803498!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/advent-calendars.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 27, 2019 4:00 AM PT", "2019-11-27T12:00:00.831Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Rebecca Doucette\u00a0lingered at the front of a tea shop\u00a0along\u00a0Robson Street in Vancouver on the second-to-last Friday in November.\u00a0She'd already left the till, purchases tucked away in her bag,\u00a0but she hung back at a shimmery\u00a0display near the open door.\nA glossy blue package accented with crimson trim\u00a0and pale snowflakes was propped open on a display. Two dozen gold numbers were printed\u00a0across two dozen sliding drawers, hiding two dozen teabags\u00a0that counted\u00a0down\u00a0until Christmas Eve.\n\"It's like a little\u00a0mini-present every day,\" said Doucette, 26, glancing down at the holiday advent calendar. \"As an adult, you don't get that much.\"\nAdvent calendars have expanded well beyond the traditional kid-friendly countdowns stuffed with chocolate. Alternative calendars have exploded in recent years, many containing luxury products tailored for adult customers.\nThe concept is\u00a0a marketing\u00a0fantasy, experts say, capitalizing\u00a0on holiday spending merriment\u00a0while pushing a wide range of sample-sized products into consumers' hands.\nThe traditional advent calendar dates back to the 1800s.\u00a0The advent, for some denominations, refers to the four Sundays before Christmas and is said to have begun with countdowns written in chalk for children.\u00a0\nNow, advent calendars can be found filled with full-sized ranges of beauty products, essential oils, specialty teas, vegan gummy bears, artisan cheese, cannabis, luxury perfumes,\u00a0sex toys, short stories, hair scrunchies,\u00a0and \u2014\u00a0at one B.C. market \u2014\u00a0poutine-flavoured dog treats. Alcohol is a common variant, with many calendars filled with either wine, whisky or craft beer.\nThey hit shelves early and sell out quickly, often well\u00a0before Black Friday.\nThe cost isn't always\u00a0modest anymore, either. Tiffany and Co., the Fifth Avenue luxury jeweller, released a six-figure advent calendar in late October.\nMarketing experts say the calendars are a boon for consumer and retailer alike. For the average buyer, they're a way to treat themselves or\u00a0sample a product they've been eyeing all year.\n\"You can't really try more than two perfumes at a time in a store. With this, you could try them over time and, perhaps, see which one you like,\" said Judy Zaichowsky, a marketing professor at Simon Fraser University (SFU) in Burnaby, B.C.\nThe calendars are also a safe\u00a0bet for the dithering\u00a0gift-giver.\n\"Sometimes, people don't know what to get for people and they see this and they think, 'Oh ... there's lots of different things and I don't have to make a decision \u2014\u00a0there's maybe something in there that's really great,\" said Zaichowsky,\u00a0who holds\u00a0a PhD and 40 years of\u00a0experience in marketing.\nRetailers, she added, hope\u00a0the person who ends up with the calendar\u00a0find at least one of the 24 products worth a repeat investment.\u00a0\n\"It's an opportunity to showcase their whole range of product ... they're bound\u00a0to find something there that they do like,\" said Zaichowsky.\nThere are downfalls to the\u00a0trend.\nThe calendars are seldom reusable, often chock-full of single-use packaging that creates a disproportionate amount of waste.\nFor businesses, success\u00a0requires a delicate consideration\u00a0of supply and demand \u2014\u00a0any stock left over after\u00a0Dec. 1\u00a0isn't likely to sell\u00a0for full price.\nDoucette, who's a public policy student at SFU, says she waits to buy\u00a0an\u00a0advent\u00a0calendar when it's on sale a few days into December.

A lack of raw product\u00a0itself isn't one of them.\nThere are still ample supplies of grains, oilseeds, pulses and potatoes. No shortages are anticipated.\nThroughout the food chain, the greatest threats to food security appear where there is a need for a large workforce. Meat and poultry processors have plenty of animals and birds on hand, but have to contend with bottlenecks at their labour-intensive processing plants due to illness.\nProducers of vegetables, who depend heavily on foreign labour and are less mechanized than growers of cereals, oilseeds, pulses and tubers, are also facing short-term difficulties.\nBut some producers say the real threat to food security is\u00a0the danger that many farmers will go bankrupt, and their future production will be lost.\nThe pandemic's\u00a0effects have been uneven. It's been very kind to growers of peas, harsh to those who raise\u00a0hogs.\nFarmers who produce less perishable product for export are mostly doing well. Growers that depend heavily on the domestic food service industry \u2014 such as the people who grow potatoes \u2014 are not.\nAnd even those who depend on exports are still waiting to see what kind of world market for food will emerge on the other side of the pandemic.\n\"There've been a lot of policy decisions that were made under extreme conditions,\" says Greg Cherewyk of Pulse Canada, which represents growers of peas, lentils, chickpeas and similar crops. \"You've got everything from import bans to export control measures in place, all reacting to a very extreme and difficult time.\n\"When we revert back to a more normal environment, what will that new normal look like? That's the question that we're grappling with.\"\u00a0\nThe meat industry's problem is one of capacity: too many animals, not enough processing plants.\n\"We estimate that between 6,000 and 9,000 head of cattle a day are still being backed up within the Canadian beef supply system,\" Bob Lowe of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association told a Commons committee this week.\u00a0\nThe return to operation of Canada's biggest meat-packing plant will not fundamentally change that, Lowe added.\nThe Cargill plant in High River, Alberta was the scene of Canada's largest single-site outbreak of the novel\u00a0coronavirus, with over 1,500 cases,\u00a0counting secondary infections. It represents 36 per cent\u00a0of Canada's beef processing capacity.\nThe cattle industry was granted one of its wishes Tuesday when\u00a0the federal government announced up to $125 million for a \"set-aside program\" \u2014 essentially government money to cover the costs of feeding livestock while they wait to get into a slaughterhouse.\nA similar program was introduced during the BSE crisis in 2004. But even with that program in place back then,\u00a0\"27,000 beef farmers left the industry,\" said Lowe.\nWhile it's estimated that North America's processing capacity for beef is down by at least 10 per cent, the slowdown for hog producers has been even sharper.\n\"Last week in North America, 42 per cent of the plant capacity was closed, so you can just imagine how things start backing up on the farm,\" Rick Bergmann of the Canadian Pork Council told CBC News.\n\"The plants are going as fast as they can. But in Canada, and especially in Eastern Canada, there's still about 140,000 to 150,000 animals that should have gone to slaughter but haven't. These are the ones that are still down on the farm and they're getting bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\"It's easy to turn off the tap at the plant. It's difficult to turn off the tap on the farm, because you're basically working 11 months ahead of time.\"\nAlthough they are eligible for the same set-aside program as cattle raisers, hog farmers are unlikely to find that the money goes far enough.\u00a0\n\"We're taking between a $30 and a $50 hit per hog,\" said Bergmann.\u00a0\"We've been told by our federal government that we're an essential service. We've been told that food security is important for Canadians and for our country.\n\"And we've had multiple conversations with government where we tell them, 'Look, our house is burning down, can you help us?' We need a bit of a fire truck here. And it's been too quiet for our liking.\"\nBergmann\u00a0said\u00a0hog farmers would like the government to provide about $20 per hog to help them stay in business. With 14 million hogs on Canadian farms, that would add up\u00a0to more than the value of the entire\u00a0federal assistance package announced for the agricultural sector this week.\nBergmann said that if a hog farm goes under, its lost production likely won't be coming back any time soon.\n\"We're not making backpacks or coffee mugs,\" he said.\u00a0\"We're making food so people can live.\n\"If producers go out of business\u00a0because they're losing money, then where's our pork going to come from? Is it going to be imported?\"\nChicken production\u00a0is heavily dependent on restaurants and the fast food industry, Lisa Bishop-Spencer of Chicken Farmers of Canada told CBC News.\n\"We've been affected by a significant decrease in the food service business, which represented 40 per cent of the production of chicken in Canada,\" she said.\u00a0\"There has been a rapid increase in demand for retail product, but it hasn't been enough to make up the difference.\"\nCompared to cattle and hog farmers, however,\u00a0chicken farmers have some advantages.\n\"We're a supply-managed commodity,\" said\u00a0Bishop-Spencer. \"We have a little bit of flexibility in our system that allows us to adjust our production according to both consumer demand and the capacities of our value chains.\"\nIn mid-April, the Chicken Farmers of Canada board of directors\u00a0agreed to reduce the sector's May-June output by 12.6 per cent\u00a0nationally, and to cut output for the summer months.\nNot all supply-managed sectors enjoy that luxury. Chicken producers,\u00a0said\u00a0Bishop-Spencer, benefit from a growing cycle shorter than those in the beef and pork sectors, which allows them to reduce output quickly.\nThe dairy sector is also\u00a0supply-managed. But while a chicken farmer can decide to produce fewer chickens, a dairy farmer can't order cows to stop producing milk \u2014 which is why some\u00a0have started dumping milk. But at least\u00a0supply management ensures the\u00a0dumping is done in a coordinated manner, and losses are shared across the sector.\nPotato growers also depend on restaurants, said P.E.I.\u00a0farmer Kevin MacIsaac, president of the United Potato Growers of Canada.\n\"Probably about 70 per cent\u00a0of our industry is dedicated towards the food service industry,\" MacIsaac told CBC News. \"So we just don't have the volume we used to have.\n\"We're probably in one of the most difficult situations that I've seen in my time ...\"\nMacIsaac said there's still a lot of\u00a0product in stock that would normally have been used by now, and orders from french fry manufacturers are down 15 to 25 per cent.\nMacIsaac said matters are even worse for their counterparts in the U.S.\n\"The only thing we've got going for us here in Canada is that the U.S. planting season is probably two to three weeks ahead of ours, so there's a crop planted there that now has to be destroyed,\" he said.\u00a0\"I just saw this in Washington State. In Canada, we still have some opportunity to not plant those potatoes that have no market.\"\nMacIsaac said his organization is advising farmers to plant only enough to cover their contracts. He said he expects many will sow their idle acres with lower-value crops such as wheat, soybeans\u00a0or corn.\nCanada is a world leader in the production of pulses, and few crops are better placed to weather the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic. Pulses are an exportable commodity that can be stored almost indefinitely once canned or dried. Their production is heavily mechanized\u00a0and they don't depend on restaurants being open.\n\"All indications are the product is moving really well,\" said Greg Cherewyk of Pulse Canada. \"Our pea program, which is a big chunk of our exports, is ahead about 500,000 metric tons of where it was this time last year. Lentils are 300,000 tonnes ahead of where we were same period last year.\n\"The COVID-19 crisis has actually led to a bit of a spike in demand in North America for pulse products. Things like shelf-able products, canned and dry-packaged goods are moving. It's what's been called the 'plan-for-the-worst' trend.\n\"Some of the processors we're dealing with are saying that sales are up about 40 per cent. Others are saying that shipments are as much as 400 per cent\u00a0higher than where they were last year. It's safe to say we've benefited from that effort to make sure the pantry is stocked.\"\nCanada's wheat farmers also are\u00a0doing well.\n\"We are seeing a little bit of an uptick in demand that has been caused by the pandemic,\" said Cam Dahl of Cereals Canada. \"There had been some concern that exporters like Russia and other countries around the Black Sea might limit exports, and that has increased interest in other countries because of food security. I'm seeing very strong demand in other countries for Canadian grains and oilseeds.\"\nDahl said the high degree of mechanization has helped the industry, but it's not the only factor.\n\"It is a technology-intensive industry, that is for sure,\" he said. \"But it's also because the entire sector has taken steps to ensure the protocols are in place at the country terminals where farmers bring their produce and throughout the chain.\"\nWheat, durum, barley and oats remain in good supply and the system is running smoothly, from inland elevators to railway terminals and ports, and from fertilizer plants to flour mills.\nBut even the\u00a0Canadian agriculture sectors\u00a0that are weathering the pandemic best have\u00a0doubts about the future.\nAll predict a post-pandemic world where countries are thinking more about self-sufficiency\u00a0and are less inclined to rely on imports.\n\"Prior to COVID-19, we were seeing a steady increase in what I would call economic nationalism,\" said\u00a0Dahl. \"There were more and more market access issues cropping up that either had the potential to limit trade or actually were limiting trade.\n\"I expect that to accelerate. I expect that protectionist bent to be more problematic as we come out of the pandemic.\"\nCherewyk\u00a0agrees.\u00a0\n\"We've all experienced a bit of a shift away from a rules-based trading environment into one where there's less transparency and less predictability,\" he said.\u00a0\"With the emphasis on ensuring that food supply is safe and stable and secure enough to meet domestic needs, what will those efforts look like?

The venerable Montreal daily La Presse\u00a0stopped its presses almost three years ago after 133 years of appearing on newsprint.\nAt first the switch from print to a proprietary\u00a0tablet-based publishing tool was not an unmitigated success, said Am\u00e9lie Daoust-Boisvert, an assistant professor of journalism at Concordia University in Montreal and a former reporter for Le Devoir. Part of the evidence that it was no longer a big money earner was that in 2018 the\u00a0owners of the title, Canada's Desmarais family, spun it off into a social trust, effectively a non-profit foundation.\nBut now,\u00a0after a difficult patch that involved serious cost-cutting, La Presse appears to be back on the road to success, said\u00a0Daoust-Boisvert.\n\"I suppose it's not easy for everyone there, but it's encouraging news that they are still publishing every day,\" she said.\u00a0\nAs a non-profit, the financial success of the Montreal paper\u00a0is harder to read, but according to\u00a0their own report last month, despite a large payout to lay off unionized printing staff, the decision by La Presse to stop the presses has been a success story. The board of directors reports this year's operational\u00a0deficit is falling and the paper is heading for a balanced budget next year.\nThat is a positive sign in a business where traditional daily papers continue to hemorrhage money, including just last month the McClatchy group of 30 papers including the Miami Herald and the Kansas City Star. So far the papers continue to operate in bankruptcy, but the company said plunging ad revenue and falling subscriptions finally\u00a0pushed them over the edge.\nFor more than a decade, since the collapse of one of their most important\u00a0sources of revenue, classified ads, quality broadsheet newspapers have been struggling to find a business model that works.\nEarly suggestions that online news had to be free\u00a0were replaced by paywalls, which seemed to work for specialty papers like the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times with the stature to attract online subscriptions.\u00a0The Guardian in the United Kingdom decided to\u00a0offer\u00a0their product free, depending on online ads aimed at their\u00a0large readership, while begging loyal readers for donations. But none of those three have given up their print editions.\nKaren Unland, one of the first editors for the online version of the Edmonton Journal back in 2007, says while so many newspapers remain committed to paper editions, the cost of printing, distribution and house-to-house delivery remains enormous.\n\"It's very expensive to do,\" says Unland, who now runs her own successful online news business for the Alberta capital, called Taproot Publishing.\n\"I felt really strongly that we needed to kill the print product so we could fully concentrate our resources,\" said Unland, remembering her time at the Journal. \"But at the time that was crazy talk.\"\nSince then,\u00a0online-only publications such as The Athletic or Business Insider\u00a0have crowded into the market, offering specialty service for a price, while avoiding printing costs.\nFor both La Presse and The Independent, the model they have chosen is similar to the Guardian's but without the cost of running printing presses\u00a0and distributing a physical newspaper.\nIt is a model that\u00a0Jeff Elgie, CEO of Village Media, based in Sault Ste Marie, Ont.,\u00a0has shown can work in small markets as well as large.\nThe profitable company, that now has editions in 12 Ontario communities as well as affiliates outside the province, earns 70 per cent of its revenue from local advertising from dedicated regional sales reps, 15 to 20 per cent from Google-style ads, and the rest from local contributions and the licensing of their publishing technology to other papers.\nElgie says, rather than paywalls, the company uses its reach to attract advertisers. But, unlike existing papers, the 15-year-old company has one big advantage.\n\"We're not hindered by legacy issues. You know, we don't have large buildings and printing presses and distribution facilities,\" he said.\nElgie says his readership, while appealing to all ages, skews younger, and being fully online offers an intangible aura of representing the future instead of the past.\n\"There's a stigma attached to being a newspaper,\" he said. \"You're for parents or grandparents.\"\nFor\u00a0established papers\u00a0struggling to survive, parents and grandparents still addicted to a physical newspaper may simply be\u00a0too important to the bottom line to ignore. But one day soon that will change.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Oliver Skinner", "title": "Forests, rowdy nightlife and one slippery sea lion: An artist's guide to falling in love with London", "description": "Writer Oliver Skinner is here to show you that London is much more than just a college town or pit stop", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/arts/forests-rowdy-nightlife-and-one-slippery-sea-lion-an-artist-s-guide-to-falling-in-love-with-london-1.5233713", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234679.1564763822!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/i-he-art-my-city-london.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 02, 2019 1:00 PM ET", "2019-08-02T17:00:33.341Z"], "source": "CBC Arts", "content": "Everyone knows about the art scenes in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver \u2014 but what about Calgary, Yellowknife or Saint John? In CBC Arts's continuing series \"I He(art) My City,\" a local artist offers an insider's guide to the city they call home. Here, writer Oliver Skinner shows you his London.\nTo some, London, Ontario may not appear to be much more than a pit stop between the metropolises of Detroit and Toronto. Yet, as the 2019 JUNO Awards and the spotlight they shone upon London proved, when it comes to vibrant cultural scenes, the mid-sized city is a covert major player.\nWhether you're a resident looking to expose yourself to some arts and culture, or a stranded visitor in desperate need of an itinerary: here is my London.\nThis 300-acre park stretches along the border of the Thames River, linking a variety of neighbourhoods throughout the city. As preteens, my friend Nicole and I often hit Springbank's trails on our bikes to head downtown and stock up on used books or go to the movies. When the weather is favourable, the park is populated by picnickers, runners, skaters\u00a0and families heading to Storybook Gardens, a nursery rhyme-themed children's park.\nIf you're wondering what the bronze statue of a sea lion near Storybook Gardens' entrance signifies, it actually makes for an engrossing saga. The park was once the abode of Slippery, a California-bred sea lion who, in 1958, mysteriously escaped the confines of the park, plunged into the Thames River and swam all the way to Lake St. Clair, through the Detroit River and across Lake Erie. Slippery was eventually discovered at the mouth of Ohio's Maumee River \u2014 a solid 400km from his starting point, and almost a direct route back to his birthplace. About half of London's population lined the streets to witness Slippery's return.\nBy this point, readers will have noticed the amount of London landmarks named for their British progenitors. And although I've never stepped foot in London, England's famed Covent Garden, I wouldn't hesitate to call our version a worthy successor. The indoor market is brimming with local vendors selling fresh produce, making it the ideal spot to do your groceries or grab lunch.\nThe market's mezzanine is home to the Original Kids Theatre Company, where I spent many an adolescent hour rehearsing and performing plays and musicals. Besides being a revered theatre training program for youth ranging from 8 to 18, the company offers London audiences the year-round opportunity to catch top-notch productions put on by budding talent. While many of its alumni \u2014 including Rachel McAdams \u2014 have gone on to successful careers, I have fond memories of OKTC fostering the importance of the ensemble and giving children a safe space to play and come into their own.\nAfter playing host to the JUNO Awards earlier this year, London's stature as a musical city has caught on nationwide. But any resident will tell you that that spirit has been present from the get-go. The JUNOs ceremony was held at Budweiser Gardens, which serves as the city's main venue for major acts passing through on tour. But if you're here for the summer, almost every other weekend presents the occasion to revel in live music outdoors.\nSunfest puts together a diverse roster of artists from across the globe to perform for free each year at Victoria Park. Harris Park sets the stage for Rock the Park, a popular music festival which routinely lands massive names (recent headliners include Snoop Dogg and Cyndi Lauper). The London Music Hall of Fame on Dundas Street is devoted to telling the story of London's musical history. And construction is currently underway on Dundas Place, a pedestrian-motorist flex street that acted as London's inaugural Jurassic Park during the NBA playoffs, and which will no doubt be the site of countless concerts in the near future.\nLondon is a college town, so when the school year picks up each September you can count on its nightlife to follow suit, for better or for worse. Western University was the only Canadian school this decade to make Playboy Magazine's list of the top 10 party schools, and you can see it living up to its rowdy reputation any Friday or Saturday night on Richmond Row, a downtown strip of restaurants, bars and clubs.\nWhile I'll steer clear of the strip if I'm not in the mood for drunk university students, it does feature some staples of London's nightlife, from the lineup of people waiting to get into Joe Kool's to the patio of The Ceeps, a historic tavern that first opened its doors over a century ago. Pro tip: sober up after a night on Richmond Row at Stobie's, a beloved pizzeria that serves generously-sized slices.\nGrowing up, this independently-owned cinema served as a bit of a sanctuary to me. It was the only place in town where I could watch each year's winner of the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or on the big screen, including The Tree of Life three times in the span of a week. I also have cherished memories of assembling groups of friends for packed midnight screenings of cult classics like Blue Velvet and Dazed and Confused.\nI must give a shoutout to Imagine (fka Rainbow) Cinemas, where I once held a job scooping popcorn and which remains an affordable and more laidback alternative to Cineplex. If you're around in October, be sure to check out the Forest City Film Festival, which showcases projects produced by filmmakers from Southwestern Ontario. And in May, catch the London Lesbian Film Festival \u2014 the longest-running film fest of its kind.\nA brief stroll from downtown, Old East Village is filled with restaurants and shops well worth wandering off the beaten path to discover. It's also where you'll find the Palace Theatre, which recently unveiled plans to merge the London Community Players and the London Fringe Festival to form a powerhouse theatrical organization in the city. Before or after a night of theatre at the Palace, you'll have no regrets by crossing the street to Unique Food Attitudes, a cozy Polish eatery with a mouthwatering menu.\nLondon is nicknamed the Forest City. As someone who grew up in newly developed suburbs on the outskirts of town, so much of my meandering adolescence involved purposefully getting lost in the forest along the banks of the Thames. The Kains Woods conservation area holds a place in my heart simply because it was where I spent so much of my time idling about, shooting short films with friends and crossing paths with deer and wild turkey. Although housing developments like the one I inhabited are aggressively widening the city borders every day, London boasts a multitude of secluded nature paths that pose the perfect getaway whenever you need a breather.\nSo, if any of the inner city destinations I've highlighted aren't hitting the spot \u2014 or, frankly, if London is just not for you \u2014 I'd recommend both long-time Londoners and tourists alike try making like Thoreau and wandering deep into the woods, far, far away from civilization. Even when I feel most at home I am no stranger, like Slippery the vagabond sea lion, to standing at the water's edge and contemplating where it might carry me if I dived in.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1572086851778", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1572086851778", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Netflix's U.S. subscriber growth slowing as competition looms", "description": "Netflix added 520,000 subscribers from the U.S. from July to September, below the 800,000 management expected", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-subscriber-growth-slowing-1.5323517", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323539.1571260153!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/netflix-results.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 16, 2019 5:16 PM ET", "2019-10-16T21:38:54.991Z"], "source": null, "content": "Netflix's subscriber growth is bogging down even before the leading video streaming service confronts high-powered threats from Apple and Walt Disney Co.\nThe latest sign of the challenges facing Netflix emerged Wednesday with the release of its third-quarter results. The numbers provided further evidence that Netflix's salad days may be over, particularly in the U.S., where most households that want its 12-year-old streaming service already have it.\nNetflix added 6.8 million subscribers worldwide from July through September, below the 7 million customers forecast by the Los Gatos, California, company. Just 520,000 of those subscribers were picked up in the U.S., below the 800,000 that management anticipated. The shortfall came after Netflix lost 123,000 subscribers in the U.S. during the April-June period, marking its first contraction in eight years.\nThat downturn and the uncertainty about the service's future growth is the main reason Netflix's stock had dropped by about 30 per cent\u00a0below its peak price of $423.21 US reached 16 months ago. Netflix's shares surged by 8 per cent\u00a0in extended trading Wednesday, apparently because some investors had been bracing for an even bigger letdown in the third quarter.\nFor the third quarter, Netflix's net income rose to $665 million, or $1.47 per share, from $403 million, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier.\nTotal revenue rose to $5.25 billion from about $4 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.52 billion.\nIn the next earnings report, Netflix will begin disclosing revenue and membership by regions - Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East/Africa, Latin America and the United States, the company said.\nNetflix said it expects to add another 7.6 million worldwide subscribers during the final three months of the year, down from 8.8 million during the same period last year. The more conservative outlook amounted to a concession to the new entrants in the streaming market.\n\"The launch of these new services will be noisy,\" Netflix advised in its third-quarter letter to shareholders. \"There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance.\"\nThe big question now is whether some of Netflix's existing subscribers will decide to cancel its service and defect to cheaper alternatives that Apple and Disney will launch within the next month.\nApple is charging only $5 per month for its service, set for a Nov. 1 debut, while Disney is selling a service featuring its vast library of treasured films and TV shows for just $7 per month beginning Nov. 12. Netflix's most popular plan in the U.S. costs $13 per month.\nNetflix is counting on the unique lineup of award-winning TV shows and movies that it has amass since expanding into original programming six years ago to help it retain its competitive edge and attract more subscribers.\nIt has taken advantage of its head start in video streaming to track the viewing interests of millions of households around the world, giving it valuable insights into the kind of programming that is most likely to appeal to wide swaths of its audience.\nThat knowledge, in theory, will help it pick and choose which TV shows and movies to back in the future as it bids for programming against the likes of Apple, Disney and existing rivals such as Amazon and AT&T's HBO.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/emily-lau-is-the-former-chair-of-the-hong-kong-democratic-party-and-a-former-member-of-the-legislative-council-she-talks-to-cbc-news-network-s-janet-stewart-about-protests-that-shut-down-the-hong-kong-airport-1.5246448", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Bartley Kives", "title": "No cause for panic \u2014 or celebration: Downtown Winnipeg developers driven by profits, not altruism", "description": "Proposed sale of Portage Place is no bellwether for downtown Winnipeg, but it could ease the housing crunch", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-downtown-construction-analysis-1.5208967", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5202133.1563475132!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winnipeg-portage-place-mall.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 13, 2019 6:00 AM CT", "2019-07-13T11:00:00.353Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In a slow-growth city like Winnipeg, there's a tendency to cheer the appearance of every new downtown construction crane.\u00a0\nFor nearly 30 years, pretty much nothing over six storeys went up in the heart of the city.

As a status update, \"doing better but not good enough\" is neither a cause for concern or celebration.\nIt's also why some skepticism is required when you consider both the\u00a0jubilance and alarm that followed the announcement Portage Place is about to be sold.\nToronto-based Starlight Investments intends to buy the Portage Avenue mall for nearly $70 million and build a pair of residential towers above two pads, designed precisely for that purpose when the mall was completed in 1987.\nCivic boosters have already seized on\u00a0this plan as proof downtown has\u00a0become\u00a0more attractive to investors. Some left-of-centre analysts have raised concerns this would amount to gentrification and the displacement of downtown's existing residents.\nA quick look at the underlying real estate market conditions suggests both of those opinions are off the mark.\nThe main reason the sale of Portage Place is proceeding right now, where it did not in the past, is that the The Forks North Portage Partnership\u00a0was previously unwilling to part with the parkade below the mall, out of fear The Forks would be deprived of the revenue it needed to get by. For decades, The Forks only survived because of the Portage Place parkade revenue.\nBut the non-profit organization has been generating more of its own cash in recent years, partly by replacing cheap long-term leases signed when The Forks Market was desperate for tenants\u00a0with more lucrative rental agreements.\nNow, The Forks is in a better position to wean itself off the parkade revenue. This allows the mall to be sold to a buyer who can then count on the parkade revenue to offset the financial liability associated with\u00a0purchasing a 32-year-old mall that's saddled with an abandoned Imax theatre,\u00a0a trio of empty conventional movie theatres and other vacant spaces.\nPortage Place also appears to have deferred maintenance issues and most definitely suffers from a perception of being unsafe.\nBut the mall has a lot of things going for it, too, despite its reputation. While Portage Place failed at its intended task of revitalizing downtown in the late 1980s, it has become a vital community space for inner-city residents, many of them newcomers who live in the populous Central Park neighbourhood.\nThe two pads on either end of the mall allow a new owner to build a pair of residential towers at a much lower cost than needed to build\u00a0from the ground up. And Winnipeg still has a demand for residential apartments, especially new stock, and will continue to experience this demand as long as newcomers continue to arrive in what the rest of Canada views as a very stable market.\nThere are few bargains on\u00a0this scale in fast-growing cities such Vancouver and Toronto. It is reasonable to expect Starlight to build apartments suitable to Winnipeggers of relatively modest means\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the company has already indicated it intends to provide\u00a0some student housing.\nThis is why the Winnipeg boosters must be taken with a grain of salt. Outside investors are swooping in to engage in some bargain shopping, not to place a bet on a steamy market.\nLikewise, fears about gentrification also seem misplaced. The addition of any new rental apartment units in Winnipeg will reduce the pressure on the existing housing market, where middle-class renters are displacing lower-income tenants right now.\nThe new towers should also lure more retailers back to the mall itself, after residential tenants move in. Similar forces drove the construction of the new tower under construction right now on the south end of Winnipeg Square, at the corner of Graham Avenue and Main Street.\nWhen the City of Winnipeg owned the parkade below Winnipeg Square, the old owner of the mall had no incentive to build a tower on the south pad.\nNow, Artis Real Estate Investment Trust owns the mall, the parkade and the new tower rising above it all. It had a pad in place to reduce construction costs on the tower\u00a0\u2014 and should be able to hike parkade fees to meet the increased demand that will\u00a0inevitably\u00a0result from more people living at this address.\nUnlike residential apartments, parking facilities\u00a0are not subject to rent controls in this province. This is one reason parking lots and parkades make for attractive investments.\nIf all of this sounds a little clinical, it should. Real estate investment tends to be governed by the expectation of profit, as opposed to some loftier, community-minded goal.\nSo go ahead and cheer on that construction crane. It doesn't mean anyone believes in Winnipeg, per se.\u00a0\nIt means a developer believes there's a dollar to be made\u00a0\u2014 and if that results in more students living downtown, so be it.\n"}, {"author": "Bartley Kives", "title": "No cause for panic \u2014 or celebration: Downtown Winnipeg developers driven by profits, not altruism", "description": "Proposed sale of Portage Place is no bellwether for downtown Winnipeg, but it could ease the housing crunch", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-downtown-construction-analysis-1.5208967", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5202133.1563475132!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winnipeg-portage-place-mall.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 13, 2019 6:00 AM CT", "2019-07-13T11:00:00.353Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In a slow-growth city like Winnipeg, there's a tendency to cheer the appearance of every new downtown construction crane.\u00a0\nFor nearly 30 years, pretty much nothing over six storeys went up in the heart of the city.

Some left-of-centre analysts have raised concerns this would amount to gentrification and the displacement of downtown's existing residents.\nA quick look at the underlying real estate market conditions suggests both of those opinions are off the mark.\nThe main reason the sale of Portage Place is proceeding right now, where it did not in the past, is that the The Forks North Portage Partnership\u00a0was previously unwilling to part with the parkade below the mall, out of fear The Forks would be deprived of the revenue it needed to get by. For decades, The Forks only survived because of the Portage Place parkade revenue.\nBut the non-profit organization has been generating more of its own cash in recent years, partly by replacing cheap long-term leases signed when The Forks Market was desperate for tenants\u00a0with more lucrative rental agreements.\nNow, The Forks is in a better position to wean itself off the parkade revenue. This allows the mall to be sold to a buyer who can then count on the parkade revenue to offset the financial liability associated with\u00a0purchasing a 32-year-old mall that's saddled with an abandoned Imax theatre,\u00a0a trio of empty conventional movie theatres and other vacant spaces.\nPortage Place also appears to have deferred maintenance issues and most definitely suffers from a perception of being unsafe.\nBut the mall has a lot of things going for it, too, despite its reputation. While Portage Place failed at its intended task of revitalizing downtown in the late 1980s, it has become a vital community space for inner-city residents, many of them newcomers who live in the populous Central Park neighbourhood.\nThe two pads on either end of the mall allow a new owner to build a pair of residential towers at a much lower cost than needed to build\u00a0from the ground up. And Winnipeg still has a demand for residential apartments, especially new stock, and will continue to experience this demand as long as newcomers continue to arrive in what the rest of Canada views as a very stable market.\nThere are few bargains on\u00a0this scale in fast-growing cities such Vancouver and Toronto. It is reasonable to expect Starlight to build apartments suitable to Winnipeggers of relatively modest means\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the company has already indicated it intends to provide\u00a0some student housing.\nThis is why the Winnipeg boosters must be taken with a grain of salt. Outside investors are swooping in to engage in some bargain shopping, not to place a bet on a steamy market.\nLikewise, fears about gentrification also seem misplaced. The addition of any new rental apartment units in Winnipeg will reduce the pressure on the existing housing market, where middle-class renters are displacing lower-income tenants right now.\nThe new towers should also lure more retailers back to the mall itself, after residential tenants move in. Similar forces drove the construction of the new tower under construction right now on the south end of Winnipeg Square, at the corner of Graham Avenue and Main Street.\nWhen the City of Winnipeg owned the parkade below Winnipeg Square, the old owner of the mall had no incentive to build a tower on the south pad.\nNow, Artis Real Estate Investment Trust owns the mall, the parkade and the new tower rising above it all. It had a pad in place to reduce construction costs on the tower\u00a0\u2014 and should be able to hike parkade fees to meet the increased demand that will\u00a0inevitably\u00a0result from more people living at this address.\nUnlike residential apartments, parking facilities\u00a0are not subject to rent controls in this province. This is one reason parking lots and parkades make for attractive investments.\nIf all of this sounds a little clinical, it should. Real estate investment tends to be governed by the expectation of profit, as opposed to some loftier, community-minded goal.\nSo go ahead and cheer on that construction crane. It doesn't mean anyone believes in Winnipeg, per se.\u00a0\nIt means a developer believes there's a dollar to be made\u00a0\u2014 and if that results in more students living downtown, so be it.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Drone attack in Saudi Arabia hits world's largest oil processing facility", "description": "Yemen's Houthi rebels claim attack that sparked huge fire at processor crucial to global energy supplies", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/drone-attack-saudi-arabia-yemen-houthis-1.5283837", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5283842.1568458454!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/saudi-aramco-fire.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 14, 2019 7:12 AM ET", "2019-09-14T23:35:30.451Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Drones launched by Yemen's Houthi rebels attacked the world's largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia and another major oilfield Saturday, sparking huge fires at a vulnerable choke point for global energy supplies.\nThe drone attacks affected up to half of the supplies from the world's largest exporter of oil, though the output should be restored within days, multiple news outlets reported and Saudi Arabia's energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz later\u00a0confirmed. He stated the country will make up for some of the loss with oil stocks, while the U.S. Energy Department released their own statement saying the U.S. \"stands ready to deploy resources from the Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserves if necessary to offset any disruptions to oil markets.\"\nIn a statement released by the Saudi Press Agency, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz said explosions at Saudi Aramco's Khurais and Abqaiq plants caused several fires that were controlled, but there were no injuries.\nRising smoke from the fires at the sites could be seen by satellites in space.\nFirst word of Saturday's assault came in online videos of giant fires at the Abqaiq facility, some 330 kilometres\u00a0northeast of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Machine-gun fire could be heard in several clips alongside the day's first Muslim call to prayers, suggesting security forces tried to bring down the drones just before dawn. In daylight, Saudi state television aired a segment with its local correspondent near a police checkpoint, a thick plume of smoke visible behind him.\nThe attack by the Iranian-backed Houthis in the war against a Saudi-led coalition comes after weeks of similar drone assaults on the kingdom's oil infrastructure, but none of the earlier strikes appeared to have caused the same amount of damage. The attack likely will heighten tensions further across the Persian Gulf amid an escalating crisis between the United States\u00a0and Iran over its unravelling nuclear deal with world powers.\nThe\u00a0Houthis, who hold Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and other territory in the Arab world's poorest country, took responsibility for the attacks in the war against a Saudi-led coalition that has fought since 2015 to reinstate the internationally recognized Yemeni government. But the U.S. blamed Iran, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeting, \"There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\"\u00a0\n\"Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply,\" Pompeo added\nIn a short address aired by the Houthi's Al-Masirah satellite news channel, military spokesperson\u00a0Yahia Sarie said the rebels launched 10 drones in their co-ordinated attack after receiving \"intelligence\" support from those inside the kingdom. He warned that attacks by the rebels would only get worse if the war continues.\n\"The only option for the Saudi government is to stop attacking us,\" Sarie said.\nIn a statement released Saturday, the UN's Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths called the attack \"extremely worrying.\" They implored\u00a0all sides to exercise restraint, and\u00a0not\u00a0\"complicate the already fragile situation and jeopardize the UN-led political process.\"\nLater, U.S. President Donald Trump called Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to offer his support for the kingdom's defence, the White House said. The crown prince assured Trump that Saudi Arabia is \"willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression,\" according to a news release from the Saudi Embassy in Washington.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Riyadh said it was unaware of any injuries to Americans. Saudi Aramco employs a number of U.S. citizens, some of whom live in guarded compounds near the site.\nSaudi Aramco describes its Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq as \"the largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world.\"\nThe facility processes sour crude oil into sweet crude, then later transports onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Estimates suggest it can process up to seven\u00a0million barrels of crude oil a day.\nThe plant has been targeted in the past by militants. Al-Qaeda-claimed suicide bombers tried but failed to attack the oil complex in February 2006.\nThe Khurais oilfield is believed to produce over a\u00a0million barrels of crude oil a day. It has estimated reserves of over 20 billion barrels of oil, according to Aramco.\nPrince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz\u00a0said that according to preliminary estimates, 5.7 million barrels a day of oil production were lost, and the supply of ethane and natural gas also was cut by about half.\nHe said Aramco will provide updated information within 48 hours of restoring full production.\nThere was no immediate impact on global oil prices as markets were closed for the weekend across the world. Benchmark Brent crude had been trading at just above $60 US a barrel.\nWhile Saudi Arabia has taken steps to protect itself and its oil infrastructure, analysts had warned that Abqaiq remained vulnerable. The Rapidan Energy Group, a Washington-based advisory group, warned in May that \"a successful attack could lead to a months-long disruption of most Saudi production and nearly all spare production.\" It called Abqaiq\u00a0\"the most important oil facility in the world.\"\nThe Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies separately issued its own warning just last month.\n\"Though the Abqaiq facility is large, the stabilization process is concentrated in specific areas \u2014\u00a0including storage tanks and processing and compressor trains \u2014 which greatly increases the likelihood of a strike successfully disrupting or destroying its operations,\" the centre said.\nThe war has become the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The violence has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine and killed more than 90,000 people since 2015, according to the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED, which tracks the conflict.\nHouthi rebels have been using drones in combat since the start of the Saudi-led war. The first appeared to be off the shelf, hobby kit style drones. Later, versions nearly identical to Iranian models turned up. Iran denies supplying the Houthis with weapons, although the UN, the West and Gulf Arab nations say Tehran does.\u00a0\nThe rebels have flown drones into the radar arrays of Saudi Arabia's Patriot missile batteries, according to Conflict Armament Research, disabling them and allowing the Houthis to fire ballistic missiles into the kingdom unchallenged. The Houthis launched drone attacks targeting Saudi Arabia's crucial East-West Pipeline in May as tensions heightened between Iran and the U.S. In August, Houthi drones struck Saudi Arabia's Shaybah oilfield, which produces some one\u00a0million barrels of crude oil a day near its border with the United Arab Emirates.\nUN\u00a0investigators said the Houthis' new UAV-X drone, found in recent months during the Saudi-led coalition's war in Yemen, likely has a range of up to 1,500 kilometres.\nThat puts the far reaches of both Saudi Arabia and the UAE in range.\n"}, {"author": "Rachel Ward", "title": "Do chuckwagon races amount to 'cruel' abuse or save horses from slaughter?

I have seen some idiots with hotshots poking cattle in the chutes, etc. But my experience is they are the exception, and any cowboy worth his salt will call them out on it.\n\"However, I find myself in agreement with a call to ban chuckwagon racing, and all horse racing, in fact. Too many young horses that are not fully developed yet, too many injuries or deaths. Too many discarded racehorses that won't find a quality life after racing. Some do, but most don't. After watching the wreck last night, Harden should be banned from the sport completely. My two cents.\"\nDawn MacNeill: \"Every year we say, 'Wonder how many horses are going to die this year,' so that their owner can be in a race like the ol' cowboys did in the olden days.

In July last year, they noticed there had been 132 calls for service in the vicinity of the bar over a six-month period and the \"high volume of calls suggested an emerging crime trend requiring attention.\"\nOn Sept. 21, 2018, \"Constable F\" posed as a drug buyer and visited Sammy.\u00a0The pair met at the bar and negotiated a cocaine purchase, then went just outside the front entrance to complete the transaction. The officer then met Sammy again on Nov. 2 \u2014 this time inside the bar, near\u00a0the VLT machines\u00a0\u2014 and bought more cocaine.\nAll this information, including the altered names, comes from the written decision of an AGLC\u00a0panel, which spent days hearing an appeal from the bar owner, after the provincial regulator temporarily shut the place down.\nIn May, the AGLC suspended the liquor licences of\u00a0Cowboy's Taphouse and its sister location in Airdrie\u00a0\u2014 indefinitely. It's one of the harshest sanctions the regulatory body can hand down. The bar owners quickly appealed and the\u00a0suspensions were stayed, pending the outcome of that appeal, allowing both pubs to continue operating in the meantime.\nAnd while the hearing panel found the licensees guilty on three of four offences (narrowly dismissing the fourth on the grounds that it couldn't be proven whether Sammy actually worked at the bar), both Cowboy's locations are still open for business, their liquor licences intact for the time being.\nThe status of their appeal, described as one of the longest and most complex the AGLC has ever heard, is now unclear, after the UCP government dismissed the majority of the AGLC board in mid-August\u00a0\u2014 including two of the three members on the hearing panel. The move came as part of a widespread purge of more than a dozen boards, commissions and agencies across the province.\nExperts in board governance say the purge will, at best, delay the outcome of the appeal and, at worst, undermine the legitimacy of the process, opening up the AGLC's ultimate decision to be challenged, potentially in court.\nMore broadly, one of the dismissed panel members believes the government acted rashly when it let six trained board members go in favour of\u00a0four new appointees \u2014 two of whom have since resigned. He worries not just about the Cowboy's case, but about the larger implications of so much turnover at the top of a\u00a0multibillion-dollar organization that oversees Alberta's policies on liquor, gaming and cannabis\u00a0\u2014 just as legal edibles are about to enter the market.\nBob Wyatt knew his days on the AGLC board were numbered when the UCP won April's provincial election. Appointed by the previous NDP government in 2018, he figured he would finish out his three-year term, which would then not be renewed.\nInstead, he says, he got a phone call from Finance Minister Travis Toews on Aug. 15, thanking him for his service and informing him that his appointment had been rescinded. He was one of four board members to have their positions rescinded, while two others' positions were not renewed.\n\"I was surprised that six of the seven board members had been removed \u2026\u00a0rather than keeping some group of us around for continuity,\" said Wyatt.\nThe following day, the Alberta government issued a press release announcing the appointment of four new board members\u00a0\u2014 including two who resigned weeks later.\nOne of those appointees owns a pub in Calgary. The other had worked previously as a senior executive for one of the largest liquor retailers in Canada. Both of these facts were trumpeted in the news release as credentials, which made Wyatt wonder whether the new government had read the Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Act.\nSection 53(1) of the act says no liquor licence may be issued \"to or for the benefit of a person who is a member of the board\" or \"in respect of any premises if a member of the board \u2026\u00a0holds an interest in the premises.\"\nDoes that section of the act preclude a current pub owner from sitting on the board? And could it preclude a former liquor-store executive, if that person still derived any financial benefits, such as a pension or stock holdings, from the company?\nThe AGLC referred all questions about the legality of these appointments to the finance minister, who is responsible for appointing board members. But Toews declined to be interviewed for this story and his press secretary,\u00a0Jerrica Goodwin, refused to answer specific questions about whether the appointments were consistent with the law governing the AGLC.\nGoodwin would only say in, an email, that both resigned \"to pursue personal business interests and opportunities.\"\u00a0She did not reply to repeated questions asking whether these appointments were consistent with provincial law in the first place, if the minister believed they were legal\u00a0or if the law had anything to do with the resignations.\nLegalities aside, having\u00a0people with connections to the liquor industry on the AGLC board could be problematic because it could create a conflict of interest, or at least the appearance of one, says George Cuff, an Edmonton-based consultant who advises organizations on good governance.\n\"It strikes me that you would be really on thin ice,\" Cuff said.\n\"Somebody could readily say you're in a conflict of interest. And normally the perception of conflict of interest is almost as damning as the conflict\u00a0itself.\"\nThat's no longer an issue, given the two board members resigned in September. But Wyatt worries the additional turnover may further delay some of the AGLC's critical functions, including the outcome of the Cowboy's Taphouse matter.\nIt's unclear what happens next with the appeal.\nWhile the hearing panel had reached a decision on the licensees' violations \u2014 which include lying to AGLC investigators\u00a0\u2014 it didn't have a chance to decide on the proper penalty, including whether to uphold the indefinite liquor-licence suspensions.\nGiven \"the seriousness of the matter,\" the original panel\u00a0wanted to convene another hearing \"for the sole purpose of addressing the issue of sanction,\" but\u00a0two of the three panel members were removed from\u00a0the AGLC board before that could happen.\nThe AGLC says it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment on the status of the case, since it is ongoing.\nWyatt, who was a member of the original panel that spent four days hearing evidence and arguments from\u00a012 witnesses and three lawyers, believes the entire process will need to be re-done.\n\"As far as I understand it, they'll have to have the hearing all over again,\" he said. \"The new panel cannot simply accept the evidence or accept the decision of the previous panel.\"\nCuff, however, believes it would be possible for the old panel's decision on violations to be maintained and for a new panel to be convened to determine the sanction, alone. But, he says, the unusual nature of such a procedure could provide an opportunity for the licensees to challenge the entire process.\n\"A\u00a0good lawyer is going to say ... 'Look, we've got a whole new case here. We need to go back and start from the start or, given the amount of time that's gone by, let's waive it altogether,'\" Cuff said.\n\"So I think whoever's involved in this instance is probably rubbing their hands together, thinking that this process is likely flawed as result of the change in government,\u00a0and therefore their chances of getting a more favourable hearing have just shot up.\"\nPriyambia Bedi is described in the original panel's decision as the majority shareholder of the Cowboy's Taphouse in Airdrie and bookkeeper and manager of the Calgary location. Reached by CBC News, she said she expects another hearing \"very soon\" but didn't want to comment further, other than to say she is not upset by the way the process has unfolded.\n\"I don't have any complaints,\" she said. \"It's all good.\"\nBeyond the Cowboy's matter, Wyatt worries about other implications that could stem from the period of upheaval atop the AGLC.\nThe AGLC\u00a0typically convenes about 30 panels a year to hear appeals, but board members are responsible for more than just deciding these cases. They also must guide the organization's strategic direction and monitor\u00a0its business plans.\nWyatt expects cannabis will continue to be one area where the new board will need to focus its attention, in particular, especially with edible products recently legalized and due to hit the market soon.\nThree new board members were appointed last week through an order-in-council, more quietly than before. No press release accompanied the appointments this time.\nAll three of the newest appointees have previous experience on other types of boards, and Cuff says people in that position can typically get up to speed on a new board quite quickly.\nAnd while the additions will bring the board's size to six members (plus the president and CEO, who isn't eligible to sit on hearing\u00a0panels), Cuff believes that's still too small. For an operation with the scale and scope of the AGLC, he says there should be at least nine and as many as 11 members.\n\"This is one of the largest government agencies that there is,\" Cuff said. \"It has a very significant impact in terms of the funding that flows from AGLC to the provincial government.\"\nThe AGLC employs about 1,000 people and, last year alone, it directed $2.3 billion to the provincial government's coffers, through its various revenue streams, primarily gaming and liquor. Its cannabis operations, so far, are running at a net financial loss.\n\"So you're not talking about your run-of-the-mill public sector agency; you're talking about one that has a huge impact,\" Cuff said.\n\"The government has to be very, very careful in terms of who it appoints.\"\n"}, {"author": "Terry Roberts", "title": "How a leaner, regulated Nalcor could save millions and better protect consumers", "description": "Liberty Consulting is proposing a dramatic shakeup at embattled Crown corporation in the Muskrat era", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/nalcor-muskrat-mitigation-1.5309082", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5273846.1567796924!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/muskrat-falls.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 05, 2019 7:00 AM NT", "2019-10-05T09:30:00.488Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Newfoundland and Labrador's energy corporation, already described as \"downtrodden\" by one of its leaders, is coming under more scrutiny and criticism as efforts intensify to keep electricity rates affordable in the Muskrat Falls era.\nOne of the cost-saving recommendations for the corporation is the elimination of\u00a0100 positions\u00a0at\u00a0the executive, management\u00a0and supervisory level sfor an annual savings of up to $21 million. Others include having the corporation be fully scrutinized by the Public Utilities Board, and\u00a0stripping away Nalcor's power supply division and integrating it into one of its subsidiaries, Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro.\nThese and other recommendations in a sweeping report by Liberty Consulting could lead to a\u00a0shakeup at the powerful government-owned corporation and create a \"unified and more effective operating entity,\"\u00a0Liberty's John Antonuk\u00a0told the Public Utilities Board during hearings in St. John's on Thursday.\nThe moves\u00a0would eliminate duplication, save millions in salary costs, and ensure Nalcor is subject to the full scrutiny of the utility regulator to ensure a circumstance like the one imposed by Muskrat is not repeated, Antonuk explained.\nLiberty says a workforce reduction of five to 10 per cent at Nalcor is achievable\u00a0and could begin now.\nAntonuk did not mince his words.\n\"The execution of that effort will show that here or there, somebody does have too many people reporting to him or her.\"\u00a0\nHe referred to N.L. Hydro as \"substantially over the norm\" with respect to employee numbers.\n\"Even with these reductions, Nalcor will remain above Crown corporation comparators in staffing and numbers,\" he added.\nLiberty is also recommending that Nalcor be fully scrutinized by the utility regulator, much like N.L Hydro and Fortis-owned Newfoundland Power.\nThe Lower Churchill project, which includes the Muskrat generating station and a massive network of transmission assets, was exempt from PUB oversight when it was approved at an all-in cost of $7.4 billion in 2012.\nThe price tag has since ballooned to $12.7 billion, and is threatening to send electricity rates into the stratosphere when the project is commissioned in two years, which is why the utility regulator is now holding public hearings to hear options on how that can be avoided.\nWithout PUB oversight, Antonuk said Nalcor \"will be empowered to make capital investments and expend operating costs without the discipline either of the market or of regulation.\"\n\"In our view it's difficult to understand why that should be the case for Nalcor,\" he said.\n\"There's nothing about them that makes them infallible. There's nothing about them that makes them better than the industry as a whole. There's nothing about them that makes us think regulation is less useful from a customer perspective.\"\nMuskrat's financing framework puts the entire cost burden on ratepayers, and Antonuk\u00a0sees that as a problem that should not be repeated on a project like Gull Island, if it's ever sanctioned.\n\"If you continue to look at advancing energy projects by transferring what we consider owner's\u00a0risk to customers, then we think that is troublesome,\" he said.\nAs for Nalcor's\u00a0power supply division, which was established by CEO Stan Marshall in 2016 as the project was in crisis, Liberty believes it should be folded into Hydro.\nThis division is responsible for the operation of Muskrat's generating and transmission assets, and its integration into Hydro would \"create a structure much more typical of a small, vertically integrated utility,\" said Antonuk.\nHe said most of the job losses would be at the senior management level, and produce \"substantial savings.\"\nLiberty was one of two consulting companies hired by the board, and Antonuk and other members of his team appeared at hearings Thursday and Friday.\nIt was clear from their presentation that paying the Muskrat mortgage \u2014 beginning at $726 million in 2021\u00a0\u2014 will severely test the limitations of a province already teetering on a financial cliff.\nThe firm is recommending that government subsidize power rates by hundreds of millions each year, which could set up a scenario where ratepayers get a break, but taxpayers\u00a0\u2014 essentially the same group of people\u00a0\u2014 are forced to shoulder the Muskrat burden.\nAntonuk\u00a0acknowledged that political leaders face a daunting task.\n\"As tough as our work was, we did the easy part when it comes to making those kind of judgments,\" he said.\nLiberty has identified $200 million in rate mitigation opportunities for 2021,\u00a0composed mostly of the dividends the province will receive from its $3.7-billion equity investment into Muskrat construction.\nThat figure grows to nearly $600 million by 2039, and could help mitigate rates by more than 12 cents.\nThis money will not appear out of thin air, since the provincial government is still required to pay back the massive amount of money it borrowed to build Muskrat. Yet Premier Dwight Ball has pledged to keep rates affordable, and avoid tax increases.\nBut that won't be easy.\n\"These are not net new dollars. These are dollars moved from another source to mitigation,\" said Antonuk.\n\"We've created a large pot here. The larger the pot, the better it looks for rate mitigation. Well, the larger the pot, it's tougher for the province to figure out how to do without that money. So it's really going to have to come down to affordability from the province's perspective.\"\nRead more\u00a0from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "John Last", "title": "On housing, local authorities bemoan territory's 'paternalistic' policies", "description": "Local authorities, contractors point finger at the N.W.T.

Then, that house needed repairs, and she had to find another home for her family.\nShe's now sharing her sister's \"one-person\" house with six people. The unit has mould, and her child's health has been affected. But her sister has been on a waiting list for five years already.\n\"It's very stressful,\" she said. \"You get depressed.\"\n\"It makes me feel sad for my kids, that they don't have their own place to stay.\"\nGreen's story is not unusual in the territory, where the N.W.T. Housing Corporation\u00a0oversees 2,400 public units in 33 communities. In some places, like Paulatuk, those units\u00a0make up the majority of the housing stock.\nBut conversations about housing are taking on a new urgency as local authorities, contractors, and residents push for changes to \"paternalistic, colonial\" policies in the public housing system during territorial and federal campaigns.\n\"People across the North are facing the same crisis,\" said Jason Snaggs, chief executive officer for the Yellowknives Dene First Nation. \"The enormity of it is so great that, in my opinion, we need the equivalent of a Marshall Plan for housing, particularly within Indigenous communities, and in the North.\"\nPart of Snaggs's work is overseeing the local housing authority in Detah and Ndilo, where more than 70 per cent of houses are publicly-owned.\n\"It's a very difficult relationship,\" he said. \"We have limited control.\"\nSnaggs said eligibility rules mean residents are asked to pay expensive market rates when their salary increases by as little as $50.\nEven residents who aren't on restricted incomes have no options when it comes to housing. Government policies make it impossible to secure a mortgage to build on Yellowknives Dene land.\nThat means aging housing stock is left to decay.\n\"If you come to Ndilo and Detah you will see \u2026 houses that are derelict, abandoned,\" he said. \"There needs to be changes.\"\nDerelict houses are a sign of core housing need, a term used by housing authorities to measure the number of households either too expensive for their residents or otherwise inadequate \u2014 in need of major repairs, for example, or overly crowded.\nAccording to a 2014 survey, just under one in five households in the territory fit this definition. But in some communities, it's far worse.\nIn Wrigley, more than half of households surveyed in the 2016 census fit this description, with more than 40 per cent needing major repairs.\nIn Behchoko, one in five houses were crowded. In K'atl'odeeche First Nation, almost a third were unaffordable, meaning residents spent more than 30 per cent of their income on rent.\nBut even those numbers may underestimate the scale of the problem. In a different community survey, produced for the housing authority in 2017, more than half of respondents said housing conditions had gotten worse.\nEven where the territory is trying to tackle the problem of limited and degrading housing, its approach to contracting is raising serious questions.\nIn 2015, the housing corp. began construction on a new housing complex in Fort Good Hope, which a representative told the community would be \"the most expensive nine-plex in the N.W.T.\"\nAccording to Heather Bourassa, a local contractor, the contract was awarded to Tee Jay Contracting, a Fort Good Hope-based company owned by territorial candidate and former Sahtu\u00a0grand chief Wilfred McNeely, Jr.\n\"The project has been on again, off again,\" said Bourassa. For a while, it stalled \u2014 materials degraded and had to be replaced, and paint froze.\n\"It was just a bit of a gong show,\" she said.\nRecently, Bourassa said, the work on the nine-plex was taken over by Energy Wall, a Yellowknife-based contractor.\nThe crew, flown in to work on the job, was given a public housing unit to stay in.\nAs of 2016, 57 households in Fort Good Hope were living in inadequate or unsuitable conditions. The housing corporation's 2017 survey said nine applicants were on a waitlist for housing.\nIn an open letter to Tom Williams, the president of the N.W.T. Housing Corporation, Bourassa's brother, Robert, said \"the use of government accommodations is prohibited\" to contractors.\n\"There is a housing shortage,\" the letter concludes. \"[We] can't see any justification for putting a contractor in front of the people of Fort Good Hope.\"\nTom Williams and the N.W.T. Housing Corporation declined an interview for this piece, citing the ongoing election.\nThough increasing access to affordable housing was in the mandate of the 18th Assembly, the last government actually significantly decreased its contribution to the housing corporation \u2014 by almost 18 per cent from 2015 levels.\nThe federal government, by contrast, is contributing virtually the same amount now as in 2015, and actually boosted its contribution significantly in the intervening years.\nThe feds also signed an almost $140-million, 10-year agreement last year to provide \"long-term and predictable funding.\"\nDespite those boosts, the housing corp.\u00a0still projects a nearly $5-million deficit by 2020 \u2014 a year in which the territorial government plans to drop its contribution by nearly $6 million.\nOn the ground, the territory's decreased investment has had real consequences.\n\"We don't seem to build houses here anymore with government funding,\" said Sean Whelly, mayor of Fort Simpson. \"I'd say that the private market has done more to alleviate the strains here than the government has in the last five years or so.\"\nWhelly said private companies recently renovated about 20 units in town using funding from a discontinued housing\u00a0program.\nThe housing corp.\u00a0also contributed a few modular houses that \"looked like places designed for the High Arctic,\" he said, \"almost like leftovers from other failed projects.\"\nFort Simpson has had a strained relationship with the N.W.T. housing corporation since July, when it fired the local housing board and appointed a replacement.\nAt the time, the outgoing director said local boards were no more than \"window dressing\"\u00a0to give the appearance of local control.\u00a0\nWhelly said the incident was \"unfortunate\" and a \"distraction,\" but echoed complaints about the corporation's relationship with communities.\n\"I don't think there's a lot of consultation as to what kind of housing a community wants,\" he said. \"There's always \u2026 dog-and-pony shows going around, or whatever, but in the end they just do what they want.\"\nAlfred Moses, the housing minister, declined an interview for this story.\nSince its survey in 2017, the territory has done some things to make it easier for residents to take advantage of housing programs. It eliminated co-payments for several repair and maintenance programs, and committed to providing customer service training to all staff.\nIn some areas, it also committed to develop new housing policies in consultation with local governments.\nIn April, for the first time in a decade, the housing corporation hosted a Northern Housing Summit, bringing together bureaucrats, experts, and leadership from across Canada.\nOne of the speakers was Shelagh McCartney, director of Ryerson University's Together Design Lab, which is working with Yellowknives Dene First Nation to develop a locally-designed housing plan.\nShe said communities in the N.W.T. lack large parts of the \"housing continuum\" \u2014 a spectrum of supported and unsupported housing that ranges from homeless shelters to transitional homes, to market housing.\nMcCartney said committing to long-term, stable funding and allowing communities to dictate their demands is key to community wellness.\n\"I know politicians might not like that advice,\" she said, \"but when we think about wellness, and allowing people to see their future, and plan for that future \u2026 longer term funding is something that would work very well.\"\nSnaggs, the CEO of Yellowknives Dene First Nation, agrees.\n\"They also need to realize it's not about bricks and mortar, and wood,\" he said.\nOther government departments should get involved in developing financial literacy, helping communities with planning, and making sure housing is \"holistic,\" he suggested.\n\"They have to move away from the colonial past of the policies which do not help people,\" he said. \"As a matter of fact, they put them down.\"\nHe's seen some movement from the territorial government. In a letter he received earlier this year, Moses and Tom Williams, the housing corporation president, committed to provide $110,000 in funding for an $800,000 community plan, he said.\nBut\u00a0they haven't seen the money yet.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/chief-of-police-mark-saunders-provides-an-update-on-gun-violence-in-toronto-1.5246792", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Brianna Sharpe", "title": "5 stylish Canadian yoga wear brands committing to more sustainable practices", "description": "These makers are striving for greener production \u2014 and not sacrificing on look or feel in the least", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/life/style/5-stylish-canadian-yoga-wear-brands-committing-to-more-sustainable-practices-1.5230319", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5230567.1564511603!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/yoga-brands.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 30, 2019 3:00 PM ET", "2019-07-30T19:00:39.310Z"], "source": "CBC Life", "content": "When it comes to clothes, no doubt about it, Canadians love athleisure. Market research company The NPD Group found that although Canadian apparel sales decreased a bit in 2017, activewear brands were still going strong; with $6.2 billion in sales, these brands made up 23 per cent of the overall apparel and basics industry. At the same time, more mindful buying is on the rise. A full third of respondents in a recent PwC Canadian consumer insights survey said they actively seek out sustainable, environmentally friendly products, while 28 per cent said they opt for brands with sustainable practices when shopping.\nWith these trends in mind, we've rounded up five yoga brands that prioritize sustainable practices without sacrificing style.\u00a0\nPrana Vida\u00a0\nPrana Vida uses fabric that's mainly a blend of Tencel Lyocell fibre and organic cotton (not to mention, Lyocell makes the leggings feel silky and look sleek). Currently, some spandex is used for stretch, but the brand's creator Amelia Barnes says she is working to source a new fibre, Sorona, to make the leggings fully biodegradable. The material is also OEKO-TEX certified, which means it meets high standards of environmental and human safety. Plus, the brand boasts a range of sizes (from 00 to 24) and a maternity-friendly line.\u00a0\u00a0\nSeed\u00a0\nNot only do Seed pants look hip as heck, the brand's clothing is comprised of mainly hemp and organic cotton, with just four per cent spandex. Owner Blake Ward says that 80 per cent of Seed pants in stock are dyed using the roots and leaves of plants \u2014\u00a0no synthetics added (when produced in small quantities, as Seed's clothing is, these dyes can be low-impact). While the clothes are already manufactured in Calgary, Seed's goal is to produce all of its clothing from local hemp crops by 2020 too.\u00a0\nZen Nomad\u00a0\nAlthough Zen Nomad's clothing is certainly boho-inspired, the neutral colour palette and simple lines add balance to their aesthetic. The natural fibres the company uses, from organic cotton to Tencel Lyocell to hemp, require minimal or no pesticides to grow, and owner Sonja den Elzen sometimes hand-harvests the plants and dyes the materials herself. She saves and uses the leftover scraps from manufacturing, and also makes a point of buying the overstock fabrics from bigger designers, thereby repurposing what would otherwise have been waste.\nInner Fire\nIf you've tried on a pair of Inner Fire leggings, you may have noticed their smooth, form-fitting feel,\u00a0but you may not have realized that they're made from recycled, BPA-free water bottles. According to a 2016 study from the World Economic Forum, at least eight million tonnes of plastic leaks into the ocean every year, so while these leggings aren't biodegradable, repurposing post-consumer water bottles means less plastic in landfills, thus less in our oceans. Passionate about the health of local waterways too, B.C.-based Inner Fire has raised money to support the Standing Rock water protectors.\u00a0\nRespecterre\nEach item in Respecterre's down-to-earth yoga collection is made in an ecovillage in Quebec. La Cit\u00e9 \u00c9cologique aims to eliminate overstock waste; several pieces of their clothing are made to order, and when you do go to check out, you'll be given the option of plastic-free packaging. For many companies, using fabrics with eco certifications can be out of reach, but many of Respecterre's textiles meet OEKO-TEX standards.\u00a0\nBrianna Sharpe is an Alberta-based freelance writer, educator and chronically caffeinated parent.

Barron.\nThe plan was to keep it that way when Strategic Group bought it, but then the oil crash happened, said Ferguson.\n\"We put a redevelopment plan together that we worked on since 2012 to convert the building \u2014\u00a0double the floor plate \u2014\u00a0into an office building while still respecting the architectural characteristics of the building,\" Ferguson said.\n\"Unfortunately,\" he added, \"our plan was completed and permitted in 2015 where things came\u00a0to a little bit of a stop in the office industry.\"\nNow\u00a0the interior is being reconfigured into residential units, with an expected opening in 2020.\nThat same phenomenon\u00a0came into play a few years ago, when Alberta Health Services announced it wasn't renewing its lease at another Strategic Group building, known as the Cube, on 11th Avenue S.W., across from the Midtown\u00a0Co-Op.\nRather than trying to find a new tenant to replace their departing one, the company decided to\u00a0repurpose the building as apartments.\nFerguson said the combination of design\u00a0and location made it an appealing candidate.\n\"We looked at the building over what might happen in the next 10 to 15 years as an office building,\" Ferguson said, \"and we looked at our costs and our returns on converting it to residential \u2014 and due to the location and the physical structure of the building, it was ideal for repurposing.\"\nThe building contains 67 suites. Ferguson described it as \"more of a jewel box type building\"\u00a0than a lot of the high rise style apartments downtown, which distinguishes it from them, and as the thinking goes, appeals to a different sort of demographic.\n\"There is a big propensity and a big demand for purpose-built rentals in the city of Calgary today,\" Ferguson said.\n\"That could mean singles, it could mean empty nesters. It could mean new citizens moving into the city and even into the country.\"\nThe Cube is still under construction on its exterior, but has people living in it already.\n\"We're particularly proud of the Cube,\" Ferguson said, \"because it's the first repurposing project that we're delivering into the two big markets in Alberta.\"\nStrategic is also converting several office buildings in Edmonton into residential towers, for the same reason they're doing it in Calgary: older stock offices can't compete with new office buildings in a shrinking office demand economy.\nBut, Gray asked, what about the condo gluts that exist in both cities?\nFerguson suggested that there's room for rental units, particularly when compared with aging rental stock in both cities.\n\"The two youngest cities by a demographic in the country are Calgary and Edmonton and a young population,\" Ferguson said. \"Remember, our average age is 35, and a young population has a greater propensity to rent than to buy.\n\"The second leading economic indicator is the fact that our rental inventories in the two big cities in Alberta,\u00a0greater than 50 percent of that inventory was built prior to 1976 \u2014 so there's tranches of inventory every year that are becoming functionally obsolete.\"\nIt's not cheap to convert office buildings into residential units. The Barron Building conversion will cost $44M, while the Cube's is around $24.5M\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but Ferguson said it beats the alternative.\nWill it change downtown Calgary?\nCould a\u00a0ghost town\u00a0transform into something resembling a community?\n\"It can absolutely change,\" Ferguson said.\nWith files from The Calgary Eyeopener\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "China reports 25 more coronavirus deaths as Germany reports its 1st case", "description": "Death toll in China rises to at least 106", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-lunar-new-year-extended-1.5441383", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5441588.1583869245!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-health.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 27, 2020 6:48 AM ET", "2020-01-28T09:15:13.539Z"], "source": null, "content": "China reported 25 more deaths in its coronavirus outbreak on Tuesday, bringing the death toll to at least 106.\nAuthorities said 24 of the deaths were in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak that first began in December, and one in Beijing.\nWhile a new national total number of deaths was not provided, the count was last at 81, which would make the total now at least 106.\u00a0\nShortly before the new figures from China were released, Germany confirmed its first case of the virus.\u00a0Bavaria's health department said a man in the town of Starnberg, 30 kilometres\u00a0southwest of Munich, has been confirmed as having the virus.\nThe patient is in \"good condition\" and isolated under medical observation, Bavaria's health department said in a statement posted on its website.

Over a year, larvae resembling minuscule willow leaves drift along in the Gulf Stream to destinations spanning from the Caribbean to Greenland.\nBy spring, they have become tiny eels, and millions swim the final stretch through brackish estuaries to rivers in Nova Scotia. Here they will mature into adult American eels and spend between four and 40 years, before finally returning to the Sargasso Sea to spawn.\n\"It's quite an amazing story,\" said Rod Bradford, an aquatic biologist with DFO who provides science advice on the status of American eel in the Maritimes.\nIt's during that spring run that dozens of fishermen in Nova Scotia and southern New Brunswick, working under nine tightly regulated licences, set their nets in the dark to catch upwards of seven\u00a0tonnes of elvers.\nEels are difficult to breed in captivity, which means aquaculture facilities in Asia must depend on \"seed\" stock. The elvers\u00a0that are legally fished in the Maritimes are packed in a little water, chilled in ice and put on airplanes to China.\nWhen they reach market size, they are split down the back, gutted\u00a0and often fried into a dish called kabayaki. It is particularly popular in Japan, which accounts for 70 per cent of the world's eel consumption.\nIn the early years, following the first licences in the\u00a01980s, fishing for elvers in Nova Scotia generated little more than cottage-industry income, as little as\u00a0$25 a kilogram. By 2006, the price sat at about $110.\nBut in 2010, Europe banned the export of elvers following a 20-year crash in population that led to the European eel being declared critically endangered.\nAs supply declined, elver prices shot up. By 2015, the elvers in the Maritimes were being sold for an astonishing $4,685 a kilogram. Last year's price kept pace at $4,500.\nA burgeoning black market has followed.\nJennifer Ford, DFO's regional manager for resource management, said the implications of that are significant. There's been a recommendation\u00a0to list the American eel as threatened in Canada, following declines in the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River area. A decision has been pending for several years.\nAs a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, Canada must show it has control over the elver fishery\u00a0or could face export restrictions that would shut down the industry.\n\"At this point we feel that the species is sustainably managed and that the fishery is going well,\" Ford said in an interview. \"But there are risks if we can't demonstrate that fishery is being managed sustainably.\"\nAnd things can quickly get out of hand.\nIn Maine, poaching became such a problem that last year, the state was forced to shut down the fishery early. Dozens of people have been charged in a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service investigation called Operation Broken Glass. Some have even gone to prison.\nLast year, Spanish and Portuguese police busted a smuggling ring they say was preparing to send five tonnes of baby eels to China in 364 suitcases.\nEuropean police believe as much as 100 tonnes of\u00a0elvers were\u00a0illegally exported in 2018, in what the conservation group Sustainable Eel Group calls \"one of the planet's greatest wildlife crimes.\"\n\"That's a cautionary tale,\" said Genna Carey, an elver fisherman in Nova Scotia and the president of the Canadian Committee for a Sustainable Eel Fishery. \"We don't want to be there.\"\nThe legal elver industry in Nova Scotia remains guarded. Carey, for instance, is reluctant to detail fishing techniques, worried it will provide a blueprint to poachers.\nAnd they are out there. The local elver world is a small one, so it's easy to know who's an outlier. Given elver fishing\u00a0is done in remote areas and at night, when the creatures\u00a0are on the move, there are also safety concerns about bumping into poachers in the dark.\nWhen Kiley was sentenced earlier this month, federal prosecutor Derek Schnare called the case \"a very serious regulatory crime with far-reaching consequences,\" one that amounted to \"the black market destruction of the fishery.\"\nKiley, 31, who has a criminal record that includes drug and weapons offences and aggravated assault,\u00a0had been on the radar of fisheries officers long before the undercover operation that targeted him. The season before, both he and his brother had been under surveillance and charged for illegal elver fishing.\nIn April 2017, according to an agreed statement of facts at his sentencing, the pair smashed the window of a former Esso station in Sable River, N.S. Getting inside, they then hauled off 20 kilograms of elvers being stored there, and that\u00a0had been legally fished under the licence of Waycobah First Nation in Cape Breton.\nRCMP and fisheries officers later searched a property in Shelburne, charged the brothers\u00a0and retrieved 17 kilograms of elvers.\n\"It's a very lucrative business, is all I can tell you, for a very few people,\" said Brian Decker, owner of the building that was broken into.\n\"And that's where the problem comes in. Lots of money for just a handful of people, and other people want to get in onto it and they can't because it's controlled by the fisheries, for licensing and whatnot.\"\nThe next season,\u00a0DFO kept a close eye on Kiley and a small group seen fishing in a brook off the LaHave River in Nova Scotia's Lunenburg County. It included his common-law wife, a member of the Acadia First Nation in southern Nova Scotia.\nKiley is not Indigenous, and Schnare told the court he had been poaching under \"the guise\" of his partner's food, social and ceremonial\u00a0fishery licence.\nOn May 8, 2018, using the email address curtis_kiley69@hotmail.com, Kiley contacted two people in the elver industry, asking if they wanted to buy. Both were suspicious, and the emails were forwarded to DFO.\nTwo weeks later, federal fisheries officers set up their sting. One contacted Kiley by text, posing as a buyer named Danielle looking to ship elvers to Hong Kong. She was in Toronto, but would return to New Brunswick in a week.\n\"Well, I live in Halifax and wanna meet up with soon as u get back, and well we got a couple different groups doing it and all of us together got around 250kgz,\" Kiley wrote in one text, later upping the amount to 250 to 300 kilograms.\nHe even offered to inquire about a \"dummy company\"\u00a0to handle the money, and said he would sell the elvers for just $1,500 a kilogram, about a third the price of the legal market but one that would still net hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nWhen he was arrested, Kiley had about 300 grams of elvers. DFO remains circumspect about what happened to the remaining 250-300 kilograms. A spokesperson said it cannot divulge that information as a co-accused who was allegedly with Kiley when he met the undercover officer will be going on trial next month.\nKiley ultimately pleaded guilty to various fisheries and criminal charges. He\u00a0was sentenced to $17,500 in fines and two years probation, and was given\u00a0five months in jail for the break-in and another case involving a stolen car.\nAs part of a pre-sentence report, he told a probation officer he'd faced financial problems and been motivated by money. He suggested police had been \"picking on him.\"\nThere is one remarkable aspect to the sentence. For two years,\u00a0Kiley is barred from being within 20 metres of any inland waterway, except if he's driving by.\n\"First time I've seen an order like that,\" said Sperry, with DFO enforcement.\nLast week, on a river near Chester, N.S., fisheries technicians from the non-profit Coastal Action unlocked a series of boxes wedged under a bridge and scooped out elvers, to be weighed and measured before being released upstream.\nThe work has gone on for more than two decades\u00a0and represents one of the longest-running elver \"recruitment\" studies in North America. The numbers help dictate quotas for the local fishery and determine which rivers can be fished.\nIn recent years, between two million and four million elvers each spring climb have climbed this waterway,\u00a0which means the news, at least in Nova Scotia, is good.\n\"The indications are that we have moved beyond the low point in eel abundance, at least here in the region,\" said Bradford.\n"}, {"author": "Richard Cuthbertson", "title": "Inside the secret, million-dollar world of baby eel trafficking", "description": "Undercover Canadian government operation highlights global concerns around smuggling to feed Asian demand", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/baby-eels-poaching-trafficking-nova-scotia-1.5183556", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5185576.1561389033!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/elver-fishing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 25, 2019 6:00 AM AT", "2019-06-25T13:41:19.663Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In the parking lot of an\u00a0Irving gas station in Aulac, N.B., not far from the Nova Scotia border, Curtis Kiley popped the trunk of a Toyota Corolla.\nInside was a white bucket containing what looked like a giant hairball, the type that might be pulled from a bathtub drain.\nExcept it was alive \u2014\u00a0a wriggling, slithering mess.\nThis was just an initial sample Kiley had brought to show a prospective\u00a0black-market buyer, a woman he knew only through text message as \"Danielle.\"\nHe was ultimately hoping to unload up to 300 kilograms of the tiny creatures, a huge haul worth $1.3 million on the open market,\u00a0but one he was offering at a steep discount.\nMoments later, Kiley's world turned from dollar signs to handcuffs.

The numbers help dictate quotas for the local fishery and determine which rivers can be fished.\nIn recent years, between two million and four million elvers each spring climb have climbed this waterway,\u00a0which means the news, at least in Nova Scotia, is good.\n\"The indications are that we have moved beyond the low point in eel abundance, at least here in the region,\" said Bradford.\n"}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "Vancouver's lasting 2010 Olympic legacies, from big arenas to iconic art", "description": "Vancouver projects successfully integrated into the community, says city's former chief planner", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/olympic-legacies-2010-vancouver-list-1.5460374", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5460605.1581628107!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancouver-olympic-public-art.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 15, 2020 8:00 AM PT", "2020-02-15T16:00:00.402Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "No grand monuments\u00a0\u2014 but no white elephants either.\u00a0\nWhen considering the physical legacy of the 2010 Olympics,\u00a0the impact to Vancouver was subtle compared to most host cities, says Vancouver's chief planner at the time.\u00a0\n\"I remember doing interviews about why there wasn't any\u00a0famous architect coming to town to do big famous buildings, as if that was the most important and best illustration of success for an Olympics,\" said Brent Toderian.\n\"It\u00a0wasn't about who the name of the architect was, it was about the success of these facilities after the Games as great additions to the livability of our communities.\"\u00a0\nIn Metro Vancouver, the number of facilities for the games was relatively small,\u00a0but all of them \u2014 the new Convention Centre, Olympic Village, the Richmond Olympic Oval, Hillcrest Centre\u00a0and UBC Winter Sports Centre\u00a0\u2014 are used on a daily basis today, most of them repurposed from how they were set up during the Olympics.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It's\u00a0fun to take someone to Hillcrest and ask them 'would you have guessed that this was where Olympic curling was held?'\" said Toderian, referring to the curling site converted into a community centre with a swimming pool, hockey rink and public library.\n\"People will not necessarily guess that, but what they will do is marvel about what a great community facility it is ... that's\u00a0a very Vancouver thing, in the sense that it didn't err\u00a0on the side of being sexy and superficial. What it was, at the end of the day, was eminently practical and successful.\"\nWATCH our breakdown of every single Olympic legacy\nThe everyday impact of the Olympics in Whistler is more direct, with facilities built for the games still being used in the same way.\n\"Those amenities that were put on the ground in our community have been lasting,\" said Whistler Mayor Jack Crompton.\u00a0\n\"We've found value in them.\u00a0We've seen kids\u00a0that are born and raised in this town become Olympians.\"\nThose include the Whistler Olympic Park for ski jumping, biathlon and cross-country skiing, and the Whistler Sliding Centre for bobsleigh, luge and skeleton.\nThe biggest impact for Whistler, though, was arguably the Athletes Centre and Olympic Village\u00a0\u2014 built further south in Chekamus Crossing, the village and surrounding land transferred to the municipality, allowing it to expand its stock of non-market housing.\u00a0\n\"That piece of land allowed us to make a huge jump forward,\" said Crompton, who says that 50 per cent of Whistler-based employees now live in resident-restricted housing, available only to locals and with\u00a0covenants that deter speculation.\u00a0\n\"It's a huge benefit to our community that allows us to participate in the world tourism economy in a way we couldn't otherwise.\"\nOne of the most pervasive legacies of the Olympics, however, may be something that had nothing to do with the core purpose of the Olympics.\u00a0\n\"Being the games, it's not their main focus, art. But we made our space,\" said Connie Watts, project manager for the 2010 Aboriginal\u00a0Art Program.\u00a0\nWatts, an artist of\u00a0Nuu-chah-nulth, Gitxsan and Kwakwaka'wakw ancestry, oversaw a team of people that selected pieces of Indigenous art\u00a0placed at every venue.\u00a0Many of them can still be viewed to this day, including Susan Point's\u00a0Spindle Whorls outside Hillcrest Centre, the Truce Installation and Salish North Star in Olympic Village, and the rebuilt Sacredness of Four\u00a0structure outside Trout Lake Community Centre.\u00a0\n\"I really wanted it to reflect the diversity of a culture. And the fact that we're represented and strong and extremely creative as a people,\" said Watts.\u00a0\nThere are\u00a0other exhibits that were commissioned for the games that also become well-known,\u00a0including Ken Lum's iconic\u00a0East Vancouver sign\u00a0and the giant birds\u00a0at\u00a0the Olympic Village.\nBut the smallest artistic legacy?\u00a0There was a large vase-like\u00a0structure called\u00a0Garde-Temps placed under the Cambie Street Bridge, turning different colours throughout the night.\u00a0\nIt's gone now, but the podium for it remains\u00a0\u2014 a reminder of how legacies can come in all shapes and sizes.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "SAQ open to collecting deposits on glass bottles, but it won't collect the empties", "description": "Crown corporation says it just doesn't have the space to store empty bottles", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/saq-glass-bottle-recycling-deposit-system-quebec-1.5245263", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4969485.1546920485!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/wine.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 13, 2019 1:25 PM ET", "2019-08-13T17:25:26.358Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Quebec's liquor control board has, after years of steadfast opposition to wine and liquor bottle returns, come out in favour of collecting deposits on glass containers.\nBut somebody else will have to collect the empties.\n\"Our branches, which are increasingly limited in size, don't have the space to take back 100 per cent of our inventory,\" SAQ president and CEO Catherine Dagenais told a legislative committee on Monday.\nThe committee\u00a0is looking into the matter of glass recycling across the province \u2014 a system that currently sends nearly three quarters of collected glass to landfills.\nThe SAQ sells some 200 million bottles a year, Dagenais explained, and its 404 outlet locations just aren't equipped to handle that volume of empty containers.\u00a0\nExpanding storage in all of its\u00a0locations isn't possible either, she said, because many are signed into long-term leases in tight rental\u00a0spaces.\nEven if the agency did collect the bottles, what would it do with them? Sending them back to suppliers is out of the question, Dagenais said, because the agency has more than 3,000 suppliers in 81 countries.\u00a0\nIn her testimony to the committee, she said the wine and liquor bottles sold by the SAQ account for about half of the glass found in recycling bins and that glass is hardly recycled.\nThe province only has one glass remelting plant,\u00a0which mainly recovers clear or amber glass. That type of glass represents only 20 per cent of the bottles sold by the SAQ, she said.\u00a0\nIn 2018, 70,000 tonnes of glass were sent to landfills by sorting centres and that's not counting what residents tossed directly into trash bins.\u00a0\nAccording to Recyc-Qu\u00e9bec, the recycling rate for glass recycling is rising, but it\u00a0was only 28 per cent in 2018. This is largely due to contamination and breakage during\u00a0the single-stream collection process that mixes everything into one blue bin and, subsequently, one truck.\nDagenais said the province should be zeroing in on that problem instead \u2014\u00a0 a new glass collection strategy that addresses all glass containers.\u00a0\n\"We believe that the chosen solution must be to go beyond the collection method and offer a solution to improve the rate of glass recycling in order to avoid its burial,\" she said.\n\"It is urgent that we put measures in place\u00a0that will really improve the recycling rate of all post-consumer glass in Quebec. And if this goal is achieved by changing collection methods\u00a0and by setting a deposit on glass, the SAQ will support the initiative.\"\nBut some groups feel the SAQ shouldn't just pass the buck onto others.\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des travailleurs et travailleuses du Qu\u00e9bec (FTQ), which represents not just glass manufacturers, but also SAQ workers and waste collectors, is among those calling on the SAQ to manage collection.\nWhen the purity of glass is impaired during the collection process, the market value is reduced, the FTQ says. Plus, broken glass can damage\u00a0sorting equipment and exposing workers to the risk of injury.\nRecyc-Qu\u00e9bec has proposed the coexistence of deposit and collection. The rate of glass recycling is up from 14 per cent in 2014, but the province needs to do more, it says in a statement published on its website Monday.\nRecyc-Qu\u00e9bec's president and CEO Sonia Gagn\u00e9 says the current system must be modernized to achieve the desired objectives and the Crown corporation is working to \"provide solutions in this direction and to work on proposals that will move us away from the status quo.\"\nQuebec is among the only provinces not demanding a deposit on wine and liquor bottles. That means companies like\u00a0Owens-Illinois, which has a glass-container manufacturing factory in Montreal, must stock up on glass from outside the province.\nIt uses 40 per cent recycled glass to produce containers. The company does use beer bottles collected through the deposit system in Quebec, but otherwise buys glass from Ontario, New Brunswick and the United States.\n\"I've worked here for seven years and, for seven years, we've taken glass from other provinces, because it's glass that comes from deposit systems,\" said Fran\u00e7ois Carrier, director of the Owens-Illinois plant in Montreal.\n\"The deposit is working elsewhere, so it should work here.\"\n"}, {"author": "James Dunne", "title": "So long, soggy hot dog: The convenience store reinvented", "description": "Meeting shifting consumer tastes with gourmet food, trendy decor and delivery", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/convenience-stores-gourmet-foods-1.5226687", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5227223.1564175175!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/popbox-customer-and-cashier-july-2019.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jul 27, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-07-27T11:07:00.154Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Attila Szanyi, the owner of PopBox Micro Market, a fancy convenience store in Toronto, believes the key to his success is raising the bar for the products he carries.\n\"I've always thought of it this way, could you be almost locked in this room and be sent out to space for a whole year and be happy about it?\" explains Szanyi.\u00a0\"Can you have absolutely everything, and the good version of everything?\"\u00a0\nThough the sector is growing, convenience store operators have been under pressure for years from discount retailers, e-commerce and other forces.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo they're evolving with shifting consumer tastes and expectations.\u00a0 Also, with gas and tobacco as their top sellers, convenience retailers are looking to other products as those markets shrink.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile tech giant Amazon is shaking up the convenience model with its cashless and unstaffed stores, independent entrepreneurs are also innovators in the space; trying to cash in on consumers' continued interest in specialty coffees, prepared meals and craft food products.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSzanyi opened PopBox Micro Market in 2015, picking up on the trend of U.S. startups offering consumers something more than simply being close.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"I think it came from a realization that there was this tired old market on the landscape that was ever present, decades old.

The company says its American operations have delivered record results\u00a0this year, with fresh food sales a\u00a0 key part of that growth.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn Dallas, the chain has a test store offering made-to-order smoothies and tacos, an in-store bakery and dining areas. The retailer has also launched its own meal kits, a wine label Voyager Point, and an energy drink called Quake. \u00a0It's also started doing delivery.\nQuebec-based Alimentation Couche-Tard now owns over more than 16,000 stores around the world after several years of buying up smaller chains.\u00a0\nIts stores outside\u00a0Quebec are being branded under the Circle K label. It says expanding food and beverage service is a priority and that's starting with burritos and baristas. Circle K has added a Mexican food service concept called Cantina to some of its stores in Ireland, and replaced some self service coffee kiosks with baristas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSoberman believes a large chain like Circle K can successfully add cool products to its inventory and customize experiences in different markets.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"With the technological data-processing advances that we have, you can still, within a standardized format, deliver a tailored product line and a tailored offering.

Plus, even though\u00a0\"the rise of delivery services for grocery or meals\u00a0inherently makes the act of going into a convenience store a little less convenient,\" Lang notes Foxtrot's local delivery fixes that problem.\u00a0\n\u00a0It's not the only chain offering a new and cool take on convenience.\u00a0\u00a0\nOthers, including Green Zebra of Portland, Ore.,\u00a0and Choice Market of Denver, show, in Lang's words, \"how urban convenience can really be tailored to more than just a bag of chips\u00a0and a soda.\"\u00a0\nA pair of well established convenience chains in Pennsylvania have been creating a cool factor around their stores for two\u00a0decades, while gradually adding healthier food and beverage offers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWawa\u00a0has more than 800 stores in six\u00a0states, and Sheetz about 600 stores in six\u00a0states. Both empires are family businesses with sales numbers well into the billions of dollars.\nBoth companies were selling fresh custom made food orders by the 1990s, and both were early adopters of touch screen order kiosks for faster service. Now they have online ordering plus their own coffee lines, other private label products, and even store-branded craft beer.\nThe two chains' evolving strategy and level of service have\u00a0customers willing to buy store-branded T-shirts, hats and baby clothes, and that's not the\u00a0only way they show brand loyalty.\u00a0\u00a0\nWawa is well known for its hoagies, which have inspired a customer's rap song.\u00a0\nWarning: The lyrics\u00a0and content of\u00a0 this\u00a0video may offend some viewers\nNot to be outdone, a few loyal Sheetz Freaks\u00a0who are in a rock band wrote and recorded a jingle celebrating the chain and its tasty treats,\u00a0including mac and cheese.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd picture this: a pair of Wawa lovers who met at a store later had their wedding photos taken in its parking lot.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bWawa is from eastern Pennsylvania and Sheetz the west, matching the divide between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh's pro sports teams. The fanatic customers of these brands are even the subject of a planned documentary.\nWatch Sheetz Vs. Wawa: The Movie\nThe big name brands in convenience are evolving too, changing their business models to offer more fresh prepared foods and craft style products, though at their own pace.\n\"They're going to be running their own tests, they're going to be addressing this for sure,\" says David Soberman, a professor with the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.\u00a0\n7-Eleven,\u00a0 the world's biggest convenience store chain, has more than 68,000 stores\u00a0in 17 countries. The company says its American operations have delivered record results\u00a0this year, with fresh food sales a\u00a0 key part of that growth.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn Dallas, the chain has a test store offering made-to-order smoothies and tacos, an in-store bakery and dining areas. The retailer has also launched its own meal kits, a wine label Voyager Point, and an energy drink called Quake. \u00a0It's also started doing delivery.\nQuebec-based Alimentation Couche-Tard now owns over more than 16,000 stores around the world after several years of buying up smaller chains.\u00a0\nIts stores outside\u00a0Quebec are being branded under the Circle K label. It says expanding food and beverage service is a priority and that's starting with burritos and baristas. Circle K has added a Mexican food service concept called Cantina to some of its stores in Ireland, and replaced some self service coffee kiosks with baristas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSoberman believes a large chain like Circle K can successfully add cool products to its inventory and customize experiences in different markets.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"With the technological data-processing advances that we have, you can still, within a standardized format, deliver a tailored product line and a tailored offering. It's much easier now because you can keep track of things. And you can be very efficient.\" \u00a0\nPerhaps the most radical vision of the future for convenience stores, though, puts them on wheels.\u00a0\nRobomart, a California-based company, has designed a small self-driving electric low-speed vehicle that can be summoned from a smartphone.\nWatch a model of a self-driving store\u00a0\nIn Shanghai, a Swedish company is testing its Moby Mart.\u00a0That's an autonomous solar powered shop on wheels. Customers open the door\u00a0and pay for items with their phone, making the store like a portable version of Amazon Go.\u00a0 It promises a frictionless experience, but can't offer freshly made custom sandwiches.\u00a0\u00a0\nSoberman thinks the roaming store idea isn't going far. \"My guess is that this is more of a novelty than a big trend.\"\n"}, {"author": "Alicia Elliott", "title": "After the crisis, what kind of world do we want?

I had the idea, the books. I'd started doing the research. Due to COVID-19 forcing me and so many others to stay at home and inside, I had the time.\nBut, also due to COVID-19, I didn't have the inclination to continue doing any of it. For over a week now I've felt paralyzed, as though I've been watching my friends and family members move through a slow motion horror movie. I imagine a lot of people have felt that way over the past few days, weeks and/or months, depending on how deep into this global pandemic they are. With each passing day it has become clearer that life as we'd once known it is ending before our very eyes. Each day I've scrolled mindlessly through social media, waiting for the latest news story that might give some sort of discernible shape to our increasingly uncertain collective future.\nThere have been daily news conferences and updates. There has been emergency legislation introduced and passed. There have been restrictions on how many people can gather in one place, which businesses are allowed to remain open, and how they must operate if they do. It's suggested that everyone stay in their homes, provided they have homes; that if you do have to go outside, you remain a certain distance away from others. While all of this gives us a pretty clear idea of what our individual, immediate futures will look like \u2014 more social distancing, more sickness \u2014 we still don't have any idea what our collective future will look like. What's going to happen when this global pandemic opens our eyes to the cruelty of our priorities, the callousness of our society? Can we really go back to the way things were before? Can we really close our eyes again and pretend we haven't seen what's been right in front of us all along?\nSociety didn't prepare us for this. Politicians didn't prepare us for this. But as I've watched more and more uncertain people turning to movies like Steven Soderbergh's 2011 film Contagion, or TV shows like HBO's Westworld or Netflix's Kingdom, it has occurred to me that maybe art \u2014 particularly post-apocalyptic art \u2014 in some ways has prepared us for this. By showing us fictional worst case scenarios, artists have been holding up a sort of funhouse mirror for us to peer into, reflecting back at us our strangest, scariest, most distorted selves. Ultimately, as we observe these artists' visions/versions of ourselves, squirming and shivering and staying awake at night, haunted, the question hangs over us: do we like what we see? And if not, what will we do to change it?\nSeeing ourselves at this moment, at the edge of what is most certainly a historical precipice, we have many different paths before us. One was sketched by Cormac McCarthy in his 2006 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Road. In McCarthy's grim, bloody vision of post-apocalypse, an unnamed father and his son \u2014 referred to only as \"the man\" and \"the boy\" \u2014 wander south through ash-covered lands in search of food and a warmer climate. Society has entirely deteriorated; food supplies have collapsed to the point that cannibal gangs are a serious concern. On the surface, that world looks entirely different from the one we all occupied before COVID-19. But if we look deeper, the me-first, trust-no-one mentality the man relies on to get by is exactly the sort of behaviour our society has pushed all along.\nAfter all, one does not become a millionaire by sharing the means of production with the people. What's interesting is while most mainstream discourse has painted socialism as the \"evil\" inversion of \"good\" capitalism, this crisis has questioned that premise, laying bare the inherent cruelty of a system that values profits over people. We've believed politicians when they've told us that we need to wait for the things we need: more housing to help the homeless, or universal drug plans, or funding to ensure reserves have access to, and infrastructure for, clean water. This moment \u2014 when governments are finding billions, even trillions of dollars to distribute \u2014 is teaching us that was never really the case. It's always been a matter of priorities. And as we now dwell on the precarious state capitalism has left many of us in, unsure how we're going to pay our bills in the months ahead, we must ask ourselves: will we allow ourselves and our neighbours to fall victim to profiteering, carelessness, even outright disdain? Unethical corporations and callous, inhumane politicians are the metaphorical cannibal gangs we're faced with right now. Will we join those cannibal gangs? Or will we demand they stop eating the flesh of our families and neighbours?\nAnother possible path before us was envisioned by Emily St. John Mandel in the 2014 Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning novel Station Eleven. Unlike McCarthy, Mandel gives us a reason for her post-apocalyptic society: a pandemic of the fictitious Georgian Flu. The pandemic hits in what the survivors have since referred to as \"Year Zero\"; the bulk of the book takes place 20 years after. Interestingly, the survival of humanity is not the main concern of this novel. Instead, Mandel looks at the ways that culture endures, even in the ruins of civilization. For example, there is still a travelling acting troupe called the Travelling Symphony in this society, which performs for small towns around the Great Lakes on a two-year circuit. A man settles in at a big city airport, collects iPhones and laptops and displays them in what he now refers to as the \"Museum of Civilization\"; he is its curator. A woman holds onto Dr. Eleven, a pair of graphic novels she'd been given before the apocalypse, so that she can also hold onto the kindness of that gesture.\nJudging by the ways that people have been relying on art right now, it's clear that Mandel's hunch about cultural survival was pretty accurate. I can't help but wonder how successful recommendations to voluntarily practice social distancing would be if we didn't have movies, TV shows, video games, music and books to keep us inside and occupied. I know that I've personally been relying on all of those things to distract me; without art, I'd be in a constant state of stress and anxiety. Art reminds me what's good, what matters, what's worth saving. Art gives me hope. Will we take those values, that hope and use them to imagine a better collective future? Or will we remain in a holding pattern, helplessly watching ourselves make the same mistakes over and over?\nYet another possible path before us can be found in Waubgeshig Rice's award-winning 2018 novel Moon of the Crusted Snow. Rice's post-apocalypse is set in a northern Anishinaabe community, where colonialism has made electricity blackouts so common that, at first, the community doesn't even realize the apocalypse has come. And that's where Rice's vision of post-apocalypse differs wildly from both McCarthy and Mantel: Rice is Anishinaabe, which means he comes from a nation that has already survived a sort of apocalypse. In fact, most Indigenous people have already dealt with apocalyptic illnesses; that's one of the ways this country was colonized. So when the Anishinaabe people on Rice's fictional reserve realize the electricity might not be coming back, it makes sense that they immediately prioritize the safety of the entire community. After all, this is how they have survived all this time \u2014 by relying on one another. Will we prioritize our elders, our children, our most vulnerable right now? Will we continue to show care and kindness in the face of fear, death, tragedy?\nThe authors of each of these post-apocalyptic novels thought our society would take a specific path at this exact moment. The question is: which one will we choose?\nAre we going to take this moment to stand up for the most vulnerable among us and ensure their needs are met? What about ourselves, in our everyday lives? So many grocery stores have had their stock almost entirely depleted as customers think about themselves and only themselves while under quarantine. So many people have continued to go out unnecessarily. Is that the kind of community we want to create right now \u2014 the sort where everyone continues to care for themselves above all else, putting other peoples' lives at risk without a second thought? The kind that values the market over the lives of the people who make up that market?\nI hope not. Ultimately, the beating heart of all post-apocalyptic art is hope: hope for the future, hope that we can change, hope that care and compassion for one another will prevail even in the most dire of circumstances. As we read and watch post-apocalyptic art, meditating on what our collective future could look like after all of this, I hope we take a very long look in that funhouse mirror and reflect on what moral, compassionate choices we can make to avoid the paths those writers have laid before us.\nKai Cheng Thom said it best in her 2019 book of the same name: I hope we choose love.\nCBC Arts understands that this is an incredibly difficult time for artists and arts organizations across this country.

A similar thing occurred at his previous place, and it's happening to so many renters in Charlottetown that a new term has been born: Renoviction.\nCharlottetown is a prime example of the scarce vacancies and spiraling costs facing renters in communities across the country.\n\"It's getting ridiculous,\" Gallant says of the rental market. \"Prices have doubled pretty much, and that boils back to supply and demand. They know there's nothing here, [so landlords] jack up the price.\"\nCost of living is a big election issue, a\u00a0CBC\u00a0News-commissioned online\u00a0poll\u00a0from June suggests, and housing is the biggest single expense for most Canadians, according to Statistics Canada figures on annual household spending.\nAs the campaign has unfolded, the federal parties have begun to unveil plans on how they'd make life more affordable for voters.\nThe Liberals\u00a0aim to build 100,000 affordable housing units over a decade. They would also encourage home ownership through a first-time home-buyer incentive that subsidizes up to 10 per cent of the purchase of a new home and five per cent on resale homes \u2014 with restrictions.\u00a0\nThe NDP have a more ambitious plan, committing to build 500,000 affordable housing units in a decade.\nA central message of the Conservative campaign is that it wants people \"to\u00a0get ahead, not just get by,\" and that\u00a0the government needs to get its hand out of Canadians' pockets in areas like the carbon tax, which the party describes as ineffective. The Conservatives have\u00a0promised to ease building regulations to increase the housing supply,\u00a0and said\u00a0Monday that if elected the party\u00a0would change the maximum mortgage term, increasing it from 25 years to allow up to 30-year mortgages. It is also promising to review the \"stress test\" for first-time buyers applying for a mortgage.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe reality is that finding affordable housing is increasingly difficult in many parts of Canada.\nThe smallest provincial capital, Charlottetown, has one of the lowest rental vacancy rates in the country. It hovers just above zero per cent, new Kijiji listings last just minutes before apartments are snapped up, and renters complain about spending ever more of their limited dollars on housing.\nIt is an old axiom of financial planners that renters should never spend more than 30 per cent of their gross earnings on rent and utilities. In Charlottetown, low income renters (those earning less than $21,361) spend on average 62 per cent of their earnings on housing.\nThe numbers get only marginally better when income levels increase.\nData gathered by the Canadian Rental Housing Index shows that Toronto renters earning as much as $45,498 a year are dedicating 40 per cent of their earnings to monthly housing costs. Live outside the downtown core, in York or Peel region, and those middle income earners are paying an average of per cent 44 and 38 per cent respectively.\u00a0\nIn Regina, low-income renters spend more than half their pre-tax earnings on rent and utilities. In Calgary it's 62 per cent, and 91 per cent in Vancouver.\nThis may help to explain why so many adult children are returning to live with their parents even after they've entered the workforce, or why many young adults choose to have roommates to defray living costs.\nCheck out your region's costs and compare it to others on the Rental Housing Index\nAcross Canada, it's not simply a question of how much accommodation costs, but also about keeping up with the need for more places to live.\nIn 2018, there were 37,000 new apartments built nationwide, but demand increased by 50,000 units, according to tracking done by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nAnd Canadian cities continue to grow, driven by factors such as immigration and stronger job numbers.\nWith housing-related problems rising and the cost of living a primary issue for Canadian voters, Charlottetown Mayor Philip Brown figures political party leaders in the midst of a federal election campaign should be talking more about it. When he was elected last year, he describes how he used a congratulatory phone call from the Prime Minister to drive home his top priority.\n\"We have a problem with affordable and accessible housing,\" Brown says he told Justin Trudeau on a call shortly after his election as mayor in November 2018. \"We need more public spending from the provincial and federal governments to up the supply of affordable and accessible housing.\"\nEach community has its own housing challenges, and one of the big ones for Charlottetown is that short-term rentals for the city's giant tourism industry suck up a lot of housing stock.\u00a0\nAnother is house prices \u2014\u00a0Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) data shows they've jumped 38.5 per cent in the past three years alone in P.E.I.'s capital. By comparison, prices rose 25.3 per cent in Toronto, 21.6 in Ottawa and 33.3 in Victoria. A market where buyers get into bidding wars is new for Canada's smallest province, which recently surpassed 153,000 residents, and it's persuading some landlords to sell.\nAdded to that, the province's population is growing, with people moving to P.E.I. from other nations and parts of Canada on both a permanent and temporary basis. The University of P.E.I. hasn't built a new residence in 14 years, for example, while its student population has increased by about a third. There have been significant increases in the number of students on campus requiring housing, with half now coming from out of province or out of country.\n\"And that, in turn, is pushing more demand on downtown housing,\" Brown explains.\nHolland College student Sierra Elkerton was debating whether she could even afford to stay in school\u00a0after she was evicted by her landlord because the building was not up to code. She managed to find a new apartment, but for nearly double the monthly rent.\n\"Realistically I don't want to pay that, but it looks like I'm going to have to,\" says Elkerton. \"The cost of living is way too high considering it's such a small city.\"\nShe's not alone. A global survey by money manager BlackRock Inc. found \"many Canadians feel that they are in a financial squeeze \u2014\u00a0hard pressed to save amid what they perceive as a high cost of living, including devoting much of their income to paying for their homes.\"\nCanadians who responded to the poll said they spend an average of 43 per cent of their income on housing \u2014\u00a0whether renting or owning.\u00a0\nAmong the 20 countries surveyed, only the Netherlands and Sweden had higher housing costs, at 51 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.\nCharlottetown's mayor is well aware of the numbers. In his community, he's most focused on trying to help the people who find themselves paying more than they can afford \u2014\u00a0and those who can't find anything at all.\n\"We may be a small city,\" he says,\u00a0\"but we've got big city problems.\"\nThe mayor says he would like to hear commitments from party leaders this election cycle to use the big federal wallet to help cities build more affordable housing.\n\"I got two calls this past week and one visit to the office,\" Brown says. \"From a woman who was living in her car in the Walmart parking lot, and another woman that's been in [a shelter] now for almost a month and she needs a place to live.\"\nWatch The National's story about what it's like to live in a 'severely unaffordable' Canadian city:\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Retail businesses reopen in Wuhan, China's original coronavirus epicentre", "description": "Not every shop open, and limits are placed on number of customers at any 1 time", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/china-wuhan-stores-reopen-1.5514658", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5514687.1585578785!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus-china-wuhan.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 30, 2020 11:01 AM ET", "2020-03-30T17:50:18.900Z"], "source": null, "content": "Shopkeepers in the city where China's virus outbreak began were reopening Monday, but customers were scarce after authorities lifted more of the anti-virus controls that kept tens of millions of people at home for two months.\n\"I'm so excited, I want to cry,\" said a woman on one of Wuhan's major shopping streets, the Chuhe Hanjie pedestrian mall, who would give only the English name Kat.\nKat said she was a teacher in the eastern city of Nanjing and was visiting her family when most access to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and the manufacturing hub of central China, was suspended Jan. 23 to stem the spread of the coronavirus.\n\"After two months trapped at home, I want to jump,\" said Kat, jumping up and down excitedly. \"I want to revenge shop.\"\nCustomers at the upscale Wuhan International Mall were greeted by employees who wore masks and carried signs that said, \"Please wear masks all the way.

The final curbs on Wuhan end April 8.\nWuhan became the centre of one of the most intensive anti-disease controls ever imposed after the virus emerged in December. Some researchers suggest it may have jumped to humans from a bat at one of the city's wildlife markets.\nThe ruling party suppressed information about the outbreak and reprimanded doctors in Wuhan who tried to warn the public.

The next morning, residents awoke to news that their sprawling city that straddles the Yangtze River was cut off from the outside world.\nPolice set up roadblocks at expressway entrances. Only truckers leaving the city to collect food and a handful of other drivers with official passes were allowed through. Bus and subway service inside Wuhan shut down.\nRestaurants, shops, cinemas and other businesses were ordered to close, leaving streets empty and silent in a foreshadowing of controls that would spread to other countries. Families were ordered to stay home.\nRestrictions spread to cities around Wuhan and eventually expanded to cover some 800 million people, or more than half of China's population. Restaurants, shopping malls, factories and other businesses were closed nationwide and families were told to stay home, while two temporary hospitals with more than 1,000 beds each were built and a third one was set up in an exhibition centre.\nPresident Xi Jinping visited Wuhan for the first time March 10 in a show of official confidence that the virus was under control. The next day, the government began to ease controls on Hubei, allowing some factories and other businesses deemed essential to the economy or to producing daily necessities to reopen.\nAt the same time, the ruling party has rolled out a massive propaganda effort to portray its leaders as the heroes of the outbreak and deflect accusations they allowed the virus to spread due to politically motivated foot-dragging.\nGovernment spokespeople have suggested the coronavirus's origin is unknown, contradicting earlier official statements that it came from Wuhan. A foreign ministry spokesman said the virus might have been brought to Wuhan by visiting American military officials, a claim that prompted an angry response from Washington.\nWuhan suffered 2,547 coronavirus deaths, accounting for about 80 per cent\u00a0of China's total fatality toll of 3,186 as of midnight Sunday, according to the National Health Commission.

That followed\u00a0an announcement a week ago that it had amassed a greater\u00a0quantity of low-enriched uranium than permitted.\nIran has said it will take another, third step away from the\u00a0deal within 60 days, but has so far held back from formally\u00a0announcing what that next step would entail.\nKamalvandi said the authorities were discussing options that\u00a0included the prospect of enriching uranium to 20 per cent purity or\u00a0beyond, and restarting centrifuges that were dismantled as one\u00a0of the deal's core aims. (A centrifuge separates liquids or gases of different weights or densities. In nuclear engineering, they are used to separate isotopes to enrich uranium for nuclear energy or weapons.)\n\"There is the 20 per cent option and there are options even higher\u00a0than that, but each in its own place,\" Kamalvandi said, according\u00a0to state television. \"Restarting IR-2 and IR-2 M centrifuges is\u00a0an option.\"\nSuch threats from Iran will put new pressure on European countries,\u00a0which insist Iran must continue to comply with the agreement\u00a0even though the United States is no longer doing so.\nU.S. President Donald Trump spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron about Iran's threat, the White House said.\n\"They discussed ongoing efforts to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon and to end Iran's destabilizing behaviour in the Middle East,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement.\nA report to member states that was obtained by\u00a0Reuters said the\u00a0IAEA had verified the enrichment level using online enrichment monitors, and samples had been taken on Monday for analysis.\u00a0\nIran also said\u00a0the last chance for saving its nuclear deal with world powers will pass after a 60-day deadline.\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson\u00a0Abbas Mousavi told reporters Monday that Iran won't offer any further \"deadlines\" to save the deal by September.\nIran is pressuring European partners to find a way around U.S. sanctions and deliver the deal's promised economic relief. The U.S. unilaterally withdrew a year ago.\nThe nuclear agreement guaranteed Iran access to world trade\u00a0in return for accepting curbs on its program. Iran says the deal allows it to respond to the U.S. breach by\u00a0reducing its compliance, and it will do so every 60 days.\n\"If signatories of the deal, particularly Europeans, fail to\u00a0fulfil their commitments in a serious way, the third step will be stronger, more decisive and a bit surprising,\" Mousavi said on Monday.\nThe new U.S. measures in place since May are intended to bar\u00a0Iran from all oil exports\u00a0and have succeeded in effectively\u00a0pushing Iran out of mainstream oil markets.\nEuropean countries do not directly support the U.S.\u00a0sanctions, but have been unable to come up with ways to allow Iran to avert them. Britain, one of Washington's main European\u00a0allies, was drawn deeper into the confrontation last week when\u00a0it seized an Iranian tanker it says was bound for Syria, in\u00a0violation of separate EU sanctions on Syria.\nWashington has imposed sanctions that eliminate any of the\u00a0benefits Iran was meant to receive in return for agreeing to the curbs on its nuclear program. The confrontation has brought the U.S. and Iran\u00a0close to the brink of conflict.\nEnriching uranium up to 20 per cent\u00a0purity would be a dramatic move,\u00a0since that was the level Iran had achieved before the deal was\u00a0put in place. It is considered an important intermediate stage\u00a0on the path to obtaining the 90 per cent pure fissile uranium needed to make a bomb.\nOne of the main achievements of the deal was Iran's\u00a0agreement to dismantle its advanced IR-2M centrifuges, which are used to purify uranium. Iran had 1,000 of them installed at its\u00a0large enrichment site at Natanz before the deal was reached.\u00a0\nUnder the deal, it is allowed to operate only up to two centrifuges for\u00a0mechanical testing.\nStill, the threatened measures also appear intended to be\u00a0sufficiently ambiguous to hold back from fully repudiating the\u00a0deal. Kamalvandi did not specify how much uranium Iran might\u00a0purify to the higher level, nor how many centrifuges it would\u00a0consider restarting. He did not mention other more advanced\u00a0centrifuges, including the most advanced, the IR-8.\n"}, {"author": "Joel Dryden", "title": "What it would mean for pensioners if Kenney creates an Alberta pension plan", "description": "Pension funds would likely be transferred to government-owned AIMCo", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/pension-plan-aimco-kenney-alberta-calgary-canada-1.5353186", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5197611.1562099287!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/alta-kenney-platform-20181015.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 10, 2019 7:30 AM MT", "2019-11-10T15:55:10.026Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Naturally, some questions arise whenever anyone floats the possibility of transferring billions of public dollars from one fund manager to another.\nSpeaking Saturday during a keynote address to close the Manning Conference in Red Deer, Alberta, Premier Jason Kenney laid out measures that will be explored as part of what's being called the Fair Deal Panel.\nHe announced initiatives that include creating a provincial police force, establishing a formal provincial constitution and opting out of federal cost-sharing programs.\u00a0\nThe panel will\u00a0also study the possibility of withdrawing from the Canada\u00a0Pension Plan (CPP) in favour of an Alberta-based alternative.\nThat squares with previous comments Kenney has made on pensions, including during a Facebook livestream a little more than a week ago. In that stream, he said he believed a \"compelling case\" could be made to withdraw from the CPP.\nSo were an Alberta pension plan to be implemented, how would a fund transfer take place? Who would manage and invest those funds? And why now?\nThe short answer is: it's unclear.\nAlberta pensioners have been paying into CPP since it was established in 1965 by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. The CPP\u00a0fund has\u00a0$400.6\u00a0billion in assets as of June 30 \u2014\u00a0money that has been partly contributed by Albertans.\nEconomist Trevor Tombe said there's no precedent for what has been proposed by Kenney.\n\"For Alberta to withdraw from the CPP would be a phenomenally complex undertaking, because you'd have to figure out what share of the fund is transferred to the Alberta fund,\" Tombe said. \"How would people's CPP contributions and benefits they've already earned, how would that translate into an Alberta system?\"\nIt's possible that the Alberta government could set up a parallel pension system to the CPP and gradually phase out of one and into another, Tombe said.\n\"But it would be phenomenally complex [to set up]. And I'm not sure what it would achieve,\" he said.\nIn a scenario where the Alberta government was able to transfer the billions in dollars in Alberta pensions to a local authority, those funds would, in all likelihood, be managed by the\u00a0Alberta Investment Management Corp., or AIMCo.\nAIMCo is a Crown corporation, meaning it is owned by the provincial government.\u00a0\nThe corporation\u00a0already manages\u00a0$100 billion in government pensions and other funds, and approximately $17 billion in assets as part of the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund.\nAccording to the corporation's mandate and roles document, it operates at arms-length from the government\u00a0but there is \"broad cooperation and collaboration between AIMCo and the Government of Alberta.\"\nBryce Tingle, a regulatory lawyer and professor at the University of Calgary, said keeping the relationship arms-length was important for a number of reasons.\n\"It's good because you want your money to be managed by professionals. You don't want politicians, who typically don't have very much training in investment selection, stock picking and trading strategies, to be in charge of banking investments,\" Tingle said. \"You also don't want public money used to reward friends of the politicians or powerful constituencies.\"\nThough the government wrote in its budget it planned to build up a \"made in Alberta\" portfolio through AIMCo, a spokesperson said that didn't mean the corporation would be pressured to use the funds to support provincial initiatives.\n\"The 'made in Alberta'\u00a0strategy referenced in the budget document ensures that AIMCo retains its position as a leader of investment management services in Western Canada by further solidifying its role and increasing its assets under management,\" said\u00a0Jerrica\u00a0Goodwin with Alberta's Treasury Board and Finance in a written statement.\u00a0\"The 'made in Alberta'\u00a0phrasing is not a reference to a change in the way that AIMCo invests their client's money.\"\nWere AIMCo to use pension funds to invest in Alberta-based companies and economies\u00a0that move would likely backfire, Tingle said.\n\"If AIMCo was to invest preferentially in, let's say oil and gas, and it was underperforming the rest of the market, so AIMCo reported steady subpar returns, that would eventually become a political football,\" Tingle said. \"Because that pension money is what Albertans depend on to live on when they stop working.\"\nDenes Nemeth, director of communications with AIMCo, said the organization would not respond to influence from the provincial government.\n\"[If] any provincial government directed\u00a0AIMCo to manage a specific company, a specific asset, a specific type of infrastructure, absolutely not,\" he said. \"We have full investment discretion\u00a0over what kinds of investments we make and they need to maximize net investment returns for our clients.\"\u00a0\nAIMCo funds achieved a net return of 2.3 per cent in 2018, down from 9.3 per cent a year prior.\nA CBC News investigation\u00a0published in July\u00a0revealed\u00a0AIMCo\u00a0had shares worth a total of about $4.8 million as of March 31, in both GEO Group and CoreCivic, two companies linked to for-profit prison companies, including one linked to controversial migrant detention centres in the United States.\nAIMCo\u00a0confirmed the corporation\u00a0no longer owned shares in those companies.\nDiscussion around an Alberta pension plan can be traced back to the \"firewall letter,\" penned by a number of prominent conservative figures, but it has largely fallen off the radar over the past two decades.\nBut in a time of continued western alienation, Tingle said it could be part of a larger bargaining chip with Ottawa.\n\"As far as I can see, the threat to withdraw from CPP is actually the most credible tool the provincial government has in its quiver to bring people to the table and negotiate on the things Alberta cares about,\" he said.\nFor Tombe, the panel has its work cut out for it, with no obvious first step forward.\n\"It would be very complex, and there currently does not exist details or credible analysis on how to do it,\" he said. \"So at the moment, it's just a talking point.\"\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Why the Bank of Canada won't fight a recession till there is one: Don Pittis", "description": "With the economy riding high, Poloz is unlikely to be pressured into early cuts", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-poloz-interest-economy-1.5264675", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5266050.1567188048!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/basketball-nba.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 03, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-03T08:00:00.031Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Inevitably, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz\u00a0must do his job in the\u00a0shadow\u00a0of his powerful\u00a0U.S. equivalent at the Federal Reserve.\nBut as Canada's central banker reveals his rate decision on Wednesday, he will have an edge on Fed chair Jerome Powell. The Poloz advantage is that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won't be hollering at him to cut interest rates or insulting him when he doesn't.\nWith so much fearful talk of a coming\u00a0recession, U.S. President Donald Trump is not the only one who has called for rate cuts to boost the economy.\nBut as the fundamental strength of Canadian growth, employment, income and housing seems an oasis in a world beset by recessionary fears, Poloz and his advisers will do what good central bankers\u00a0like best: follow the data.\nWhatever may be around the corner, it is hard to dispute that right now the fundamentals of the Canadian economy are strong. Annualized gross domestic product numbers on Friday hit nearly four\u00a0per cent,\u00a0well above forecasts, although the year-over-year gain is less than half that.\u00a0\nJobs, wages\u00a0and inflation remain strong. Housing is no longer soaring, which is good, but it is no longer plunging either. Canadian shoppers are still shopping.\nIt is almost certain that the Bank of Canada will leave rates unchanged tomorrow at 1.75 per cent.\nA\u00a0poll of 40 economists by Reuters now shows a majority foresee no rate cuts in 2019. But it's a split decision. Just over 40 per cent say not only will there be a cut, but some suggest it will be half a percentage point, double the usual quarter-point decrement.\n\"With the Fed likely easing in September and then again in October, it looks as if it would be the prudent thing to do for the Bank\u00a0of Canada\u00a0to take up some insurance as well,\" BMO's\u00a0Benjamin Reitzes\u00a0told the news agency.\nU.S. easing is not yet certain. Warnings of price increases by retailers due to the China-U.S. trade war may push inflation higher. A partial resolution of the trade fight may make two cuts unnecessary.\nPoloz may indeed find himself pressured by U.S. and other countries'\u00a0rate cuts if he believes there will be an impact on Canada.\u00a0But the idea that central banks can do much to compensate for an economy smacked by the growing costs of\u00a0trade disputes, especially by cutting interest rates in advance,\u00a0was a subject of debate at the recent central bankers' conference at Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nWith rates already so low, it is not clear even a half-point cut would convince business borrowers to take out additional loans to expand their businesses just when they have been warned\u00a0a recession is about to strike.\u00a0\nAnd rather than boosting business fundamentals,\u00a0rate cuts when an economy is running hot would mostly jack up asset prices like real estate and stocks, which might please speculators, but would only make a bigger noise should a recession bring those asset prices\u00a0crashing down.\nWhile there will be plenty of criticism and suggestions for improvement\u00a0during the\u00a0upcoming election campaign, there are signs that Canada is benefiting from years of relatively good government by Trudeau and Stephen Harper before him.\nImmigration and high levels of education have given Canada a healthy workforce. Recent data shows that while Canada's rich are not as rich as their U.S. counterparts, those earning median salaries and below are significantly better off.\n\"Our income estimates may actually underestimate the economic well-being of Canadians relative to Americans,\" writes Bloomberg's Justin Fox. \"Indeed, Canadians usually receive more in-kind benefits from their governments, including notably in health care.\"\nOf course, that economic advantage Fox reports\u00a0only comes after you look at Canadian purchasing power parity. Canadian dollars buy more goods and services here at home, but as we discovered during a summer visit to Alaska, they don't go so far in the U.S.\nLast week The Atlantic reported that a coming recession was going to doom U.S. young people weighed down by student debt and poor job prospects. But as Bloomberg's Fox observed, the mood really is different in Canada.\nWhile Canadian youth also face the burden of\u00a0high rents and entry-level wages, subsidized education means levels of student debt are not as extreme. And with boomers departing the workforce in droves, young Canadians know there are hundreds of thousands of good jobs going begging if only they can get the right credentials.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Andie Bulman", "title": "Cancel culture, indeed: COVID-19 is going to slam the gig economy", "description": "Freelancers, creatives and the self-employed are already feeling the sting of coronavirus", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/coronavirus-gig-economy-freelancers-1.5496342", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 14, 2020 8:00 AM NT", "2020-03-14T12:08:07.105Z"], "source": null, "content": "I could be a poster child for the gig economy.\nI own a small business, do frequent catering gigs, perform as a stand-up comic, contribute to CBC, write short films, act with a sketch comedy troupe, teach the occasional cooking class and take on a seasonal contract with Choices for Youth.\nThe gig economy gets a bad rep, but I love how each day is different.

For every cancelled event, there are a collective of hardworking producers, writers, drivers, personal assistants and technicians who lost out on work they were counting on.\nLocally, artists are being hit hard as well. Performer, artist and event coordinator Allison Collins has already cancelled meetings aimed at organizing a big event for April 10, which may be called off. Her main source of income is event planning and performing, so she's braced for her wallet to take a hit.\n\"I was too proud to apply for the funding for artists during the state of emergency,\" she said. \"But I'm really worried about the upcoming season. That's when I make the bulk of my dollars.\"\nSo what's the solution? How can we help the artists, giggers and entrepreneurs in our midst? We probably cannot count on the federal government.\nJustin Trudeau announced Thursday that the government is allocating $1 billion toward the coronavirus crisis \u2014 an impressive announcement. Interestingly, Trudeau's plan has also set aside $5 million to speed up access to employment insurance. Usually, there is a grace period of one week before people can make a claim, but his government will be waiving this period during the coronavirus scare.\nWhile Thursday's announcement failed to acknowledge part-time workers, entrepreneurs, artists and everyone else who considers themselves part of the gig economy, on Friday the prime minister said the government would be introducing a fiscal stimulus package in the days ahead. No one should have to worry about making the rent, buying groceries or paying for child care because of COVID-19, he said.\nFinancial support will be key, because most in the gig economy\u00a0cannot access employment insurance\u00a0because they don't qualify as a full-time worker.\nEven those who do qualify may still only receive 55 per cent of their income as the maximum benefit, and in a province with high rents, high heat and insanely expensive insurance, 55 per cent of income is not enough.\nI guess we're going to have to help each other out.\nHere's what you can do if you're a pensioned permanent worker with paid sick leave and a healthy savings account: first, don't be a troll. That is, don't spend next month mocking and looking down on the people who don't have the benefits you have.\nDon't tell yourself they are in financial trouble because they didn't work as hard or aren't as skilled.\nSecond, buy restaurant gift certificates. Yes, we shouldn't be gathering. Avoiding public spaces and making food at home might be the new normal for the next little while, but calling your favourite restaurant, brewery or food truck and buying a gift certificate for a later date will help that business stabilize.\nSame goes for all small businesses, not just food! Buy certificates for all the little shops and services that contribute to the culture of this place.\nThe cab industry will likely be impacted, too. Fewer events means fewer calls, so consider tipping generously next time you're in a taxi.\nAlso, pay your bills on time! If you have the means, don't leave your house cleaner or repairman hanging until next week.\nDonate to theatre companies, art galleries or consider being a patron of the arts. Performances are going to be cancelled, putting actors and musicians out of work, so support them.\nStage shows of all kinds are bound to be cancelled in the coming months. Why not donate to the theatre company or artists you were planning to enjoy this year? If their show has been cancelled or postponed, maybe you can purchase their work online.\nThe work of artists, entrepreneurs and part-timers is important and valid. Show up for them.\nThis virus is scary, but it won't be so bad if we help each other.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Neil Macdonald", "title": "Winter is coming, and so is an uncharted economic abyss: Neil Macdonald", "description": "The economic situation scares me.

Their contempt for amateurs \u2014 columnists with broad audiences, for example \u2014 would sear the lungs if inhaled.\nSo, because criticism just makes me feel so terrible, let me phrase a whole set of nagging worries as questions. Can we agree there are no stupid questions? Probably not. But let's try anyway.\nQuestion No. 1: How in heaven's name did we arrive in a world where you must pay someone to borrow your money, and what does that mean to the punters? Like, um, me?\nAt the moment, there is more than $14 trillion US in negative-yielding debt extant in the world, meaning money is not just cheap, it's on sale at a loss.\u00a0\nLet's put that sum in perspective: Canada's GDP in 2018 \u2013 the entire economic output of a G7 country \u2013 was about $1.7 trillion US. Fourteen trill is a huge chunk of global wealth.\nGovernments, many of them European, are actually offering \u2014 and investors are buying \u2014 bonds that are worth less at the end of five or 10 or even 30 years than their purchase price.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd a bank in Denmark\u00a0is now offering\u00a0a negative-yield mortgage. Jyske Bank will lend customers a ten-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of -0.5%, which means those borrowers will actually pay back less than they borrowed.\nAs for the punters, some have pensions, private and public, which, if this trend continues, will be forced to severely reduce their payouts. Some have RRSPs and other savings, which are subject to the same market forces. The expectation my generation was raised on was that prudence and parsimony would result in a nest egg later in life, which someone would pay to borrow, which would help fund your retirement. Now, apparently, we will have to pay someone to \"hold\" our money for us.\nBloomberg, the financial news agency, moved an explainer piece on all this last week, which suggested that this is all perfectly normal.\u00a0\nRelatively flat economic growth in the developed world, explained the explainer, combined with ever-increasing concentration of wealth, has left rich people and companies sitting on vast piles of cash for which there is weak demand.\u00a0\nThe rules of economics being what they are, theorized the author, it only makes sense that financial institutions would begin charging to store this surplus money. After all, if you own something really expensive, don't you have to pay to store it safely? A safety deposit box costs money, doesn't it?\nWhat the explainer avoided was where a lot of this money came from in the first place. Which brings us to Question No. 2: Governments have printed unimaginable amounts of money, inflating the money supply, since 2008. That must have consequences for the punters, right?\nIn early 2008, before the criminal greed of America's mortgage and investment bank industry nearly destroyed the world's economy, the balance sheet of the U.S. Federal Reserve stood at about $870 billion.\n(Speaking of 2008, there is no better example of economists being wrong. Larry Summers and Alan Greenspan, two economists who rose to manage much of the American economy, not only didn't see the subprime crisis coming, they both fought successfully against regulation of derivatives, which are essentially bets on the rise and fall of asset values. Wall Street's creation of ever more insane derivatives basically caused the meltdown while regulators looked the other way.)\nBen Bernanke launches blog defending actions as Fed chief\nLessons from the 2008 recession\nThen-Fed chair Ben Bernanke and his fellow governors, desperate to avert complete disaster, plugged in the money-printing machine (actually, money printing is done electronically, with a few computer keystrokes).\u00a0\nThe Fed balance sheet is now at nearly $4 trillion.\nThe European Central Bank began printing money in 2015: $2.6 trillion Euros over four years, or about 7,600 Euros for every person in the currency bloc. Japan, the UK and Switzerland have all done the same in differing amounts. The technical term for it is \"quantitative easing.\"\nThe central banks have used the oceans of new money to buy bonds from their own debt-addicted governments, with the intended result of lowering the cost of borrowing and encouraging risk-taking, which is at least one explanation for the nosebleed stock market levels nowadays, and the staggering levels of household debt here and in the U.S.\nBut there is serious pressure to do even more. Which brings us to Question Number Three: Winter is coming, and so is another recession. It is inevitable; 10 years have passed since the last one. What will we do this time? And\u2026the punters.\nOne thing central banks won't be able to do this time is lower interest rates significantly. As negative rates are already here. U.S. President Donald Trump, judging by his weekly rants about the incompetence of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump appointed, seems to think monetary policy should be in the hands of politicians like him. (Now that would be a confidence-inspiring move, wouldn't it?). Trump thinks cutting U.S. interest rates even further is just the ticket.\n....proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much (and that I was right!). They must Cut Rates bigger and faster, and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening NOW. Yield curve is at too wide a margin, and no inflation! Incompetence is a.....\nOther politicians, on the left, are promoting Modern Monetary Theory, which posits that governments can print unlimited amounts of money without inflationary consequences. Some even want central banks to just start sending cheques to every household.\n(Actually, Trump is right over there with the leftists, if you think about it: pro-spending, pro-debt, and pushing for even looser monetary policy).\nAnd of course the central banks are increasingly shackled by the fact that citizens and governments owe so very much; at this point, having helped create this mess to save us all from the earlier mess, they haven't much choice but to leave interest rates where they are for many years to come.\nThis much is absolutely true: we are in unknown territory, out past the \"here be monsters\" sign. None of us has any idea how this will turn out, economists included. As we saw in 2008, the collateral damage when things start to go badly can be devastating. Personally, I have a bad feeling about it all, but then I'm not an economist.\nI'm with Bruce Springsteen, also a non-economist, who once put it this way: \"Blind faith in your leaders \u2026 will get you killed.\"\nBy \"you,\" he did not mean the top .5 per cent, with their insider information and high-speed trading algorithms and political influence and vast, expanding piles of cash. They'll be fine. When Donald Trump, a member of that cohort, said in 2015 that the system is rigged, he was right, just not in the way he meant.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Manitoba local teen Taylor Janzen, a graduate of the youth program, kicks off the festival Thursday night.\nThe site offers acres of grass and shaded picnic areas, with more than 150 porta-potties located at the festival site and campgrounds, according to the website. There are ATMs and phone charging stations available \u2014 and lots of lineups, so organizers suggest people\u00a0stock up on cash and charge up before the shows.\nFestival-goers can hop\u00a0aboard the Folk Fest Express for a free ride to the site.\nA new bike rental program presented by Natural Cycleworks is renting Dutch bikes to folkies for the weekend at $50 plus tax and a $25 deposit up front, according to Folk Fest online. The website indicates bikes can be picked up at the festival campground.\nOver in the Handmade Village \u2014 a pop-up market for craftspeople to promote their work \u2014 artisan Robyn Wolfe of Braecrest Design is selling bee puddles.\n\"They're a decorative way of providing water for bees and butterflies other pollinators like birds in your garden,\" Wolfe described her creations made from ceramic and western red cedar.\n\"Hopefully it will bring some smiles to folk fest peoples' faces.\"\nWolfe said it's her second year bringing her business to the festival.\n\"We like the vibe, which is friendly, and family friendly, and happy. The weather is co-operating, so far. It's just a beautiful place to be with a lot of people enjoying some beautiful music and sharing in each others' creative output,\" Wolfe said.\n\"We have a large and well-trained safety crew,\" festival director Frayer said about how organizers maintain a safe place.\nFirst aid services and health and wellness initiatives, such as Red Tent run by Klinic\u00a0Community Health in Winnipeg, are available at select locations to help people take care of their physical and mental wellbeing on\u00a0long days under the hot sun.\n\"It just helps people if they're\u00a0having a hard time. If they need to find a place to just chill out for a bit, we have people that work in the mental health field that are there,\" Frayer said.\nThe festival strives to be environmentally friendly by using a comprehensive recycling and composting program, the director said. The 30 food vendors located on site and in the campground will provide reuseable\u00a0plates and compostable\u00a0utensils.\nThe festival has also gone\u00a0plastic water bottle-free, Frayer said.\n\"We encourage people to bring their own reusable water bottle,\" he added.\nVisit the website for more tips and the answers to frequently asked questions about travel, parking, camping and more.\nCBC Manitoba is a sponsor of the Winnipeg Folk Festival.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Get informed on the top stories of the day in one quick scan", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/morning-brief-december-20-2019-1.5402063", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5403697.1576804703!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/dona-murphy.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 20, 2019 7:38 AM ET", "2019-12-20T12:54:41.976Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Good morning!

Three of the five patients remaining in hospital are in an intensive care unit.\nPublic Health is\u00a0also looking at testing some asymptomatic people in \"very specific situations.\"\n\"That's something that's kind of the next phase of our discussions.\u00a0\nMore resources have been put in place with respect to 811, where 200 people wait on hold at the same time, and more family doctors are performing virtual care, she said.\n\"Our testing sites are obviously still able to ramp up capacity,\" she said. \"We would definitely aim for 1,000 per day as needed.\"\u00a0\nOf the 116 cases confirmed COVID-19 cases, 66 are travel-related, 40 are close contacts of confirmed cases, eight are the result of community transmission and two remain under investigation.\nTo date, 75 people have recovered.\nA total of 12 people have been hospitalized during the pandemic, but seven have been discharged.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We are\u00a0definitely moving in the right direction but we haven't reached our\u00a0destination,\" Russell said.\nHere is a roundup of\u00a0other developments.\u00a0\nPremier Blaine Higgs said the province is looking at ways it can restart its economy and allow businesses to reopen\u00a0that aren't considered essential.\nHe's hoping businesses can find ways to operate and use safe practices that observe physical distancing.\nBut when and how a gradual reopening can get underway will depend on the consistent number of cases, or lack of cases,\u00a0the province sees in days to come, he said.\u00a0\n\"We want to make that happen and\u00a0it will depend on what it\u00a0looks like in the coming weeks,\" Higgs told reporters on Tuesday.\nIf all goes according to plan during that \"critical\" time, Higgs said non-essential businesses could begin re-opening in some fashion in May.\nPremier Blaine Higgs says the province plans to share guidelines soon for keeping residents safe in long-term care homes, one of the hardest hit targets of the\u00a0coronavirus in other provinces.\nHiggs said Vitalit\u00e9 and Horizon Health Networks have been putting a lot of effort into training home-care and nursing home workers so they're using best practices and proper equipment during the pandemic.\u00a0\n\"Obviously, what we're seeing happening in Ontario and Quebec, we absolutely do not want to see anything like that here,\" Higgs said.\nOver the weekend, public health officials in Quebec were investigating conditions at private long-term care homes around the province after learning that since the outbreak began, 31 people have died at one such facility in Montreal.\nBy April 1, at least 40\u00a0deaths\u00a0in Ontario nursing and retirement homes had been linked to COVID-19.\n\"We're doing whatever is necessary to avoid any situation that would resemble that in any way,\" Higgs said.\nHe said he\u00a0will be updating\u00a0the COVID-19 all-party committee Wednesday night about what's been done to date in long-term cares homes.\n\"We'll be looking [to see] if we need to do anything further,\" he said.\nPremier Blaine Higgs\u00a0says emergency officials have factored COVID-19 into\u00a0potential flooding plans. He cited plans for\u00a0physical distancing and the use of masks if sandbagging is required.\nWater levels are expected to surpass flood stage in some parts of the province this week.\nHiggs\u00a0asked\u00a0residents in flood-prone areas to remain vigilant. And if they are forced to leave their homes, he said they cannot stay with friends or family because of the requirement for physical distancing.\nHiggs said the Canadian Red Cross will help people with lodging if and when this is needed.\u00a0\n\"People should exercise caution as the spring freshet is underway and water is high,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe province has announced a new service that will allow\u00a0New Brunswickers\u00a0to\u00a0donate personal protective equipment to health-care workers for their fight against COVID-19.\nPeople can donate by visiting the government's COVID-19 website, Dr. Jennifer Russell, the chief medical officer of health, said Tuesday.\n\"Some have stocks of masks, gowns and medical equipment they purchased when caring for a loved one at home,\" she said.\n\"Some businesses that used protective gear in their daily work have inquired about donating their stock and others want to turn their hands to sewing masks or making other gear for our frontline workers.\"\nPeople who want to donate will be asked\u00a0to fill out and submit a form detailing the condition and type of equipment they\u00a0have.\u00a0\nThe information would include the manufacturer, specifications and certifications to make sure the material is safe to use.\nIf a donation is accepted, specific instructions for delivery will be provided.\u00a0\nAlthough the number of COVID-19 cases have been low in New Brunswick, Dr. Jennifer Russell, the chief medical officer of health,\u00a0said it's important to look at the days and weeks ahead.\u00a0\n\"You're always looking at a snapshot two weeks behind,\" she said of the daily case totals.\nRussell said there are several epidemiologists on her team and medical officers who look at the data \"in fine detail.\"\n\"You can't see the peak until after you've passed it,\" she said. \"We're keeping an eye on the numbers.\"\nEarlier Tuesday, an infection control epidemiologist said New Brunswick case numbers could be on the verge of peaking.\nColin Furness, a professor at the University of Toronto, said New Brunswick is managing to flatten its curve \"incredibly well,\" but the province will likely see some deaths related to the virus.\u00a0\n\"When death starts to happen and the proportion of cases that end up in deaths goes up, that means you're getting toward the end,\" Furness said.\u00a0\nBut New Brunswick could be\u00a0unique, in that it\u00a0has managed to avoid community spread relatively well, he said.\u00a0\n\"It looks like you're through the peak and that you never got high community spread. And that although you can expect to see a few deaths, it's not going to be anywhere near what the provincial modelling numbers were saying last week.\"\nThe government released its COVID-19 projections last week, predicting between 550 and 1,750 people could die in the next 18 to 24 months.\u00a0\nBetween 15 and 132 people could die this month alone, the projections suggested.\nWhat happens over the next month will depend on how well the province restricts travel.\n\"How New Brunswick handles new cases coming into [the province], I think is the big determinant,\" he said.\nBut Furness also said it's difficult for Canada, or any country, to determine how low numbers need to be so\u00a0governments can\u00a0lift restrictions.\u00a0\nAbout one-third of all cases never show symptoms, which makes\u00a0it difficult to know when it's safe to ease emergency measures.\n\"It's cause for concern that we're testing in a way that doesn't match the way the virus works.\"\u00a0\nThe one-time $900 New Brunswick emergency income benefit has been distributed to more than 33,000 people so far, Premier Blaine Higgs announced Tuesday.\nThe benefit was created for workers or self-employed people who lost their jobs because of the pandemic.\nTo date, the provincial government has provided more than $30 million in benefit payments.\nThe benefit was created to provide a bridge for people\u00a0who would be applying for employment insurance or the new Canada emergency response benefit.\nSince the federal program started\u00a0on April 6, applications for the New Brunswick benefit have closed but\u00a0Higgs said applications which were submitted by the deadline continue to be processed.\nThe City of Saint John says it has been forced to\u00a0reinstate bus fares and parking regulations, after they were suspended\u00a0last month because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMayor Don Darling said Tuesday that bus fares had to be reintroduced because the city's financial situation is impossible to maintain otherwise.\n\"Fare collection was suspended because we didn't have a mechanism to collect it in a safe way,\" Darling said.\u00a0\nBeginning Tuesday, bus fares will be collected through Plexiglas barriers.\u00a0\n\"We simply cannot afford to not collect some level of fare for the bus,\" Darling said.\nPotential financial losses from transit alone would have reached up to $1 million if the fare had continued to be free.\u00a0\nPlexiglas barriers are still being installed on all city buses. On buses with barriers, passengers must enter through the front door to pay the fare.\u00a0\nPassengers are not required to pay a fare on the buses that don't have Plexiglas. On those buses, passengers should enter through the rear door.\nMarch bus passes are valid for the month of April.\nThe Saint John Parking Commission has started enforcing on and off street parking regulations, including alternate-side parking, accessible parking, and monthly parking.\u00a0\nMarket Square and Peel Plaza are operational and fee collection has also resumed.\nTeachers are reaching out to students this week to lay out the final 10 weeks of classes, if they haven't already.\nThe Anglophone West School District conducted a telephone survey to find out how many students don't have access to reliable technology or stable internet for online learning. About 200 of the 8,600 people who responded don't have adequate access.\nDavid McTimoney, superintendent of the Anglophone West\u00a0School District, said the district will stay in touch with those students over the phone.\nHe said he has been working on preparations for online coursework with teachers and collaborating with other superintendents.\n\"We're ready to roll ahead with that continuity of learning and looking forward to it,\" McTimoney said.\n\"We want to make sure students aren't disadvantaged when it comes to rolling out [the work].\"\nPeople concerned they might have\u00a0COVID-19 can\u00a0take a self-assessment\u00a0on the government website. Symptoms of coronavirus include fever,\u00a0a new or worsening\u00a0cough,\u00a0and\u00a0breathlessness, as well as sore throat, headache and\u00a0runny nose.

He not only lost access to cameras and other equipment, the wider pandemic closures effectively barred him from gathering with classmates to complete their jointly created projects.\u00a0It's been challenging figuring out how to continue in the interim.\n\"If you shoot footage on your iPhone or whatever, it's not going to match with the cinema cameras that the school is kind enough to let us use,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"And the actual process of screening in front of an audience that you can see, instead of on a Zoom call, that \u2014 obviously \u2014 we're not getting.\"\nThough she's working with a professionally equipped kitchen rather than a film set, Maria Burguette has faced similar issues. A student from Mexico City, Burguette just completed \u2014 via remote learning \u2014 her final few weeks of the baking and pastry arts management program at Centennial College.\nFinishing a program she estimates as 70 to 80 per cent \"hands-on\" via online videos and demos was both challenging and frustrating, said the Toronto-based student. For example, her final weeks were to have included in-person workshops and sessions mastering advanced techniques for breadmaking, sugar art and chocolate work in her school's commercial kitchens.\n\"It's something that you need to feel, you need to see \u2026 it's all about the texture, the smell, the looks. Consistency is everything,\" Burguette noted.\n\"It's hard to see it through web, like through a webcam or a phone or whatever electronic device you're using. It's nothing like being there and being able to touch it with your hands and to taste it and see all the process. It's completely different.\"\nShe's also dismayed that though she and her classmates were not using resources, like pricey ingredients, or receiving the same hands-on experience they'd paid for, schools are generally not refunding tuition costs \u2014 something that hits her harder as an international student who paid a higher fee for her studies.\nAspiring massage therapist Corry Ouellette is concerned about the quality of what learning at home has entailed and whether she'll gain the experience required for her chosen profession.\n\"I hope that I'm going to get out of this what I paid for \u2014 and then be doing that profession at the end,\" she said.\nFor Ouellette, who is just ending her first term of a fast-track program at Toronto's Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy, the past six weeks have underlined both opportunities and challenges with remote learning. She's appreciated how some teachers have been creative in retooling curriculum typically taught hands-on into video sessions delivered via platforms like Zoom or Skype.\u00a0\nHowever, not all have figured\u00a0out how to teach in new ways.\u00a0\"It takes time, takes some ingenuity. I'm not sure every teacher is going to possess that,\" she said.\nLearning a hands-on profession is critically dependent on in-person practice, Ouellette added.\n\"It's like muscle memory. It just becomes natural. You want someone who is working in a health care profession \u2026 to be confident and comfortable,\" she said.\u00a0\"I know that I'm only going to get that if I practise a lot.\"\u00a0\nOuellette\u00a0hopes\u00a0her school will offer tutoring and makeup sessions \"to guarantee that we have the skills that we need going forward into this career.\n\"I will push for it, that's for sure, because it's important to me.\"\nThe drastic changes the pandemic has forced upon the education system is one of the biggest challenges Anne Sado says she's had to face in her 17 years as president of George Brown College, a school with a reputation for excellence in experiential learning.\n\"I can't say that I know we've been able to cover everything in the same way that it would have been done in the lab,\" she admitted, but she lauded her faculty and students for bringing \"creativity and collaboration\" into the forefront.\nFor instance, the culinary school has pivoted\u00a0to lessons and assignments delivered through videos and online conferencing. Early childhood education students have been supporting families with virtual story times, activities and other interactions. George Brown has even implemented a virtual welding lab, with a simulation that Sado had to try out for herself.\n\"We haven't been able to follow through on all of our programs,\" she noted, saying that some \u2014 like construction or mechanical engineering\u00a0\u2014 will require students to complete lab work at a later date. But that is her intention, whenever public health officials give schools the go-ahead to reopen.\nWe will \"make opportunities for students to come back and get access to those labs. What we can't confirm right now is exactly when that will happen.\"\nWATCH | 'Be innovative \u2026 resilient:' George Brown president's message to students:\nIn the interim, George Brown is not accepting new students for the summer term, \"because we just thought it would be easier for students who've already been in the program to continue, rather than to bring first-time students\"\u00a0in at this time, Sado said.\u00a0\nHer team is also prepping scenarios that take into account a host of possibilities for the fall, from continuing online learning upfront and delaying hands-on sessions for later in the season to extending school hours to run labs throughout the day.\n\"We just actually spoke this morning about what can we do to get students volunteer experiences, other things that they can do, that they actually can gain skills and knowledge and experiences they'll be able then to use with employers in the future, whenever that market does open up.\"\nBut when campuses reopen, Nathaniel Winsor\u00a0is wondering what they will look like.\u00a0A third-year PhD student in the University of Toronto's department of immunology, he typically spends 95 per cent of his time in lab research.\u00a0\nSince his campus shuttered, however, \"pretty much 90 per cent of my day now is what I would be spending 10 per cent of my day on doing two months ago.\"\nThough he spends time with online seminars, lectures, weekly research meetings and things like writing manuscripts and processing previously gathered data, \"nothing can replace lab time,\" he said.\n\"If you're not generating new data, to do it all remotely is pretty impossible.\"\nWhen he and his colleagues are able to return to the lab, they'll be heading into small confined spaces: centralized rooms where, for instance, 10 people might be sharing equipment.\n\"Maintaining social distancing in those environments is going to be really hard,\" Winsor noted.\n\"What is it going to look like when it does reopen? Is it going to be shift work? Is it going to be days on, days off?\"\nAfter receiving some questionnaires about how his work has been affected, Winsor believes university officials are still trying to take stock of exactly how the school can safely reopen.\n\"I know we'll be back in the lab. I haven't heard a date yet, but I know it's going to happen. What that's going to look like, I have no idea.\"\n"}, {"author": "Andrew Leach", "title": "OPINION | Greens' climate plan adds up to Mission: Improbable", "description": "Kicking the tires on the federal party's new energy and environment plan", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/green-party-climate-plan-mission-possible-andrew-leach-1.5220091", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5220220.1563810661!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/elizabeth-may.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 29, 2019 5:00 AM MT", "2019-08-12T17:11:02.009Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first in a series of articles from energy and environmental economist Andrew Leach\u00a0about the federal political parties' climate plans. Read his other articles here:\nIt's summer,\u00a0so we can all likely be forgiven for not paying attention to plans and early platform commitments in the lead-up to the fall election. One of those plans, the \"Mission: Possible\"\u00a0climate change plan from the Green Party, merits more critical attention than it's getting.\nWhat drew my attention to it was the publication of a transcript of the interview that Green Party Leader Elizabeth May did with Macleans' Paul Wells in Ottawa, but you can see the plan here. A few things in the interview rubbed me the wrong way, not least of which was the implication that the policies that many of us have been working on for years amounted to little or nothing.\nAfter tweeting a little too much about this interview and the plan itself, I also had the opportunity to chat with May, and some of her comments to me are reflected here as well. It's certainly to the credit of the Greens that they reached out, not just at the policy level, but also with a phone call from the leader, to clarify their plans.\nMission: Possible proposes a radical transformation of Canada's economy in a frighteningly short period of time. Beyond the scope and scale of Mission: Possible, the regional disparity of the likely impacts is remarkable.\nLet's be clear: if the world is to act on climate change in sufficient measure to meet global goals, we're going to need a lot of transformation quickly. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change (IPCC) reported recently\u00a0that keeping the global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees would likely require a decline in global emissions of about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030.\nThe Green plan gives a sense of the order of magnitude of the transitions we'd need to see if we're going to meet aggressive global goals. For that, they deserve credit. However, the plan leaves far too many loose ends, includes far too many inconsistencies, and off-hands near-impossible adoption rates for retrofits and renewable power. And, it doesn't say a lot about how these actions will spur similar kinds of cuts globally so as to benefit from reduced impacts of climate change.\nIf you are going to address emissions in Canada, you first need to know where they come from. It's become fashionable in conservative circles to point at heavy industry as the source of Canada's emissions, while exempting from scrutiny emissions from chimneys and tailpipes. Polluters not commuters, to borrow from Doug Ford.\nElizabeth May makes a bit of the same mistake in her conversation with Wells when she says first that, \"there are basically 200 facilities across Canada that are responsible for the lion's share of greenhouse gases.\"\nIn fact, the 200 largest industrial facilities account for about 32 per cent\u00a0of our national emissions \u2014 a significant share, but not the lion's share by any means.\nIf you want an accurate summary by sector, oil and gas production (27 per cent), transportation (24 per cent), buildings (11 per cent), and electricity (10 per cent) account for about 75 per cent of emissions, with other heavy industry (10 per cent), agriculture (10 per cent) and waste disposal (six per cent) making up the rest. Provincially, Alberta dominates with 38 per cent of national emissions, and the top five emitting provinces account for 91 per cent of emissions combined.\nTo reduce emissions from oil and gas, the Greens' plan pledges to ban oil imports and fracking, to eliminate not-clearly-defined subsidies and to continue carbon pricing. May also alludes to stringent regulations on emissions-intensive sources in her interview with Wells, though that's not reflected in the plan.\nFrankly, I'd have expected to see stronger leave it in the ground language, but it's not there. There's a throwaway about transitioning the oilsands to supply only petrochemical facilities by 2050, but that's it \u2014 the lack of a clear oilsands policy is surprising given that oilsands production alone accounts for more than 10 per cent of Canada's emissions.\nBanning oil imports has the potential to create chaos with no clear emissions impact.\nCanada imports a lot of crude, much of it to supply refineries in Eastern Canada. How are you going to replace or eliminate demand for those barrels? In her interview with Wells, May talks about using Newfoundland oil, but using currently-exported Newfoundland oil would still leave Eastern Canada short about two million cubic metres per month (about 400,000 barrels per day).\nPerhaps\u00a0the Greens expect some refineries to close? If they do, they should say so. Otherwise, the options to keep them open include more pipeline capacity from the West or continued tanker-borne imports. And, if you're just shifting barrels around and shipping some barrels further than you otherwise would, you're not reducing emissions.\nWe also currently import a lot of hydrocarbon liquids to dilute oilsands bitumen production for shipping via pipelines. Again, clarity is needed here: if we're not going to import diluent, then what? Perhaps, in line with Elizabeth May's previous statements, we could upgrade or partially upgrade more bitumen in Alberta. This would reduce the need for diluent, but to offset our imports, a major processing increase would be needed and this would increase both emissions in Alberta and total, life-cycle emissions from oilsands.\nIt seems odd that a Green party would be behind tens of billions of dollars in heavy oil refining capacity, especially in a North American market that is already over-supplied with refined products.\nThere's a lot of contradiction here since Mission: Possible states that it would allow investment in upgraders and, presumably, full conversion refineries, in line with previous statements from May. Yet, in clarifying comments to me, Ms. May stated that there is no need for new pipelines and no support for new fossil fuel infrastructure. That leaves a pretty gaping hole that needs to be addressed.\nElectricity would also be in for dramatic changes under the Greens' plan: they pledge to remove all fossil fuel generation by 2030. Nationally, about 20 per cent\u00a0of our generation comes from coal and natural gas, with a little bit from oil. Stated that way, it sounds manageable, but fossil fuel sources make up more than 85 per cent of the generation in Alberta, over 80 per cent in Saskatchewan, and more than 50 per cent in Nova Scotia. Furthermore, natural gas plants also often serve as peaking plants, supplying the grid only during periods of high demand. They are, therefore, both relatively low generators\u00a0and crucial to overall system reliability.\nReplacing all of that in 10 years? When electricity is a provincial jurisdiction? How?\nThe answer, I'm told, lies in the plan's proposal to \"rebuild and revamp\"\u00a0our east-west electricity grid. Interties \u2014 the connections that allow current to pass between separate electric utility systems \u2014 are indeed crucial to increasing the use of renewable power.\nBut constructing substantial interprovincial interties in 10 years is a challenge, let alone construction at a scale sufficient to offset mothballed fossil fuel generation in some regional markets.\nAnd because you never want to have a single point of failure, jurisdictions would need to have either peaking power plants or immediately droppable demand to offset imports in case there's a line failure. This is precisely the capability we are significantly reducing by phasing out gas plants.\nWhile the electricity supply side is undergoing upheaval, the Green plan would also radically increase electricity demand by electrifying transportation and building energy use.\nThe plan pledges to ensure that all new cars are electric by 2030 and that, by 2040, all internal combustion vehicles are off the road. This seems like a lot, but it's a path less aggressive than the one Norway is currently following, and with the speed at which range is increasing and cost is decreasing for electric vehicles, it's plausible. Meeting these targets would increase electricity demand, likely by 5-10 per cent. Again, this is significant but manageable in and of itself.\nThe plan leaves open the question of heavier-duty vehicles, where the electrification challenges get much larger, as this Julia Pyper piece points out. But\u00a0at least there's a plausible path to these outcomes.\nBut then things get really serious. The plan calls for retrofitting every building in Canada to be carbon neutral by 2030. Every. Building. In. Canada. In 10 years.\nCanada has more than\u00a014 million private dwellings and, in every province but Quebec and New Brunswick, more than half of average household energy consumption comes from natural gas or heating oil. And you've got commercial and industrial buildings on top of that.\nYou can get part way to carbon neutrality with renewable natural gas, but you're going to have to electrify a lot of heating and hot water systems, and make sure that electricity is carbon neutral to meet this goal. And you're going to need a whole lot more electricity to do that.\nAnd\u00a0we haven't even considered how we're going to replace industrial heat currently provided by on-site combined heat and power systems fuelled by natural gas, never mind the mind-boggling logistics and costs of deep retrofits to Canada's entire building stock.\nIn conversation with me, May compared the effort involved to the rescue of British forces at Dunkirk in World War II. She might be underestimating the challenge.\nThe combined electricity demand changes would likely mean upgrades to most local distribution systems at a time when we're undertaking an unprecedented revamp of our electricity supply and a major investment in transmission.\nHow's it all going to get paid for? And how would the federal government mitigate the massive regional differences in the costs of these policies? And I'll remind you again: electricity and the building stock are both within provincial jurisdiction.\nPerhaps we'll see more in the lead-up to the election, but today this remains more of a wish list than a plan. I'm assured that more detail, including a full costing of all the measures by the Parliamentary Budget Office, is coming, so that might assuage some of these critiques.\nThis column is an opinion.

Rentals are hard to come by.\nThe most recent data from the Yukon Bureau of Statistics put the average house sale price in Whitehorse in the second quarter of 2019 at a record-high $529,500 \u2014 a 10.5 per cent increase from a year earlier. The average condo went for $354,700.\n\"We have a shortage of affordable housing \u2014\u00a0entry-level type housing,\" said Marc Perreault, president of the Yukon Real Estate Association.\n\"It pushes people into having to buy homes that are more expensive than they would like to, or could, or can. And it pushes the prices up because people are getting the prices they're asking for homes ... we've seen it for years now, and it's a difficult issue to address.\"\nFor Cory Levasseur and his partner, it was enough to drive them out of the territory. They originally moved up from Ontario last year when his partner found work in Yukon as a firefighter, but after a year they reluctantly decided to go back.\n\"To just find a, you know, just a house or apartment that would be affordable on our budget, it was next to impossible to find,\" Levasseur said.\n\"It was bittersweet. I did not want to leave \u2014 at all. And I still think about it every day.\"\nFor Meg Grudeski, housing coordinator for the Yukon Anti-Poverty Coalition, it's not just a matter of building more houses \u2014 although that's part of it.\nShe says Yukon simply does not have enough options for people with varied needs and financial resources.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Housing is growing as an issue as we see income disparity continue to expand \u2014 so the gap between folks who are on fixed income or low income, and folks who aren't, is getting larger,\" Grudeski said.\n\"There is a continuum of housing that needs to be available.\"\u00a0\nThat also means looking beyond Whitehorse, she says. Some people in Whitehorse may want to move back to their home communities, where housing is more affordable \u2014 but they won't if it means they can't access the services they need.\n\"People have to make very difficult decisions,\" she said.\nGrudeski\u00a0thinks it's something the federal government should take seriously, and partner\u00a0with local governments to find solutions.\u00a0\nDoris Bill,\u00a0chief of the Kwanlin D\u00fcn First Nation in Whitehorse, agrees. \u00a0\n\"Affordable housing is really a big issue in the territory. And I just really hope that whichever federal party gets in and forms government would make it a priority,\" she said.\n\"It's a community problem and we all need to be a part of the solution.\"\nSome in Whitehorse, including the Real Estate Association, have high hopes for the First Nation's plan to offer up land for lease on its territory. That could happen by next year.\nBut Bill says that's not the whole solution.\n\"It's not. It's maybe a portion of the solution, but there are other solutions out there that we need to explore,\" she said.\n\"Housing Yukoners\u00a0is not Kwanlin D\u00fcn's problem. It is everyone's problem. And government has a role in that.\" \u00a0\nYukon's federal candidates were asked for their take. They were asked how big of an issue they\u00a0think\u00a0housing is, and what solutions they might propose.\u00a0\nHere are some of their emailed statements, provided to Radio-Canada. They have been edited for length.\nLarry Bagnell, Liberal\n\"As I have said through out the campaign, the most important issues are climate change and housing.\n\"We have already funded a number of housing projects in the Yukon, both in Whitehorse and the communities. We have over 25 housing or homelessness initiatives with Yukon First Nations. But there is much more to do.\u00a0\n\"Starting\u00a0in 2020, we will implement the Canada Housing Benefit, a program that will assist over 300,000 families and provide an estimated average of $2,500 per year to each household that is having difficulty affording their rental payments.\u00a0\n\"Budget 2019 introduced the First Time Homebuyer's incentive, to help 100,000 first time home buyers, by having the federal government purchase up to 10 per cent\u00a0of their mortgage, thus making their mortgage payment lower.\u00a0\n\"We have also announced, that we would provide up to $40,000 interest free loans to up to 1.5 million Canadians to make their homes more energy and cost efficient, thus more affordable.\"\nJustin Lemphers, NDP\u00a0\n\"Access to housing is a critically important issue in Yukon. Without a safe place to call home, people are increasingly vulnerable and living at risk.\u00a0\n\"A New Democrat government will partner with provinces, territories, and municipalities to\u00a0create half a million units of affordable housing over the next 10\u00a0years. This will include social housing, community, and non-market housing, as well as co-ops. We'll make sure that affordable housing investments go to rural and northern communities too.\n\"We will spur the construction of affordable homes by\u00a0waiving the GST in Yukon\u00a0on the construction of new affordable rental units \u2014\u00a0a simple change that will help get new units built faster and keep them affordable for the long term.\n\"We will re-introduce\u00a030-year terms to CMHC insured mortgages\u00a0on entry-level homes for first time home buyers allowing for\u00a0smaller monthly payments.\n\"We'll also double the Home Buyer's\u00a0Tax Credit to $1,500\u00a0to help people with closing costs.\"\nLenore Morris, Green\n\"Housing is likely the number one\u00a0local issue in Yukon. Lack of access to affordable housing is a territory-wide problem but is most acute in the First Nations communities.\u00a0\n\"The solution is to build new affordable housing and\u00a0to renovate some of the existing housing. We need to increase our stock of public housing but I would also like to see incentives provided to private developers/builders, to build affordable housing, especially rental housing, rather than more high price condos and homes. I would also like to see this construction used as an opportunity to increase skills and capacity, in the communities in particular \u2014\u00a0to create jobs for people living there.\"\nJonas Smith, Conservative\n\"If we are going to attract, recruit and retain the workers we need across all sectors from health care and mental health services to responsible mineral development and aviation, the access to land availability and therefore accessible housing development costs is crucial to our territory's sustainability and self-determination.\n\"We are committed to tax cuts for small businesses, seniors and young families alike. We will eliminate the carbon tax and the GST on home heating fuel; a necessity here in the territory.\n\"I will work to ensure Yukoners have more money in their pockets, which can be allocated to their sheltering needs.\u00a0\n\"This, paired\u00a0with\u00a0what I think is one of the federal government's largest and most\u00a0important\u00a0roles; which is to support Yukon First Nations governments and their respective development corporations, with their land availability process, in order to make housing development costs more attainable for Yukoners.\"\nJoseph Zelezny, People's Party\n\"Housing is important just like everything else but more government interference is not the answer. The markets are inflated thanks to cheap debt and higher government fees and taxes. The incentives that exist in some cases due to government interference are backwards and also the value of houses reflect in part the devaluation of Canadian dollars.\n\"Cutting taxes and reducing the influence of government in\u00a0people's lives and repealing the economy-killing regulations like Bill C-69 and the carbon tax will enable prosperity and wage growth which will allow for a rebalancing between the value of a home and annual income. The gap is too great.\n\"Immigration numbers also must be reduced nationwide to reduce demand on limited supply.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian families will pay nearly $500 more in 2020 for food, report says", "description": "Canada's Food Price Report 2020 cites changing weather patterns, 'elephant in the room,' as big factor", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/climate-change-food-price-increase-report-1.5383507", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5383526.1575464254!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/food-price-report-20181204.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 04, 2019 9:28 AM ET", "2019-12-04T20:11:05.344Z"], "source": null, "content": "The average Canadian family will pay up to an extra $487 for food next year, according to an annual report that highlights climate change as a big\u00a0culprit for rising prices, especially in the produce department.\nUnexpected snowstorms, droughts and other weather events have impacted crops and food prices in the past, said Simon Somogyi, lead researcher from Ontario's\u00a0University of Guelph.\nBut for 2020, he and others behind\u00a0\"Canada's Food Price Report 2020,\" highlight climate change.\n\"We're deliberately pointing out that, you know: climate change is causing the droughts, is causing the bad snowstorms that's impacting prices,\" he said, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released on Oct. 8.\nThe report calls the impact of changing weather patterns on our food systems through droughts, forest fires, heavy precipitation, reduced freshwater access and rising sea levels \"the elephant in the room\" for 2020.\n\"Canadian farmers will face challenges in the future dealing with unpredictable crop yields, heat-wave livestock threats, pasture availability, and pest and disease outbreaks,\" reads the report from researchers at Dalhousie University in Halifax\u00a0and the University of Guelph.\nThat link between climate change and food prices comes with a forecast that the average Canadian family will spend $12,667 on food at grocery stores and restaurants in 2020.\nThat's two to four per cent more than in 2019 \u2014 though\u00a0the researchers expect it to be closer to the top end of that range. It's the second-highest prediction since 2013, outdone only by an anticipated three to five per cent, or $420, rise for 2017. The algorithm provides a two per cent range for the national forecast.\nCanadians also face relatively steady inflation. The consumer price index rose 1.9 per cent year over year in October, according to Statistics Canada \u2014 the same increase as the previous two months. Increases have remained below 2.5 per cent since Sept. 2018.\nA hotter climate is one factor behind an increase in bacterial outbreaks such as E. coli, Somogyi said, as hotter temperatures and unpredictable heat waves increase bacterial growth. In recent years, multiple E. coli outbreaks prompted grocers to pull romaine lettuce off their shelves and restaurants to stop serving the leafy green, which tend\u00a0to drive up prices for alternatives, like spinach.\nProduce prices also trend up because Canada imports vast amounts of its food as the colder weather limits what can be grown. Imported goods can fluctuate in price due to trade issues creating slowdowns at borders or weather events impacting delivery logistics.\nFood trends can also prompt price swings. This year, celery costs skyrocketed partly due to a fad diet based on purported health benefits of celery juice. In May, one major Canadian grocer advertised celery stalks for $5.99 online \u2014 compared to a more typical, roughly $3-per-kilogram cost for much of the years prior to April 2018, when Statistics Canada stopped tracking the vegetable.\nIt's difficult to put a number on how much of the anticipated 2020 food price increase comes from climate change, said Somogyi, but it is responsible for \"the bulk\" of last year's vegetable sticker shock. In the case of the catapulting celery costs, months of unseasonably cold weather and heavy rainfall in California created supply issues.\nBut the stability of food supply isn't climate change's sole casualty, as it sparks changes to demand too, said Sylvain Charlebois, lead author from Dalhousie University.\n\"People, when they think about food, they see the planet on their dinner plates much more so than ever before,\" he said.\nYounger generations especially decide what to eat in part by looking at the environmental impact of their meals, said Charlebois, and turn more toward full or partial plant-based diets. Fast-food chains and manufacturers raced to stock and create products to feed this demographic with Beyond Meat and Lightlife alternatives now ubiquitous at restaurants across Canada.\nSomogyi anticipates climate change will continue to boost food prices, particularly in categories where Canada relies heavily on imports, unless big changes occur.\nIn particular, he'd like to see a national food policy that focuses on producing more high-cost items, like many vegetables, in Canada through vertical and indoor farming. That would reduce time to market, costs and risks of bacterial outbreaks, he said.\n\"If we maintain our current food, Canadian food distribution structure, I can see that happening each year \u2014 four per cent, 10 per cent, 15 per cent.\"\nThe federal government released a long-awaited food policy in June 2019 \u2014 the first in Canada \u2014 after starting public consultations in 2017. The policy addressed\u00a0four significant areas for short- and long-term action, including:\nCertain initiatives announced as part of the food policy could support vertical or indoor farming, said Agriculture Canada spokesperson\u00a0James Watson in an email.\nThe department is also exploring vertical and container agriculture beyond the food policy, he said, pointing to a August\u00a02017 workshop it held where experts identified research and development needs in this area.\n\"Vertical and greenhouse production show potential for increasing food security [particularly in remote areas of Canada], decreasing transportation costs and increased health for Canadians.\"\nAgriculture Canada is working with others to optimize these farming systems so they can complement traditional ones, he said.\n"}, {"author": "Andrew Leach", "title": "OPINION | Greens' climate plan adds up to Mission: Improbable", "description": "Kicking the tires on the federal party's new energy and environment plan", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/green-party-climate-plan-mission-possible-andrew-leach-1.5220091", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5220220.1563810661!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/elizabeth-may.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 29, 2019 5:00 AM MT", "2019-08-12T17:11:02.009Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first in a series of articles from energy and environmental economist Andrew Leach\u00a0about the federal political parties' climate plans. Read his other articles here:\nIt's summer,\u00a0so we can all likely be forgiven for not paying attention to plans and early platform commitments in the lead-up to the fall election. One of those plans, the \"Mission: Possible\"\u00a0climate change plan from the Green Party, merits more critical attention than it's getting.\nWhat drew my attention to it was the publication of a transcript of the interview that Green Party Leader Elizabeth May did with Macleans' Paul Wells in Ottawa, but you can see the plan here. A few things in the interview rubbed me the wrong way, not least of which was the implication that the policies that many of us have been working on for years amounted to little or nothing.\nAfter tweeting a little too much about this interview and the plan itself, I also had the opportunity to chat with May, and some of her comments to me are reflected here as well. It's certainly to the credit of the Greens that they reached out, not just at the policy level, but also with a phone call from the leader, to clarify their plans.\nMission: Possible proposes a radical transformation of Canada's economy in a frighteningly short period of time. Beyond the scope and scale of Mission: Possible, the regional disparity of the likely impacts is remarkable.\nLet's be clear: if the world is to act on climate change in sufficient measure to meet global goals, we're going to need a lot of transformation quickly. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change (IPCC) reported recently\u00a0that keeping the global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees would likely require a decline in global emissions of about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030.\nThe Green plan gives a sense of the order of magnitude of the transitions we'd need to see if we're going to meet aggressive global goals. For that, they deserve credit. However, the plan leaves far too many loose ends, includes far too many inconsistencies, and off-hands near-impossible adoption rates for retrofits and renewable power. And, it doesn't say a lot about how these actions will spur similar kinds of cuts globally so as to benefit from reduced impacts of climate change.\nIf you are going to address emissions in Canada, you first need to know where they come from. It's become fashionable in conservative circles to point at heavy industry as the source of Canada's emissions, while exempting from scrutiny emissions from chimneys and tailpipes. Polluters not commuters, to borrow from Doug Ford.\nElizabeth May makes a bit of the same mistake in her conversation with Wells when she says first that, \"there are basically 200 facilities across Canada that are responsible for the lion's share of greenhouse gases.\"\nIn fact, the 200 largest industrial facilities account for about 32 per cent\u00a0of our national emissions \u2014 a significant share, but not the lion's share by any means.\nIf you want an accurate summary by sector, oil and gas production (27 per cent), transportation (24 per cent), buildings (11 per cent), and electricity (10 per cent) account for about 75 per cent of emissions, with other heavy industry (10 per cent), agriculture (10 per cent) and waste disposal (six per cent) making up the rest. Provincially, Alberta dominates with 38 per cent of national emissions, and the top five emitting provinces account for 91 per cent of emissions combined.\nTo reduce emissions from oil and gas, the Greens' plan pledges to ban oil imports and fracking, to eliminate not-clearly-defined subsidies and to continue carbon pricing. May also alludes to stringent regulations on emissions-intensive sources in her interview with Wells, though that's not reflected in the plan.\nFrankly, I'd have expected to see stronger leave it in the ground language, but it's not there. There's a throwaway about transitioning the oilsands to supply only petrochemical facilities by 2050, but that's it \u2014 the lack of a clear oilsands policy is surprising given that oilsands production alone accounts for more than 10 per cent of Canada's emissions.\nBanning oil imports has the potential to create chaos with no clear emissions impact.\nCanada imports a lot of crude, much of it to supply refineries in Eastern Canada. How are you going to replace or eliminate demand for those barrels? In her interview with Wells, May talks about using Newfoundland oil, but using currently-exported Newfoundland oil would still leave Eastern Canada short about two million cubic metres per month (about 400,000 barrels per day).\nPerhaps\u00a0the Greens expect some refineries to close? If they do, they should say so. Otherwise, the options to keep them open include more pipeline capacity from the West or continued tanker-borne imports. And, if you're just shifting barrels around and shipping some barrels further than you otherwise would, you're not reducing emissions.\nWe also currently import a lot of hydrocarbon liquids to dilute oilsands bitumen production for shipping via pipelines. Again, clarity is needed here: if we're not going to import diluent, then what? Perhaps, in line with Elizabeth May's previous statements, we could upgrade or partially upgrade more bitumen in Alberta. This would reduce the need for diluent, but to offset our imports, a major processing increase would be needed and this would increase both emissions in Alberta and total, life-cycle emissions from oilsands.\nIt seems odd that a Green party would be behind tens of billions of dollars in heavy oil refining capacity, especially in a North American market that is already over-supplied with refined products.\nThere's a lot of contradiction here since Mission: Possible states that it would allow investment in upgraders and, presumably, full conversion refineries, in line with previous statements from May. Yet, in clarifying comments to me, Ms. May stated that there is no need for new pipelines and no support for new fossil fuel infrastructure. That leaves a pretty gaping hole that needs to be addressed.\nElectricity would also be in for dramatic changes under the Greens' plan: they pledge to remove all fossil fuel generation by 2030. Nationally, about 20 per cent\u00a0of our generation comes from coal and natural gas, with a little bit from oil. Stated that way, it sounds manageable, but fossil fuel sources make up more than 85 per cent of the generation in Alberta, over 80 per cent in Saskatchewan, and more than 50 per cent in Nova Scotia. Furthermore, natural gas plants also often serve as peaking plants, supplying the grid only during periods of high demand. They are, therefore, both relatively low generators\u00a0and crucial to overall system reliability.\nReplacing all of that in 10 years? When electricity is a provincial jurisdiction? How?\nThe answer, I'm told, lies in the plan's proposal to \"rebuild and revamp\"\u00a0our east-west electricity grid. Interties \u2014 the connections that allow current to pass between separate electric utility systems \u2014 are indeed crucial to increasing the use of renewable power.\nBut constructing substantial interprovincial interties in 10 years is a challenge, let alone construction at a scale sufficient to offset mothballed fossil fuel generation in some regional markets.\nAnd because you never want to have a single point of failure, jurisdictions would need to have either peaking power plants or immediately droppable demand to offset imports in case there's a line failure. This is precisely the capability we are significantly reducing by phasing out gas plants.\nWhile the electricity supply side is undergoing upheaval, the Green plan would also radically increase electricity demand by electrifying transportation and building energy use.\nThe plan pledges to ensure that all new cars are electric by 2030 and that, by 2040, all internal combustion vehicles are off the road. This seems like a lot, but it's a path less aggressive than the one Norway is currently following, and with the speed at which range is increasing and cost is decreasing for electric vehicles, it's plausible. Meeting these targets would increase electricity demand, likely by 5-10 per cent. Again, this is significant but manageable in and of itself.\nThe plan leaves open the question of heavier-duty vehicles, where the electrification challenges get much larger, as this Julia Pyper piece points out. But\u00a0at least there's a plausible path to these outcomes.\nBut then things get really serious. The plan calls for retrofitting every building in Canada to be carbon neutral by 2030. Every. Building. In. Canada. In 10 years.\nCanada has more than\u00a014 million private dwellings and, in every province but Quebec and New Brunswick, more than half of average household energy consumption comes from natural gas or heating oil. And you've got commercial and industrial buildings on top of that.\nYou can get part way to carbon neutrality with renewable natural gas, but you're going to have to electrify a lot of heating and hot water systems, and make sure that electricity is carbon neutral to meet this goal. And you're going to need a whole lot more electricity to do that.\nAnd\u00a0we haven't even considered how we're going to replace industrial heat currently provided by on-site combined heat and power systems fuelled by natural gas, never mind the mind-boggling logistics and costs of deep retrofits to Canada's entire building stock.\nIn conversation with me, May compared the effort involved to the rescue of British forces at Dunkirk in World War II. She might be underestimating the challenge.\nThe combined electricity demand changes would likely mean upgrades to most local distribution systems at a time when we're undertaking an unprecedented revamp of our electricity supply and a major investment in transmission.\nHow's it all going to get paid for? And how would the federal government mitigate the massive regional differences in the costs of these policies? And I'll remind you again: electricity and the building stock are both within provincial jurisdiction.\nPerhaps we'll see more in the lead-up to the election, but today this remains more of a wish list than a plan. I'm assured that more detail, including a full costing of all the measures by the Parliamentary Budget Office, is coming, so that might assuage some of these critiques.\nThis column is an opinion.

He not only lost access to cameras and other equipment, the wider pandemic closures effectively barred him from gathering with classmates to complete their jointly created projects.\u00a0It's been challenging figuring out how to continue in the interim.\n\"If you shoot footage on your iPhone or whatever, it's not going to match with the cinema cameras that the school is kind enough to let us use,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"And the actual process of screening in front of an audience that you can see, instead of on a Zoom call, that \u2014 obviously \u2014 we're not getting.\"\nThough she's working with a professionally equipped kitchen rather than a film set, Maria Burguette has faced similar issues. A student from Mexico City, Burguette just completed \u2014 via remote learning \u2014 her final few weeks of the baking and pastry arts management program at Centennial College.\nFinishing a program she estimates as 70 to 80 per cent \"hands-on\" via online videos and demos was both challenging and frustrating, said the Toronto-based student. For example, her final weeks were to have included in-person workshops and sessions mastering advanced techniques for breadmaking, sugar art and chocolate work in her school's commercial kitchens.\n\"It's something that you need to feel, you need to see \u2026 it's all about the texture, the smell, the looks. Consistency is everything,\" Burguette noted.\n\"It's hard to see it through web, like through a webcam or a phone or whatever electronic device you're using. It's nothing like being there and being able to touch it with your hands and to taste it and see all the process. It's completely different.\"\nShe's also dismayed that though she and her classmates were not using resources, like pricey ingredients, or receiving the same hands-on experience they'd paid for, schools are generally not refunding tuition costs \u2014 something that hits her harder as an international student who paid a higher fee for her studies.\nAspiring massage therapist Corry Ouellette is concerned about the quality of what learning at home has entailed and whether she'll gain the experience required for her chosen profession.\n\"I hope that I'm going to get out of this what I paid for \u2014 and then be doing that profession at the end,\" she said.\nFor Ouellette, who is just ending her first term of a fast-track program at Toronto's Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy, the past six weeks have underlined both opportunities and challenges with remote learning. She's appreciated how some teachers have been creative in retooling curriculum typically taught hands-on into video sessions delivered via platforms like Zoom or Skype.\u00a0\nHowever, not all have figured\u00a0out how to teach in new ways.\u00a0\"It takes time, takes some ingenuity. I'm not sure every teacher is going to possess that,\" she said.\nLearning a hands-on profession is critically dependent on in-person practice, Ouellette added.\n\"It's like muscle memory. It just becomes natural.

Early childhood education students have been supporting families with virtual story times, activities and other interactions. George Brown has even implemented a virtual welding lab, with a simulation that Sado had to try out for herself.\n\"We haven't been able to follow through on all of our programs,\" she noted, saying that some \u2014 like construction or mechanical engineering\u00a0\u2014 will require students to complete lab work at a later date. But that is her intention, whenever public health officials give schools the go-ahead to reopen.\nWe will \"make opportunities for students to come back and get access to those labs. What we can't confirm right now is exactly when that will happen.\"\nWATCH | 'Be innovative \u2026 resilient:' George Brown president's message to students:\nIn the interim, George Brown is not accepting new students for the summer term, \"because we just thought it would be easier for students who've already been in the program to continue, rather than to bring first-time students\"\u00a0in at this time, Sado said.\u00a0\nHer team is also prepping scenarios that take into account a host of possibilities for the fall, from continuing online learning upfront and delaying hands-on sessions for later in the season to extending school hours to run labs throughout the day.\n\"We just actually spoke this morning about what can we do to get students volunteer experiences, other things that they can do, that they actually can gain skills and knowledge and experiences they'll be able then to use with employers in the future, whenever that market does open up.\"\nBut when campuses reopen, Nathaniel Winsor\u00a0is wondering what they will look like.\u00a0A third-year PhD student in the University of Toronto's department of immunology, he typically spends 95 per cent of his time in lab research.\u00a0\nSince his campus shuttered, however, \"pretty much 90 per cent of my day now is what I would be spending 10 per cent of my day on doing two months ago.\"\nThough he spends time with online seminars, lectures, weekly research meetings and things like writing manuscripts and processing previously gathered data, \"nothing can replace lab time,\" he said.\n\"If you're not generating new data, to do it all remotely is pretty impossible.\"\nWhen he and his colleagues are able to return to the lab, they'll be heading into small confined spaces: centralized rooms where, for instance, 10 people might be sharing equipment.\n\"Maintaining social distancing in those environments is going to be really hard,\" Winsor noted.\n\"What is it going to look like when it does reopen? Is it going to be shift work? Is it going to be days on, days off?\"\nAfter receiving some questionnaires about how his work has been affected, Winsor believes university officials are still trying to take stock of exactly how the school can safely reopen.\n\"I know we'll be back in the lab. I haven't heard a date yet, but I know it's going to happen. What that's going to look like, I have no idea.\"\n"}, {"author": "Zach Dubinsky, Lisa Mayor", "title": "Who's really behind Toronto's chain of illegal pot shops that won't quit?", "description": "CAFE's backers have included a notorious counterfeiter and a Lamborghini-driving ex-wrestling champ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-cafe-cannabis-dispensaries-1.5217307", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5217466.1563504284!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/law-enforcement-raid-and-shut-down-of-cafe-dispensary-on-harbord-street-in-toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 19, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-07-19T08:00:00.880Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Amid scuffles and some shouting, a familiar scene played out in downtown Toronto last week.

He claimed CBC journalists threatened him when they sent questions to CAFE earlier this week that mentioned his modest criminal record, but he did not address queries about the chain of pot shops.\nWeber's precise role in the growth of CAFE is similarly unclear. Undergoing cross-examination in an unrelated 2017 lawsuit, he said under oath that while he loaned $10,000 to Galvano in the lead-up to CAFE's opening and helped him secure a lease, he was not part of the business, nor was he making any money from it.\nBut a former employee of a digital currency company founded by Weber told CBC\u00a0News that it was well known around the office, back in CAFE's early days, that Weber was involved, and that he boasted of it. \nWeber features in many photos on Galvano's Instagram feed, including posts where the pair are shown \"flying to a meeting\" together or on that trip to Jamaica where CAFE staff attended a festival.\nAnd Weber's spouse, real estate agent Michelle Kam, filed the incorporation papers and signed property records for the federally registered company that owns CAFE's premises on Bloor Street West. She's also named as the guarantor of the $1.7-million mortgage on the property. Until last February, she served as the director of that registered company.\nWeber has a history with deceit. He has a long criminal record, including convictions for forgery, fraud, cultivating marijuana and, notably, counterfeiting.\u00a0\nIn the early 2000s, he and three friends became so good at forging $100 bills that he is sometimes cited as a reason many businesses stopped accepting them around that time. He was caught by the RCMP, convicted and sentenced in 2001 to five years in jail.\nMore recently, Weber has run afoul of the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). In 2011, the OSC found he broke the law by engaging in unregistered stock trading and unregistered investment advising. He is currently facing allegations of illegally soliciting and accepting investments for the\u00a0digital currency company he founded, where he went by\u00a0\"Wesley Kam.\"\u00a0\nWeber has also used the alias \"Jeff Murray\" while giving a deputation to Toronto city councillors about how they should regulate cannabis establishments.\u00a0\u00a0\nHis spouse, Michelle Kam, was in 2017 asked under oath in a lawsuit related to the digital currency company: \"[Do] you agree with me that Mr. Weber has a history of fraud?\" and \"Do you agree with me that Mr. Weber has a history of lying?\" Both times, she answered yes.\nGalvano's past doesn't appear to be as murky. His modest criminal record consists\u00a0of guilty pleas for producing marijuana in 2010 and for a probation violation\u00a0and possession for the purposes of trafficking in 2011. The most he was ever penalized was a $5,000 fine.\u00a0\nThe 2010 conviction stemmed from a police raid on a\u00a0marijuana grow-op in the basement of his home in Windsor. Officers were tipped off by two confidential informants, according to court filings.

One elderly woman scoops filling onto the conveyor belt as those flanking the sides grab the mixture of meat and rice to plunk into prepared cabbage leaves.\nBy the end of the day, they'll pump out 6,000 cabbage rolls. They'll be sold to hungry labourers who pop into Peg's Kitchen for a hearty lunch, be shipped out by the hundreds for catered events, and be frozen to be sold to long-time customers who visit the Park Street location to stock up on the goods.\nPeg's Kitchen is obviously much more than a kitchen.\n\"We are three businesses in one,\" says Peg of the outfit she and her husband, Vern Leippi, founded more than 20 years ago.\nIt took a bit of encouragement from family and friends, a joy of cooking that she and Vern inherited from their German mothers, and a strong community-mindedness that led them to sell their farm near Kronau, Sask., and commit to serving handmade cabbage rolls, perogies and sausages for a living.\nIn 1998, Peg and Vern hosted 250 guests for their 25th wedding anniversary, serving a huge meal on the farm.\u00a0\n\"People came up to us and said, 'This food is so good. You should charge people for it. You shouldn't just give it away,'\" Peg recalls.\nThey started by selling Vern's smoked turkey legs \"that tasted like ham\" and sausage at nearby farmers' markets and craft sales, using the brand Peg's Legs.\nOver time, they introduced perogies and cabbage rolls, a recipe honed over many years and taste-tasted by their three children.\u00a0\nBy 2002, demand for their food reached the point where Peg and Vern had outgrown the commercial kitchen they built in the basement of their farmhouse. It was time to move the operation into the city.\n\"At that time my husband was farming, and farming in the '90s was going downhill and going into the big farms, which we weren't,\" says Peg. \"And so we decided something had to change.\"\nAdding catering to the operation came about unexpectedly. When the health inspector came to assess their new Regina location, he gave them a licence for catering. They quickly learned.\n\"We started with small ones \u2014 [parties of] twenties, thirties, forties \u2026 and we've worked up to hundreds \u2014 in town, out of town, and any kind of function you could think of,\" says Peg.\nAs their catering business grew, so did the Peg's Kitchen brand. People drive in from out of town (some folks are the same customers who frequented Peg and Vern's craft sales), have lunch and buy a few boxes of frozen food. Demand spikes around the holidays.\nPeg says they often comment the restaurant feels homey and inviting, like a small-town restaurant.\u00a0\n\"We told the interior designer when we built the restaurant that we didn't want it to look like a chain restaurant. We want to look like down-home cooking. We want it to look like Grandma made the meal. So we're happy with how the restaurant turned out.\"\nPeg has me taste the Ukrainian lunch, complete with borscht and a freshly baked bun from Indian Head Bakery. It is delicious. I am a second-generation Filipino-Canadian and my grandma did not serve this to me growing up. But I am born and raised in Saskatchewan: perogies, sausage and cabbage rolls most definitely taste like home.\nLooking back over the past 20 years, it's the connection with her customers that Peg says makes her most proud.\u00a0\n\"When you see them here at Christmas time and they're lined up ... from the door for hot food and from the freezer for the frozen food,\" she says, tears welling up, \"it really makes your heart happy and they know you by name.\"\nNow grandparents, Peg and Vern are looking to slow down and sell the business, but they want to pass it on to someone who can keep it going with their own touch.\nI thank Peg and head for the door, but she refuses to let me leave without giving me a cinnamon bun \u2014 just like grandma would do.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/programs/onthecoast/august-14-2019-hunky-bill-1.5247581", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/here-s-what-s-on-the-menu-at-the-2019-cne-1.5247600", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/watson-lake-teacher-learns-from-students-on-ice-trip-1.5247421", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/programs/onthecoast/august-14-2019-hunky-bill-1.5247581", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/here-s-what-s-on-the-menu-at-the-2019-cne-1.5247600", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Carly Ostroff", "title": "9 beauty experts share their must-have affordable buys", "description": " Pssst!

I use it every day, whether it's prepping my lashes for a swipe of mascara or when I'm going for a natural look and just running out the door. I always recommend clamping the curler down twice to get the most dramatic look, first close to the lash line, holding for a few seconds, and then again a bit further away. Pro tip: you can also concentrate the curl at the outer corner to create the illusion of a more elongated, almond-shaped eye.\"\u00a0\nKevyn Aucoin The Eyelash Curler,\u00a0$28, Sephora\nMichelle Bilodeau, writer and editor\u00a0\n\"I really like the Lanolips' balm. It's a staple lip product. I love Bite Beauty too, but they're changing their agave lip balm and taking the lanolin out. I love Lano's version because I frequently have dry lips and I can also get cold sores quite easily if my lips get too dry. This one is pretty lightweight, and I can put it on just as I'm going out of the house quickly to protect myself while I'm walking my daughter to daycare. I also find it's a really good base under lipstick, so I'll put some on and blot it with a tissue and top it off with lipstick.

To cover the costs, the paper's advertising department would sell display ads to a growing corporate sector and to the retailers looking to attract new customers.\nAs it turned out Samyn's\u00a0entrepreneurial dream, like so many during\u00a0the early heady\u00a0days of\u00a0what the Globe and Mail trumpeted as \"the biggest new business sector in Canadian history,\" was not so promising as he\u00a0hoped.\nOne year after legalization, as pot share prices sag,\u00a0the number of cannabis\u00a0users remains stagnant, and provincial distribution\u00a0systems still fail to compete with the illegal sector, the bloom is off the rose.\nAs it turns out Samyn was half right. People really did want a popular and reliable information source about the emerging pot sector. The site got respectable traffic not just from\u00a0Canada and the U.S., but from around the world. But as with so many other cannabis-related ventures begun with such high hopes, the business case just didn't work out.\nLast week The Leaf News, as the Free Press pot venture was called, bid farewell, that is\u00a0\"until the next time Canada legalizes a drug,\" said the online newsletter in the cheeky style it\u00a0had cultivated.\nWhen I spoke to Samyn just over a year ago, the writing was already on the wall.\n\"The advertising revenue has been negligible,\" said Samyn, who had anticipated rules on pot promotion\u00a0would be more like the lucrative liquor sector, with high-value lifestyle ads and glittering product displays. As it turned out, the plain brown wrapper style of packaging\u00a0decreed by federal law was never going to make for a pretty image.\nBesides, advertising rules intended to discourage use rather than help develop a new lucrative industry did not allow for showing people actually enjoying the product and its effects.\n\"They're treating it like tobacco,\" he said.\nThe current disillusionment with the Canadian pot industry is partly due to the contrast with the business hype of startup companies trying to sell\u00a0\"vision,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Michael Armstrong, a professor at Brock University's Goodman School of Business, in St.\u00a0Catharines, Ont., who writes regularly for the Globe and Mail's paid-subscription cannabis newsletter, Report on Business Cannabis Professional.\n\"Two years ago we had all these entrepreneurs big or small selling vision of the empires they were going to build and how wonderfully profitable they were going to be,\" said Armstrong.\nThat's the job of entrepreneurs, like Tesla's Elon Musk or WeWork's Adam Neumann, painting the picture of success to inspire investors to give\u00a0them money. But not all visionary ideas work out. Last week Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis, Canada's two biggest pot companies, revealed that\u00a0revenue was falling and announced stunning losses.\nNow, of course, experts who once declared that a shortage of pot supplies would be hard for the industry to overcome are saying they saw the current glut coming.\n\"If you were a rational investor or a wise investor ... you would be realizing at that point, OK, this is going to be a brand new industry. It's almost certainly going to go through some kind of boom and bust,\" said Armstrong.\nArmstrong says the flood of new pot publications and specialist cannabis reporters was less over-optimistic than\u00a0entrepreneurial as the shrinking journalism industry sought an opportunity for growth. That includes the Globe's specialist site\u00a0for which, so far, Armstrong\u00a0still writes a monthly op-ed.\n\"This is what the private sector does. They place educated bets and the Globe and Mail said, 'This is a brand new industry, there's potentially money here,'\" he said.\nSolomon Israel, though hired to fill the pages of The Leaf News, is now a staff reporter for the Winnipeg Free Press, covering stories that will include the cannabis beat. He says\u00a0that while in the end\u00a0ad revenue was not as good as expected, the two-year run of the site was a success as a public service and in\u00a0helping to put Winnipeg and the paper\u00a0on the map.\n\"Something that I tried to do every day,\" said Israel, \"was to try and focus on things that don't only matter to people who own stocks in cannabis companies but simply to people who might use cannabis and be interested in learning more about legalization and the laws just for themselves.\"\nAnd the public service work the site generated has not disappeared. The Ask Herb\u00a0feature, an advice column, continues\u00a0on the Free Press site as a kind of FAQ of Canadian cannabis wisdom.\nBrock's Armstrong, who is scandalized at the\u00a0mismanagement of the Canadian pot rollout, especially in Ontario, says there is still potential growth in the industry once\u00a0legal sales cut into the black market that retains\u00a0the vast majority of the Canadian trade. But he says\u00a0that requires more stores and more competitive pricing.\nIsrael, who effectively spent two years full time\u00a0becoming a cannabis expert, also sees the industry transforming\u00a0slowly over the coming decades, just as alcohol only gradually became a normal retail product in the years after Prohibition. And from his point of view, the fact that pot smoking has not exploded in popularity since cannabis became legal\u00a0is not a bad thing.\n\"From a public health perspective that's good news, right?\" said\u00a0Israel. \"When you get down to it, the legislation was public health legislation first and foremost, it wasn't legislation that was meant to necessarily create an enormous industry.\"\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Carly Ostroff", "title": "9 beauty experts share their must-have affordable buys", "description": " Pssst!

'Tis the time when our social media feeds are flooded with a very specific kind of sparkle: that of engagement rings. The apparent influx of proposals in and around the holidays isn't merely anecdotal. Recent surveys by Brides and Wedding Wire both (separately) found that December is the most popular time to pop the question by far. So if you've been thinking about proposing to your partner, you might be deep in the planning process or about to plunge right into it.\u00a0\nThere are two main paths people take when searching for the perfect engagement ring: heading straight to a jewelry counter, or finding an artisan who can create a custom piece. Since there isn't a ton of information out there on how to approach the intimidating-from-the-outside process of commissioning a bespoke ring, we reached out to Toronto-based jewelry designer and goldsmith Eden Philippa, who's known for her timeless, vintage-inspired designs. Philippa designed the engagement ring that now lives on my finger, though I was not involved in the design or purchasing process. She and my fianc\u00e9 got it so right, however, that I thought she was the perfect person to give us a full primer on what's involved.\u00a0\nHere are\u00a0her thoughts on why going custom can be so special, what to keep in mind before you commit (to the process, not your partner), and how it all actually goes down.\nWhy go custom?\nThe most obvious benefit of opting for a custom engagement ring over something from a collection is knowing that you're leaving with an entirely one-of-a-kind piece that can't be found on anyone else's finger or feed. It allows a very specific vision to be realized and for unique touches, whether that's playing with styles, metals and stones that aren't typically seen in engagement rings (coloured stones are a personal fave for Philippa, who does a lot of work with teal-tinged Montana Sapphires), or by integrating family stones that may carry a special meaning or history for you or your partner. If you are hoping to use family stones in a custom piece, Philippa recommends getting them appraised ahead of time. \"Sometimes if your stone has been sitting in a setting for 100 years or 50 years it might not be as intact as a newly cut stone,\" she says. \"There could be chips or there could be scratches; I just don't recommend using [damaged] stones in a new piece.\"\nIn addition to those aesthetic accommodations, a jeweller can help you with more practical concerns and decisions as well. For example, if your partner works with their hands but still wants to be able to wear their ring on a day-to-day basis, \"I would recommend a certain style of setting,\" Philippa explains, \"maybe a bezel setting, something that is more secure and protects all the edges of the stone.\" Likewise, if your partner doesn't wear a ton of jewelry, or finds it to be uncomfortable and irksome, a jeweller can work to create a more discreet design that won't feel bulky or get in the way. \"If they find jewelry to be uncomfortable, usually they don't want something that's going to stick up really high, or they don't want a solitaire setting where the stone is very high,\" Philippa says. \"Or they might not want a claw setting that can catch in their hair or on things.\"\nOn a larger scale, the custom process makes for a more intimate, one-on-one relationship between you and the artisan, which can be helpful if you've got a revolving door of questions. For example, you may really want to ensure the stones being used in the design were mined or created in an ethical, eco-friendly way. Philippa notes that many jewellers today, including herself, work with recycled or lab-grown diamonds, and often stones can be traced from mine to market. So if these things matter to you, having a direct line of communication with the person putting all the pieces together can be incredibly valuable.\u00a0\nThe budget for bespoke\nNaturally, one of the biggest sticking points for people when making the decision to go bespoke is budget. But while tailor-made pieces do tend to run pricier than items that are part of an existing collection, that doesn't mean you need to start multiplying your monthly income to plan accordingly for your purchase. \"People think that you need a huge budget for a custom piece or you even need a huge budget for an engagement ring in general,\" Philippa tells us, \"that's definitely the misconception that I clear up the most.\" It actually is possible go custom while keeping the price down \u2014 it just all boils down to the stone you choose. If you're on a budget, Philippa recommends opting for stones like white sapphire or moissanite (a diamond alternative that's mainly lab-grown today), which can be far less expensive than a traditional diamond \u2014 and may sparkle slightly differently \u2014 but shine just as brightly.\u00a0\nThe engagement ring isn't the only piece of jewelry you'll need to budget for when going the custom route, Philippa tells us. A lot of people don't realize that \"a custom ring isn't going to sit with a wedding band from collection,\" she says. \"So that means they're going to have to design a custom [band], and with all the costs associated with a wedding, when it comes to time to choosing [one], most couples don't budget enough.\" To avoid that unpleasant surprise right in the middle of wedding crunch time, be sure to ask your jeweller about their wedding band pricing during the initial engagement ring design conversations. That way, you'll have your ducks in a row, making it easier to account for the extra spend within your overall wedding budget.\u00a0\nAnother big thing to keep in mind when going custom: you probably won't be able to return or substantially alter the ring, meaning your options are a little limited if your partner says 'no' or doesn't love what you've picked out. Most independent jewellers have no-return policies on made-to-order items like engagement rings, so be sure to read the fine print and seek feedback from your partner, or someone close to them like their mom or BFF, before settling on a design and handing over your credit card.\u00a0\nHow it all actually works\nOnce you've decided you're ready to take the marital plunge and have landed on 'custom' as your ring route, the best way to start is by finding out what your partner actually wants in an engagement ring \u2014 they're the ones who'll be wearing it indefinitely, after all. But sometimes our penchant for surprises, or the desire to make the engagement process as special as possible, can take over. Philippa says one of the biggest mistakes she sees people make is \"not paying attention to hints or what their partner likes. I definitely encourage all my clients to come with as much information on their partner's taste and preferences, and from there we have an excellent road map for designing the most beautiful piece.\"\nPhilippa also assures us that the days of engagement ring details being shrouded in secrecy until the moment of the proposal are kind of over, so if you're worried about accurately conveying your partner's wants and needs to your jeweller, why not tackle that part of the process together? \"With custom work, I would say 75% [of the time] it's the woman coming to me first\u2026 or if I'm emailing with them, then they'll both be on the email thread,\" Philippa says. \"I think a lot of women these days really want to have a say in what they're going to wear for the rest of their lives.\" And it's not too difficult to get the best of both worlds either; after the design is hammered out, the proposer can take over and begin planning the perfect way to pop the question, without the help of their partner.\u00a0\u00a0\nOf course, whether you're going in alone or together, there are a few key details you should have ironed out before getting in touch with your jeweller of choice. \"Once I get that initial inquiry, I like to get as much information as possible from the client\u2026 inspiration photos, stone type and size, budget and timeline,\" Philippa tells us. In terms of inspiration photos, a pared down Pinterest board or a small collection of Instagram screenshots is ideal. \"It can get complicated if their partner has sent them 20 different photos and all the photos have really different elements,\" Philippa explains. \"So if that does happen, then I'll just go through all the photos with them and sort of subtract all of the elements that are similar to each other.\" After all those big-picture aspects are all sorted, then come the sketches and quotes, and eventually a cemented design that everyone is happy with.\u00a0\nFrom there, the timing can vary, though Philippa says that typically 4-8 weeks is a safe range to bet on. \"The design and the stock selection process can take anywhere from two weeks to a few months,\" she explains. \"Some clients are dead set on having a specific colour or type of stone, which in some cases can take time to [find]... I recommend folks get in touch a few months before their desired date or trip.\" And, luckily, if you're working with a jeweller in a different province or country, you shouldn't have to account for additional wait time. \"It doesn't really add much\u2026 like maybe a couple days for shipping, depending on where they are in the world,\" says Philippa.\u00a0\nHowever, after the question has been popped, and the proposee has said 'yes', there may be delays if the size of the ring needs to be adjusted. \"Some designs are more accommodating to being resized, but generally I can size a ring up or down one size, and it takes about two weeks to complete,\" Philippa says. She also recommends bringing the ring back to the jeweller who designed it to have these adjustments made, whenever possible \u2014 even if that means sealing that precious stone in an envelope and sending it back across the country.\u00a0\nAs we're wrapping up our chat, I somewhat cynically ask Philippa how much she's forced into the role of therapist, soothing the worries of anxious partners about to put their hearts on the line in a pretty vulnerable way.

Ana Bailao, the city's affordable housing advocate.\nPodium Developments had planned a 27-storey, 386-unit rental building on Dale Avenue, near the Guildwood GO station\u00a0with about 30 per cent of the units earmarked for lower income residents, the developer told CBC Toronto in an email.\nPodium planned to take advantage of a provincial government program that refunds the development charges that builders must pay to municipalities.\n\"We then learned of the [development charge]\u00a0rebate cancellation in November, 2018 and lost all provincial funding,\" the email says.\nPodium went back to the drawing board. The new, smaller incarnation of the project, which Scarborough community council passed on to staff for more study last week, calls for\u00a0seven- and\u00a012-storey buildings, with only 33 affordable rental units \u2014\u00a0about 11 per cent of the total.\nSteve Clark, the province's minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, defended his government's decision to cut the rebate program, saying it benefited only 13 communities province-wide.\n\"We decided ... that we would look at exempting new rental units from rent control, hopefully spurring on rental development in all 444 municipalities,\" he said.\nBut Podium said it needs the funding help now, and rent controls don't pay\u00a0off for years.\nBailao said she's not aware of any other affordable housing projects that have been jeopardized by the province's decision to cut the rebate program.\nPaul Zuliani, Scarborough's director of community planning, emphasized that the project still needs to go through community consultations before its final mix of housing is determined. As well, it's likely there will be changes suggested by city staff before before shovels are in the ground, which could take a year or more.\n\"After you work out all the issues, usually the number of units and the height and the density starts to fall a little bit,\" he said.\n\"So I don't know that the 116 [affordable units]\u00a0was going to be the final outcome of any development, but we'll try to get the 33 up, and we'll see how willing the applicant is to increase the number.\"\nSome locals have already expressed reservations about the project.\nAt a public consultation organized by Podium, residents complained that the 2.25-hectare project will eliminate too much green space in the neighbourhood. And they say the area doesn't have suitable city services to support an influx of new residents.\n\"Let's make housing affordable,\" resident Anita Thachuk said. \"But let's put the support structures in \u00a0that are needed\u00a0\u2014\u00a0schools, underground infrastructure, green space \u2014 to keep our communities healthy.\nPodium's statement indicated the company will ask the federal government to fill the funding void.\nAs well, Clark told CBC Toronto he's prepared to talk about other funding sources with both the city and Podium.\n\"I sympathize with any developer who feels that that there was a missed opportunity,\" he said.\n\"And I want to say to those municipal officials that are involved that if they do want to sit down with me and talk about how we can work together on providing more affordable housing, we still have a number of very significant tools that are available.\"\nThe Dale Avenue project is being fast-tracked because it was approved under the Open Door Affordable Housing Program, a city initiative that helps developers with tax breaks and fee reductions if they agree to build affordable rental housing.\nThe province's development charge rebate program was administered through Open Door.\nOpen Door\u00a0got off the ground in late 2016. \u00a0\nSince then, nine buildings with 239 units have been completed, according to city statistics. Another 54 projects are in development, representing 7,513 units.\nBut a new report from RBC Economics paints a grim picture of what the city needs to ease what it calls Toronto's housing deficit.\n\"To restore equilibrium over, say, a two-year timeframe, we estimate Toronto's rental stock must expand by 53,500 new rental units (the size of the deficit plus two years' worth of demand growth) or an average of 26,800 units per year,\" the report says.\n\"Now here's the rental supply reality: despite mounting developer interest in rental apartment projects and heavy investor involvement in the new-condo market, the number of new rental units making their way to the rental universe falls way short of what's needed in Toronto. The pace has to at least double,\" it continues.\n\"High Toronto construction levels aren't high enough.\"\n"}, {"author": "Max Fawcett", "title": "OPINION | What happens if Albertans keep praying for another oil boom, but God has none left to give?", "description": "If Calgarians are looking for an answer to that question, they could do a lot worse than look to Detroit", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-future-oil-industry-max-fawcett-part-one-1.5273170", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5279189.1568215505!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pray-for-oil-boom.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 11, 2019 9:45 AM MT", "2019-09-11T15:45:45.418Z"], "source": null, "content": "Another day, another divestment.\nOn Aug. 14, the Financial Post reported\u00a0that Koch Industries (yes, that Koch Industries) was selling its collection of oilsands leases to a subsidiary of Paramount Resources for an undisclosed sum of money.\nTo some, like BNN's Amanda Lang, this was more bad news for an already battered energy sector.\n\"The symbolism of yet another multinational player abandoning Canada is very bad,\" she said during her daily television hit.\nNever mind, for a moment, that the assets the Koch Brothers sold were of marginal quality, at best, or that Paramount is far more likely to develop them than they ever were.

The shares of publicly-traded companies, meanwhile, are trading at multi-year lows \u2014 far lower than where they were at before April's election.\nThis isn't Kenney's fault, mind you.\nInstead, it's a reflection of the fact that there's nothing any Canadian politician can do to arrest the technological, economic, and environmental changes that are reshaping the oil and gas industry's future.\nIndeed, those sorts of tectonic shifts are beyond the reach of even the most powerful politician in the world.\nJust ask the U.S. coal industry, which pinned its hopes on Donald Trump's pledge to make it great again only to watch him flail impotently as ever-cheaper natural gas and renewables continued to eat away at their proverbial lunch. By the time he's out of office they'll be lucky if there's even a snack left for them. Politics, as ever, are no match for economics.\nThe same thing is true in the oil industry, where those technological changes have redefined the economic landscape and transformed a market that used to be defined by scarcity of supply into one that's practically drowning in surplus. That's put an end to the days when multinational corporations would back up the metaphorical truck in order to get their hands on some small slice of Alberta's billions of barrels of oil.\nAnd worse still, from the perspective of the companies that own those barrels (and the provincial treasury that benefits from their sale), the growing concern about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions is chipping away at the rampant growth in demand for oil that defined the early 2000s and marking a clear path to its eventual decline.\nThat raises an almost existential question for Calgary.\nIn a city where praying for another oil boom and promising not to piss it away is practically a rite of passage, what happens if God doesn't have any more booms left to give?\nIf Calgarians are looking for an answer, they could do a lot worse than asking someone who's spent the last few decades in Detroit.\nIn 1980, Detroit had the second-highest median income per capita for workers under 35 in the country (nearby Flint, Mich., was number one). Today, those incomes have dropped by nearly $15,000 a year. And while it probably seems strange to compare the two cities, Calgary and Detroit have more in common than it might appear.\nBoth are defined by one dominant industry\u00a0whose economic reach extends beyond its own supply chains and into the vitality of the city's restaurants, bars, boutiques\u00a0and housing market. Both have resisted efforts to diversify away from those industries and expand the scope of their economies. And while Calgary's stock in trade hasn't been disrupted in the way or to the degree that Detroit's was in the 1980s, we're all still in the early innings of a game that's yet to fully play itself out.\nFor Detroit, the disruptive change came in the form of increased competition from Japanese and German automakers and, somewhat ironically, a spike in the price of oil in the late 1970s. And despite increasingly desperate efforts to subsidize and support the city's auto industry, the slide continued more or less uninterrupted until it bottomed out during the 2008 recession.\nFor Calgary, and Alberta, the disruptive forces at work are twofold: the technology that's unlocked billions of barrels in the shales of Texas, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania, and the ever-improving economics of lower-carbon sources of energy like wind and solar. Together, they're transforming the global energy landscape \u2014 and turning what used to be a competitive advantage, Alberta's massive oil reserves, into a potential albatross.\nThat's a staggering turn of events, given that they looked until very recently like a licence to print money with no expiration date. But the fears of peak supply, which drove predictions of $200 per barrel oil and takeover offers in the oilpatch with generous premiums attached to them, have given way to the reality of peak demand. And while there's still disagreement about when demand for oil will peak, with more aggressive forecasts suggesting it could come as soon as the mid-2020s and more cautious ones pegging it closer to 2050, they all predict that demand will be plateauing in most of our lifetimes.\nAs Wood Mackenzie, one of the biggest energy research and consultancy firms in the world, noted in 2017, \"Although oil demand grows to 2035 on aggregate, it is minimal compared with what we have seen over the past 20 years. The prospect of peak oil demand is very real.\"\nThis doesn't mean Alberta's oil and gas industry is doomed, or that it needs to start shutting in production any time soon. Ironically, the very nature of the shale plays that makes them so attractive \u2014 their ability to bring on production quickly from new wells \u2014 also creates an opening for non-shale operators.\nUnlike the oilsands or conventional wells, whose production declines at a relatively gentle pace, shale wells are like a roller-coaster at an amusement park \u2014 a huge peak followed by a stomach-churning descent. Alberta can and will play a role in filling the gap they naturally create \u2014 a gap that will get much bigger as prices come down and fewer new shale wells are drilled.\n\"We can't try to live in the past and hope for more boom times,\" says Blake Shaffer, an economist with the University of Calgary and a former energy trader. \"But I do believe that there's scope for continued production \u2014 and especially when you look towards Trans Mountain and the potential for either west coast or cross-Pacific shipments.\"\nBut, he says, that scope will be informed by how quickly Alberta's oil and gas companies can drive down their costs \u2014 and their GHG emissions. And they'd better do it quickly, given that we're in the midst of a(nother) seismic shift in the global auto industry that will start hitting the demand for oil soon.\n\"I see the electric vehicle transition being far more rapid and far more widespread than I think even optimistic forecasts are calling for right now. And that's substantial,\" Shaffer says.\nIndeed, as Fortune noted in a recent story, \"EV sales are shooting up beyond many supposed experts' wildest predictions.\"\nAnd while petrochemical-driven demand is expected to continue growing, it won't be nearly enough to offset the growing impact of electric vehicles on transportation, which accounts for approximately 70 per cent of the overall appetite for oil.\n\"That's where the curve is going to bend,\" Shaffer says. \"I think we're going to see it in Europe, we're going to start to see it in the Americas, and we're going to start to see that sooner than we think in China.\"\nAnd Shaffer is clear: when it comes to that curve bending, it's only a matter of when, not if.\n\"Eventually, a transition is going to be required,\" Shaffer says, \"and we can do it in an orderly fashion or we can do it in a forced fashion. Preparing ourselves is prudent, simply from a risk management perspective.\"\nIt's this preparation that helps explain much of the so-called \"capital flight\" that's happened over the last four years, as American and international oil companies sell their Alberta assets to Canadian owned and controlled companies like Suncor and Canadian Natural Resources.\nDepending on oil prices and the quality of the acreage, an average shale well takes anywhere from 12 to 24 months to pay out \u2014 that is, generate revenue equivalent to its costs plus a return on the investment. An oilsands project, by comparison, can take upwards of a decade.\nIf you're a multinational company that's uncertain about the long-term demand picture for oil, you're going to start hedging out some of that risk.\n\"Just from a business point of view,\" Shaffer says, \"you want to reduce your exposure to being locked into long-life assets that may or may not be valuable. Having more flexibility with the shorter-life assets makes a lot of sense.\"\nThis is the reality that many Calgarians have yet to fully reckon with, the one where the recent pain and suffering is being meted out by global supply and demand realities rather than the person sitting in the prime minister's office (or, as some of the more conspiratorial whisperings would have it, his former principal secretary and longtime friend.)\nAnd while it's understandable that people want to go back to the days when the market traded on the basis of long-term scarcity rather than surplus, they're not coming back.\nNeither, just as importantly, are the days when the industry was significantly more labour-intensive than it is today. Companies are replacing workers with technology everywhere they can, from the drilling rig site to the head office, and there is nothing \u2014 not a new prime minister, nor any sort of short-term geopolitical disruption in the Middle East \u2014 that can change that.\n(This is the first of a two-part series examining the challenges facing Calgary's oil and gas sector.

So why is there still a steady stream of new COVID-19 cases?\nSome pockets of Canadian society have been harder hit than most, and many of the positive COVID-19 cases hospitals are seeing are the people who have not been able to work from home or isolate \u2014 such as transit drivers, grocery workers, taxi drivers and the homeless population. In Toronto, for example, public health says about 40 per cent of new cases are connected to infections in the community or the workplace, which are then spread back to households. The demographics of the patients now bearing the brunt of COVID-19 aren't surprising despite the precautions being taken by many employers to keep front-line workers safe, said Erin O'Connor, deputy medical director of regional emergency departments at the University Health Network in Toronto.\nSarif Ali, a bus driver with Toronto's transit system for 10 years, is off recovering from COVID-19 after two stays in hospital. The Toronto Transit Commission has reported nearly 40 positive cases among its front-line workers. Although Ali can't be sure he caught the virus at work, when he thinks of returning after his time off sick, it weighs on him despite the TTC's new safety measures. \"I think the trauma is more because it's the unknown, you don't know what's going to happen to you and it's a concern you go through every day,\" he said. \"I think it will always be in the back of my mind, this experience, and I have been shaken a lot.\"\nAlso hard-hit are grocery stores, which were designated as essential businesses from the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Helen Stathopoulos, who works at two grocery stores operated by the same chain, said she feels the stress of being on the front lines when she goes to work every day. She said the reality of her situation hits her when she gets home at night. \"You put all the strength that you have to make it through the day, to be able to do your job, to execute your daily functions. And by the time you get home, you've just got nothing in the tank. It really takes all your energy right out of you,\" she said.\nBut for thousands of Canadians who make up the homeless population, there's no safe refuge at the end of the day. The federal government earmarked $157 million for Canada's homeless population several weeks ago to help specifically with COVID-19, opening up more shelter beds, recovery centres for those infected and even freeing up hotel rooms for added shelter, but advocates argue much more is needed. Cities can only track infection numbers among homeless people who use shelters, but Kelly Bouchard of the outreach group Ve'ahavta in Toronto said he and his colleagues have noticed many more people sleeping on the streets out of fear that staying in shelters could pose a greater threat of catching COVID-19 because of the close quarters.\nClick below to watch more from The National\nCanadians to help develop, test potential COVID-19 vaccine by Chinese company\nThe National Research Council of Canada said it will work with a Chinese company to try to develop its potential vaccine for COVID-19 more quickly. The Chinese company, CanSino Biologics, is already conducting human clinical trials for its vaccine. The collaboration will allow Canada's publicly funded research council to try to scale up the technology needed to produce enough of the candidate vaccine to protect Canadians.\nThe announcement was welcomed by Matthew Herder, director of the Health Law Institute at Dalhousie University in Halifax who also evaluated contracts for the Canadian Ebola vaccine. That vaccine followed a similar path from the lab bench to mass production, and Herder wants to ensure Canadians will have access to all of the safety and efficacy data, both from trials conducted in China as well as here. There could also be strings attached to pricing, how much manufacturing can be done in Canada to meet both domestic and international needs and equity of access, he said.\nThe NRC plans to use a cell line its scientists developed during Ebola vaccine research. The federal government's previously announced $44 million for upgrades to the NRC's facility in Montreal also aims to allow for domestic production if the vaccine candidate pans out as hoped. A Phase 1 trial for the Ebola vaccine took place at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax and the coronavirus vaccine will also be tested in human volunteers there.\nRead more about the collaboration \nTrudeau says government will be 'very, very careful' about any easing of border restrictions\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau hinted today that Canada is in no rush to ease travel restrictions at the U.S. border to allow for non-essential travel as the clock ticks down on the current agreement. Trudeau's comments came as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared before a U.S. Senate panel to testify against reopening state economies too quickly.\nCanada and the U.S. reached an agreement in March to temporarily close the border to non-essential travel \u2014 meaning no recreational visits \u2014 while keeping it open to commercial traffic and essential workers who cross for their jobs. It was extended in April by 30 days and is set to expire on May 21. \"We're going to be very, very careful about reopening any international travel, including in the United States, before we feel that it is time,\" he said.\nOn Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said traffic is bound to increase across the Canada-U.S. border as states and provinces begin to reopen. She said conversations with the Trump administration about when to ease the border restrictions are ongoing. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province shares crossings with Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio and New York, has said he's opposed to lifting the border restrictions.\nRead more about the Canada-U.S. border \nSeniors to receive up to $500 in a one-time payment to offset added costs because of COVID-19\nCanadian seniors will receive a one-time payment of up to $500 to help offset any increases in the cost of living because of COVID-19. Seniors Minister Deb Schulte said today that seniors who qualify for Old Age Security (OAS) will be eligible for a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 and those eligible for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) will get an extra $200. Those eligible for both will receive $500 and seniors already receiving OAS and GIS will get the one-time benefit automatically.\nThe government is also investing another $20 million in the New Horizons for Seniors Program, which funds community projects for seniors. Schulte said that money will help to mitigate the impacts of isolation with things like virtual exercise programs and tablet laptops. Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos said the measures announced today will not require parliamentary authority and the supports are expected to flow within weeks. NDP seniors critic Scott Duvall said he is \"largely disappointed\" with the emergency aid plan for seniors.\nMarissa Lennox, chief policy officer at the seniors advocacy group CARP, said in addition to added grocery and prescription costs, seniors also are seeing free or discounted community services \u2014 such as laundry services, meals at community centres and volunteer tax preparation \u2014 dry up because of the global pandemic. Lennox said many seniors also have seen their retirement savings shrink because of a drop in the stock market. CARP had asked the federal government to waive mandatory registered retirement income fund (RRIF) withdrawals in 2020. CARP said the mandatory withdrawals increase the tax liability for the year as seniors struggle with added costs related to the pandemic.\nRead more about the supports for seniors \nIf you've recovered from COVID-19, can you stop physical distancing?\nCBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions about the COVID-19 pandemic, including this one. If you have a question of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca.\nAs for the issue at hand: \"Not at the moment,\" said Dr. Allison McGeer, infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. Even if you've had the disease, McGeer said you should continue to be vigilant and follow all the necessary measures and precautions. That means staying at least two metres away from others and to consider wearing a mask when going outside.\nThe World Health Organization says that while it's expected that people who recover from COVID-19 will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection, the extent of that is not yet known.\n\"We're really hoping that people who have recovered will be protected in both the short- and long-term from second infections,\" McGeer said. \"But we don't know that yet.\"\nArtist creates online show to teach children about Indigenous culture during pandemic\nLance Cardinal wanted a way to keep his nieces and nephews busy while they stayed at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since he couldn't be with his family in northern Alberta, the Edmonton-based artist \u2014 who has designed sets and props, acted and painted \u2014 decided to use his talents to create an online kids show for his family.\nBut Cardinal, who's from Bigstone Cree Nation, wanted Family Art Adventures to feature more than just a craft tutorial. He wanted to teach the Cree language and tell kids about Alberta's Indigenous communities. \"I wanted to continue to connect with them and find a way to help our kids, our families and our Indigenous communities, especially up north, have an outlet of positivity and creativity to do as a family,\" he told CBC's Radio Active.\nHe started small, recording the first episode in his studio apartment by propping his phone against a can of soup and broadcasting to family and friends on Facebook. The 40-minute show has evolved over its last eight episodes and is now broadcast on YouTube every Saturday morning to a small but loyal audience. Cardinal has also improved the format of the show by purposefully connecting the crafts to a history lesson of an Indigenous community.\n\"It's not a very difficult thing to do to share language and culture in a fun way, especially for kids. They want to learn ... about other cultures and I think that's the best time to be teaching this,\" Cardinal said.\nRead the full story about the show \nSend us your questions\nStill looking for more information on the outbreak?

And while there's still disagreement about when demand for oil will peak, with more aggressive forecasts suggesting it could come as soon as the mid-2020s and more cautious ones pegging it closer to 2050, they all predict that demand will be plateauing in most of our lifetimes.\nAs Wood Mackenzie, one of the biggest energy research and consultancy firms in the world, noted in 2017, \"Although oil demand grows to 2035 on aggregate, it is minimal compared with what we have seen over the past 20 years. The prospect of peak oil demand is very real.\"\nThis doesn't mean Alberta's oil and gas industry is doomed, or that it needs to start shutting in production any time soon. Ironically, the very nature of the shale plays that makes them so attractive \u2014 their ability to bring on production quickly from new wells \u2014 also creates an opening for non-shale operators.\nUnlike the oilsands or conventional wells, whose production declines at a relatively gentle pace, shale wells are like a roller-coaster at an amusement park \u2014 a huge peak followed by a stomach-churning descent. Alberta can and will play a role in filling the gap they naturally create \u2014 a gap that will get much bigger as prices come down and fewer new shale wells are drilled.\n\"We can't try to live in the past and hope for more boom times,\" says Blake Shaffer, an economist with the University of Calgary and a former energy trader. \"But I do believe that there's scope for continued production \u2014 and especially when you look towards Trans Mountain and the potential for either west coast or cross-Pacific shipments.\"\nBut, he says, that scope will be informed by how quickly Alberta's oil and gas companies can drive down their costs \u2014 and their GHG emissions. And they'd better do it quickly, given that we're in the midst of a(nother) seismic shift in the global auto industry that will start hitting the demand for oil soon.\n\"I see the electric vehicle transition being far more rapid and far more widespread than I think even optimistic forecasts are calling for right now. And that's substantial,\" Shaffer says.\nIndeed, as Fortune noted in a recent story, \"EV sales are shooting up beyond many supposed experts' wildest predictions.\"\nAnd while petrochemical-driven demand is expected to continue growing, it won't be nearly enough to offset the growing impact of electric vehicles on transportation, which accounts for approximately 70 per cent of the overall appetite for oil.\n\"That's where the curve is going to bend,\" Shaffer says. \"I think we're going to see it in Europe, we're going to start to see it in the Americas, and we're going to start to see that sooner than we think in China.\"\nAnd Shaffer is clear: when it comes to that curve bending, it's only a matter of when, not if.\n\"Eventually, a transition is going to be required,\" Shaffer says, \"and we can do it in an orderly fashion or we can do it in a forced fashion. Preparing ourselves is prudent, simply from a risk management perspective.\"\nIt's this preparation that helps explain much of the so-called \"capital flight\" that's happened over the last four years, as American and international oil companies sell their Alberta assets to Canadian owned and controlled companies like Suncor and Canadian Natural Resources.\nDepending on oil prices and the quality of the acreage, an average shale well takes anywhere from 12 to 24 months to pay out \u2014 that is, generate revenue equivalent to its costs plus a return on the investment. An oilsands project, by comparison, can take upwards of a decade.\nIf you're a multinational company that's uncertain about the long-term demand picture for oil, you're going to start hedging out some of that risk.\n\"Just from a business point of view,\" Shaffer says, \"you want to reduce your exposure to being locked into long-life assets that may or may not be valuable. Having more flexibility with the shorter-life assets makes a lot of sense.\"\nThis is the reality that many Calgarians have yet to fully reckon with, the one where the recent pain and suffering is being meted out by global supply and demand realities rather than the person sitting in the prime minister's office (or, as some of the more conspiratorial whisperings would have it, his former principal secretary and longtime friend.)\nAnd while it's understandable that people want to go back to the days when the market traded on the basis of long-term scarcity rather than surplus, they're not coming back.\nNeither, just as importantly, are the days when the industry was significantly more labour-intensive than it is today. Companies are replacing workers with technology everywhere they can, from the drilling rig site to the head office, and there is nothing \u2014 not a new prime minister, nor any sort of short-term geopolitical disruption in the Middle East \u2014 that can change that.\n(This is the first of a two-part series examining the challenges facing Calgary's oil and gas sector.

Well, today we did it,\" Draghi told a news conference.\nYet there were doubts, even within the ECB itself, as to whether the latest measures \u2014 most of the few remaining tools in its monetary policy arsenal \u2014 would be enough to stoke a euro zone recovery in the face of a U.S.-China trade war and possible disruption from Brexit.\nDraghi faced faced pushback from the representatives of Germany and France as well as at least one of his own board members when he pushed for resuming the ECB's bond-buying program, three sources told Reuters.\nThursday's moves also infuriated Trump, who just this week called on the U.S. Fed to adopt a negative-rate policy.\n\"They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports.... And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!\" Trump tweeted.\nA 10 basis point cut in the ECB's deposit rate to -0.5 per cent was fully expected but the revived bond purchases exceeded many expectations because they are set to run until \"shortly before\" the ECB raises interest rates.\nGiven that markets do not expect rates to rise for nearly a decade, such a formulation suggests that purchases could go on for years, possibly through most of Christine Lagarde's term leading the bank.\n\"Today's decisions have anchored and enshrined the Draghi legacy in future ECB decisions,\" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.\n\"Whatever it takes has just been extended by as long as it takes,\" Brzeski said, referring to the 2012 speech in which Draghi promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro, a bold move credited with holding the crisis-hit bloc together.\nWhile conservative ECB policymakers had spoken out against more bond purchases in recent weeks, the decision suggests some of them eventually agreed, giving Draghi a majority for what is probably his last major policy move.\nUnderlining the need for action, the ECB cut its growth projections for this year and next, predicting growth at just above one\u00a0per cent, below what is considered its natural potential.\nThe ECB's decision triggered a rally in euro zone bonds that will cut the cost of borrowing across the 19 countries that use the euro. The single currency itself firmed a touch after wild price swings during Draghi's news conference.\nA simple rate cut would have increased the cost to commercial banks of parking their more than 1 trillion euros worth of excess reserves safely at the ECB, a dangerous move since banks transmit the bulk of its policy to the real economy.\nTo offset that burden, the ECB promised even cheaper long-term funding and said it would introduce a multi-tier deposit rate to shield them from some of the charge. That could leave lenders about 2 billions of euros a year better off than previously, according to some estimates.\nYet the size and design of the scheme underwhelmed bankers whose own loans are being offered at rock-bottom rates.\n\"Even if the tiered interest rate introduced today provides some relief, European banks will continue to have to pay billions to the ECB every year as some sort of penalty charge tax,\" Hans-Walter Peters, president of the German banking association, said.\nEuro zone stocks were little changed on Thursday, however, highlighting investors' doubts about the effectiveness of ECB policy, which can only prop up domestic confidence, not deliver a U.S.-China trade deal or seal a Brexit agreement.\nIndeed, Draghi stepped up his rhetoric in calling for governments to spend their way out of a slowdown, singling out Germany, which is obsessed with running a balanced budget.\n\"Now it is high time for the fiscal policy to take charge,\" Draghi said. \"There was unanimity, namely that fiscal policy should become the main instrument.\"\nDraghi has called for years for governments to do more to stimulate growth.\nWith the ECB's balance sheet already bloated and rates at record lows, analysts also questioned the effectiveness of more stimulus and suggested it could even work against the ECB.\n\"The key risk is that rate cuts could even backfire. Deeply negative interest rates could push up saving rates \u2014 see the surge in German savings, for instance,\" Shweta Singh, a managing director at TS Lombard, said.\n\"Crucially, there may be much less scope this time for the euro to edge lower and thus boost inflation expectations.\"\n"}, {"author": "Nahlah Ayed", "title": "'Mask wars' risk setting back global fight against coronavirus", "description": "Global competition for supplies among Western nations spikes", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-global-mask-wars-1.5522860", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5522980.1586153559!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus-usa-new-york.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 06, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-04-06T15:10:25.047Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When the crisis is over, there will be tough questions to be answered and explanations to be sought over how so many leading countries found themselves short of masks and other life-saving protective equipment.\nFor now, the Western world must contend with the consequences of their lack of foresight: including the unsightly \"mask wars\" that have pitted neighbouring countries, even U.S. states and levels of government, against each other in the rush to acquire them \u2014 prompting accusations of modern piracy.\nThe country most often accused of undercutting the efforts of its allies in the so-called mask wars\u00a0is the U.S., which not only attempted to halt exports of U.S.-made N95 masks to Canada and Latin America last week, but also stands accused of scuttling European deals to purchase them in China and elsewhere.

The combined company would have more than 260 daily papers in the U.S. along with more than 300 weeklies.\nThe companies said Monday the deal will cut up to $300 million in costs annually and help speed up a digital transformation.\nNewspaper consolidation has picked up as local papers find it hard to grow digital businesses and replace declines in print ads and circulation. While papers with national readerships like the New York Times and the Washington Post have had success adding digital subscribers, papers with local readerships are having a difficult time. Hundreds of such papers have closed, and newsrooms have slashed jobs.\nAccording to a study by the University of North Carolina, the U.S. has lost almost 1,800 local newspapers since 2004. Newsroom employment fell by a quarter from 2008 to 2018, according to Pew Research, and layoffs have continued this year.\nGateHouse and Gannett are known as buyers of other papers. Bulking up lets companies cut costs \u2014 including layoffs in newsrooms \u2014 and centralize operations.\nThose cuts could give the owners \"a cushion of time\" to figure out how to improve their digital businesses, longtime industry analyst Rick Edmonds of the Poynter Institute wrote Sunday.\nBut it's no panacea.\n\"I don't think, just by these companies merging, they're going to somehow magically find a new business model, make everything all right and produce robust journalism at a local level,\" Butler University journalism Prof. Nancy Whitmore said. Still, a bigger, combined newspaper company could sell more national ads and boost their ad revenue, she said.\nGateHouse's owner, New Media, is taking on new debt to get the deal done \u2014 a $1.8 billion US loan from private equity firm Apollo Global Management. That will have to be paid back.\n\"We've been hearing for years and years about the glories of cost efficiencies,\" said Northeastern University Prof. Dan Kennedy, a proponent of local ownership for media outlets.\nIt's unclear, based on past media mergers, whether those savings will benefit the papers, its employees or their readers, he said.\nKennedy\u00a0wonders whether combined companies make more or fewer cuts than they would have if they had remained separate, while finding money to pay off debts looms.\nSeveral experts said they do not expect the Justice Department to have an issue with the deal, as the two companies have papers in different markets.

The combined company would have more than 260 daily papers in the U.S. along with more than 300 weeklies.\nThe companies said Monday the deal will cut up to $300 million in costs annually and help speed up a digital transformation.\nNewspaper consolidation has picked up as local papers find it hard to grow digital businesses and replace declines in print ads and circulation. While papers with national readerships like the New York Times and the Washington Post have had success adding digital subscribers, papers with local readerships are having a difficult time. Hundreds of such papers have closed, and newsrooms have slashed jobs.\nAccording to a study by the University of North Carolina, the U.S. has lost almost 1,800 local newspapers since 2004. Newsroom employment fell by a quarter from 2008 to 2018, according to Pew Research, and layoffs have continued this year.\nGateHouse and Gannett are known as buyers of other papers. Bulking up lets companies cut costs \u2014 including layoffs in newsrooms \u2014 and centralize operations.\nThose cuts could give the owners \"a cushion of time\" to figure out how to improve their digital businesses, longtime industry analyst Rick Edmonds of the Poynter Institute wrote Sunday.\nBut it's no panacea.\n\"I don't think, just by these companies merging, they're going to somehow magically find a new business model, make everything all right and produce robust journalism at a local level,\" Butler University journalism Prof. Nancy Whitmore said. Still, a bigger, combined newspaper company could sell more national ads and boost their ad revenue, she said.\nGateHouse's owner, New Media, is taking on new debt to get the deal done \u2014 a $1.8 billion US loan from private equity firm Apollo Global Management. That will have to be paid back.\n\"We've been hearing for years and years about the glories of cost efficiencies,\" said Northeastern University Prof. Dan Kennedy, a proponent of local ownership for media outlets.\nIt's unclear, based on past media mergers, whether those savings will benefit the papers, its employees or their readers, he said.\nKennedy\u00a0wonders whether combined companies make more or fewer cuts than they would have if they had remained separate, while finding money to pay off debts looms.\nSeveral experts said they do not expect the Justice Department to have an issue with the deal, as the two companies have papers in different markets.

Health Minister Adrian Dix on Tuesday told people in his province there is \"zero chance \u2014 none\" that orders meant to tackle COVID-19 would be varied by the end of this month. \"I think we're in this for a long time,\" he said.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to put a specific timeline on how long strict measures could last, saying they would be in place for a number of weeks \u2014 and perhaps months. Trudeau again reiterated a call on Canadians to respect public health rules and practise physical distancing, saying the behaviour of Canadians has a direct impact on how the health crisis will unfold.\nToday, Toronto provided details about a 12-week plan to try to clamp down on the virus's spread, after Mayor John Tory said COVID-19 \"numbers are presently heading in the wrong direction\" in Canada's largest city.

Other masks, such as surgical masks, are looser fitting and made of material that may reduce only some aerosol particles. Earlier today, Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam offered some guidance on the use of non-medical masks.\nHealth-care workers around the country say they have been rationing the protective N95 masks while they wait for stocks to be replenished. Because there are currently no domestic manufacturers of N95 masks, pressure put on the global supply by the coronavirus pandemic has left Canada in a precarious position.\nRead more about the need for N95 masks \nStrategies for safe grocery shopping during a pandemic\nPublic health officials across the country have been consistent in their advice that people stay home as much as possible and therefore try to shop for groceries only once a week or less, and preferably alone. But Canadians still have questions about how to best get groceries during a pandemic.\nHere are some insights from experts:\nIf debating between shopping online or going in person to the grocery store, a simple message from Toronto's medical officer of health, Eileen de Villa, may help guide you: \"Each time we leave our homes, we increase the risk of virus spread.\"\nBut in some parts of the country right now, getting a delivery or even a pickup slot for online shopping is nearly impossible without a wait of a week or two. Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious diseases specialist at St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, suggests that people who are healthy and able can still go to the grocery store in person.\nAnd what should you do once you're at the store? Disinfect the shopping cart handle and do your best to keep two metres between you and other people, even if it means waiting to go down an aisle or to get what you need off the shelf. Wash or disinfect your hands after you pay for and pack up your groceries and before you put them in your car.\nOnce you get home, \"put away the groceries, wash your hands,\" Chagala says. And when you're preparing your food, he advises to wash your hands afterwards, just as you would normally before you eat.\nCanadian hospitals getting 'creative' to expand COVID-19 care facilities\nWith many experts predicting a surge in COVID-19 cases here in the next couple of weeks, many Canadian hospitals are also looking for \"creative\" solutions as they scramble to prepare.\nPaul-\u00c9mile Cloutier, the CEO of the largest national organization of hospitals in Canada, said hospital administrators are looking at recreation centres, hotels and other facilities that may be vacant right now. As well, some have ordered \"makeshift\" hospitals and quarantine centres to be constructed. \"They do not want to be in the same position as Italy,\" he says.\nIn the U.S., naval hospital ships have been pressed into service in New York and California. There's so far no word of the Canadian\u00a0government pressing naval ships into COVID-19 service, but there is existing infrastructure in Canada that could be transformed into medical facilities to assist with the expected surge of cases.\nAn off-site solution presents its own unique challenges. \"The rationale for keeping patients on-site is that with COVID-19, patients' conditions can change very quickly,\" said Dr. Ian Preyra, chief of staff of the new pandemic response unit in Burlington, Ont. \"We want them to be close to the hospital so that we can transfer them directly to intensive care if their conditions worsen.\"\nN.S. grocery store staff use mystery gift to buy groceries for seniors\nAtlantic Superstore staff in Antigonish, N.S., decided to use an anonymous gift that was dropped off by a customer to buy groceries for four seniors who live in the area.\nA man dropped off 10 sealed envelopes covered with messages such as \"Thank you for working,\" \"Thank you for all you're doing during COVID-19\" and \"Thank you from the community.\" Each envelope contained $40 and the man wanted the envelopes to be distributed to the store's staff.\nPatti Hilton, the store's manager, said the staff decided to use the $400 to buy groceries for four seniors, and that they would be making the deliveries personally.\n\"Here's the thing, we are still working. We still get a paycheque every week and there are so many people out of work and so many seniors that need help right now that we decided to pay it forward,\" Hilton said.\nRead the full story about the grocery store staff's generosity \nSend us your questions\nStill looking for more information on the outbreak?

Three-time Stanley Cup-champion Justin Williams comes to mind. So do solid citizens such as veterans Andrew MacDonald, Marc Methot, Jamie McGinn, Dan Girardi and goaltender Cam Ward.\nSome clubs like to take a break, take stock before making prudent moves to upgrade its roster in the weeks and days leading up to training camp.\nThe salary cap limit being increased by only a couple million dollars to $81.5 million US has somewhat hampered the free-agent market. But there also are some summertime trends that you should recognize.\nThere is the valued veteran category. Players like Williams, Patrick Marleau and Joe Thornton fit this genre. They're proven performers who can afford to wait for the right fit for family and the hope to play for a contender.\nThere also is the one and done. Think of someone like Thomas Vanek or Pat Maroon. Maroon returned home to play for the St. Louis Blues; won a Stanley Cup and proved his worth. But, at 31, he has also made the round, playing for four different teams, in six full NHL seasons.\nThere also is the PTO (player tryout) crowd. Members of this group are wondering if their time is up or not. Maybe the next step is retirement or Europe. Perhaps they are willing to take a shot at attending training camp on a tryout basis to see if they can make an impression.\nSo, between now and when training camps open in mid-September, here are a handful of players that could land in intriguing spots:\nThe 29-year-old defenceman has a boatload of offensive talent. But his record in big games is suspect. Also, after missing only eight games in five seasons with the Toronto Maple Leafs, he was sidelined for 20 matches with a back injury late in the past regular season. Gardiner has sought a short-term deal this summer, and that has hurt his prospects.\nWATCH | Gardiner contributes to Leafs collapse in Game 7 vs. Bruins:\nThe 34-year-old fourth-line centre has played for six teams in 12 seasons. He's a wonderful person, with leadership qualities, whose been good on face-offs. He went to back-to-back Stanley Cup finals with the 2013-14 New York Ranges and 2014-15 Tampa Bay Lightning.\nHip Check: Brian Boyle scores after leukemia diagnosis:\nThe third-line centre has 99 games of Stanley Cup playoff experience. He went to the final with the Rangers four years ago and the East final with the Ottawa Senators three years later. Brassard, 31, has bounced around from the Rangers to the Senators to the Pittsburgh Penguins to the Florida Panthers and Colorado Avalanche in four seasons, but that's because he's a valued performer.\nThe dependable 26-year-old defenceman is a definite casualty of the small increase in team salary cap space. His last contract was a two-year deal worth $2.8-million a season with the Vancouver Canucks. But he's a proven depth defender who struck gold with Canada at the 2016 world championship and could help a contender.\u00a0\nHow can you not be intrigued to see where this pair of friends wind up? Thornton was selected first overall by the Boston Bruins in 1997. Marleau was taken second by the San Jose Sharks. The two later spent 11-and-a-half seasons together in San Jose before Marleau decided to bolt for the Maple Leafs two years ago. Marleau turns 40 on Sept. 15. Thornton already is 40. Do they wind up together again back in San Jose?\nWATCH | Patrick Marleau passes Maurice Richard on NHL all-time scoring list:\n"}, {"author": "Truc Nguyen", "title": "A modern primer on engagement ring shopping", "description": "From ethical diamonds to recycled gold, top experts share everything we need to consider", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/life/holiday/a-modern-primer-on-engagement-ring-shopping-1.5393112", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5393126.1576531453!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/1056586676.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 11, 2019 4:58 PM ET", "2019-12-11T21:58:13.582Z"], "source": "CBC Life", "content": "On the lookout for the perfect engagement ring this month? You wouldn't be alone \u2014 according to a survey on wedding trends in Canada by Weddingbells magazine, one\u00a0in five proposals take place in December, and 35 per cent\u00a0of engagements occur between December and February.\u00a0\nWhether you're planning to pop the question, or have recently gotten engaged and are now ring-shopping together, there's a lot to consider before making the big purchase (it can be a significant financial commitment; the average engagement ring is expected to cost $3,125, according to the same survey).\u00a0\nFirst, you'll need to think about budget and learn about the \"four c's\" of diamond shopping, all of which will significantly affect the ring price: carat,\u00a0cut,\u00a0clarity and colour. Then, you'll need to consider whether you want to buy a ready-made ring, customize an existing style to your needs, or go the truly custom route. Other important decisions to be made along the way include the type of diamond you're looking for (if you want a diamond and not another gemstone) \u2014 options today can include natural, coloured, lab-grown and vintage \u2014 and, beyond ensuring that they're ethically-mined and conflict-free, whether the country of origin and precise traceability are important for you. Finally, there are material and style trends to consider; for example, recycled gold is becoming more popular, and some buyers are forgoing a solitaire design in favour of smaller, stackable rings.\nTo help you select the right engagement-ring, we asked three industry experts \u2014 Alison McGill, editor-in-chief of Weddingbells and editorial director of Mariage Quebec, Tonia Guerrera, director of bridal and prestige jewelry at\u00a0Birks, and Melissa Gobeil, goldsmith and co-founder of Attic \u2014 to share their insider insights and must-know tips for navigating this big purchase.\u00a0\nKnow the basics\nA diamond's cut, clarity, colour and shape are all important factors that will affect the price when you're shopping for an engagement ring. But according to Guerrera, the cut is the most important element to consider, \"It's what you really need to look for, because you don't want to compromise on the cut; you want to maximize the brilliance and the beauty of the diamond.\" And keep in mind that if a retailer or jeweler doesn't have the exact style and type of gemstone you're looking for in stock, you can always request it by special order. \"50 per cent\u00a0of our bridal sales comes from special orders,\" says Guerrera.\nSelecting natural diamonds\nWith natural white diamonds, ideally you're looking at a conflict-free, ethical diamond where you have some idea of its origin. While every jeweler and retailer may use diamonds from different sources, a diamond's supplier and country of origin can provide invaluable information. \"When you know the origin of your gemstone, you have a better or clearer picture of the manner in which the stone was mined, and the social conditions under which it was mined,\" says Gobeil. (According to her, some good gemstone options when it comes to meeting higher environmental and social standards are Montana sapphires from the United States, sapphires from Sri Lanka, Canadian diamonds, and diamonds from alluvial (or stream bed) mines in Australia.)\u00a0\n\"If you're shopping for a diamond engagement ring, you should be asking about the origin of the stone if you can,\" says Gobeil. For a white diamond, she recommends Canadian stones, which are responsibly mined and \"upheld to the highest ethical and social standards.\" Attic works with CanadaMark diamonds mined in the Northwest Territories, says Gobeil, adding that the supplier recently began offering tracing even for smaller diamonds (under half a carat in weight).\n\"All of our vendors that we get our diamonds from [at Birks] have to comply to the Kimberley Process,\" says Guerrera. \"It's a process to make sure that everything was conflict-free [and] ethically sourced.\" And all Canadian diamonds purchased at Birks are traceable to the mine where they come from; clients can look up this information online, Guerrera notes.\nThe industry is still developing in terms of traceability, but knowing the origin of your stone can be helpful in helping you make \"the social, the environmental decisions you want to make,\" explains Gobeil. And this type of information should become more accessible soon \u2014 the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), for example, just launched a new Diamond Origin program where, Gobeil says, \"they work with major mining companies to scientifically cross reference the rough diamond with finished or polished stones to authenticate its origin.\"\nThe buzzy alternatives: other precious stones and vintage, coloured, and lab-grown diamonds\nAll three experts all agree that colourful diamonds, diamonds with unique quirks (such as \"salt and pepper\" diamonds) and alternative precious stones are becoming popular alternatives to the classic white diamond. \"We're seeing a lot of fancy stones like yellow diamonds, sapphires of all colours, rubies, garnets,\" says McGill. \"I like to see rings that are different and very reflective of the person, and I think you can really do that with a coloured stone.\"\nVintage diamonds are another option \u2014 at Birks, for example, there's a bespoke program where you can design a ring with a custom gemstone inside, which could be a vintage or heirloom stone. \"When we're talking about vintage pieces, generally speaking what I have experienced is they're heirloom pieces, so there's some sort of sentimental and personal connection which I think is really nice,\" says McGill. It's a sustainable choice, because you're reusing an existing piece in a new way, though it's worth having them checked for scratches, chips and other damage.\nAnd lab-created diamonds (which are structurally and visually identical to mined diamonds)\u00a0are beginning to gain some acceptance in the fine jewelry market, at least internationally. De Beers has started selling synthetic diamonds in stores and several direct-to-consumer brands focused on lab-grown diamonds have launched worldwide. \"[Lab-grown diamonds] is really an emerging topic that I think people are getting educated about, and it's really becoming a conversation point,\" says McGill. \"Definitely people are very curious about it \u2026 from an ethical and sustainability perspective.\" Ultimately, she suggests doing your research and asking a jeweler if you want to know more about the differences between natural and lab-grown diamonds. \"Don't be afraid to ask these questions when you are looking at a diamond, because you want to feel confident about what you're buying and where your stone is coming from,\" says McGill.\nCurrently, Canadian fine jewelers like Birks and Attic are not offering lab-grown diamonds, but that could change in the future. \"We have definitely been receiving requests, but it's not something that we are exploring at this time,\" says Gobeil.\nChoosing a metal\nOnce you have a design and stone in mind, you'll want to choose a metal for the setting. According to Guerrera, platinum and white gold continue to be the top choices for rings (the former has a slightly more matte finish), but yellow and rose gold are \"picking up\" in popularity.\u00a0 Birks only carries 18-karat gold. \"You see it in the weight and the quality,\" says Guerrera. \"It has more of a substance and more of a look [compared to 14- or 10-karat gold].\"\n\"For durability, our material of choice is 14-karat. It's very beautiful and complementary on a lot of skin tones,\" says Gobeil, noting that Attic does offer pieces in 18k gold upon request and for custom designs. The company also offers pieces in post-consumer recycled gold, which they purchase from an Ontario refinery. \"It's the same quality [as new gold] and there is no price difference,\" says Gobeil.\u00a0\nThe newest trends\n\"It's an interesting time because just like weddings have become kind of anything goes, so have engagement rings, and there's really not one cookie cutter model for everyone,\" says McGill. While classic designs such as the iconic radiant-cut or princess-cut solitaire ring and the halo setting (which features smaller gemstones set around a large center stone) continue to be dominant, McGill notes that she's \"seeing people move towards really individual designs that really suit them.\" Three-star rings, band stacking and more minimalistic designs are other rising styles that McGill has noticed recently.\u00a0\nOther emerging trends in the space include \"fancy shape gems\" such as oval, marquise and pear-cut stones, says Gobeil, noting that some of her clients are forgoing the classic solitaire ring in favour of stacking designs or even sets of rings.\u00a0\nThe experts' top shopping tips\n\"Engagement ring shopping is kind of like shopping for a wedding dress,\" says McGill. \"Everybody always tells you, explore things that you might not have explored before \u2026 you may have your heart set on a round-cut diamond, but maybe an oval looks better on your hand, or maybe a coloured stone looks great with your skin tone.\" There are many options in the market, and she recommends taking the time to look, try on, and consider.\u00a0\n\"Wherever you go, ensure that the retailer has a reliable after-sale program,\" advises Guerrera. \"It's a long term relationship with the retailer that you're dealing with [\u2026] at Birks, we have a 90-day return policy, free sizing, free engraving, lifetime diamond warranty, a trade-up policy, a GIA certification on the diamond and on the shank that matches to make sure that nothing gets switched in.\"\nGobeil suggests that you \"go simple\" and \"invest in classics: timeless, quality pieces,\" and notes that word-of-mouth recommendations can come in handy when it comes to jewelry shopping. \"Book a meeting and sit down with the jeweler, and use your feelers. I think that it's really important if you can to do that,\" says Gobeil. \"It's a big purchase and you want to feel good about all the steps that it takes. It's a very fun process, but you have to find the right match.\"\nTruc Nguyen is a Toronto-based writer, editor and stylist.

Read an updated story here.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau and the country's provincial and territorial leaders will meet in Ottawa over the next two days as Canada grapples with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and cratering oil prices that could blow big holes in public finances.\nThe premiers met in December for an emergency meeting of sorts to address the threat to national unity posed by rising political and economic frustration in Alberta and Saskatchewan over their place in the federation. The leaders agreed unanimously to push Ottawa to rework the fiscal stabilization program \u2014 a fund for provinces facing sudden financial shocks \u2014 and take a second look at Bill C-69, the federal government's overhaul of the environmental assessment regime.\nBut a meeting that was initially called to address the political alienation of Alberta and Saskatchewan \u2014 and some of the health-care funding concerns of other provinces \u2014 has picked up some more agenda items in recent days.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 \u2014 which has infected dozens of Canadians and killed one \u2014 and the threat it poses to Canada's economic outlook will also be up for discussion among the country's leaders today and tomorrow.\nNew Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs said late Wednesday he is debating whether he should come up to Ottawa at a time when COVID-19 is threatening public health. Yukon Premier Sandy Silver has already cancelled.\nHiggs said the meeting is \"very important\" given the national health and economic threats abroad, but he questioned if it was \"prudent\" for the country's leaders to gather in one spot.\n\"We've actually connected with Ottawa and our colleagues and considering, can we do this on a video conference? Can we look at this another way? If we're asking people to stay home, should we be doing the same thing?\" Higgs said in an interview with CBC's Power & Politics.\nManitoba Premier Brian Pallister\u00a0has delayed his flight out of Winnipeg until later on Thursday after the NDP opposition in that province successfully managed to delay the tabling of the provincial budget, pushing back his departure. A spokeswoman for the premier said Pallister is hoping the budget will be introduced early Thursday.\u00a0\nThe weeks-long Indigenous-led rail blockades also will be discussed, with national Indigenous leaders scheduled to meet with the prime minister and premiers later today. Those blockades crippled the country's transport network and left CN Rail trains idling for much of February.\nSupporters of the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs opposed to the Coastal GasLink pipeline in northern B.C. are planning solidarity protests near the site of the meeting as they renew their calls for TC Energy, the pipeline proponent, to leave the area.\nAt least one premier said the first ministers' meeting shouldn't be bogged down by discussions about \"fashionable\" issues. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said the group should be laser-focused on the economy.\n\"We need this government to get refocused on the economy \u2014 enough about dealing with every fashionable issue out there and the virtue-signalling and the UN Security Council and all the rest of it,\" Kenney told reporters before he boarded a flight to Ottawa Wednesday.\n\"We are facing an economic crisis in Canada and we need the national government to act accordingly with total focus on that issue.\"\nThe stock market has seen wild swings over the last two weeks and the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the U.S. oil price benchmark, has cratered due to anxiety over COVID-19 and a conflict between major world oil producers on production levels.\nSaudi Arabia and Russia were unable to agree last weekend on production cuts to bolster the global price. That sent WTI into a tailspin \u2014 it dropped 24 per cent on Monday and fell even lower Wednesday. The industry now faces the possibility of increased production at a time when demand for more oil is weak.\nIt costs Canadian producers more than either of those two countries to get a marketable barrel of oil out of the ground.\nBoth Alberta and Ottawa projected WTI would trade in the high US$50 range for much of the year. On Wednesday, the price was roughly US$33.\nThe average per barrel operating cost for a surface mining operation in Alberta's oilsands is about C$27 \u2014 which means that if oil prices stay at these levels over the medium term, many operations will be unprofitable, will fail to generate free cash flow and could be forced to shut down and issue pink slips to thousands of workers.\nIn 2015, the federal Department of Finance estimated that every $1 decrease in the price of oil would result in a reduction in tax revenues of roughly $150 million. That means Ottawa already is facing the loss of $3.6 billion in tax revenue this year because of the wild gyrations in the price of oil.\nThe situation is much worse in Alberta. For ever $1 decrease in the price of WTI, the province can expect to lose $355 million in revenue.\nTo address these shocks, Kenney will come to Ottawa to ask the federal Liberal government to bolster the stabilization program to help cover some of those budget shortfalls by removing per capita limits on the money available to provinces.\nThe current program, which is administered by Finance Minister Bill Morneau, provides financial assistance to any province faced with a year-over-year decline in its non-resource revenues greater than five per cent.\nHowever, the money available to eligible provinces is capped at just $60 per resident \u2014 something Kenney says is inadequate given the size of the budget deficit the province is facing after the last time oil prices plunged.\nIn 2018, for example, Alberta tapped just $250 million from the program while Newfoundland and Labrador received about $8 million. Lifting the cap would flow more money to provinces in need.\nMorneau said Ottawa is aware \"that system should be updated.\"\n\"It's hasn't been updated for more than a couple of decades. We want to make sure it responds to significant financial shocks for provinces,\" he said ahead of the meeting.\nTrudeau promised Wednesday that his government is taking the COVID-19 pandemic \"extremely seriously.\"\nWhile he said Canada has been \"fortunate so far\" in that less than\u00a0100 people have been officially diagnosed with the virus, Trudeau said Ottawa is ready to invest more to help workers facing long periods at home in quarantine and businesses experiencing disruptions.\nManitoba M\u00e9tis Federation president David Chartrand, who is representing the M\u00e9tis National Council at the talks in Ottawa, said COVID-19 should be front and centre in the discussions and jurisdictional disputes over Indigenous land and treaty rights should be left for another day.\n\"I think this is sort of a potential attack on our country and we need to come together on that, and that differences with jurisdictions and politics need to be put aside and I hope that's what comes out of this meeting,\" Chartrand said in an interview.\n\"If it ever hits our communities, if it ever comes to any of our M\u00e9tis villages, we are in big trouble. We don't have health care centres. We don't have supports. We have no program with the province. There's nothing. We're on our own. If it ever hits us, what do we do?\"\nBeyond COVID-19, the Indigenous leaders want to discuss the importance of implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) legislation to avoid future unrest.\nTrudeau promised money for Indigenous communities facing COVID-19. He also promised to help the provinces and territories shoulder the costs of the virus.\nThe provinces are on the front line of this pandemic as provincially run hospitals and public health agencies are dealing with suspected cases of the virus. To that end, Trudeau promised to earmark half of the billion-dollar COVID-19 response fund for the provinces to help them\u00a0deal with \"preparation and mitigation\" of the virus.\nProvinces have promised to ramp up testing of the virus to identify potential cases early to stop the spread.\n\"We have not seen a drastic spike in the number of cases reported but I know that people across the country are worried, worried about their health, worried about their aging parents, worried about the kind of impact this virus could have on their job, on their business,\" Trudeau said.\nOttawa has loosened the purse strings to help address COVID-19. Morneau and Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos have suggested more money could flow in the upcoming federal budget to stimulate an economy that faces a slump as a result of virus-related shocks.\nIn a press release ahead of the meeting, the premiers are asking Ottawa to target infrastructure spending in particular by sending them \"additional, long-term funding to enable projects to move forward expeditiously.\"\nBut the Business Council of Canada warned Ottawa against massive increases in deficit spending when Ottawa is already on track to post a $26.6 billion deficit for this fiscal year.\n\"We commend the federal government's responsible and targeted package of measures to protect Canadians from COVID-19 and to address the economic consequences of the current health emergency. More may be required going forward, but at this point it makes sense to hold off on major economic stimulus measures until the extent of the impact is better understood,\" said Goldy Hyder, the president and CEO of the council.\nHyder, like Kenney, said the meeting of leaders should be focused on supporting the economy and the oil and gas sector.\n\"We look forward to this week's First Ministers' Meeting to assess how the federal government responds to the hardship currently being inflicted on the energy sector. The TMX pipeline project, Coastal GasLink and other trade-enabling infrastructure are needed now more than ever,\" Hyder said.\nWhile spending might increase in the coming federal budget, it's not yet clear if Ottawa will meet the demand from provincial leaders to lift a cap on health care spending.\nThe Council of the Federation agreed at their December meeting to press Ottawa to increase the annual escalator on the Canada Health Transfer to 5.2 per cent a year from the current three per cent.\nSome premiers, notably\u00a0Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister, said Ottawa should park plans for a national pharmacare program and direct funds toward supporting the existing health care system.\nAsked in question period Wednesday if Trudeau would agree to the escalator hike, the prime minister pivoted to the government's new funding for COVID-19.\n\"We're always going to be ready to work with the provinces to improve the health system for Canadians, while of course respecting provincial jurisdiction,\" Trudeau said.\n"}, {"author": "Kathleen Harris", "title": "Trudeau announces $1B COVID-19 package as WHO calls global outbreak a pandemic", "description": "Federal government will waive 1-week wait for employment insurance, fund research", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberals-support-workers-businesses-covid-19-1.5493454", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5493622.1583937333!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cda-coronavirus-20200311.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 11, 2020 8:15 AM ET", "2020-03-11T23:23:18.274Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a $1-billion package to help Canadians cope with the COVID-19 outbreak, with half of the money going to the provinces and territories.\nThe announcement came just hours before he World Health Organization (WHO) officially called the global spread of the virus a pandemic.\nDuring a news conference in Ottawa today, Trudeau said the federal government is \"pulling out all the stops\" to help Canadians through the global health crisis. The package includes $275 million for additional research, such as vaccine development, and $200 million for federal medical supplies, supports for Indigenous communities and education efforts.\nThe federal government also will waive the one-week waiting period for employment insurance to assist workers and businesses affected by the novel coronavirus, and explore other measures to support affected Canadians, including income supports for those who are not eligible for EI sickness benefits.\n\"I want all premiers and Canadians to know your government is here for you,\" Trudeau said. \"We will make sure you have everything you need.\"\nOther elements of the\u00a0COVID-19 response package:\nWATCH: Justin Trudeau announces measures to help Canadians cope with COVID-19\nWith more than 100 countries now reporting cases of COVID-19, the WHO labelled the health crisis a pandemic\u00a0Wednesday and urged countries to prepare and move on\u00a0plans to find, test, isolate and\u00a0treat\u00a0cases.\n\"Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly,\" said WHO director general\u00a0Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.\"\nIn late January, the WHO labelled the outbreak that first emerged in Wuhan, China a global health emergency of international concern.\nHealth Minister Patty Hajdu\u00a0said that because Canada's response to COVID-19 has been based on science and evidence from the beginning, the WHO's pandemic announcement won't change the way the federal government approaches the outbreak.\nAsked what percentage of the population could be affected by the virus, Hajdu pointed to the potential rates of infection for all populations, which experts have pegged at between 30 to 70 per cent. She said that most people who get the virus\u00a0will experience only mild symptoms, similar to a cold or flu, and that it's the elderly or people with underlying health conditions who face the greatest risk.\n\"Those are the folks that are most severely affected by this illness. And so the work that we're doing as Canadians is not so much that it's lethal to the average healthy Canadian, but rather that they can then be a vector of infection to a very vulnerable person,\" she said.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel\u00a0said today that up to two-thirds of her country's population could become infected with the coronavirus.\nDuring a health committee appearance later Wednesday, Hajdu\u00a0offered more details on preparations underway to deal with a growing number of cases.\nShe said the funding being provided to provinces will allow them to rapidly acquire crucial equipment such as respirators, and that the government is exploring options to procure\u00a0additional hospital beds in the event a \"severe surge\" in cases overwhelms the system.\nHajdu said she's also talking to Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan about how the military might help to respond\u00a0to a community outbreak.\n\"They've already been very active in the repatriation process, and without hesitation, I will say,\" she said.\n\"They are incredible professionals that work for us at (Canadian Armed Forces)\u00a0who have a variety of different expertise and levels of engagement in terms of health ... (along with) other allied professionals that we can rapidly deploy should we need to. And those conversations are ongoing.\"\nCalling the measures Canada announced today \"significant,\" Trudeau said the government is ready to do more \"as the situation warrants it.\"\n\"The message we have for Canadians and for Canadian businesses is that we will be there for them,\" he said.\nCanada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said federal and provincial health authorities are preparing for a \"range of scenarios\" but\u00a0declined to predict how much of the population could be affected.\nShe said it's up to Canadians to keep each other safe\u00a0\u2014 particularly those who may be more vulnerable, such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions.\n\"That epidemic curve, and the number of people who get seriously ill and go into your health system, depends on all of us to protect those who may get more severe illness,\" Tam said.\nAs of early Wednesday morning, Canada has 101 reported cases of\u00a0COVID-19:\nOntario officials reported five of those cases\u00a0are now resolved,\u00a0which they said means the individuals are \"no longer infectious based on two consecutive negative tests.\" B.C.\u00a0says four of its cases are resolved.\nWATCH: Chief public health officer says Canadians can help slow virus's spread\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada's website says the risk to Canadians\u00a0remains low for the general population \u2014 but that \"could change rapidly.\" It says there is an increased risk of more severe outcomes for Canadians who are aged 65 or older or have compromised immune systems.\n\"While a COVID-19 outbreak is not unexpected in Canada, our public health system is prepared to respond.

We also don't want workers going to work because they feel that they need to work in order to pay for the groceries and put food on the table.\"\nThe research funding in the package unveiled Wednesday is over and above the $27 million announced in Montreal last week.\nOttawa is also leading a pan-Canadian effort to bulk-buy certain medical devices, and the federal government says it will be ready to support provinces needing further assistance to shore up their health-care systems as the number of confirmed cases rises.\nTreasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos said the government is also considering stimulus spending in the upcoming federal budget.\nBeyond Wednesday's announcement, Duclos said Ottawa will spend more to help people \"go through the crisis\" and help \"workers, families and businesses thrive and sustain themselves.\"\nWhile the debt-to-GDP ratio has been falling in recent years, Ottawa is running a federal budget deficit of $26.6 billion for the 2019-20 fiscal year.\nStock markets have cratered and the price of oil has dropped to levels not seen in years, in part due to the global panic over the spread of\u00a0COVID-19.

Truthfully, job hunting can feel like a job in itself. It takes a considerable amount of effort, persistence and self-reflection to not only find the job you want but to market yourself for it, ace the interview and land the position.\nFrom creating your personal branding to following up after an interview here's what you need to consider to successfully find \u2014and land \u2014 a job in the digital age.\nConsider your values and your reality before beginning in earnest\nBefore the job hunt begins you need to decide on what your dream job is. But, if you're not even sure what that looks like, career coach, writer and founder of Brand Editor, Rebecca Perrin, says you need to do some self-reflection. \"The number one thing that I advise clients who are in the dark about what to do next is to get in touch with their core values,\" says Perrin. \"If you don't know what you care about then you don't really have a foundation to build on.\" She says these core values can mean a number of different things to individuals \u2014\u00a0from working for a company with the potential for innovation, entrepreneurship opportunities and environmental missions. She suggests zeroing in on three to five values, this will help guide you to the type of company you want to work within. That being said, it's important to be realistic. \"Regardless of the industry, it is important to fully understand the qualifications and demands of a prospective career in advance,\" says Michael Contento, CEO of IT service company Blue Umbrella. Before applying he suggests finding guidance from professionals or people you know in the field to ensure you have all the imperative information before diving in.\u00a0\nJob posting red flags\nWondering whether a job post is worth applying to? When you read the description it should get you excited to join the company, if it doesn't then move on to the next one. \"The posting should tell a story and you should know exactly what the company is about,\" says Randy Quarin, senior partner at IQ Partners, an executive search and recruitment firm based in Toronto. He says not to get caught up on job titles but you should be wary if the posting is light on details about what the job is. Another thing to watch out for is if you see a job that's been posted for a long time \u2014 or re-posted. It could simply mean the company has lots of similar jobs to fill that are typically high-turnover positions (such as seasonal retail work) or it could be a sign that the company has a high-turnover for reasons that might raise concerns about an unhealthy workplace environment.\u00a0\nLinkedIn profile tips\nDo you need a LinkedIn profile? In short, yes. Recruiters and employers both use LinkedIn to source candidates for employment. First of all, having an account also means that you can use the site to research companies. Quarin suggests using LinkedIn to find and connect with the hiring managers rather than the HR manager. \"Hiring managers need to fill a role and they want to get it filled quickly with the right person,\" he says. Once you've found the hiring manager do some research on the company and send them a custom LinkedIn invite noting the current news. \"A few days after they accept your invite send them an email as a follow-up, showing your interest in their company and seeing if they have time for a five-minute phone call or meet in person,\" he says.\nFurther, if used correctly, LinkedIn can help hiring managers, clients and collaborators find you \u2014 and understand you. \"Your LinkedIn is a snapshot of your career brand \u2014 your personal brand within a professional context,\" says Perrin. Your 'about' section should read as an online reflection of who you are. Not just you as a professional but as an individual. \"It should include what you care about, why you're ambitious in a certain field and why you're pressing a career move,\" says Perrin. This is especially important if you are a recent graduate and fresh on the job hunt. \"It's really important to flesh out all the other things you did during your four years of university or high school,\" says Quarin. Include charity work, internships and sports because these things show dedication, discipline and responsibility.\u00a0\nAn easy way to make your profile stand out is to use a background image. If you're open for business, it's the sign above the door, says Perrin. \"It could be a simple stock image, something nice, that's complementary to your profile picture,\" she says, adding that writing a LinkedIn headline requires special attention too, because it's the most heavily weighted pieces of your profile for keywords, according to LinkedIn's search algorithm. Don't just make it your job title, \"it should actually be more of a shorthand snapshot of who you are, what you do, and some of your key skills,\" she says. Try and fit between five to seven keywords in this section. Finally, if you are on LinkedIn because you want to be found, try and update your profile at least once every 3 months.\u00a0\nYour social media channels\u00a0absolutely matter\nDespite what you might think, most employers aren't scouring the internet looking for reasons not to hire you, they're looking for reasons to hire someone. In other words, your professional digital snapshot doesn't just stop with your LinkedIn page. According to a 2018 CareerBuilder survey, 70 per cent of employers use social media to screen candidates during the hiring process. \"Your skills and experience are important but most of those things are flexible, they can be learned and shaped. What it really comes down to for companies is your personality and how much of a fit you are with the team,\" says Perrin.\nTips for making sure your application is read\nOnce you've crafted your perfect resume it's time to send it out in the world. When you're applying for a job via LinkedIn's application process never send it in a PDF format. LinkedIn and large-scale employers use automated application tracking systems (ATS) to pre-screen candidates and PDF resumes don't get read by many of these programs, says Perrin. She recommends a .DOCX file (Microsoft Word) as the best means of submitting your resume. However, if you apply directly to a hiring manager or through a company's website Quarin prefers PDF formatting because the document can't be changed or altered.\u00a0\nOther best practices for applying for a job is making the subject line crystal clear, says Quarin. For example, state the role, title or job number. Another piece of advice to note is to only attach your resume in the email and not your cover letter. Instead, have your cover letter in the body of the email, unless stated otherwise in the posting. \"The hiring manager will open up a resume because they have to, it shows what this person is doing right now but they're not going to open up a cover letter. It takes too long,\" says Quarin. To make things efficient he tells his candidates that the profile statements (a brief summary of an applicant's skills, experiences and goals related to a specific job opening) on their resume should read like a condensed cover letter.\nConsider getting in touch with a recruiter\u00a0\n\"Recruiters are generally really happy when they hear from somebody who proactively reaches out to them,\" says Perrin. Quarin agrees. Whether you're new to Canada and looking for a job or you're looking for a location or industry change as long as you're clear on what's motivating you it makes sense to work with a recruiter. An in-house recruiter or HR manager acquires talent for their organization and an agency recruiter helps a multitude of companies find talented candidates. Working with a recruiter can provide you with a clear path to a hiring manager's inbox. In addition, a recruiter can give you resume writing advice, a street-level perspective and insight into what companies are looking to hire followed by what they are looking for from a candidate.\nA simple Google search is a good way to help you find a recruiter in your area who is looking for candidates in your field of employment. Even better is to get a referral from a friend in a similar industry.\u00a0\nGet both your stories and your questions ready before your interview\nYou made it through the pre-screening software, perhaps had a phone call with an HR manager and now you got yourself an in-person interview. Good for you, but before you walk in there you should be armed with two things; some well-crafted stories and thoughtful questions.\u00a0\n\"Your skills and strengths have taken you this far. Now, demonstrate to an employer how you will apply your knowledge and leverage your extensive experience,\" says Contento. Share your knowledge in the form of stories. \"When we use the word story, it means to have examples of\u00a0situations you were put in and how you work yourself out of it,\" says Quarin. Come up with concrete examples from your past that you can point to as supporting evidence that you'd be great at the job; have three good ones at the ready (this way you can repeat the same stories in any interview) and make sure they have a clear and concise outcome. \"Practice out loud because your delivery is just as important as the content of the story itself,\" says Perrin.\nSecondly, have a list of prepared questions on hand. Don't focus on the basic questions like salary or start date, be more strategic. Perrin suggests asking about leadership opportunities for instance. \"If you ask questions that show that you're interviewing the company that will help garner you some respect from the interviewer,\" she says.\nAlways follow up, quickly\nThe experts agree. Post-interview, the standard protocol is to find out the contact information for every person who interviewed you and send them a personalized thank you. This applies whether your interview was for an internship, retail job or an executive level position; every candidate can benefit from sending thank you notes which convey both gratitude and professionalism. Send them via email the following day \u2014 or even better, the same day.\u00a0\nJulia McEwen is a Toronto-based writer, editor and stylist.

Both Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam have downplayed the idea that so called \"silent spreaders\" are a common way people are infected.\nBut a growing body of research indicates they may be wrong and people don't have to appear ill at all to infect others.\nJeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University in New York, says he is frustrated when people deny that asymptomatic spread can happen.\n\"We have so much evidence that that is going on,\" he said. \"It's ridiculous.\"\u00a0Read more about \"silent spreaders\" here.\nNursing homes across the world have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, and Canada is no different. At the Pinecrest Nursing Home in Bobcaygeon, Ont., 20 residents had died as of April 3 from the disease. In other parts of the country, families are being advised against hospitalizing their elderly relatives who contract the disease.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue facing Guelph is the threat posed by global climate change.\nIn the last four years, the Liberal Government put a price on pollution, banned single use plastics, and protected great swaths of our land and oceans. Our carbon pricing system not only reduces emissions but also puts money back in the pockets of more Canadian families. Battling climate change takes courage and planning, grassroots leadership, and government investment. I am proud to represent a political team that is fighting for a better future. The Liberal Party will build on our progress, and continue to take ambitious action to fight climate change: committing Canada to net zero by 2050, planting two billion trees, and making our country the best place in the world to build a clean tech company.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nI know that the changing nature of work can present a challenge for our people to find and keep a good job, even in this time of record low unemployment. As Guelph's Member of Parliament, my personal commitment to continuing to make life affordable revolves around three goals: environmental protection, economic prosperity, and social inclusion.\nTo make life more affordable for Canadian families, I support a plan that lowers taxes for middle class families. With an increase in the Basic Personal Amount, Canadians will not pay federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn. Changes to the Canada Child Benefit, CPP, and OAS will make sure that the youngest and oldest members of our society have the support they need.\nI also favour moving the Canadian economy into the carbon neutral future. Providing interest-free loans of up to $40,000 means landlords and other homeowners can improve their properties to make them more energy efficient. Lowering taxes for cleantech companies will create a strong incentive for business to set up shop in Canada and help make Canada a strong leader with green innovation.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe Liberal government recognizes that climate change is real, and scientific research has indicated the risk this represents to our future.\nCanadians expect forward-looking leadership, which is why the Liberal team has committed Canada to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This means we will enact measures not only to reduce carbon emissions, but also to offset emissions with actions that will remove carbon from the atmosphere. As a result, we will greatly increase Canada's forests and protect more of Canada's lands and oceans. The Liberal government will begin a program to plant two billion trees over the next 10 years. We will also protect 25% of Canada's lands and 25% of Canada's oceans by 2025.\nThe Liberal government will also continue to lead with a price on pollution and support for making the transition to a green economy. A $5-billion Clean Power Fund will help northern, remote, and Indigenous communities become less reliant on diesel-fueled power and will promote the electrification of Canadian industries using our own sources of clean and renewable power, like hydro, solar and wind.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nWith a background in community benefit organizations and as former President of the Guelph Chamber of Commerce, I understand the interests and the concerns of our community. Every day I work hard to respond to the needs of Guelph constituents. Helping to resolve problems with immigration, pensions, and employment insurance is a gratifying part of being the MP. Equally important is advancing policies to address the climate crisis, create a positive environment for employment, and improve life for our families.\nA key part of my job as MP is connecting individuals and institutions with the resources they need from the federal government. As a member of the House of Commons' Agriculture Committee, I have presented local Guelph ideas that can respond to national concerns. For instance, researchers at the University of Guelph made major contributions to the creation of the new National Food Policy.\nWorking collaboratively with others toward a common goal has been a cornerstone of my professional life. Being your MP is a reflection of all I have learned. While politics is often seen only through an adversarial lens, it demands significant collaboration and teamwork.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI have been knocking on doors and speaking to the residents of Guelph and one thing has remained clear, life has gotten more expensive under Justin Trudeau. Two thirds of Canadians feel that they either can't pay their bills \u2013 or feel that they have nothing left over at the end of the month after they do. Gasoline. Groceries. Home heating. Real estate. Debt. Everything keeps getting more expensive.\u00a0\nAn Andrew Scheer-led Conservative government will implement a Children's Fitness Tax Credit and a Children's Arts and Learning Tax Credit. These Tax Credits will put more money in parent's pockets while helping their kids do well in school, learn a new skill, and reach their greatest potential.\u00a0\nA Conservative government will remove federal income tax from Employment Insurance (EI) maternity benefits by providing a non-refundable tax credit of 15 percent for any income earned under these two programs.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Conservative plan is a plan that means real results for Canadians and their families.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nToday, Canadians are under pressure and worried about their future. Their dreams are getting further and further out of reach. They are looking for help. Trudeau has proven he cannot be trusted to deliver it. If Trudeau is re-elected and given four more years his endless deficits will force him to raise taxes even higher.\u00a0\nA Conservative government will provide a Universal Tax Credit to all hardworking taxpayers, will remove the GST off home heating and home energy costs, and will make transit passes more affordable by implementing the Green Tax Credit for Public Transit.\u00a0\nLife is expensive enough without the government costing you more. A new Conservative government will live within its means and put more money in the pockets of Canadians so they can get ahead, not just get by.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nCanadians trusted Justin Trudeau when he said he would protect the environment and lower Canada's emissions. Instead, all they got was a carbon tax. Not only is Canada failing to hit our Paris Agreement targets, we are getting further and further away.\u00a0\nAs an environmental policy, the carbon tax is a failure of epic proportions. It makes virtually no contribution to the global fight against climate change. And it only makes life more expensive for Canadian families and small businesses.\u00a0\nWe should all be concerned about climate change \u2013 about the kind of planet we will leave to future generations. A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment is built on three guiding principles:\u00a0\nThis plan is the most comprehensive environmental platform ever put forward by a political party in Canada.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nBorn in New Delhi, India, I have come to Canada to work hard to build a life for myself and my family. I am a veterinarian licensed in toxicology, and work as the chief science officer for a Canadian clean-technology company providing eco-friendly and safer alternatives to petroleum-based products.\u00a0\nI am passionate about my community, and willing to work tirelessly to represent the concerns of the residents of Guelph in Ottawa. I am running to champion the residents of Guelph so they can get ahead, not just get by.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nIt is difficult to choose one issue when so many of the challenges facing Guelph are intertwined.\nWe are dealing with a housing and homelessness crisis, an opioid crisis, and threat of private control of our drinking water supply. That is all without even mentioning the climate crisis that we are all facing, and the pressure to privatize water supplies.\nReally, I think what it comes down to is cost of living and whether governments are working for people or working for the powerful. We need to support people so they can make decisions in life that work for them \u2014 and that means taking money that goes to big polluters and big pharmaceutical companies, and bringing it back to ordinary working people in Canada.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nI am a mental health nurse\u00a0and in my work I have seen firsthand how difficult life has become for people. It induces stress, anxiety, and depression and cost of living is certainly a contributing factor to rising rates of these mental struggles.\nWe do need more mental health services, but it's not just that \u2014 we also need to address the root causes. Pharmacare, childcare, dental care, affordable housing units, living wages, pension security, and rental subsidies are all things missing from our society right now that should be provided, so that people can afford to live again.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe have to ensure a fair transition for workers \u2014 not just those who work directly in oil and gas, but also all those communities in Alberta, Sarnia, and others, whose economy revolves around the existence of their local industries.\nI know that many people in Sarnia have already started working out of town at places like Bruce Nuclear because there is not enough work left for them at home, and local restaurants are suffering due to this. I find that troubling. People should be able to be supported at home and contribute to where they have chosen to live.\nMy party is going to use things like the money saved from fossil fuel subsidies and the climate bank to create 300,000 clean, good jobs for people who need them, as close to their homes as possible.\nWe\u00a0also recognize that any climate action done by one government could be overturned by a future majority government that doesn't believe in climate science \u2014 that's why we need proportional representation, to create a system of minority governments that are incentivized to work together for the common good, not just to pander to one sector of Canadian society or another. We will also create an independent climate accountability office to hold future governments' feet to the fire on science-based climate targets.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a mental health nurse. It's a tough job. I want people to know how political my work is.\nWorking on the front line of the healthcare system means I see a lot of people who our systems have failed, whether it's the person whose addiction was treated as a crime instead of an illness, or the Indigenous mother whose children have been taken away from her, or the young person who doesn't want to have kids because they're not sure we'll make it out of the climate crisis. The one responsibility of a nurse is to protect the public, and that's why I decided to run.\nI want to give hope to all those people on the margins, hope that they will have a representative in government who can listen to them no matter where they're coming from. I want people to know I'm committed to working with the NDP to make life in Canada liveable again.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThere are several issues facing the people of Guelph, affordable house, climate change and a lack of mental health funding. The people in Guelph feel that none of these issues can be meaningfully tackled with a government that acts without integrity or accountability to the issues that matter to us. It's important that citizens have trust in their government and know the nation's leadership is accountable to the people.\u00a0\u00a0\nBroken promises, corporate interference and conflicts of interests at the highest levels of our government, have eroded the people's trust that government will act decisively on our most pressing issues. Greens seek to hold the balance of responsibility in a minority government to keep government accountable to its promises.\nWe would bring in new standards of transparency and an all party inner cabinet to encourage collaborative action. We would also create a Council of Canadian Governments ensuring an equal voice to Federal, Provincial, Municipalities, and First Nations representatives.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nHere's what we know:\nHome prices have risen by about 30% in Guelph since 2015\u00a0 the last election.\nHousehold incomes have not risen by 30% since the last election, so being able to afford a home, or make rent, has become near impossible for some.\nWe need to legislate housing as a legally protected human right for everyone in Canada. We need to increase the number of affordable housing units, and begin to roll back the causes of these rising costs.\nThe Green Party will deliver policy innovations, such as encouraging two family dwellings to address affordability, build a denser community, provide rental income opportunities and are good for the planet.\nAs we transition to a low carbon economy, we need to ensure no one is left behind and that means establishing a guaranteed livable income (GLI).\nThe principle of the GLI is simple: to establish an income floor below which no Canadian could fall, but with incentives recipients to continue working and to earn more. A GLI would provide a regular payment to every Canadian, at a level above the poverty line and ensure that no person's income falls below what is necessary for health, life and dignity.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Green party's climate plan Mission Possible calls for a 60 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. We must immediately end oil imports and support our Canadian workers.\u00a0\nThe Green plan to phase out fossil fuels must be done in a way that's fair to workers and builds a bridge to a low carbon economy where no one is left behind. Our energy and transportation network will be drawing from 100 per cent renewable energy within 10 years.\u00a0\nTo accomplish this, we all need to put aside partisanship and work together on what the evidence tells us we need to do. Climate change is too important to be a partisan issue. That's why we need an inner cabinet consisting of all parties to have everyone work together to ensure the climate is no longer treated like a political football.\u00a0\nThis is about the welfare of Canada and the entire planet.\u00a0\nWe will provide zero-interest loans for homes and businesses to complete energy upgrades based on EnerGuide criteria.\u00a0\nPeople want to do the right thing and save money as they save energy.\u00a0 And we can do this without creating more government debt.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\u00a0\nI've transformed my life from a carbon based lifestyle to the low carbon economy, 10 years ago I was building engines for Cadillac and stuck in traffic. Since then, I've built a company right here in Guelph installing climate solutions and creating great jobs of the future.\u00a0\nI've taken leadership on cross party policy building on electoral reform, and climate change action across municipal, provincial and federal governments, engaging people from youth to seniors.\u00a0\nAs a Green I'm devoted to building a healthy and inclusive social environment, one that puts health care, affordable housing, and social justice at the very core of our mission. I have been listening to our youth.\u00a0 OurTime.ca - the youth led organization for Canada's Green New Deal has endorsed me as their candidate because I have been living the values of decisive climate action, addressing inequality and creating good work.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nHome costs / Cost of Living\u00a0\nThe People's Party of Canada is the only party promising to address the root cause of rapidly increasing housing costs. The cause of this problem is supply and demand. Last year Toronto had a demand of 50,000 rental units, but only had 37,000 units available. This lack of supply results in increased rent and drives up the prices of entry level homes.\u00a0\nPeople who should be able to afford a house at 25 years old with a good job simply cannot afford to buy into this market. We cannot build enough units to stay ahead of the proposed growth. Money laundering is also playing a role, increasing the price of Canadian real estate by $40 billion dollars in 2018. The RCMP lack the resources to effectively fight this crime. This artificially inflates an already pressured market.\u00a0\nTo address this the People's Party is proposing to reduce immigration to between 100,000 and 150,000 people per year. We will give more support to the RCMP and Border Service Agents to crack down on money laundering and increase the speed at which current claims can be processed. This will help clear the backlog and will stop the flow of illegal border crossers into the country from the United States. This will reduce demand and lower housing costs.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\nVote enthusiastically to repeal the ineffectual carbon tax. It does not reduce emissions of CO2. It does not help the environment. It just makes everything more expensive. The cost of living is increasing much faster than wages have been increasing in Canada. From housing to boxes of cereal. If you are on a fixed income, it is hard to keep up with the pace of the increasing costs.\u00a0\nA People's Party government will put an end to corporate welfare. We will impose pipelines in order to end our reliance on Saudi oil. This will boost Canadian jobs, increase transportation\u00a0safety, remove tankers transporting oil across the ocean and keep $300 million per month in our economy, not in Saudi Arabia's. This is low hanging fruit. Simple policies that any self-interested government would implement. We are using oil all across the country. We are an oil rich nation. Why are we spending $300 million per month on foreign oil?\u00a0\nKeeping the $300 million per month will help the Canadian economy. A pipeline to bring our natural resources to support our Eastern Provinces will increase skilled jobs across the country for years to come.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nOur current government has had a strong majority with a strong environmental mandate that they have largely ignored. They have heaped on the rhetoric, but they have done nothing of substance for the environment. In fact, our waterways are filthy and they are failing to institute any concrete environmental policy.\u00a0\nThe previous government had a system and timeline in place to move to end the discharge of raw sewage into the St. Lawrence and off the coast of British Columbia. The Trudeau Liberals immediately moved to allow this process in 2015, days after assuming office. A People's Party will prioritize clean water and will implement a plan to stop this practice of discharging raw sewage into our waterways.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual? \nMark Paralovos (rhymes with \"for all of us\") is the People's Party of Canada candidate for Guelph.\u00a0\nMark is a proud, first generation Canadian. He was born in Toronto and his family moved to Guelph in the mid-eighties. He has lived here ever since. He comes from a large, supportive family, is married and has two school-aged children.\u00a0\nMark is a children's mental health professional by trade and spent 15 years working in that field, both in private facilities and with various school boards. During that time he was actively involved in union negotiations and served as a Union Steward.\u00a0\nIn 2016, Mark decided to take his career in a completely different direction, working with businesses to develop and manage their websites. He currently works with a small firm managing the e-commerce and advertising aspects of the business.\u00a0\nMark writes and produces a daily YouTube podcast focused on Canadian federal politics (https://CanadaPoli.com). After being nominated as the People's Party Candidate for Guelph, Mark started a second podcast specific to Guelph and his campaign (https://markparalovos.com). He also sits on the French as a Second Language Advisory Committee (FSLAC) with the Upper Grand District School Board.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue is people, homeless people, people wanting to buy a house, drug-addicted people, seniors needing care, hospital bed space and abuse of minorities.\u00a0Each of these requires a unique approach. Some just need money, others need counseling, some need care and all benefit from having a stronger image.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nI know of a family of five in Hong Kong who lived in a 600 sq. ft. apartment for years.\u00a0We\u00a0can make smaller housing units available to address the high cost of living.\u00a0 We need not be using more than we need.\u00a0The CHP endorses the Fair Tax Policy of collecting federal money through a sales tax and abolishing income tax.\u00a0People would only be taxed on their spending, and not on their savings.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOne major concern is for carbon in the atmosphere.\u00a0New technologies can capture carbon from the air and turn it to other uses.\u00a0While costly now, we can invest in these technologies. Two such organizations remove as much carbon from the air as is produced by 600,000 cars.\u00a0More businesses like this can help. Driving at 100 km/h on freeways, instead of 120 km/h, saves 30 per cent\u00a0of fuel. Less fuel means less carbon in the air.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am caring, sympathetic and hard working.\u00a0I am a good supporter of the needs of others.\u00a0I played a role in the founding of Michael House in Guelph, a crisis pregnancy home.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\n(Actually) affordable housing. People are finding it incredibly difficult to find adequate housing to rent (never mind buy).\nWe believe housing is a right. Our platform includes building one million new units of social housing, but also policies around better jobs. Guelph has a low rate of unemployment, but we don't know how many are underemployed or in other forms of precarious employment. Our full employment strategy, which includes a 32 hour work week with no loss in pay (and a $20 minimum wage), and job creation plans \u2014 housing, an affordable electric car and mass transit, retrofits and upgrades, etc. would make it a bit easier to afford.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nNationalize. Take away corporations' demand for profit over all other considerations. If we nationalized GM, for example, we could build an affordable electric car and mass public transit.\nOur energy and resource extraction policies could be based on what we need rather than what brings (a few people and corporations) more profit. Our full employment strategy, job creation, free daycare and post-secondary education, expanded Medicare and public services are also aimed at addressing these concerns.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nStop increasing the military budgets! We would cut them by 75 per cent. The military industrial complex is responsible for much\u00a0of our carbon emissions and fossil fuel use.\nWe can't keep supporting environmentally (and socially!) unsustainable practices, and the money could be used to fund the services, the infrastructure, etc. that are good for the people, and good for the planet. We would close the tarsands and the associated pipelines, end carbon 'credits,'\u00a0and develop solar, wind, geothermal, hydro and other renewables.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm a mom, an activist, an anti-fascist (which should be a basic stance as a decent person), a feminist, a book addict (reader, collector, and supporter of writers). I don't think I have a good poker face when it comes to politics.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe lack of funding for social services and affordable housing. Reduce the military budget by 5 billion dollars over 5 years, halt buying 88 advanced fighter aircraft costing $15 to 17 billion\u00a0and pump these funds into social services and affordable housing across the country.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\nGo after the off shore tax shelters and tax muilti-national companies and upper 0.1 per cent\u00a0of wealthy public at 70 per cent\u00a0of income. Use funds to establish a guaranteed annual income for all Canadians.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nNationalize the fossil fuel industry and place under a crown corporation much like the National Energy Programme of the mid 1970's set up under Pierre Trudeau. Stop all subsidies to fossil fuel companies and place yearly levy of 20 per cent\u00a0on all \u00a0fossil fuel stocks traded\u00a0on the stock exchange. This levy will\u00a0increase\u00a0by additional 20 per cent\u00a0every year over five\u00a0years when 100% levy will be reached to end\u00a0the investments by banks financial institutions\u00a0in fossil fuel industry.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am an international\u00a0socialist who envisions\u00a0a World Federation of Socialist States (WFSS) as the only real alternative to the ongoing\u00a0the destruction that national and\u00a0 trans-national capitalism has brought this planet\u00a0 and more specifically, saving\u00a0this planet from fossil fuel capitalism, the threat of nuclear war and runaway militarism.\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo was unable to find any contact information for Michael Wassilyn.

What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur track record on the environment speaks for itself, and I want our government to keep making progress.\u00a0Our government put a price on pollution, polluting is no longer free in Canada. We will continue to take action on reducing emissions, supporting clean growth, and protecting and preserving our wildlife.\nOur government has been working to transition away from a carbon-based economy, and we must continue this progress, because the economy and the environment go hand-in-hand, and we cannot have one without the other. I will continue to fight for greater investment in renewable energy, programs to grow green solutions like our electric vehicle rebate, preservation of Canadian wildlife and our plan to plant two\u00a0billion trees.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI love Cambridge. I've lived here for two decades, and it's where I've chosen to raise my two children. Nothing is more important to me than helping families in this community succeed and access the help they need when they're facing challenges.\nEven before being your Member of Parliament, I spent my career serving our community in non-profit organizations like the YMCA,the Boys & Girls Club, and the University of Waterloo. I will always fight for our community, and the people that live here.\nWebsite\nResponses not yet received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI've knocked on over 10,000 doors now, and what I hear most about is the opioid and addictions crisis. We've seen the harm caused by addiction, homelessness, and mental health issues in Cambridge. As your MP, my first task would be to declare a public health emergency on the opioid crisis, and commit to working with all levels of government, experts, and Canadians, to develop a national strategy on opioids.\nI would work to end the criminalization and stigma of addiction while getting tough on the real criminals - those who traffic in and profit from illegal drugs. I'll also work to pursue financial compensation from the drug companies responsible for this crisis. In parallel, I'll pursue an effective Affordable Housing strategy for\u00a0Cambridge, that will tackle homelessness, poverty, and housing shortages.\nThe opioid crisis stems from previous cuts to affordable housing, education, social services, and the unexpected impact of oxycontin and oxycodeiene being produced and pushed by pharmaceutical companies in the 1990s. To start fixing the crisis in Cambridge and beyond, we need to take these roots into consideration and deal with them today. There's no magic bullet, but we can heal our riding.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an\u00a0MP?\nFirst: Wages have stagnated while the cost of living, mortgages, tuition, etc., has skyrocketed. This means families are stuck paying for essentials like food, and services like childcare and medicine, on their credit cards. So, the first thing we can do is recoup the billions of dollars that are lost to corporate tax evaders, and implement a 1 per cent tax on those with more than $20 million in wealth. This will raise over $10 billion-plus per year, helping us pay for the services our families need, allowing us to pay off debts and make lives more affordable.\nSecond: The climate crisis demands immediate and rapid action. We must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions quickly. The silver lining is that we are presented with an unprecedented economic opportunity, because the world is at the frontier of a green energy revolution. My vision is that, Cambridge, as an industrial town with our infrastructure and skilled workforce, is at the leading edge of this low-carbon energy transformation, building the electric cars and public-transit fleets and infrastructure of tomorrow. This will create hundreds of thousands of new, well-paying jobs. Either we build the future we want to see, or someone else will.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThis is an important question for me, since my PhD centered on Climate Politics.\nWe need less talk, and real action, immediately. We have less than 10 years to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by half to meet the IPCC's targets.\u00a0\nWe need a Green New Deal. This will require nothing less than a mass mobilization and transformation of the way our society understands and consumes energy. First and foremost, we cannot continue to increase emissions, which the TMX pipeline would do. So: no new pipelines; cut all fossil-fuel subsidies; and use the $3.3 billion previously given to the biggest polluters, to be directly invested into the low-carbon technologies of the future.\u00a0\nWe need this to science-based targets in line with keeping warming to 1.5 degrees.\nTo finance new projects, New Democrats will launch a Canada Climate Bank to make the big, meaningful investments in the innovative clean energy projects we need.\nRetrofitting homes to be energy efficient and electrifying public transit by 2030 will create over 300,000 good jobs all over Canada, rebuilding local economies while lowering emissions. This is crucial: fighting climate change in Cambridge BY building the low-carbon future we want to see.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI listen to everyone and I never cast judgment on anyone.\nI used to work as a landscaper, in minimum-wage retail, and then as a recruiter in human resources. I went back to school as a 'mature student' to study politics, because I was concerned about where the world was headed environmentally, economically, and politically. I studied hard, was accepted to do a Masters degree at Oxford University and a PhD in International Politics at the LSE (UK), and then I taught International and Environmental Security at Wilfrid Laurier University and the Balsillie School in Waterloo. I'm also on the Board of Directors of the Cambridge Self-Help Food Bank.\nI decided to run for the NDP after the birth of my baby boy at Cambridge Memorial Hospital last year. I started thinking more about the future, and it scared me. So, I'm working now to make a better future for him, and for all of us. Cambridge is my home, it's where my wife and I want to raise our young family, and despite its issues, it's still an amazing place to live and it has much more potential.\nCambridge: Let's be good to one another.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue is the climate crisis.\u00a0We have a small window to respond before damage becomes irreversible.\u00a0We are already seeing negative impacts\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe gap is getting larger between the rich and poor and many Canadians are getting lost in the system.\u00a0The Green Party advocates a universal living income and universal pharmacare.\u00a0\nAlso, we need to start focusing on health and well-being rather than always measuring how we are doing in terms of economic activity. I am already a supporter of the Well-Being Waterloo project and would like to see this focus on well-being scaled up\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe Green Party has put forward a detailed action plan:\u00a0Mission Possible which\u00a0includes ending subsidies to fossil fuel immediately,\u00a0no new pipelines,\u00a0banning fracking\u00a0and scaling up the green economy.\u00a0\nWe need to make this transition for the planet and to participate in the global green economy and to do so in a way that supports workers and their families.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am an entrepreneur, social innovator, community activist, artist and a grandmother.\u00a0In my business as a graphic recorder, I have worked with non-profits, municipal government and community leaders to facilitate creative solutions to some of the most wicked social problems facing\u00a0Cambridge,\u00a0Waterloo region and Brant County.\u00a0\nMy decision to run as Green Party candidate in Cambridge is motivated by my passion for a sustainable economy and a caring community.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nWhen I'm talking with Cambridge residents, I most often hear two concerns,\u00a0one with a very local focus and the other with a national focus.\nRelated to the former, residents are concerned about drug use, especially opioids, in the downtown core. For the PPC, addressing the drug issue will involve putting the safety and well-being of law-abiding citizens first. Research proves that safe injection sites encourage riskier drug use leading to more deaths but do almost nothing to get people clean. So I don't support a SIS (supervised injection site). A compassionate approach will focus on getting addicts off drugs and that's what the PPC is for.\nThe other concern that is mentioned is the issue the corruption of national government leaders. [Liberal Leader Justin] Trudeau's broken promises and [Conservative Leader] Andrew Scheer's willingness to pander to get votes \u2014 whether it's caving in to the dairy cartel or giving Quebec, but no other province, the ability to set immigration rates \u2014 people are frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow does one address this problem of corruption? One needs to vote in politicians who tell the truth and refuse to pander even if it means it will cost them votes. Only Maxime Bernier and the People's Party is willing to follow that path.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nA People's Party government will let citizens keep more of the money from their pay cheques through lower income taxes. If you make less than $15,000 per year, you will pay no tax. If you make between $15,000 and $100,000 your income tax rate is just 15 per cent.\u00a0 And that will give middle-class Canadians thousands more every year. Those making over $100,000 pay 25 per cent.\nThe PPC is also the only party to end supply management \u2014 or producer price fixing \u2014 on milk, eggs and poultry. Ending supply management will lower the price on these food staples and lower people's grocery bill by about $600 a year.\nThe PPC is going to open up cellphones, internet and cable industries to full competition. With more businesses competing for your business, prices will go down. We'll also open airlines and other near-monopolies to competition to increase competition and get prices lower.\nFinally, we'll also lower immigration and that will lead to increased wages for lower skill and entry level position (see work of Harvard economist, George Borjas); it will also lead to lower housing prices (see work of Dr. Daniel Hiebert, UBC).\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe PPC is skeptical of the alarmist claims being made because they just don't stand up to the science. We agree that the temperature is getting gradually warmer \u2014 now up 1 degree Celsius since 1800. Science also shows that CO2 in the atmosphere can increase warming.\nHowever, the science is also very clear that levels of C02 in the atmosphere didn't reach concentrations great enough to effect warming until the 1960s. The warming we see now started in the 1800s. For something to be a cause, it cannot come after the effect.\nBased on the evidence, the People's Party is going to focus on the most pressing environmental needs for Canadians. Health Canada's says that currently over 14,000 people in North America die annually from air pollution from human sources. Pollution in our lakes, rivers and oceans causes hundreds of cases of illness every year.\nMany indigenous communities have no clean water to drink.\nWe're making safe drinking water for remote indigenous communities our first priority and it's part of a larger, firm commitment to combat air and water pollution.\nThis video is my response to climate alarmism.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nMy family \u2014 my wife Maggie and our five children \u2014 and I have made their home in Cambridge for almost 20 years. Our ties to the community have been made strong though volunteer involvement like running summer camps for kids.\nI'm a tenured professor at Wilfrid Laurier University and I've been a leading proponent for freedom of conscience and expression on academic campuses and in Canadian society more generally. My decision to enter politics is rooted in my concern that:\nThe people of Cambridge need to know that I will tell the truth even if the truth is uncomfortable to hear. I will not pander for votes. I think that every human being must be treated with respect but every idea must be open to debate.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing the riding and how would you address it?\nThe most pressing issue facing the people of Cambridge and all of Canada is the need for political renewal.\nWe need to change the political and electoral process so people can participate in making the decisions that affect their lives and the society.\nIn the present situation the major parties act as a cartel to keep their monopoly on power and control of the political process and the peoples' participation is merely to vote every four years. The interests served by this cartel of parties are not those of the working people, they are the interests of the monopolies and the oligopolies which they serve. The most people can hope for\u00a0is to \"influence an MP.\"\nWe can reject this system where the political parties come to power. By speaking in our own name about our concerns, about what should be the priorities in the economy, health care, education and other matters of national interest, working people can embark on a new path to serve their own interests. We can exercise direct control over the decisions we ourselves take and speak in our own name. Importantly, this includes what to do in the 2019 election itself.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP.\nWe need a new direction for the economy. Workers are the producers. We and our families are those most affected by upheavals in the economy, as the basis of our livelihoods is destroyed and public services and social programs come under attack. The austerity agenda which has been unleashed is playing havoc with our lives.\nWorkers are the producers of all the social wealth necessary for the economy and the society to function. It is our rights that must be at the centre of setting a new direction for the economy, one that recognizes the rights of all people. In the current situation, it is monopoly right that is held sacred. Multinationals move in or out of the area, according to their own private interests. Governments at all levels entice them to move in with various pay-the-rich schemes, and then protect them when they move out.\nSpeaking with our peers in own voice about the problems that face us, presenting our own experience with the ruling class and its pay-the-rich schemes, working out our own proposals to humanize the natural and social environment and taking our own decisions are important in breaking with the status quo.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address these concerns.\nA very significant step the government should take, is to withdraw from NATO, NORAD, and the U.S. war machine, which is the world's biggest\u00a0polluter, and the major source of war and aggression internationally.\nThe problems in the environment are crying out for the working people to empower themselves to set a direction for the economy that serves to humanize the social and the natural environment\nA government whose aim is to address the concerns of the people and to build a bright future for the people and the coming generations will restrict the monopolies and oligopolies from their destructive activities.\nAround the world, it is the people speaking out in their own name on these issues that is depriving the monopolies and oligopolies, and governments in their service, of their ability to pollute, destroy, super-exploit, trample on the sovereign rights of Indigenous peoples, and wage war for self-serving aims.\nThe government should stop blaming individual behaviour for destroying the environment. Here and internationally, governments must take measures to end\u00a0 destructive practices of the monopolies and oligopolies, such as fracking, clear cutting, detrimental mining methods, contamination of lakes and oceans, the privatization of water and fraudulent environmental assessments.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm running because it is the right of working people, as the producers of all of the social wealth, to have a say in how the society is organized. It is our right to participate in making those decisions which affect our lives.\nThe cartel parties deprive us of this right with their monopoly on power and cordon sanitaire around all areas of decision-making. The interests they serve are those of the monopolies and oligopolies. They decide all matters pertaining to the election \u2014 including who the candidates will be and what the \"issues\" are.\nThe Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada is calling on people to discuss with their peers how make their vote count.\nA vote for the candidates of the Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada and its program for democratic renewal is an affirmation of working peoples' right to have a say in how society and the economy is organized \u2014 that it's not the exclusive preserve of the cartel parties.\nIn ridings where MLPC candidates are not running, this statement can be made by voting for other small party candidates or independents.\nParty website\nResponses not yet received.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Does approving TMX do anything for the Liberals?", "description": "The Canada Votes newsletter is your weekly tip-sheet as we count down to Oct. 21", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-votes-newsletter-issue-9-trans-mountain-pipeline-decision-1.5176066", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5176221.1580915495!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trans-mountain-20190609.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 16, 2019 4:00 PM ET", "2019-06-16T20:00:00.620Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The 2019 election campaign is already underway \u2014\u00a0the CBC News Canada Votes newsletter is your weekly tip-sheet as we count down to Oct. 21.\nReading this online?\u00a0Sign-up for the newsletter\u00a0and receive it every Sunday.\nVassy Kapelos, host of Power & Politics\nLess than 48 hours from now, a decision years in the making will be announced.\nOn June 18, the Trudeau cabinet makes its go/no go decision on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. If I were a betting woman, I'd say the decision will be 'go'. (Putting aside the merits of the decision one way or the other, they own the freaking thing - how can they not build it?)\nFor those who aren't familiar with this particular pipeline saga (there are others, just think back to Northern Gateway, Energy East and Keystone XL), it began about two and a half years ago. That's when the federal government approved the expansion, which is basically the twinning of a pipeline that already exists.\nThe pipeline runs from just outside Edmonton, Alberta to Burnaby, B.C; a distance of over one thousand kilometres. It carries about 300 thousand barrels of oil, but the expansion would triple that capacity. \nThe idea is to bring that Alberta crude to B.C. where it can be shipped to Asia. Nearly all of Canada's oil goes to the U.S.; because of that and a few other factors, Canadian oil is sold at a discount compared to the price of oil everywhere else. The pipeline is supposed to change that by opening up a new market and getting a better price.\nSo, back to 2016. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet approved the pipeline, but - like all pipelines projects over the past decade - it faced a lot of opposition. B.C. is worried about the sevenfold increase in tanker traffic that the expansion will bring, the corresponding effect on marine life and the potential for an oil spill. Some First Nations along the route are also\u00a0worried about the impact of the pipeline on their land\u00a0and water supply, and the potential for an oil spillalong the route.\nLast spring the company behind the pipeline (Kinder Morgan), sensing the gridlock was permanent, threw their hands in the air and decided to peace out. In came the feds with a $4.5 billion cheque. And just as the deal to buy the pipeline was greenlit, along came a court decision that put the brakes on the expansion. The government launched new consultations and had the National Energy Board review the impact on the marine environment.\nAfter all that, decision day is here again - and it just seems bizarre to think the federal government would reject a pipeline after spending billions of dollars to keep it alive.\nWhat happens if (when) the Trudeau government does approve the pipeline? The political calculations aren't pretty. I'd wager (I'm a betting woman again) the federal Liberal Party won't earn a single vote in Alberta with this decision. I can't entirely explain it, but saying the name Trudeau in Alberta right now is like being a Golden State Warrior fan in Toronto after Game 5.\nTrust me, if you live outside the province, you're underestimating how visceral the anger is in Alberta. I'm not justifying it, I'm just saying it's there. Consider a recent conversation I had with someone in Calgary, someone who voted for the NDP provincially:\nPerson: \"Justin Trudeau just wants the oil sands to disappear, he could care less.\"\nVassy: \"Why do you think that?\"\nPerson: \"Look what he's doing with C-69, I just know he can't stand us.\"\nVassy: \"The feds did buy the pipeline ...\"\nPerson: \"He was forced to, it was the last thing in the world he wanted to do.\"\nYou get the drift. Approving this pipeline will do the Liberals no favours in Alberta. The bigger question, the one that has more variables, is whether it will cost them any votes in B.C. Looking at \u00c9ric Grenier's poll tracker numbers, the next election could put us in minority government territory, and what happens in every region and province - including B.C. - could really matter to the outcome.\nYou can see how the Liberals are trying to cushion the blow. C-69 and C-48, the government's two marquee pieces of environmental legislation, probably will pass before the House rises this week. It's easy to picture the sales pitch: 'We approved a pipeline but waiiitttt \u2026 we also did all this other stuff!' You know, environment and economy go hand in hand, we can do both, etc, etc.\nWill that be enough? It's hard to say, especially with the Green Party nipping at the Liberals' heels.\nThe Conservatives say they'll build that pipeline and others. But will they force one through Quebec to do so? Or avoid the courts? And the NDP is staunchly opposed to TMX, but what about the LNG project in B.C.? It's supported and championed by the provincial New Democrats, which seems to put the provincial party at odds with its federal cousins. As the Rachel Notley-Jagmeet Singh experience taught us, that likely won't end well.\nWill the politics of pipelines play out in this election? Bet on it. \nVassy Kapelos is host of Power & Politics, weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on CBC News Network.\nHave a question about the October election?

As the parliamentary session comes to a close, Liberals will also contrast their plan to invest in the middle class with the Conservative plan for Ford-style cuts to services Canadians rely on.\nRachel Curran\u00a0\u00a0senior associate at Harper & Associates Consulting\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer will release his long-awaited environmental policy this week, focusing both on action to address climate change and tangible measures to protect and conserve Canada's natural environment. The Conservatives will also be preparing to respond to the government's decision on the Trans Mountain pipeline, aligning with western premiers to urge approval of the project.\nKathleen Monk\u00a0\u00a0principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group\nNew Democrats are saying \"game on\" this weekend with the release of their vision document, a 'New Deal for People.' The NDP will outline their commitments to Canadians and signal what they want the campaign to be about. After a weekend of candidate training, New Democrats will hit the hustings to sell their single-payer Pharmacare for All plan to Canadians.\n\u00c9ric Grenier's weekly look at key numbers in the political public opinion polls.\nThere's one question people ask me all the time.\nWho's going to win the election?\nMy stock answer is that, if an election were held today, the Conservatives probably would win it. That's what the Poll Tracker shows.\nBut people want to know who will win in October. My answer to that question?\nI don't know.\nThat's not the cop-out that it sounds like, because there have been elections in the past where I have been comfortable with saying who I think will probably win.\nTake the last Alberta provincial election. As soon as the Progressive Conservatives and Wildrose merged into a single party, the writing was on the wall for Rachel Notley's New Democrats.\nDitto for the last Ontario vote. It wasn't a certainty that Doug Ford's PCs would win by any stretch, but even before he took over the party it looked like the most likely outcome of that election.\nBut there are a lot of reasons to reserve judgment on what will happen this fall.\nThe Conservatives hold a lead in the polls and have for months. But it isn't that wide of a lead. And in terms of the party's ability to win seats, it's rather fragile. Their edge in Ontario remains relatively narrow. Flip a few points over to Justin Trudeau's Liberals and dozens of seats flip, too.\nAndrew Scheer's approval ratings are mixed and a lot of Canadians still don't hold very strong views about him either way.\nThere's also the history of incumbents at the federal level. Single-term governments are rare.\nAnd while the Conservative vote has been pretty steady, the vote on the centre-left is fluid. What will happen to the NDP if labour backs the Liberals, the Greens present a credible option for environmentalists and strategic voters choose to cast a ballot for Trudeau to keep Scheer out of the Prime Minister's Office?\nThat could shift the numbers and the electoral map in unpredictable ways.\nSo, if an election were held today, the Conservatives probably would win it. But will they win the election that will be held on Oct. 21? I don't know. That's the honest answer.\nAnd considering all the other questions that won't be answered for another four months, it's also the smart one.\nTap here to go to the full poll tracker \nJack Brezina asks: I watch the poll tracking you do very carefully. However, I wonder how to compare the BQ's strength, which I presume is based exclusively on Quebec polling, with the other parties, whose polling, again I presume, is done nationally. Wouldn't it be more meaningful to give us, as a sidebar, the other parties' Quebec polling numbers to compare with the BQ's so we can gauge the relative strength of support in that province alone?\nIf you're curious about where each of the parties stand in different parts of Canada, you do have that option in the Poll Tracker. Just scroll down to the \"Trend over time\" section, and choose the region you'd like to check out.\nBut if you just see topline numbers for the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in a poll \u2014 or in our updates \u2014 there's an easy rule of thumb for calculating the Bloc's support in Quebec. The province represents about a quarter of Canada's population, so if you multiply the Bloc's national score by four, you'll get a rough idea of where the party stands in Quebec.\nFive per cent nationwide, for example, means about 20 per cent in Quebec.\nThe national score the party puts up, however, isn't a meaningless number. It actually could decide whether a Bloc leader gets to participate in the leaders debates.\nParties need to meet two of three criteria to be in the debates, according to the new rules drawn up by the Liberal government. One of those is to run candidates in at least 90 per cent of ridings across the country. As the Bloc only runs candidates in Quebec, it doesn't meet that condition.\nHaving an MP elected under their banner is one condition the Bloc does meet. The last? Having a reasonable chance of winning seats or obtaining at least four per cent of the vote in the last federal election. The Bloc got 4.7 per cent in 2015.\nSo, even if the Bloc's support was plummeting and the party was no longer a contender to win a seat, its leader would still get to participate in the debates in both French and English.\n\u2013 \u00c9ric Grenier, CBC's polls analyst \u00a0\nHave a question about the October election?

Jerome Adams said on CBS This Morning that the numbers will get worse this week. \"Things are going to get worse before they get better. We really need everyone to understand this \u2026 and lean into what they can do to flatten the curve.\"\nYet only hours before the surgeon general's dire warning, Trump suggested\u00a0that the remedies may be more harmful than the outbreak in a tweet that contradicted the advice of medical experts across the nation.\nA week ago, the White House came out with a \"15 Days to Stop the Spread\" plan that encouraged Americans to work from home and avoid bars, restaurants and discretionary travel, as well as groups of more than 10 people. It also told older Americans and those with serious underlying health conditions that they should stay home and away from other people.\nSince then, states that have become hot spots for the virus have implemented even more radical measures, which the White House has applauded. Officials have made clear that they don't believe the threat will be over at the end of 15 days, but will reassess what steps are needed at the end of the period.\nTrump has also balked at using his authority under the recently invoked Defence Production\u00a0Act to compel the private sector to manufacture needed medical supplies like masks and ventilators, even as he encourages them to spur production.\nOn Monday, the\u00a0White House\u00a0Correspondents Association confirmed a member of the press gallery is suspected of having contracted the coronavirus.\u00a0In a statement, the association did not identify the individual but said it has been in contact with the White House physician and the journalist's news organization.\nOn the economic front, the Federal Reserve announced Monday it will lend to small and large businesses and local governments as well as extend its bond-buying programs as part of a series of sweeping steps to support the flow of credit through an economy ravaged by the viral outbreak.\nThe Fed said it will set up three new lending facilities that will provide up to $300 billion US by purchasing corporate bonds, buying a wider range of municipal bonds\u00a0and purchasing asset-backed securities.\nTrump officials and congressional leaders, meanwhile, were resuming\u00a0talks Monday on the massive economic rescue plan that would be larger than the 2008 bank bailout and 2009 recovery act combined. Democrats had rejected an earlier plan Sunday night, arguing it was tilted toward corporations and did too little to help workers and health-care providers.\nCentral to the package is as much as $350 billion US for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. There is also a one-time rebate cheque\u00a0of about $1,200 per person, or $3,000 for a family of four, as well as the extended unemployment benefits.\nDemocrats say the largely Republican-led effort did not go far enough to provide health care and worker aid and fails to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion US \"slush fund\" for corporations. They voted to block its advance.\nDemocrats won a concession \u2014 to provide four months of expanded unemployment benefits, rather than just three as proposed, according to an official granted anonymity to discuss the private talks. The jobless pay also extends to self-employed and so-called gig workers.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar \u2014 a recent contender for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014\u00a0announced Monday that her husband, John Bessler, has tested positive for the coronavirus.\nFrom Reuters and The Associated Press, updated at 5 p.m. ET.\nIn Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday ordered the closure of most non-essential stores, libraries, gyms, playgrounds, and houses of worship, and banned gatherings of more than two people, other than immediate family, for three weeks.\nJohnson told reporters at his daily briefing that police will have powers to enforce the rules and impose fines. The stronger rules were brought in because Johnson said people continued to disregard government advice.\n\"If too many people become seriously unwell at one time,\"\u00a0he said, \"[the National Health Service] will be unable to handle it\u00a0\u2014 meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well.\"\nCOVID-19 deaths in Spain rose by 462 overnight, reaching 2,182, the Health Ministry said, while the total number of cases rose to 33,089, over one in 10\u00a0of them health workers. At the same time, the country's deputy prime minister, Carmen Calvo, was hospitalized on Sunday with a respiratory infection and is awaiting coronavirus test results.\u00a0\nIn France, doctors scrounged masks from construction workers and\u00a0factory floors in a bid to shore up much-needed medical supplies.\n\"There's a wild race to get surgical masks,\" Francois Blanchecott, a biologist on the front lines of testing, told France Inter radio. \"We're asking mayors' offices, industries, any enterprises that might have a store of masks.\"\nItaly's death toll rose by 602 on Monday to 6,077, the smallest increase for four days. At the same time, the number of new cases also slowed, raising hope that the most aggressive phase of the epidemic may be passing.\n\"Today is perhaps the first positive day we have had in this hard, very tough month,\" said Giulio Gallera, the top health official in the northern region of Lombardy. \"It is not the time to sing victory, but we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\"\nHowever, there was also a significant fall in the number of tests carried out, and the head of Italy's national health institute, Silvio Brusaferro, said it was too soon to say if the recent decline in daily deaths and new cases would continue.\nAdditionally, the man known in Italy as Patient No. 1\u00a0is out of the hospital a month after he arrived in critically ill condition.\nWATCH\u00a0|\u00a0Drone footage over Lisbon shows desolate landmarks, tourist areas:\nPoland is giving some prisoners the option of serving their sentences at home\u00a0under a justice ministry proposal that could benefit up to 20,000 convicts.\u00a0\"We propose raising the upper limit of a sentence or the total length of sentences which can be served in the electronic supervision system to 18 months,\" the Justice Ministry said in a statement. Until now, it was possible for sentences of up to a year. Prisons have already banned visits and stopped letting most prisoners work on the outside. Poland has so far reported 684 cases of coronavirus, including eight deaths.\u00a0\nANALYSIS | The week panic hit the West\nOn Monday, the German government approved another large aid package to help companies and individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0The new economic package comes on top of a previous pledge of at least \u20ac460 billion ($716 billion Cdn) in loan guarantees to help Europe's biggest economy handle the fallout from running down public life to a minimum. Germany has recorded over 26,220 cases of COVID-19 alongside 111 deaths, though Germany's public health chief says there are signs the country's infection curve is flattening.\u00a0Chancellor Angela Merkel's initial test for coronavirus came back negative, but she will undergo further tests.\u00a0\nAustria is mobilizing military reservists for the first time since the Second World War to help with food supplies, medical support and police operations, the defence minister said Monday. About 3,000 soldiers\u00a0\u2014 10 per cent of the reserves \u2014 will for three months take over coronavirus-related tasks from soldiers whose military service expires in May, Klaudia Tanner said.

The death toll\u00a0rose Tuesday by two to 120.\u00a0\nThe new numbers marked the 13th day in a row the country has posted new infections of around 100 or less, compared with the peak of 909 cases recorded on Feb. 29. But officials urged even greater vigilance as imported cases and new, small outbreaks continued to emerge, such as in nursing homes, churches and crowded workplaces.\n\"We don't give much meaning to numbers yet, but as there are some fluctuations despite a declining trend, our top priority is to prevent sporadic group infections and repatriated cases,\" said Yoon Tae-ho, director-general for public health policy at the health ministry.\nThe worst outbreak in the Middle East is unfolding in Iran, where state TV reported another 127 deaths on Monday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 1,812 amid more than 23,000 confirmed cases. Iran has faced widespread criticism for not imposing stricter quarantine measures early on. It is also suffering under severe U.S. sanctions.\nSyrians rushed to stock up on food and fuel Monday amid fears that authorities would resort to even stricter measures after reporting the first coronavirus infection in the country, where the health-care system has been decimated by nearly a decade of civil war.\u00a0Authorities said border crossings with Lebanon and Jordan would close at midday.\u00a0\nThe arrival of the global pandemic in Syria has raised concerns it could run rampant in some of the most vulnerable areas in the Middle East.\nLines formed outside grocery stores, banks and gas stations across the Syrian capital of\u00a0Damascus, as people braced for wider closures. The government has already closed restaurants, caf\u00e9s and other businesses, and has halted public transportation.\nThe city's Hamidiyeh souk, a network of covered markets running through the Old City, was deserted after the government ordered all shops closed on Sunday.\nAuthorities closed border crossings with Lebanon and Jordan, and Damascus International Airport was closed to commercial traffic after a final flight arrived from Moscow. State-run newspapers issued their last print edition and will only be available online.\nThe United Arab Emirates, home to the world's busiest international airport, said it was suspending all passenger flights for two weeks. Dubai's airport is a vital hub connecting Western nations with Asian countries and Australia, and suspending passenger\u00a0flights there affects travellers around the world.\nIndia said on Monday it will shut down domestic flights to halt the spread of coronavirus and imposed a curfew on a giant state as the number of people dying of the disease ticked up across densely populated south Asia. India has reported 415 cases of the coronavirus but health experts have warned that a big jump could be imminent, which would overwhelm the underfunded and crumbling public health infrastructure.\n"}]
