A similar thing occurred at his previous place, and it's happening to so many renters in Charlottetown that a new term has been born: Renoviction.\nCharlottetown is a prime example of the scarce vacancies and spiraling costs facing renters in communities across the country.\n\"It's getting ridiculous,\" Gallant says of the rental market. \"Prices have doubled pretty much, and that boils back to supply and demand. They know there's nothing here, [so landlords] jack up the price.\"\nCost of living is a big election issue, a\u00a0CBC\u00a0News-commissioned online\u00a0poll\u00a0from June suggests, and housing is the biggest single expense for most Canadians, according to Statistics Canada figures on annual household spending.\nAs the campaign has unfolded, the federal parties have begun to unveil plans on how they'd make life more affordable for voters.\nThe Liberals\u00a0aim to build 100,000 affordable housing units over a decade. They would also encourage home ownership through a first-time home-buyer incentive that subsidizes up to 10 per cent of the purchase of a new home and five per cent on resale homes \u2014 with restrictions.\u00a0\nThe NDP have a more ambitious plan, committing to build 500,000 affordable housing units in a decade.\nA central message of the Conservative campaign is that it wants people \"to\u00a0get ahead, not just get by,\" and that\u00a0the government needs to get its hand out of Canadians' pockets in areas like the carbon tax, which the party describes as ineffective. The Conservatives have\u00a0promised to ease building regulations to increase the housing supply,\u00a0and said\u00a0Monday that if elected the party\u00a0would change the maximum mortgage term, increasing it from 25 years to allow up to 30-year mortgages. It is also promising to review the \"stress test\" for first-time buyers applying for a mortgage.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe reality is that finding affordable housing is increasingly difficult in many parts of Canada.\nThe smallest provincial capital, Charlottetown, has one of the lowest rental vacancy rates in the country. It hovers just above zero per cent, new Kijiji listings last just minutes before apartments are snapped up, and renters complain about spending ever more of their limited dollars on housing.\nIt is an old axiom of financial planners that renters should never spend more than 30 per cent of their gross earnings on rent and utilities. In Charlottetown, low income renters (those earning less than $21,361) spend on average 62 per cent of their earnings on housing.\nThe numbers get only marginally better when income levels increase.\nData gathered by the Canadian Rental Housing Index shows that Toronto renters earning as much as $45,498 a year are dedicating 40 per cent of their earnings to monthly housing costs. Live outside the downtown core, in York or Peel region, and those middle income earners are paying an average of per cent 44 and 38 per cent respectively.\u00a0\nIn Regina, low-income renters spend more than half their pre-tax earnings on rent and utilities. In Calgary it's 62 per cent, and 91 per cent in Vancouver.\nThis may help to explain why so many adult children are returning to live with their parents even after they've entered the workforce, or why many young adults choose to have roommates to defray living costs.\nCheck out your region's costs and compare it to others on the Rental Housing Index\nAcross Canada, it's not simply a question of how much accommodation costs, but also about keeping up with the need for more places to live.\nIn 2018, there were 37,000 new apartments built nationwide, but demand increased by 50,000 units, according to tracking done by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nAnd Canadian cities continue to grow, driven by factors such as immigration and stronger job numbers.\nWith housing-related problems rising and the cost of living a primary issue for Canadian voters, Charlottetown Mayor Philip Brown figures political party leaders in the midst of a federal election campaign should be talking more about it. When he was elected last year, he describes how he used a congratulatory phone call from the Prime Minister to drive home his top priority.\n\"We have a problem with affordable and accessible housing,\" Brown says he told Justin Trudeau on a call shortly after his election as mayor in November 2018. \"We need more public spending from the provincial and federal governments to up the supply of affordable and accessible housing.\"\nEach community has its own housing challenges, and one of the big ones for Charlottetown is that short-term rentals for the city's giant tourism industry suck up a lot of housing stock.\u00a0\nAnother is house prices \u2014\u00a0Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) data shows they've jumped 38.5 per cent in the past three years alone in P.E.I.'s capital. By comparison, prices rose 25.3 per cent in Toronto, 21.6 in Ottawa and 33.3 in Victoria. A market where buyers get into bidding wars is new for Canada's smallest province, which recently surpassed 153,000 residents, and it's persuading some landlords to sell.\nAdded to that, the province's population is growing, with people moving to P.E.I. from other nations and parts of Canada on both a permanent and temporary basis. The University of P.E.I. hasn't built a new residence in 14 years, for example, while its student population has increased by about a third. There have been significant increases in the number of students on campus requiring housing, with half now coming from out of province or out of country.\n\"And that, in turn, is pushing more demand on downtown housing,\" Brown explains.\nHolland College student Sierra Elkerton was debating whether she could even afford to stay in school\u00a0after she was evicted by her landlord because the building was not up to code. She managed to find a new apartment, but for nearly double the monthly rent.\n\"Realistically I don't want to pay that, but it looks like I'm going to have to,\" says Elkerton. \"The cost of living is way too high considering it's such a small city.\"\nShe's not alone. A global survey by money manager BlackRock Inc. found \"many Canadians feel that they are in a financial squeeze \u2014\u00a0hard pressed to save amid what they perceive as a high cost of living, including devoting much of their income to paying for their homes.\"\nCanadians who responded to the poll said they spend an average of 43 per cent of their income on housing \u2014\u00a0whether renting or owning.\u00a0\nAmong the 20 countries surveyed, only the Netherlands and Sweden had higher housing costs, at 51 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.\nCharlottetown's mayor is well aware of the numbers. In his community, he's most focused on trying to help the people who find themselves paying more than they can afford \u2014\u00a0and those who can't find anything at all.\n\"We may be a small city,\" he says,\u00a0\"but we've got big city problems.\"\nThe mayor says he would like to hear commitments from party leaders this election cycle to use the big federal wallet to help cities build more affordable housing.\n\"I got two calls this past week and one visit to the office,\" Brown says. \"From a woman who was living in her car in the Walmart parking lot, and another woman that's been in [a shelter] now for almost a month and she needs a place to live.\"\nWatch The National's story about what it's like to live in a 'severely unaffordable' Canadian city:\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Toronto area housing sales up 24.3% in July, prices rise due to tighter supply", "description": "Overall average selling price for properties in GTA was $806,755", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-home-sales-1.5237143", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5237166.1565368546!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/luxury-home-report-20181023.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 06, 2019 9:25 AM ET", "2019-08-09T16:36:32.577Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Greater Toronto Area's home price index was up 4.4 per cent last month as the supply of properties for sale tightened and the number of sales jumped 24.3 per cent from July last year, the Toronto Real Estate Board reports.\nThe overall average selling price for properties in the Greater Toronto Area was up 3.2 per cent year-over-year to $806,755, TREB said in a monthly report issued Tuesday.\nThe number of properties sold increased to 8,595 from 6,916, with sales of all four categories of housing up by double digits.\n\"Broadly speaking, increased competition between buyers for available properties has resulted in relatively strong price growth above the rate of inflation for semi-detached houses, townhouses and condominium apartments,\" Jason Mercer, the real estate board's chief market analyst, said in a statement.\nOn the other hand, he said, sales of fully detached homes have been more affected by a stress test required for federally regulated mortgages and the average price for that category of housing was down 0.9 per cent overall.\nIn the City of Toronto itself, the average price for fully detached homes fell 9.1 per cent to $1.23 million, offsetting a 2.5 per cent increase in the surrounding 905 area to an average of $929,633.\nTREB says that the supply of properties for sale in the Greater Toronto Area was also tighter than it was last year.\nThere were 14,393 new listings in the GTA during the month, up from 13,873 in July 2018, but the total number of active listings at the end of July was down 9.1 per cent from a year ago.\nTREB CEO John DiMichele said there's a growing demand for residential properties due to population growth.\n\"As more and more households come to terms with the stress test and move back into the market in the coming months and years, they could suffer from a chronically under-supplied marketplace and an acceleration of home price growth to unsustainable levels,\" DiMichele predicted.\n\"Fortunately, policy makers have acknowledged the housing supply issue and are working toward solutions.\"\nThe board said it welcomes a move by Toronto Mayor John Tory and the city council, which instructed staff to report on ways to increase housing options in neighbourhoods that traditionally have had single-family dwellings.\nTREB also said it supports provincial government consultations to \"spur on and speed up\" the development of different forms of housing.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Meghan McCabe", "title": "St. John's housing prices will lead country in growth, according to Moody's", "description": "Economist says below-trend prices, drop in unemployment rate leading to predicted increase", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/st-johns-housing-prices-going-up-moodys-1.5149461", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5146804.1558629790!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-sale-regina-sask-housing-market-home-house-remax.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 25, 2019 6:00 PM NT", "2019-05-26T11:26:15.806Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "For homeowners in St. John's\u00a0it may seem like a long time coming, but Moody's Analytics is projecting housing prices to increase\u00a0by more than six per cent over the next few years\u00a0and lead the country in growth.\u00a0\nThere are two main reasons for the projected rise: how low house prices are, and the improving unemployment rate, said director and head housing economist\u00a0Andres Carbacho-Burgos.\u00a0\nThe first is where house prices sit, compared with the $340,000 mark for single family homes in late 2015.\u00a0\n\"Now they're at less than $300,000.

To address all of those challenges, the Liberals announced $1.7 billion in funding for wells in April as part of a\u00a0relief package\u00a0that also included new assistance to help firms reduce carbon\u00a0emissions.\nEnvironmentalists seemed to approve. So did\u00a0Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. But demands for more help\u00a0persisted.\nWhen the Trudeau government announced this week a program to provide loans to large and medium-sized employers (including oil and gas producers),\u00a0it said that any borrowing would come with conditions \u2014 including a requirement to \"publish annual climate-related disclosure reports \u2026 including how their future operations will support environmental sustainability and national climate goals.\"\nProponents of climate disclosure \u2014\u00a0among them Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of Canada \u2014 have called on firms to publicly account for how their business will be affected in future by both government policies to reduce emissions and the actual impacts of climate change. In theory, such disclosures would push investors to push\u00a0companies\u00a0to make environmentally sound decisions.\nIn 2015, the Financial Stability Board, an international body established by the G20, launched a task force on climate disclosure\u00a0chaired by Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. That task force came back with\u00a0recommendations in 2017. Last June, the Liberal government's own expert panel on \"sustainable finance\" \u2014\u00a0chaired by Tiff Macklem, recently appointed governor of the Bank of Canada \u2014 advised the government to \"define and pursue a Canadian approach to implementing\" those recommendations.\nMany companies already provide\u00a0some level of climate disclosure \u2014 a study by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada in 2019 found that 98 per cent of firms included some degree of disclosure\u00a0in their financial filings. But just one company in the CPA survey was meeting the task force's proposed standards.\nThis week's announcement might help kick-start that change.\nAttaching such a condition no doubt also\u00a0makes it easier politically\u00a0to sell the pandemic loans policy to voters leery of using public funds to support large corporations, particularly oil and gas producers.\nBut the Liberals are promising to apply other conditions related to things like executive pay, collective bargaining agreements\u00a0and dividends. Such things might\u00a0seem like simple due diligence when dispersing public funds, but climate change also now seems to qualify\u00a0as a fundamental consideration.\nThe Liberals should\u00a0consider taking advantage of other opportunities to push for change, said Stewart Elgie, founder and chair of the Smart Prosperity Institute.\n\"Climate disclosure is one good way of accelerating the shift to a climate-smart economy,\" he said. \"They should also be looking for ways to tie economic relief to improved environmental performance.\"\nAs an example, Elgie cites the bailout of the North American automotive industry in 2009, which President Barack Obama's administration in the United States used to push for higher fuel efficiency standards.\nThe result was an industry that is arguably both more competitive and more environmentally friendly.\nAs the extent of the economic damage caused by COVID-19 has become clear, there have been calls to pursue a \"green recovery\" \u2014 for governments to focus their rebuilding efforts and economic stimulus on combating climate change. That remains the single largest opportunity here for driving some much-needed changes.\nBut it's also not clear yet\u00a0when governments will be able to start pursuing recovery plans. Canada is still in the emergency phase, and individuals and businesses need aid to get through the current crisis.\nEven in the short-term, though, there will be chances to to deal with the climate threat \u2014 which will still be with us once the pandemic has passed.\nIn a recent white paper, policy analysts and consultants Ralph Torrie and Celine Bak proposed a $2 billion fund to help cities establish \"permanent corridors \u2026 for people walking and cycling to work and school, while maintaining physical distancing.\" In the midst of a pandemic, such routes would give some people safer ways\u00a0to get\u00a0around. In the long term, maintaining those corridors would promote environmentally friendly transit.\nBrendan Haley, policy director at Efficiency Canada, has suggested that efforts to increase\u00a0the energy efficiency of homes and business can still be pursued during a time of physical distancing \u2014 such as\u00a0online training for \"green building skills\" and virtual energy assessments.\nHaley also emphasizes the need to plan now so that governments and businesses can be ready to move when it's time to start implementing a recovery plan. Elgie\u00a0also notes that updated building codes \u2014\u00a0currently being developed by the National Research Council \u2014 could help frame future stimulus spending on housing.\nThe Liberals also promised last fall to develop climate change accountability legislation that would set legally binding targets and establish third-party oversight \u2014 a promise that shouldn't necessarily be sidelined by a pandemic.\nThough COVID-19 clearly has\u00a0become a historic crisis, the Liberals are still faced with a political and moral imperative to deal with climate change. Justin Trudeau's government might be defined by how it handles this virus and its effects, but it's unlikely to be excused, either by\u00a0its supporters or by historians, if the threat to the planet\u00a0is forgotten in the process.\nSetting aside budget plans might have been necessary. But 2050 \u2014 the year when Canada is supposed to reach net-zero emissions \u2014 isn't getting any further away.\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "Time to buy?

Bidding wars are still occurring and it remains a sellers' market for condos under $700,000 and detached homes around $1.6 million, whereas the market for more expensive homes tends\u00a0to favour buyers. \u00a0\nSo far, there hasn't been a lot of panic or forced selling, but I believe that could change in the fall.\nWhen trying to forecast where the market is heading, there are two variables that I will be closely monitoring \u2014 the post COVID-19 employment numbers and the expansion or\u00a0introduction of new government programs created to combat the financial effects of the pandemic.\u00a0\nA low unemployment rate does wonders for real estate valuations as it is an indicator that the economy is functioning well. Strong economies attract new investments, businesses, immigrants, temporary workers, international students, refugees \u2014 all of which increases demand for housing\u00a0and results in higher rents and house prices.\u00a0\nA weak economy does the opposite. People will not move here unless they think they can find a job, while recently laid off workers with few ties to Vancouver may leave. In other words, we see less demand and more supply.\nAccording to Moody's analytics, for every one\u00a0per cent increase in unemployment, house prices typically drop about 4 per cent. Based on this ratio, if our unemployment rate were to double from pre-COVID-19 levels, home values would drop by roughly 20 per cent.\nThe main reason house prices are not currently dropping is due to government intervention.\u00a0The various levels of government\u00a0stepped in with a series of temporary programs to replace or subsidize the income of those affected by COVID-19. They also arranged for many of our expenses to be deferred \u2014 such as utility bills, taxes and mortgage payments. All these programs have bought struggling homeowners some time, and have taken the pressure off to sell their homes.\u00a0\nBut what happens when the safety nets disappear? That is when the ill-prepared or vulnerable homeowners will be forced to sell. \u00a0Many of the government programs are expected to wind down in the summer and\u00a0fall, and we may see a spike in new listings \u2014 a great time for buyers but terrible for sellers.\nIf I had plans to sell my home sometime in\u00a02020 or early 2021, I would be listing my home sooner rather than later. While I'm not expecting a 20 per cent drop in value over the short term, it also wouldn't surprise me if it did happen.\u00a0I also wouldn't be surprised if the government bailed out the housing market and valuations returned to all time highs. The B.C. government's tax base is heavily reliant on the construction and housing industries,\u00a0so they can't afford to have housing valuations drop too low. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile I'm very cautious on real estate over the short term, I still think it's a solid long-term investment.\nMy advice to prospective buyers, if valuations drop by 15 to 30 per cent in 2020 or early 2021, consider leaving the sidelines as it could be the buying opportunity that many of you have been waiting for.\nIf you have a COVID-19-related story we should pursue that affects British Columbians, please email us at\u00a0impact@cbc.ca\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "How should Ottawa grow?

Those involved in the development industry\u00a0argued that not increasing the supply of land for home building\u00a0would drive house prices sky high, putting them\u00a0further\u00a0out of reach for young people and new Canadians.\nLand prices have tripled since the city decided to hold the urban boundary back in 2010,\u00a0said Kevin Murphy of Mattamy Homes.\n\"You're right on the cusp of unaffordable housing,\" added Andrew Brethour, a realtor who advises\u00a0builders.\nBut other costs matter beyond the price of a house, such as\u00a0transportation or proximity to social services, argued community organizations.\u00a0\nDr. Eugenie Waters, for instance, said she has patients who are seniors who travel from the suburbs to her clinic.\n\"I really worry about us falling into this trap that it's more affordable for people to move out to the ... new suburbs, and there won't be the social services out there.\"\u00a0\nMany presenters also wanted the city to show\u00a0far\u00a0more details about how much each of the three scenarios set out\u00a0would cost the city in infrastructure, and the implications for its climate change goals.\nIn order to absorb tens of thousands more people in existing neighbourhoods, staff recommend building a lot more shorter, multi-unit complexes instead of relying solely on controversial high-rises. These lower-rise buildings could be made of wood instead of concrete, which is more expensive.\nArchitect Rosaline Hill agreed with the city planning staff's vision. She argued that the entire city should be intensified in this manner, with the first\u00a0focus on areas that are the easiest to make\u00a0walkable, such as those near transit.\nThat may mean many established communities, or what Coun. Jeff Leiper called the \"bungalow belt\" neighbourhoods within the Greenbelt, could see change soon.\nBut Josh Kardish of EQ Homes said while those older areas were \"ripe\" for mid-rise and infill, he questionned whether the city could build enough housing for an additional 400,000 people without apartment towers.\nThe meeting opened Monday with a motion by Coun. Eli El-Chantiry to protect prime farmland to disqualify\u00a0any properties on the city's\u00a0formal \"agricultural resource areas\" list to be included in the urban boundary.\nMembers of Just Food say that still leave open the possibility for development on\u00a0some farms, like those outside the officially designated areas or land with poorer soils where animals graze.\nThe group\u00a0called on councillors to tweak the motion further so that it captures all land used for agriculture, so that no more farmland becomes housing.\nEven staff's projection methods for how it calculated\u00a0the how much additional\u00a0lands will be needed\u00a0came under fire.\nIt turns out, city staff used a different\u00a0definition for how much intensification this city is achieving. Recently, the City of Ottawa was hitting 50 per cent intensification, far exceeding the 40 per cent goal in its official plan.\u00a0\nBut for this boundary discussion\u00a0staff said it makes more sense not to count collective housing for seniors or students. The \"goalposts had moved,\" as the Greater Ottawa Home Builders' Association tried to explain it. That dropped Ottawa's\u00a0current intensification rate to just 38 per cent.\nMichael Wolfson, former assistant chief statistician at Statistics Canada now with the University of Ottawa, said he was \"baffled\" the city would omit retirement homes.\u00a0\nCity staff also said in its\u00a0report it\u00a0had no real data on the resale housing market, so the number of households they expect Ottawa to need might be high. Wolfson said that data exists and is \"critical\".\u00a0\n\"I'm afraid that the information provided to you by staff \u2026 is seriously inadequate for you, and for\u00a0citizens like myself,\" said Wolfson.\n"}, {"author": "Darren Bernhardt", "title": "M\u00e9tis raise flag above newly purchased Bank of Montreal building at Portage and Main", "description": "'It's like retracing and actually capturing a lot of our history': Manitoba Metis Federation president", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/m%c3%a9tis-portage-main-bank-montreal-heritage-1.5565955", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5566303.1589313638!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bank-of-montreal-building-in-winnipeg-new-manitoba-metis-federat.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 12, 2020 3:10 PM CT", "2020-05-12T21:15:27.181Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As Manitobans celebrate the 150th anniversary of the province, descendants of the\u00a0M\u00e9tis\u00a0who paved the way for its creation are celebrating a renewed and prominent presence.\nThe\u00a0Manitoba Metis Federation flag was raised high above\u00a0the Bank of Montreal building at Portage Avenue and Main Street on Tuesday after the organization announced late Monday that it was buying the historic downtown Winnipeg landmark, which will become home to the M\u00e9tis Nation Heritage Centre.\u00a0\nWATCH | Historic day for the MMF\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b:\n\"[We're] sending a message loud and clear that the M\u00e9tis played a very important role in this province and we still do, even after 150 years of sometimes turmoil with this country and sometimes with this province.

It was officially\u00a0enacted on July\u00a015,\u00a01870.\nThe act was based on a list of rights\u00a0drafted\u00a0by Louis Riel and his M\u00e9tis provisional government and presented to the federal government as conditions for the province to enter Confederation.\n\"[It was] led by the only Indigenous peoples in Canada to ever negotiate a province into\u00a0Confederation,\" Chartrand said.\nThe Bank of Montreal, built in 1913, stands just a 15-minute walk from where Fort Garry once stood, jutting out over what's now\u00a0Main Street at Assiniboine Avenue.\nAt the end of 1869, Riel and others took control of the fort and took over the administration of the Red River area until an agreement was reached with Ottawa.\n\"So there's no doubt in our mind \u2026 the footprints of our ancestors walked through this area,\" Chartrand said.\nHe's been inundated with texts,\u00a0calls and emails from people in the M\u00e9tis\u00a0community, he said.\n\"Over and over it's about just how proud our people are that this is happening.\u00a0Everybody knows the historic significance of that location, right by the Red River. Of course we were called, at one time, the Red River M\u00e9tis.\"\nAs part of the Manitoba Act, the federal government promised to set aside 5,565 square kilometres of land along the Red and Assiniboine\u00a0rivers\u00a0\u2014 which meet at The Forks near Portage and Main\u00a0\u2014 for 7,000 children of the Red River M\u00e9tis. However,\u00a0the government failed to follow through and most\u00a0of that land was never provided.\nIncreasing numbers of settlers and\u00a0land fraud\u00a0due to uncontrolled speculation\u00a0forced many M\u00e9tis to leave, in hopes of making a\u00a0living elsewhere.\nIn 1981, the MMF began a land claim case against the federal government for the\u00a01.4 million acres it was promised.\nIn 2018, the federation\u00a0was finally\u00a0awarded $154 million in compensation.\n\"I think it's going to lift a lot of eyebrows up: 'What's going on here? The M\u00e9tis, where are they coming from? All of a sudden they're coming and buying some historic, some really landmark locations?'\" Chartrand said about the purchases the MMF is now making.\nThe Bank of Montreal\u00a0\"is just one,\" he said. An announcement could be coming next week for another location in the downtown area and \"it's bigger than Portage and Main,\" he said.\n\"As they say in the movies, we're baaa-aack.\"\nWhen Chartrand became MMF president in\u00a01997, he stood at the corner of Portage and Main, waving the\u00a0M\u00e9tis\u00a0Nation flag.\n\"I remember saying 'One day, this will be ours,'\" he said. \"And I've made statements in the past that if we've got to buy our land back one acre at\u00a0a time, we'll do that.\"\nThe MMF has been in\u00a0negotiations with\u00a0BMO Financial Group for some time and it was difficult to keep it quiet, Chartrand said.\nThe Bank of Montreal announced plans last fall that it would be moving across the street into the office tower at 201 Portage Ave.\u00a0\nChartrand wouldn't reveal the purchase price, saying only that both sides reached a number they appreciated.\n\"Eventually that number will come out.

An estimated 1,230 structures were damaged.\u00a0\nThe last evacuation orders were lifted late Saturday but it may be weeks before people can truly return home.\u00a0\nMany homes swamped by flooding remain uninhabitable.

It's set to become operational in 2021.\nThe centre handles 911 calls, calls from the public and handles dispatches for 54 detachments and districts.\nAccording to an RCMP internal report, the\u00a0RCMP added $1.6 million to Millbrook First Nation's proposal and put down zero rent for its preferred option \u2014 the\u00a0headquarters in Dartmouth.\n\"Millbrook First Nation\u00a0provided a proposal in good faith, but we now know that the competition was falsely stacked,\" wrote Chief Robert Gloade in a March 25 letter to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair requesting a re-do of the contract process.\n\"Obviously the first competition was tainted in favour of one outcome.\u00a0Millbrook First Nation is asking that this competition be repeated but performed by an objective assessment team with no predetermined outcome.\"\nCopies of the\u00a0letter were sent to Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller and Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett.\nBlair's\u00a0office referred questions to the RCMP, as did Bennett and Miller's spokespeople.\u00a0\nNova Scotia\u00a0RCMP\u00a0said the decision to relocate the communications centre to Dartmouth was the result of \"months of follow-up work\" that came to the best conclusion.\u00a0\n\"Our focus during the study and throughout the decision-making process was on the health and safety of our employees, operational requirements and fiscal responsibility,\" it said\u00a0in an emailed statement.\nThe RCMP reviewed six options before deciding on its headquarters, according to an internal 2017 report obtained under the Access to Information Act by former Liberal MP Bill Casey and provided to CBC News.\u00a0\nThose options included doing nothing, upgrading the existing Truro centre, moving to a new location in the city, building a new location in the city or moving the centre to Millbrook First Nation.\u00a0\nMillbrook's proposal was the second cheapest relocation option, behind the headquarters move. However, the RCMP report assigned an extra $1.6 million to every relocation except its headquarters option.\u00a0\nThe figure is based on how much the Mounties pay the federal Public Works department every year to maintain empty space in their headquarters that could be rented to other federal agencies.\u00a0\nThe RCMP also assigned zero rent to its headquarters option. Yet, according to Public Works records provided by Casey to CBC News, the cost of rental space in the building housing its headquarters is $547 per square metre\u00a0and total current annual rent is $10.5 million.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The process wasn't a fair process,\" said Gloade in an interview.\nMillbrook First Nation sits about five kilometres south of Truro in the geographic centre of the province. It proposed to place the emergency communications centre in the Millbrook First Nation Power Centre, which is on a high priority power grid that runs underground and also serves a hospital a kilometre away.\u00a0\nGloade said the advantages were many with his community's proposal. He said the existing employees at the Truro centre would not have to move to keep their jobs and there is lots of room for expansion in the commercial building.\nMillbrook already acts as the base for Nova Scotia Power whenever major natural events cause widespread power outages, Gloade said.\u00a0It also hosts an Onex Solutions Inc. data centre that holds data from the provincial education department and its cannabis operations, he said.\nCasey, who didn't run for re-election but raised the issue repeatedly while in Parliament, said the RCMP wanted the centre placed at its headquarters in Dartmouth and manipulated the competition to get their predetermined outcome.\n\"They cheated Millbrook First Nation out of a chance at this,\" said Casey.\nCasey said there were major problems with the RCMP's\u00a0selection process.\nThe RCMP's ranking chart for each of the six main options was based on seven categories using a three rating system \u2014 zero if it didn't meet standards, five if it met minimum standards and 10 if it met or surpassed standards, according to the 2017 report.\u00a0\nThe seven categories were: health and safety,\u00a0consolidation of resources, functionality of accommodations, financial impact, human resource sustainability, level of disruption and\u00a0potential for expansion.\nThe RCMP headquarters option rated 10s across the board.\nMillbrook's proposal rated a five on financial impact \u2014 primarily on the added $1.6 million, plus rent; a five on human resource sustainability, meaning the ability to staff the centre from the local population and a zero on ability to expand.\nIt scored an overall rating equal to the options of relocating to another building in Truro or constructing a new facility in the city \u2014 but at a cheaper overall price, according to the report.\u00a0\nCasey questioned why the First Nation proposal would rate so low on human resource sustainability since the centre in Truro has maintained its staffing for over a decade and all its employees would not have to relocate.\u00a0\nHe also challenged the low rating on ability to expand when the centre would be placed in a nearly vacant commercial building.\u00a0\nCasey said the move to RCMP headquarters would also potentially put people at risk in Nova Scotia.\nThe decision to move the centre to the Mounties' Nova Scotia headquarters would place it about 10 kilometres from the Halifax Regional Police's own communications facility.\u00a0\nA 2004 RCMP report that initially led to the centralizing of communications at the centre in Truro specifically recommended against placing it in Halifax because it posed a risk that one event could\u00a0undermine the communication centres\u00a0of both the regional police and the RCMP.\u00a0\nSeveral emergency organizations, including the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, recommend placing emergency operations centres in separate locations.\n\"To me it became a safety issue for all of Nova Scotia,\" said Casey.\nThe Nova Scotia RCMP said in a statement that it has contingency plans should an event undermine its communications centre once it's moved to Dartmouth. The statement said these continuity plans passed a third-party review.\n\"Contingency plan for 'H' Division RCMP includes a back-up RCMP [communications centre] located outside of the [Halifax Regional Municipality] and portable equipment that would allow us to restart operations should both the primary and back-up [centre] be non-operational,\" said the statement.\nThe 2017 report made no mention of the 2004 recommendation in its ranking of potential sites.\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "Ottawa has 80,000 more suburban houses in its future.

As her family grew over the years, they moved from one new development to another, seeking new home features and upgrading their garage. It was a \"bad habit,\"\u00a0she now says.\nHomes on the fringes of the city are as popular as ever. People line up when a builder releases a new block of housing\u00a0to lay money on a unit.\nBut city planners and politicians alike know\u00a0that growth comes at a cost\u00a0\u2014 pipes, transit, greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0\u2014 and have talked for years about growing in a more compact way, and\u00a0packing more homes into existing areas to limit those downsides.\u00a0\nYet, in a big report to be debated at a virtual city committee meeting May 11, city staff say what's realistic is to expand the urban boundary to allow\u00a0an extra\u00a023,300 homes at the fringes of the suburbs by 2046. That's\u00a0on top of the\u00a066,300 units already in the pipeline.\nSome 88 per cent of those yet-to-be-built units\u00a0would be houses that fit one family, with their own\u00a0front door. The rest would be apartment units.\nCoun. Jeff Leiper was shocked city staff would recommend adding so much land \u2014\u00a0the 1,281 hectares designated for new urban areas is bigger than his entire ward of Kitchissippi.\nHe's also disappointed by the\u00a0calculations staff have done, saying it appears they've based the need\u00a0for future land\u00a0on the housing trends of the past. Leiper wants the urban-rural divide to stay where it is.\n\"If we're going to be sustainable, if we are going to have 15-minute neighbourhoods, if we're going to have affordable public transit, if we're going to keep our taxes as low as possible, then we can't just give in to market demand for single-family homes,\" Leiper said. His ward in the core is the epicentre for new highrise towers and pricey infill developments.\nBut Ottawa's mayor agrees with city staff, who say holding the urban boundary\u00a0is too ambitious.\u00a0\n\"[That's] easier said than done. You've seen some real battles over the years. Everyone talks a good line about intensification, but when it's in their community\u00a0they're against it. There are dozens of examples,\"\u00a0Jim Watson said.\nWatson calls the scenario staff prefer a \"balanced approach.\" Ottawa's population is projected to rise by 400,000\u00a0to 1.4 million people by 2046, and the city\u00a0sees splitting the projected 195,000 more households it would\u00a0need almost evenly between\u00a0existing built-up areas\u00a0and undeveloped parcels.\u00a0\nThe city\u00a0can't risk supplying insufficient space\u00a0for the expected homes. The Ontario government requires Ottawa\u00a0show it has enough.\nThat's not to say the scenario\u00a0staff propose doesn't call for much more intensification than happens now. It does. By 2046, 42,700 more apartments, as well as 49,400 single-detached, semi-detached\u00a0and row homes could elbow into\u00a0existing Ottawa neighbourhoods\nStaff have even worked with a local architectural firm on\u00a0a new kind of structure that\u00a0might help meet the needs of\u00a0Ottawa families\u00a0while building a city that's more dense:\u00a0the \"613 flat.\"\nThat is, six-rooms and\u00a0three bedrooms per unit in short buildings that blend in with\u00a0their neighbours. It offers the elusive \"missing middle\" style of housing \u2014 neither a house, nor a highrise apartment.\nThe problem, staff write, is\u00a0it takes time to create policies, and more time yet to get\u00a0the building industry and housing market to shift to building a new kind of lifestyle, and\u00a0at the right price people can afford.\nA planner who studies how cities grow and change says a big reason families\u00a0especially\u00a0keep flocking to the suburbs is that North American cities have\u00a0not been very successful at delivering them exactly these kinds of options.\n\"Most of our cities have done either really high density in the centre, or quite low density in the form of single-detached dwellings,\" said Markus Moos, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo's school of planning. \"So if you're looking for green space immediately outside your home, single-detached dwellings are often the only affordable alternative.\"\nOn the one hand, governments\u00a0have to be sure they give neighbourhoods\u00a0the good transit, amenities and green space they need, Moos said. Ideally, before a new development\u00a0is built, so as not to lock in car-centric habits.\nBeyond that, Moos said\u00a0better ideas are needed to make sure people consider the full cost of where they choose to live.\nHe points to the idea of \"location-efficient mortgages\"\u00a0\u2014 financing incentives for homebuyers who are less reliant on their cars.\nAnd then there's mindset.\u00a0\n\"I would like to call for a cultural shift. We don't need to have a backyard in order to raise our kids. We don't have to live in a house,\" said\u00a0Naama Blonder, an architect with Smart Density in Toronto\nBlonder contributed to that city's policy for how to make highrise towers more family-friendly. Many newcomers to Canada come from countries where dense living is the norm, she noted. Buildings here just need to have families in mind: units with enough bedroom space and room for a stroller, as well as\u00a0common areas for teens to do homework.\nAnd, Blonder added, when battles about new highrise proposals happen, focus less on how tall a building could be, and more on pushing for a great street-level vibe and pathways that connect people to transit and parks.\nIn the meantime, families continue to\u00a0choose Ottawa's far-flung suburbs because they're affordable. They also like the newness, lack of maintenance\u00a0and, sometimes, having space for multiple generations to live under one roof,\u00a0said Deborah Burgoyne, president of the Ottawa Real Estate Board.\nBut subdivisions themselves are changing slowly, and many look\u00a0nothing like the\u00a0big lots on winding crescents of old.\u00a0New\u00a0suburbs are more compact. When the city issued a record number of building permits in 2018, more were for semis and stacked townhomes\u00a0than for single-detached models. Some apartment buildings are going up.\n\"Toodle around and you won't believe\u00a0what's out there now,\" Burgoyne said.\nAs for Lecours, she still loves her community in Orl\u00e9ans, she just wishes there were more small coffee shops and\u00a0community gardens, and more housing choices for renters\u00a0and downsizing seniors.\n\"If they plan properly, I think it is OK to expand,\" she said.\u00a0\"But it has to be done in a way where it serves the people.\"\n"}, {"author": "Joanne Chianello", "title": "The urban boundary debate is vitally important, so should it happen online?", "description": "Monday's virtual committee meeting a test of untried process at city hall", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/urban-boundary-untested-committee-format-1.5561471", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3314590.1580407926!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ottawa-city-council-table-in-andrew-haydon-hall.JPG", "publishedAt": ["May 09, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-05-09T08:00:00.484Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "There have been many firsts in Ottawa's municipal arena during these\u00a0COVID-19 days, from virtual council meetings to Zoom news conferences to online community open houses.\u00a0\nOn Friday, the latest \"first\" came from Ecology Ottawa and a number of other groups, which held an online rally\u00a0to call for holding the urban boundary steady.\u00a0\nAs far as rallies go, it lacked chanted slogans and crowds waving\u00a0placards. But while it didn't have the visual and audible impact an offline rally might, it did\u00a0attract\u00a0more than 500 people. Who can remember the last time an in-person rally attracted that many people to city hall?\nThe rally is in advance of one of the most important firsts ever at city hall\u00a0\u2014 a major policy debate Monday that will occur\u00a0online, with\u00a0public delegations phoning in their comments.\nThe once-in-a-decade issue is the urban boundary expansion, a policy decision that will literally affect the growth of this city for decades to come.\u00a0\nThe crux of the argument is this: the city says we need to add 181,000 homes to the city in the next 25 years or so.\nThe hold-the-liners want those new homes to be accommodated in existing neighbourhoods and on empty land already\u00a0approved for residential development.\nThe city's planners\u00a0\u2014 and Mayor Jim Watson\u00a0\u2014 don't believe residents\u00a0or builders are prepared for the sort of change communities would undergo if the\u00a0boundary remained steady. Instead, they're advocating to add\u00a0up to 1,650 hectares to Ottawa's\u00a0urban edges.\nMore than 23,000 new homes would be built in these newly urbanized\u00a0areas.\nAnd home builders have suggested that even 1,650 hectares won't be enough to absorb Ottawa's growing population, which the city forecasts at 1.4 million by 2046.\nAdd in serious questions about\u00a0housing affordability\u00a0\u2014 there are many points of contention\u00a0about how, or even if,\u00a0border expansion affects house prices\u00a0\u2014 plus rising infrastructure costs in a spreading\u00a0city, some communities'\u00a0unwillingness to accept dramatic change, and whether expanding the urban boundary squares with the city's declaration\u00a0of a climate emergency, and you've got yourself one messy policy debate.\nIt's hard to imagine, then, why anyone thought the urban boundary debate would be the ideal test-case for something the city has never tried in its history.\nEveryone is figuring\u00a0out how to live with the COVID-19 pandemic, including city hall, where councillors have met for three virtual council meetings so far.\u00a0\nThey went fine, but the public isn't allowed to participate at council the way they are at committee. When council voted in late March to\u00a0allow virtual committee meetings, it directed staff to figure out how to let the public speak, starting with the one on the urban boundary.\nThe rules for the virtual meeting will be\u00a0more stringent than in-person meetings. If you want to give your five-minute deputation, you have to register\u00a0online by 9 a.m. Monday, before the meeting starts. In so-called normal times, members of the public could\u00a0keep signing up to speak right through the meeting, until councillors began debating.\nAnd if you can't or are not inclined to register online, you could have done so by phone or email\u00a0\u2014but that deadline was Friday evening.\nThe mayor argued on CBC's Ottawa Morning this week\u00a0that sharing one's opinions virtually\u00a0actually makes it \"easier for the public to participate in the process, simply because you don't have to go and get daycare, you don't have to pay for parking or come down to city hall.\"\nHe may have a point: as of Friday evening, a whopping 150 people had signed up to speak\u00a0\u2014 and that's on top of the 150 who've already sent in written comments. The last time we saw that kind of action at city hall was for the Salvation Army debate, which spanned three exceedingly long days.\u00a0\nCoun. Shawn Menard, who's been\u00a0calling for the urban boundary to remain steady, said at\u00a0Friday's rally: \"This vote really\u00a0shouldn't be happening at this moment.\"\nHe argued more time is needed to question many\u00a0of the assumptions made in the staff recommendations, from the financial implications of expanding the boundary to the\u00a0declaration that the public wouldn't accept intensification.\nBut perhaps another reason the vote shouldn't happen is because it's a major policy decision being made in the most unusual times most of us have lived through.\u00a0\nYes, there's been a year of consultations.\u00a0 And the city says more than 45,000 people \"have been reached.\" The report's been out for three weeks\u00a0\u2014 longer than is legally required\u00a0\u2014 but during a time when we\u00a0are preoccupied with a dramatic and\u00a0stressful pandemic.\nThe city has argued that the urban boundary question\u00a0must be decided soon because it paves the way for other major policies that follow, including the official plan and transportation master plan updates. But city manager Steve Kanellakos mentioned recently the transportation plan work may have to be put off anyway, due to COVID-19 related constraints facing staff.\u00a0\nSo what's the rush?\nIn fact, there is no legal reason this decision needs to be made now. Council put off a byelection\u00a0for months, so it could certainly have given the public a bit more time to adjust to the COVID-19 reality,\u00a0to start paying attention to issues other than handwashing and physical distancing.\nAt the very least, it could have chosen a less vital issue with which to experiment with an untested democratic process.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Sask. not seeing same COVID-19 impacts on housing market as rest of country", "description": "'We were seeing a lot of buyer confidence in the beginning of the year': realtor", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/real-estate-market-regina-covid-19-1.5533914", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5013574.1579367230!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/digital-mortgages-20190210.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 16, 2020 5:00 AM CT", "2020-04-16T11:00:28.182Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The CEO of Royal Lepage says now is not the time to go out and shop for a new home \u2014 or sell.\nPhil Soper said 2020 was off to a \"boisterous\" start as more homes were selling in volume before a state of emergency was declared\u00a0in Saskatchewan four weeks ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"We believe that things will ease and people will be able to move into a very different buying and selling process,\" Soper told CBC Radio's\u00a0The Morning Edition.\n\"I'm not saying things will\u00a0return to normal in 2020, but the market will loosen up as people's\u00a0stay-at-home restrictions are lifted.\"\nSaskatchewan's housing market has not been negatively impacted to the extent of the rest of Canada about a month into the pandemic.\nHome sales fell 14.3 per cent in March nationally but the Canadian Real Estate Association says it is too early to determine the pandemic's effect on prices.\nSaskatchewan sales dipped 6.2 per cent on a year-over-year basis (March 2019 compared to March 2020) while prices dropped 5.1 per cent.\nThere were three more residential sales made between March 18\u00a0(421) than there were during the same time last year (418).\n\"We were seeing a lot of buyer confidence in the beginning of the year,\" said Brin Werrett, a realtor with Royal Lepage, of Regina's market.\n\"A lot of young buyers out pulling the trigger on houses, where last year, maybe they were a little bit hesitant.\"\nSales were down 6.2 per cent overall but the Saskatchewan Realtors Association says housing sales saw increases in several of the province's largest cities on a year-over-year basis.\nThere were 274 sales in Saskatoon last month, a six per cent increase.

Then came the coronavirus.\nBut while the pandemic has definitely put a damper on things, some homebuyers continue to buy, and some sellers continue to sell. Here's how they're doing it.\nDon Collins is trying to sell his four-bedroom, 2,400-square-foot\u00a0bungalow in Carp before moving to a new home in Manotick.\nHe put the house on the market just before the COVID-19 crisis, and is asking $779,000. There were a\u00a0few showings earlier in March, but those have now\u00a0dried up. He's had no offers, but he's not panicking. He hasn't lowered his price.\nCollins believes the bungalow, with an in-law suite on the main floor and another\u00a0unit\u00a0in the basement, would be perfect for families hoping to get elderly relatives out of long-term care homes, where the virus has taken hold.\n\"We're close to Almonte, and all I can think of is the people in the rest homes,\" he said. \"We're not in a rush to sell, but I think the house is of value to somebody.\"\nCollins said he hasn't decided on his next move, and the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic isn't helping.\n\"Leave it on the market\u00a0or take it off? At the end of the day, nobody knows where we're going to be in six\u00a0months.\"\nThat uncertainty is keeping many people out of the market at a time of year that's traditionally the busiest. But not everyone is lying low.\nTrinh Yogaratnam\u00a0and her husband had planned to list their semi-detatched home in Old Ottawa South at the end of March. They'd\u00a0already purchased a new home in the Glebe\u00a0with an August close date.\u00a0Then COVID-19 struck.\u00a0\n\"We decided maybe we should just hold off. But then \u2026\u00a0we realized that it wasn't just a pandemic. It might be a deep recession,\" she said.\nYogaratban said their realtor, Shan Cappuccino, told them\u00a0the market was \"still quite buoyant,\" so the couple\u00a0decided to go ahead.\u00a0\nThe house was listed\u00a0April 14. The family moved into an Airbnb rental\u00a0for a week while their realtor held showings\u00a0\u2014 following strict physical distancing protocols, of course.\u00a0Prospective buyers could also take a\u00a0virtual tour.\n\"We got offers,\" Yogaratnam said. \"We actually got six offers.\"\nThe house\u00a0sold April 21\u00a0for more than their asking price, with no conditions.\n\"I was shocked. I was pleasantly surprised,\" Yogaratnam\u00a0said. \"We were reading all the articles leading up to it seeing how the real estate market was kind of tanking and how home sales were decreasing. I realized very quickly that when you say home sales, it's not synonymous with home prices.\"\nShe said they have no regrets about forging ahead.\n\"It is a little bananas to be doing it during this time,\" she said. \"But on the other hand, there are still people looking. Some of the people that made offers on our place had already sold theirs. So there was desperation on their part to buy as well as [on] our part to sell.\"\n\"At the beginning, it was a complete shutdown,\" said\u00a0Ottawa realtor Gloria Yankowich.\nBut now, six weeks in, things are starting to change, she said, as buyers, sellers\u00a0and agents\u00a0figure\u00a0out creative ways to mitigate their risk through virtual tours and conditional sales.\n\"I\u00a0don't know how many of us in the past have bought a house sight unseen, but it is happening,\" Yankowich said.\nAccording to realtor Paddy McCarthy, agents\u00a0have been deemed essential so people can avoid \"financial catastrophe.\"\n\"Most people don't want to [list],\u00a0but there are people who don't have a choice,\" he said. \"In February, we might have received seven offers on a place. Now there's only two or three, but they're still selling.\"\nNevertheless, realtors know there could be lean times ahead, especially if the slowdown lingers into the summer.\n\"We work in a high-risk, high-reward industry,\" McCarthy said. \"There will be a lot of realtors leaving the industry\u00a0if they haven't set aside enough [savings] to weather this storm.\"\nRealtor Peggy Blair said she's also encountering clients who simply don't have a choice.\n\"I've met two people this week who are paramedics who are starting with the City of Ottawa, moving here from other centres. They have to find places to live,\" she said.\nBlair points out the Ottawa real estate market was \"superheated\" right up until the pandemic.\n\"We were already in a situation of \u2026 unprecedented tight inventory. It's simply gotten tighter because people who don't have to sell are not selling.\"\nAnd don't expect a COVID-19\u00a0discount, Blair warned.\n\"I have some prospective buyers ... who have been sitting on the fence\u00a0hoping that there will be bargains out there, and I have to keep telling them at this point there are no bargains,\" she said. \"I was involved in a multiple offer situation on Friday. That property sold for \u2026 $42,000 over asking. They had 12 offers. Pre-March 15, they probably would have had 30 offers.\"\nBlair was able to find a house for those paramedics. \"They're actually moving in this weekend,\" she said.\nListings have \"definitely dropped to a trickle,\" said\u00a0Deborah Burgoyne, president of the Ottawa Real Estate Board. \"Some people are actively out there trading, but I would say the majority of them are not.\"\nBurgoyne said the year was off to a great start before the pandemic.\n\"We had surpassed last year's numbers, and then starting the third and fourth week of March we started to decrease. And the first two weeks of April, we're significantly lower.\"\u00a0\nBurgoyne said despite that, she's not surprised some people are still buying homes.\n\"There was a real pent-up demand. There were a lot of people that couldn't get into the market. They were pursuing multiple properties and losing out for one reason or another.\"\u00a0\nThe pandemic might actually help some families looking to buy, Burgoyne said. \"You know what? Maybe I'll have a chance because there won't be 10 people pursuing this property. There will be three.\"\nThat's likely to continue the longer the pandemic goes on.\n\"If you're priced at market value, I still believe you're going to have a good return,\" she said. \"It's not a feeding frenzy the way it was.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jennifer La Grassa", "title": "Real estate association says Hamilton home sales crashed, local realtors disagree", "description": "The national realtors association says market should have seen 25 per cent more sales", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-housing-market-drops-1.5532953", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4277867.1505954738!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-sale-hamilton-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 20, 2020 1:39 PM ET", "2020-04-21T10:41:41.423Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Hamilton's housing market should have seen much higher sales than it did last month, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), but COVID-19 kept sellers at bay.\u00a0\nA\u00a0report\u00a0Wednesday from the national realtors association\u00a0says that in Hamilton-Burlington \"sales declined\"\u00a0 by 24.9 per cent from February to March, second only nationally\u00a0to Calgary, which saw a 26.3 per cent drop.

That housing is affiliated with the Red Lake homeless shelter.\n\"[The transitional housing is]\u00a0for individuals that are ready to start moving on, and so, it's part of the shelter program, but it's one step removed from having to be in a shelter,\" he said.\nThe program is successful, he said, with nearly half of those who identified as homeless, no longer at the shelter. Wall said the number of people staying overnight at the facility is down to about five.\nWall said the goal is to learn from the experience\u00a0in Red Lake, and attempt to replicate it in Kenora, which has a much higher homeless population.\n\"In the last five years, we've really had to look at how could we end homelessness. What are the missing links?\"\nA big reason for the success, Wall said, is partnerships with groups in the community. In Red Lake, the district social services board worked with the Red Lake Non-Profit Housing Corporation to secure an existing building and renovate it.\u00a0\nCommunity leadership, including mayor and council, has made the success possible, he said, pointing to re-zoning a building that was ideal for a shelter.\nShelters in the northwest are busy.\u00a0Facilities in Red Lake, Sioux Lookout, and Kenora had 17,000 nightly stays in 2019. About 9,000 of those stays were in Kenora.\nThe number of young people needing a place to stay has gone up sharply, Wall said, with 544 people between 16 and 24 needing a place overnight.\nWall said one other factor is people, particularly women, leaving northern communities who have no place to go.\nThere are many\u00a0\"numbers of people fleeing violence, ending up in urban centres, who have no home.\"\nHe said some are also fleeing human trafficking, and need a safe place to go.\n\"How do we ensure that when families come to the shelter for help, that help is there, that the\u00a0programs do what they need to do to support families, in particular women across our region.\"\nWall said the KDSB has helped create new housing for women in Red Lake, working with the Red Lake New Start for Women\u00a0shelter to build a brand new facility. The building is about a year away from completion.\nIt's\u00a0\"a\u00a0thing that was only dreamed of a couple of years ago,\" he said.\n\"We're starting to see people shift, that we are reducing the number of individuals that\u00a0are homeless in the community.\"\n\"If things keep going the way things are, we are quite confident that in Red Lake, in the coming years,\u00a0we will have almost ended homelessness.\"\nWall said the solution comes with a price, with the KDSB\u00a0spending about $2.9 million annually on programming and maintenance of transitional housing.\nIn the past three years, KDSB has supported\u00a0about $40 million\u00a0of capital investment\u00a0for\u00a0housing related projects.\nHe said other projects include transitional housing in Kenora, along with a bail-housing program.\nWall said while it could take a decade, he hopes Kenora is in the same situation, to eradicate homelessness as Red Lake is in now.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2664936812", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}]
