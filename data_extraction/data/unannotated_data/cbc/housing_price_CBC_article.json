Almost simultaneously, the venerable Canadian fashion chain Reitmans went into bankruptcy protection.\nThose are just some on\u00a0the list of famous names that are in financial trouble during this COVID-19 lockdown, including J.Crew, JCPenney and Cirque du Soleil.\nAs people stop flying, the head of Boeing has suggested a major U.S. airline may fail, and globally, many smaller carriers are at death's door.\nAs the CMHC worries Canadian real estate prices\u00a0will crash by as much as 18 per cent, the oil industry struggles to recover from negative pricing and unemployment rises toward Depression levels, it is hard to see the bright side.\nBut according to the theory of creative destruction derived by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1942 from ideas proposed by Karl Marx, economic and technological progress demands that businesses must die and\u00a0industries and paradigms must be swept away\u00a0to make room for new ones.\u00a0\nCanadian economist Peter Howitt, recent winner of the Frontiers of Knowledge Award for his work proving Schumpeter's principles in the real world, said that while the creative destruction process is happening all the time, economic crises speed the process along.\n\"When old firms or technology or skills or whatever are hanging on, they can last a long time until things get really bad,\" said Howitt. \"It's typically during a recession that a lot of the destruction takes place.\"\nThe implication is that while those in retail or the oil business or the real estate industry may insist that the COVID-19 lockdown has been the cause of their failure, the economic crisis may instead be a trigger, a catalyst for a process already underway.\nWe already knew traditional retail was being challenged by tech giants Shopify and Amazon or by big-box discounters like Costco, but it was the downturn that pushed struggling companies like Pier 1 over the edge.\nMany have suggested in the past that the overleveraged housing market was an accident waiting to happen. In a broader sense, some economic thinkers say the current backlash against China and against globalization\u00a0or even against the social structure of rich and poor is part of a reset for which pressure was already building.\nAccording to Stephen Williamson, an economist at Western University, it may be dangerous for governments to try to push too hard against the economic forces at work in dying industries such as the fossil fuel sector.\nCoronavirus pandemic hastens decline of US coal industry <a href=\"https://t.co/f3MLTb5jii\">https://t.co/f3MLTb5jii</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FinancialTimes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@financialtimes</a>\n\"It doesn't look like, at least the exploration and extraction part of the industry, is really viable a long time into the future,\" said Williamson. \"It seems hard to justify a huge bailout for those guys.\"\nFrom the smallest businesses to the largest, the rigours of recession can act as a torture test.\nFor businesses like that of Sean Davey, who after losing his job with the Royal Bank as a stock analyst in 2016\u00a0turned his mathematical skills to founding Rithmetic Math Club, surviving recession can mean prosperity afterwards.\nSlipping into the language of his former job,\u00a0Davey said his idea was to create \"a cash-flow positive, low-risk business\" that could grow slowly.\nBy converting his after-school sessions\u00a0to Zoom, Davey said the vast majority of his 100-odd clients remain on board and he expects business to grow despite the disruption.\n\"What is in little doubt is that the COVID-19 crisis, which has turned so many people's lives upside down, will eventually produce a wealth of new business opportunities,\" The Economist magazine said\u00a0earlier this month in its Schumpeter column, named after the famous Austrian.\nResponding to a complaint from some critics that creative destruction is merely a way of putting a smiley face on economic destruction, even as a proponent of the idea, Howitt does not minimize the notion that economic change is a painful process.\n\"Since the industrial revolution, people's lives have been destroyed by new technologies,\" he said, and while there are winners, workers and investors in the so-called \"sunset industries\" such as dying retail pay a price.\nBoth Williamson and Howitt say that even while it may pave the way to future innovation, a recession hurts innovators, too, as investment capital dries up and lenders withdraw from risk.\nAt the University of Toronto's Creative Destruction Lab, that gloomy view cannot stand in the way of Mara Lederman, who is firmly focused on the creation side of the creative destruction dichotomy.\nFounded by artificial intelligence pioneer Ajay Agrawal at U of T's Rotman School of Management, CDL has been\u00a0turning \"deep science\" generated by university scholars into businesses that help transform the economy.\nLederman said\u00a0a motivation for the non-profit lab was that Canadian universities were doing incredible science that only other scientists would see.\n\"What we need to do is take the science that's being discovered and turn it into businesses, products and services for the betterment of humankind,\" she said.\nAs an economics professor, Lederman is well-versed in Schumpeter's ideas but she sees the current volatile times as an incentive to develop new ones. That's why the group founded a new division called CDL Recovery\u00a0to\u00a0address health or economic recovery challenges created by the global COVID-19 crisis.\nThe group has already helped accelerate projects, including a wristband to determine if employees fail to maintain physical distancing, a system to monitor long-term care in a time of pandemic\u00a0and a technology that uses artificial intelligence vision to keep track of care residents with a tendency to wander, to mention just a few, said Lederman.\n\"Are we in the kind of situation that is going to unleash creative destruction? I think the answer is yes.\"\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1634936899915", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/programs/intownandout/housing-prices-1.5345612", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/656163395811", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Expect housing prices to continue to rise in 2020, realtors say", "description": "Prices driven by lack of supply, says real estate association president", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/kitchener-waterloo-real-estate-housing-prices-2020-1.5417667", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4292161.1507249491!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canadian-real-estate.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 07, 2020 1:22 PM ET", "2020-01-07T18:22:22.845Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "House sales were strong and the prices increased last year in Waterloo region, according to the latest report from the Kitchener-Waterloo Association of Realtors.\nAnnual home sales in Kitchener-Waterloo hit near 6,000 transactions.

The deal\u00a0closed last Tuesday.\nThe purchase means PARC now owns four buildings\u00a0and operates 110 affordable housing units in South Parkdale. PARC helps Parkdale residents who live with poverty, mental health and addiction issues.\nWillis said the purchase is significant because it means PARC is expanding its role as a charity\u00a0that aims to provide \"safe, adequate, well-maintained, dignified homes\" in Parkdale, a neighbourhood where the charity estimates 90 per cent of residents are renters and more than 30 per cent of people live in poverty.\nThe building's tenants, who pay below market rent, will be allowed to stay. Many use PARC's services and are low income.\n\"We saw this as a really important opportunity to secure this housing so that it would stay affordable and below market in perpetuity,\" Willis told CBC Toronto on the weekend.\n\"We think\u00a0this is\u00a0an example of what needs to be done again and again. There are very few purchases like this happening now. There's an enormous trend towards buying up what was affordable housing and converting\u00a0it into unaffordable housing,\" he added.\nWillis said PARC\u00a0bought the building from a husband and wife who own a handful of properties in Toronto's west end. The two\u00a0sold because they\u00a0had to liquidate some of their\u00a0holdings.\nIn the building, which needs\u00a0about $500,000 worth of capital improvements, 35 out of 38 units are occupied. Rent ranges from just under $600 to just under $1,100. There are an estimated 36 tenants in the building, which has bachelor and one-bedroom apartments.\nWillis said the\u00a0fabric of Parkdale\u00a0is changing through gentrification.\u00a0Development pressures are increasing, there are stories of renovictions and people being priced out, and\u00a0landlords\u00a0are selling to developers and international investors.\n\"This is a very different response. It's a community based one,\" he said. \"Anybody who is living there can stay there as long as they wish. And their rents won't go up in any kind of dramatic fashion.\"\nPARC said in a news release: \"With the acquisition of this building, PARC intends to prevent the displacement of tenants out of the existing affordable housing stock, and to preserve and protect affordable housing for low-income residents.\"\nAs part of the deal with the city, rents have to remain affordable and nobody will\u00a0pay more than 80 per cent of average market rent.\u00a0Any vacancies that come up will be made available to people on the city's affordable housing wait lists.\nThe building itself at 1501 Queen Street West was constructed in 1912, has operated as an apartment building since it opened and is a mirror image of a nearby property, Edmond Place, 194 Dowling Ave., also owned and managed by PARC as supportive housing. These buildings, which are like book ends, were once called the Parkdale Mansions.\nIn the 1920s, before the great crash of October 1929, Parkdale was a posh neighbourhood with stately homes. Many of the\u00a0mansions then became guest and rooming homes. In the 1970s, some of the houses\u00a0became homes\u00a0for people who had been institutionalized in psychiatric hospitals.\n\"What's interesting about this is these buildings reflect some of the history of the old days of Parkdale,\" Willis said.\nLast September, when water from 1501 Queen Street West migrated into the basement of 1499 Queen Street West, representatives from both buildings went to investigate and the conversation about the sale and purchase of the building began, he said. The owners indicated they were getting ready to sell and PARC officials asked if they could buy.\nThe owners decided that selling to the charity\u00a0next door, which means rent would be kept stable, was the right thing to do.\nNow, Willis said the building is in need of upgrades\u00a0to heating and security systems, but the city has provided money for that as well. \"There's some work that needs to be done.\"\nFor Peter Martin, treasurer of the PARC board and a former lawyer,\u00a0the purchase makes a difference to the charity. Martin is an Ontario Disability Support Program recipient and once lived on the streets.\n\"We will be able to maintain affordable housing stock in Parkdale. We are going to be able to improve the quality of life within those buildings through making sure they are kept up to a decent standard.\u00a0We can integrate the tenants in those\u00a0buildings into the super structure of PARC's programming policies so that we can provide social supports as well as\u00a0safe spaces\u00a0for people to live in,\" Martin said.\n\"Those are\u00a0really good things,\" he said. \"A place like PARC can give you the supports. They can provide you with meals, counselling and\u00a0a social network of support with your peers.\"\nMartin said the purchase gives PARC a larger profile in the community.\n\"We are now a little bigger in the neighbourhood in terms of being a landlord. And that provides us with a bit more influence and weight when we speak to government about the problems with\u00a0affordable housing, We are becoming a bigger player in Parkdale\u00a0in terms of our role as a provider of affordable housing and it makes easier for us for our voice to be heard.\"\nMartin said Toronto's\u00a0current housing market pushes low income people to the margins. He said he knows about the importance of stable housing because, when he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder years ago, he had to move to\u00a0Toronto from northern Ontario to get the help\u00a0he needed. He had stopped working.\n\"I have had to live in places where no one should have to live in order to stay in Toronto to get the medical support\u00a0I needed as I went through my crisis,\" he said. \"The system itself\u00a0is not designed to help people like us.\"\nAs for financing of the building, the charity received a $4.5 million, 49-year forgivable loan from the city and donations\u00a0from the ECHO Foundation and the Sheila Koffman fund, individual donors and the Parkdale Neighbourhood Land Trust. The fund of the late Sheila Koffman, former owner of Another Story bookstore and chair of the PARC board, donated\u00a0$200,000.\nThe ECHO Foundation, a family foundation that supports charities that help people with mental health histories, has loaned $3 million to the organization.\nFounded in 1977, PARC provides a drop-in centre as well as\u00a0supportive housing and peer-support program and outreach programs. About 20 years ago, it began operating units of affordable housing for low-income adults who are experiencing mental health issues or addiction challenges in South Parkdale. \u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Hamilton housing sales down since September, prices up from last year: RAHB", "description": "Sales down for apartments, which increased in price by 23.2 per cent", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-housing-sales-november-2019-rahb-1.5382229", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1586671.1379056578!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hi-housing-sold-sign-8col.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 03, 2019 11:49 AM ET", "2019-12-03T16:49:00.399Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Hamilton housing sales are down from September and October, but still up from November 2018 despite an increase in pricing,\u00a0according to the Realtors Association of Hamilton-Burlington (RAHB.)\u00a0\nThe RAHB\u00a0said that an\u00a0average price for residential properties in the area is now $591,334, which represents a\u00a05.6 per cent increase from November of last year.

Its\u00a0reeve, Aubrey Moodie, later faced accusations of conflict in the 1970s when property he partly owned was sold for 30 times the original purchase price after only seven years, Gordon recounts.\nA generation\u00a0later, the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton granted an application by Terrace Investments\u00a0in Kanata to rezone 100 hectares of agricultural land for urban uses so\u00a0an\u00a0NHL hockey arena could be built. It was part of a larger pitch to create an entire town around the rink, Gordon said.\n\"The very deep-pocketed developers have bought [rural] property decades in advance, far out. When you get those [properties] converted, they become the foundation of local fortunes,\" said Gordon, who is a professor at Queen's University's School of Urban and Regional Planning.\nNow in 2020, City of Ottawa staff are recommending 1,281 hectares be added to house a growing population for the coming decades.\nOn the eve of city council's decision Wednesday, land owners just the other side of the line are indeed watching closely.\nIt's the same in all Canadian cities, Gordon says. When a city allows rural land to be used for urban development, it \"makes millionaires.\" There's a lot of pressure, and likely\u00a0\"buckets of politics,\" he said.\nAlready, councillors on the planning and rural affairs committees have supported the expansion in a 10-1 vote.\nAmong the 100 public delegations they heard from earlier this month were developers, as well as consultants in real estate, land economics and planning.\nCoun. Shawn Menard didn't have a seat on those committees but asked several presenters if they owned land outside the boundary and stood to gain financially from an expansion. It was a question committee chairs Jan Harder and Eli El-Chantiry sometimes dissuaded him from asking.\n\"Do we look to invest in the future in Ottawa? Yes, and we do have land that will support that,\" answered Chris Collins, land development manager at Cardel Homes.\u00a0\nMenard later explained to CBC News that presenters are not required to disclose their financial interests.\u00a0\n\"If I know someone else is going to gain financially and it's going to cost me on my tax bill to have that financial benefit, that should be known,\" he said.\n\"Even though there's nothing wrong with trying to benefit financially from these things, it should colour the situation ... instead of just saying all these people are totally objective and what they're saying about expanding the boundary makes perfect sense.\"\nCouncil has yet to be shown a map of properties likely to be urbanized. That list will only be compiled by late fall, and only if council approves the expansion.\nBut it's easy enough to find some candidate parcels.\nA motion by Eli El-Chantiry means agricultural resource areas should be off the table and not even scored for inclusion. Set aside wetlands and other protected natural areas, and the focus turns to \"general rural areas.\"\nWhen one adds the points a property gets for proximity to future rapid bus or rail lines, some areas in Kanata and near the Trillium Line to Riverside South come to the fore.\nThen there are areas on the fringes of suburbia that recently lost agricultural status when developers won appeals to downgrade them to simply rural: a few hundred hectares on the northern side of Barnsdale Road in\u00a0Barrhaven, and south of the Avalon and Summerside subdivisions in Orl\u00e9ans, for instance.\nA motion by Kanata\u00a0South Coun.\u00a0Allan Hubley also gives\u00a0a few extra points to lands\u00a0within 1.9 kilometres\u00a0of park-and-ride stations, and near roads that\u00a0have exclusive transit lanes or traffic signals. A landowner in the Fernbank area came out to show his support for that idea.\nThere's even the option of creating an entirely new suburb, a case made by John Smit, a former high-level city planning manager who now works for a consultancy.\n\"Not including a focused area for urban expansion might be cutting ourselves short in terms of finding the right answer,\" Smit told the committees earlier this month.\nGordon gives city staff credit for doing their homework. He said\u00a0they've made\u00a0sure to\u00a0come up with a plan that\u00a0meets provincial rules for how much developable land Ottawa has in supply, a plan they\u00a0can defend.\nGordon\u00a0studies and works with cities across Canada and says few have such sophisticated inventories of the land that sits vacant, as well as the land that could be intensified in older areas.\n\"Council's under tremendous pressure from all directions to include this type of greenfield development land at the edges, and you need excellent technical analysis in order to resist that pressure,\" Gordon said.\nLaws have changed and council's decision can't be appealed, but the minister of municipal affairs and housing could always get involved.\n\"The first round of fight is going to be at the city council level, but I'm sure the losers are going to go over the heads of council and try to make influence at Queen's Park,\" predicted Gordon.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1602483779595", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/will-a-1-tax-on-foreign-buyers-help-control-housing-prices-fact-check-1.5282050", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://gem.cbc.ca/media/the-weekly/season-2/episode-19/38e815a-01097de96e3", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "David Common & Melissa Mancini", "title": "Soaring rents and house prices in Canadian cities make housing a key election issue", "description": "Federal parties roll out their strategies to help urban Canadians keep housing costs in check", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/federal-election-campaigns-affordable-housing-1.5254614", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5255060.1566416544!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jeff-gallant.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Sep 23, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-24T12:39:03.768Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Jeff Gallant lived in his new home just 17 days before the For Sale sign went up.\nSoon after the single dad rented the house, it was sold and the new owners sent him notice of a major renovation that would force Gallant and his two young children to leave. A similar thing occurred at his previous place, and it's happening to so many renters in Charlottetown that a new term has been born: Renoviction.\nCharlottetown is a prime example of the scarce vacancies and spiraling costs facing renters in communities across the country.\n\"It's getting ridiculous,\" Gallant says of the rental market. \"Prices have doubled pretty much, and that boils back to supply and demand. They know there's nothing here, [so landlords] jack up the price.\"\nCost of living is a big election issue, a\u00a0CBC\u00a0News-commissioned online\u00a0poll\u00a0from June suggests, and housing is the biggest single expense for most Canadians, according to Statistics Canada figures on annual household spending.\nAs the campaign has unfolded, the federal parties have begun to unveil plans on how they'd make life more affordable for voters.\nThe Liberals\u00a0aim to build 100,000 affordable housing units over a decade. They would also encourage home ownership through a first-time home-buyer incentive that subsidizes up to 10 per cent of the purchase of a new home and five per cent on resale homes \u2014 with restrictions.\u00a0\nThe NDP have a more ambitious plan, committing to build 500,000 affordable housing units in a decade.\nA central message of the Conservative campaign is that it wants people \"to\u00a0get ahead, not just get by,\" and that\u00a0the government needs to get its hand out of Canadians' pockets in areas like the carbon tax, which the party describes as ineffective. The Conservatives have\u00a0promised to ease building regulations to increase the housing supply,\u00a0and said\u00a0Monday that if elected the party\u00a0would change the maximum mortgage term, increasing it from 25 years to allow up to 30-year mortgages. It is also promising to review the \"stress test\" for first-time buyers applying for a mortgage.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe reality is that finding affordable housing is increasingly difficult in many parts of Canada.\nThe smallest provincial capital, Charlottetown, has one of the lowest rental vacancy rates in the country. It hovers just above zero per cent, new Kijiji listings last just minutes before apartments are snapped up, and renters complain about spending ever more of their limited dollars on housing.\nIt is an old axiom of financial planners that renters should never spend more than 30 per cent of their gross earnings on rent and utilities. In Charlottetown, low income renters (those earning less than $21,361) spend on average 62 per cent of their earnings on housing.\nThe numbers get only marginally better when income levels increase.\nData gathered by the Canadian Rental Housing Index shows that Toronto renters earning as much as $45,498 a year are dedicating 40 per cent of their earnings to monthly housing costs. Live outside the downtown core, in York or Peel region, and those middle income earners are paying an average of per cent 44 and 38 per cent respectively.\u00a0\nIn Regina, low-income renters spend more than half their pre-tax earnings on rent and utilities. In Calgary it's 62 per cent, and 91 per cent in Vancouver.\nThis may help to explain why so many adult children are returning to live with their parents even after they've entered the workforce, or why many young adults choose to have roommates to defray living costs.\nCheck out your region's costs and compare it to others on the Rental Housing Index\nAcross Canada, it's not simply a question of how much accommodation costs, but also about keeping up with the need for more places to live.\nIn 2018, there were 37,000 new apartments built nationwide, but demand increased by 50,000 units, according to tracking done by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nAnd Canadian cities continue to grow, driven by factors such as immigration and stronger job numbers.\nWith housing-related problems rising and the cost of living a primary issue for Canadian voters, Charlottetown Mayor Philip Brown figures political party leaders in the midst of a federal election campaign should be talking more about it. When he was elected last year, he describes how he used a congratulatory phone call from the Prime Minister to drive home his top priority.\n\"We have a problem with affordable and accessible housing,\" Brown says he told Justin Trudeau on a call shortly after his election as mayor in November 2018. \"We need more public spending from the provincial and federal governments to up the supply of affordable and accessible housing.\"\nEach community has its own housing challenges, and one of the big ones for Charlottetown is that short-term rentals for the city's giant tourism industry suck up a lot of housing stock.\u00a0\nAnother is house prices \u2014\u00a0Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) data shows they've jumped 38.5 per cent in the past three years alone in P.E.I.'s capital. By comparison, prices rose 25.3 per cent in Toronto, 21.6 in Ottawa and 33.3 in Victoria. A market where buyers get into bidding wars is new for Canada's smallest province, which recently surpassed 153,000 residents, and it's persuading some landlords to sell.\nAdded to that, the province's population is growing, with people moving to P.E.I. from other nations and parts of Canada on both a permanent and temporary basis. The University of P.E.I. hasn't built a new residence in 14 years, for example, while its student population has increased by about a third. There have been significant increases in the number of students on campus requiring housing, with half now coming from out of province or out of country.\n\"And that, in turn, is pushing more demand on downtown housing,\" Brown explains.\nHolland College student Sierra Elkerton was debating whether she could even afford to stay in school\u00a0after she was evicted by her landlord because the building was not up to code. She managed to find a new apartment, but for nearly double the monthly rent.\n\"Realistically I don't want to pay that, but it looks like I'm going to have to,\" says Elkerton. \"The cost of living is way too high considering it's such a small city.\"\nShe's not alone. A global survey by money manager BlackRock Inc. found \"many Canadians feel that they are in a financial squeeze \u2014\u00a0hard pressed to save amid what they perceive as a high cost of living, including devoting much of their income to paying for their homes.\"\nCanadians who responded to the poll said they spend an average of 43 per cent of their income on housing \u2014\u00a0whether renting or owning.\u00a0\nAmong the 20 countries surveyed, only the Netherlands and Sweden had higher housing costs, at 51 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.\nCharlottetown's mayor is well aware of the numbers. In his community, he's most focused on trying to help the people who find themselves paying more than they can afford \u2014\u00a0and those who can't find anything at all.\n\"We may be a small city,\" he says,\u00a0\"but we've got big city problems.\"\nThe mayor says he would like to hear commitments from party leaders this election cycle to use the big federal wallet to help cities build more affordable housing.\n\"I got two calls this past week and one visit to the office,\" Brown says. \"From a woman who was living in her car in the Walmart parking lot, and another woman that's been in [a shelter] now for almost a month and she needs a place to live.\"\nWatch The National's story about what it's like to live in a 'severely unaffordable' Canadian city:\n"}, {"author": null, "title":

Bidding wars are still occurring and it remains a sellers' market for condos under $700,000 and detached homes around $1.6 million, whereas the market for more expensive homes tends\u00a0to favour buyers. \u00a0\nSo far, there hasn't been a lot of panic or forced selling, but I believe that could change in the fall.\nWhen trying to forecast where the market is heading, there are two variables that I will be closely monitoring \u2014 the post COVID-19 employment numbers and the expansion or\u00a0introduction of new government programs created to combat the financial effects of the pandemic.\u00a0\nA low unemployment rate does wonders for real estate valuations as it is an indicator that the economy is functioning well. Strong economies attract new investments, businesses, immigrants, temporary workers, international students, refugees \u2014 all of which increases demand for housing\u00a0and results in higher rents and house prices.\u00a0\nA weak economy does the opposite. People will not move here unless they think they can find a job, while recently laid off workers with few ties to Vancouver may leave. In other words, we see less demand and more supply.\nAccording to Moody's analytics, for every one\u00a0per cent increase in unemployment, house prices typically drop about 4 per cent. Based on this ratio, if our unemployment rate were to double from pre-COVID-19 levels, home values would drop by roughly 20 per cent.\nThe main reason house prices are not currently dropping is due to government intervention.\u00a0The various levels of government\u00a0stepped in with a series of temporary programs to replace or subsidize the income of those affected by COVID-19. They also arranged for many of our expenses to be deferred \u2014 such as utility bills, taxes and mortgage payments. All these programs have bought struggling homeowners some time, and have taken the pressure off to sell their homes.\u00a0\nBut what happens when the safety nets disappear? That is when the ill-prepared or vulnerable homeowners will be forced to sell. \u00a0Many of the government programs are expected to wind down in the summer and\u00a0fall, and we may see a spike in new listings \u2014 a great time for buyers but terrible for sellers.\nIf I had plans to sell my home sometime in\u00a02020 or early 2021, I would be listing my home sooner rather than later. While I'm not expecting a 20 per cent drop in value over the short term, it also wouldn't surprise me if it did happen.\u00a0I also wouldn't be surprised if the government bailed out the housing market and valuations returned to all time highs. The B.C. government's tax base is heavily reliant on the construction and housing industries,\u00a0so they can't afford to have housing valuations drop too low. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile I'm very cautious on real estate over the short term, I still think it's a solid long-term investment.\nMy advice to prospective buyers, if valuations drop by 15 to 30 per cent in 2020 or early 2021, consider leaving the sidelines as it could be the buying opportunity that many of you have been waiting for.\nIf you have a COVID-19-related story we should pursue that affects British Columbians, please email us at\u00a0impact@cbc.ca\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1737914435690", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Potential buyers staying home: April real estate stats in Edmonton show 55% drop in sales", "description": "'With the outbreak of COVID-19 ... this type of market decline is not surprising'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-real-estate-coronavirus-april-2020-1.5554918", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5520276.1585919722!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-sale-sign-calgary.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 04, 2020 2:07 PM MT", "2020-05-04T20:07:40.309Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The grim toll of COVID-19 on the housing market can be seen in April real estate statistics, which showed both the number of listings and sales taking a spectacular hit in the Edmonton area\nThere were 3,759 residential units sold in the first four months of 2020,\u00a0a 55-per-cent drop from the same period in 2019\u00a0in the region, which includes four surrounding counties, according to a Monday news release from the Realtors Association of Edmonton.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0750 residential sales in April were 35 per cent less than the number of sales in March 2020,\u00a0the association said.\n\"The Edmonton market experienced a significant decrease in year-over-year unit sales, with some downward impact on pricing,\" Jennifer Lucas, chair of the association, said in the news release.\u00a0\n\"With the outbreak of COVID-19 and the social distancing measures currently in place, this type of market decline is not surprising,\" Lucas said.\nAfter the World Health Organization declared coronavirus as a\u00a0global pandemic in March, open houses were banned by the Alberta Real Estate Association.\nHomes on the market are being \"shown\" through digital interfaces, including photos, videos and virtual-meeting apps like Skype or Zoom, while\u00a0real-estate agents have also been advised by the association to avoid as much face-to-face interaction as possible with clients.\nThe pandemic hit just in advance of busy April-through-June period, when people traditionally buy\u00a0and sell\u00a0homes in advance of moving during the summer.\u00a0\nThe drop in sales is partly explained by a similar drop in new listings.\u00a0\nThe number of listings in the Edmonton area dropped by 29 per cent from March, but is down by a whopping 46 per cent compared to the first four months of 2019.\u00a0\nThere were 1,871 residential listings in the region as of April 30, including the 1,366 in Edmonton.\nPrices took a hit as well, but not nearly to the same degree as sales and listings, according to the news release.\nThe average price of a single-detached home in the region was $410,200 \u2014 a four-per-cent drop from April 2019 but only a 1.5-per-cent drop from March 2020.\nPrices for condominiums and duplexes\u00a0\u2014 while still depressed compared to 2019 \u2014\u00a0were up slightly from March.

It then slows\u00a0down again through the rest of the year before beginning\u00a0the cycle again.\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown those trends out the window, as lockdowns and physical distancing measures have put a chill on home buying right as the market normally tends to heat up.\n\"Like so many other parts of normal daily life, a lot of buying and selling activity in housing markets across Canada has been put on pause,\" the CREA's chief economist Shaun Cathcart said.\nThe CREA said it saw the trend begin in March, which started out strong before sales plunged in the latter half of the month. All in all, March\u00a0sales were down by 15 per cent from February's level. Now, April is almost 60 per cent below that record low.\n\"The housing market has, in unprecedented fashion, effectively shut down and closed for business,\" Bank of Montreal economist Robert Kavcic said of the numbers.\nThe number of homes sold is in free fall, but so far average prices are not plummeting as sellers try to ride out the pandemic.\nThe average price of a home sold by a realtor last month was\u00a0$488,000, down by 1.3 per cent from\u00a0April 2019.\nWhile prices seem to be flat, on average, compared to last year, there are signs that they aren't immune to\u00a0negative pressure.\u00a0April's average price was 10 per cent lower than March's, an almost unprecedented development\u00a0given the seasonal nature of Canadian real estate.\nWhile house prices are undeniably under pressure, Toronto-Dominion Bank\u00a0economist\u00a0Brian DePratto says April's numbers need to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\"Weaker activity at the higher end of the market\u00a0took on an even bigger role in shaping average prices given the unprecedented\u00a0low level of transactions,\" he said.\nSales of high-end homes were down in Toronto and Vancouver, the two priciest markets in the country. Without those big sales prices acting as a magnet pulling up the average, the average price figure will look even more wonky than it normally does, according to DePratto.\n\"With activity shrinking so dramatically and likely to stay depressed for several months, average prices will likely be distorted,\" he said.\nCREA acknowledges that its average selling price can be misleading, which is why for several years the group has been tabulating another figure, the House Price Index or HPI, which it says is a better gauge of the market because it strips out distortions such as \"changes in the mix of sales activity from one month to the next.\"\nThe HPI\u00a0inched down by 0.6 per cent in April, the first monthly decline in almost a year. \"While some downward pressure on prices is to be expected, the comparatively small change underscores the extent to which the bigger picture is one where so much activity on both the selling and buying side is currently on pause,\" the CREA said.\nIt's not hard to see why average selling prices could be misleading.\nNormally, a homeowner living in a home they think is worth $1 million\u00a0would list their home and see what offers come in. If the offers they receive aren't to\u00a0their liking \u2014 say, $800,000 in our example \u2014\u00a0they likely just won't sell unless they have to, so that lower-than-expected house valuation doesn't get recorded in the official\u00a0numbers anywhere.\nIt stands to reason that the only homeowners selling right now are either happy with the offers they're getting, or they are selling for less than they'd hoped, or even at a loss, because\u00a0they are being forced to\u00a0due to job loss or other COVID-related factors.\nFor BMO's Kavcic, there won't be a true picture of what's happening in home prices until\u00a0buying and selling real estate can get back to what he calls \"some semblance of normalcy.\"\n\"It's going to be a race between sales and listings out of the gate to determine how the market balance shapes up, and where prices move in the near term,\" Kavcic said.\nUnprecedented government\u00a0income support measures such as CEWS and CERB will likely help limit panicky forced selling at depressed prices by owners who've lost their jobs and income. But they can't stop all the downward pressure, and certainly not forever.\n\"It's probably a big stretch to assume that the market will just go back to where it was pre-pandemic,\" Kavcic\u00a0said. \"Job market weakness will linger in certain sectors, and there could be investor-owned supply waiting to come to the market at first chance.\"\n"}, {"author": "Donna Spencer", "title": "Hamilton alters course on Commonwealth Games, now focusing on 2026 bid", "description": "Projected cost of hosting 2026 Games expected to be $500M less than 2030", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/sports/commonwealth-games-hamilton-2026-1.5579352", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5579440.1590096899!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hamilton-5-21-20.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 21, 2020 6:20 PM ET", "2020-05-22T14:02:14.105Z"], "source": null, "content": "Hamilton has pivoted from the pursuit of the 2030 Commonwealth Games to a potential bid for 2026.\nA dearth of global candidates makes the southern Ontario city a virtual slam dunk to host the earlier games.

We will be partnering with the City of Toronto, the Niagara peninsula, [town of]\u00a0Milton in providing some of the venues to take some of the risk and stress off the City of Hamilton in delivering the games.\"\nThe U.K.-based Commonwealth Games Federation released a report Wednesday stating the last five games since 2002 generated between $1.36 billion and $2 billion in gross domestic product for the host city or region.\nFewer cities have shown interest in getting recent games, however. Only two entered the race for 2018.\nDurban, South Africa was the sole bidder for 2022. The city was stripped of the games because it couldn't fulfil financial commitments. Birmingham stepped into the breach.\nCGF chief executive officer David Grevember hopes the report released this week demonstrates economic reward for the risk.\n\"The CGF recognizes, particularly in the difficult global climate we are in, that the costs of staging a major sporting event such as the Commonwealth Games is a huge commitment to those cities that have competing priorities for funding,\" he said in a statement.\n\"Aligned to our new Games delivery model to drive down operating costs by delivering the Games more efficiently, we feel there is now a clear blueprint outlining how our event can be used as a real catalyst for regeneration following the difficult situation we are collectively facing.\"\nThe construction of a pool at McMaster University, three multi-sport centres, a track and field venue and 500 to 700 affordable housing units were central features of Hamilton's 2030 bid proposal.\n\"Generally speaking from an infrastructure perspective, we're heading in the same directions,\" Frapporti. \"Affordable housing will be an even more pressing issue.\"\n"}, {"author": "Josee St-Onge", "title": "Flood and pandemic exacerbate housing crunch in Fort Vermilion", "description": "Province considering emergency housing as majority of residents can\u2019t return home", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/fort-vermilion-flood-housing-covid-19-1.5566780", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5566963.1589386509!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fort-vermilion-flood-damage.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 13, 2020 7:00 AM MT", "2020-05-13T13:00:00.884Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Fort Vermilion residents whose homes have been damaged by flooding are staying in hotels, campers or with friends and relatives as clean-up work continues in the northern Alberta hamlet.\u00a0\nThe community of about 750 people was evacuated on April 26, when an ice jam caused the nearby Peace River to overflow.\u00a0\nFlood waters have now receded, leaving more than 150 damaged structures behind, said Cameron Cardinal, Mackenzie County councillor for the area.\nThe water rose by several metres in some areas, he said.\n\"There are only seven homes that aren't affected by the flood waters,\" Cardinal said. \"The sewers also backed up in several of them because the water basically had nowhere to go.\"\nBusinesses, churches, cemeteries and the local school were also flooded.\u00a0\nCleanup is underway, Cardinal said, and assessors have started investigating the extent of the damage.\u00a0\n\"From there, we can come up with a timeline of how many people can come back and when,\" he said. \"It could be a week, it could be three months, it could be six months.\"\nThe pandemic has made it more difficult to find temporary accommodations, Cardinal said, since people can't be in crowded spaces\u00a0under ongoing\u00a0physical distancing restrictions.\u00a0\n\"If we didn't have COVID-19 to contend with, it would've been a simple, no-brainer solution.

To address all of those challenges, the Liberals announced $1.7 billion in funding for wells in April as part of a\u00a0relief package\u00a0that also included new assistance to help firms reduce carbon\u00a0emissions.\nEnvironmentalists seemed to approve. So did\u00a0Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. But demands for more help\u00a0persisted.\nWhen the Trudeau government announced this week a program to provide loans to large and medium-sized employers (including oil and gas producers),\u00a0it said that any borrowing would come with conditions \u2014 including a requirement to \"publish annual climate-related disclosure reports \u2026 including how their future operations will support environmental sustainability and national climate goals.\"\nProponents of climate disclosure \u2014\u00a0among them Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of Canada \u2014 have called on firms to publicly account for how their business will be affected in future by both government policies to reduce emissions and the actual impacts of climate change. In theory, such disclosures would push investors to push\u00a0companies\u00a0to make environmentally sound decisions.\nIn 2015, the Financial Stability Board, an international body established by the G20, launched a task force on climate disclosure\u00a0chaired by Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. That task force came back with\u00a0recommendations in 2017. Last June, the Liberal government's own expert panel on \"sustainable finance\" \u2014\u00a0chaired by Tiff Macklem, recently appointed governor of the Bank of Canada \u2014 advised the government to \"define and pursue a Canadian approach to implementing\" those recommendations.\nMany companies already provide\u00a0some level of climate disclosure \u2014 a study by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada in 2019 found that 98 per cent of firms included some degree of disclosure\u00a0in their financial filings. But just one company in the CPA survey was meeting the task force's proposed standards.\nThis week's announcement might help kick-start that change.\nAttaching such a condition no doubt also\u00a0makes it easier politically\u00a0to sell the pandemic loans policy to voters leery of using public funds to support large corporations, particularly oil and gas producers.\nBut the Liberals are promising to apply other conditions related to things like executive pay, collective bargaining agreements\u00a0and dividends. Such things might\u00a0seem like simple due diligence when dispersing public funds, but climate change also now seems to qualify\u00a0as a fundamental consideration.\nThe Liberals should\u00a0consider taking advantage of other opportunities to push for change, said Stewart Elgie, founder and chair of the Smart Prosperity Institute.\n\"Climate disclosure is one good way of accelerating the shift to a climate-smart economy,\" he said. \"They should also be looking for ways to tie economic relief to improved environmental performance.\"\nAs an example, Elgie cites the bailout of the North American automotive industry in 2009, which President Barack Obama's administration in the United States used to push for higher fuel efficiency standards.\nThe result was an industry that is arguably both more competitive and more environmentally friendly.\nAs the extent of the economic damage caused by COVID-19 has become clear, there have been calls to pursue a \"green recovery\" \u2014 for governments to focus their rebuilding efforts and economic stimulus on combating climate change. That remains the single largest opportunity here for driving some much-needed changes.\nBut it's also not clear yet\u00a0when governments will be able to start pursuing recovery plans. Canada is still in the emergency phase, and individuals and businesses need aid to get through the current crisis.\nEven in the short-term, though, there will be chances to to deal with the climate threat \u2014 which will still be with us once the pandemic has passed.\nIn a recent white paper, policy analysts and consultants Ralph Torrie and Celine Bak proposed a $2 billion fund to help cities establish \"permanent corridors \u2026 for people walking and cycling to work and school, while maintaining physical distancing.\" In the midst of a pandemic, such routes would give some people safer ways\u00a0to get\u00a0around. In the long term, maintaining those corridors would promote environmentally friendly transit.\nBrendan Haley, policy director at Efficiency Canada, has suggested that efforts to increase\u00a0the energy efficiency of homes and business can still be pursued during a time of physical distancing \u2014 such as\u00a0online training for \"green building skills\" and virtual energy assessments.\nHaley also emphasizes the need to plan now so that governments and businesses can be ready to move when it's time to start implementing a recovery plan. Elgie\u00a0also notes that updated building codes \u2014\u00a0currently being developed by the National Research Council \u2014 could help frame future stimulus spending on housing.\nThe Liberals also promised last fall to develop climate change accountability legislation that would set legally binding targets and establish third-party oversight \u2014 a promise that shouldn't necessarily be sidelined by a pandemic.\nThough COVID-19 clearly has\u00a0become a historic crisis, the Liberals are still faced with a political and moral imperative to deal with climate change. Justin Trudeau's government might be defined by how it handles this virus and its effects, but it's unlikely to be excused, either by\u00a0its supporters or by historians, if the threat to the planet\u00a0is forgotten in the process.\nSetting aside budget plans might have been necessary. But 2050 \u2014 the year when Canada is supposed to reach net-zero emissions \u2014 isn't getting any further away.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U of Regina selling 'mansion' that presidents lived in, rent-free", "description": "Former student union president says news is being met with support and shock", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/university-regina-selling-home-1.5572641", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5572752.1589581956!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/former-university-of-regina-president-house.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["May 15, 2020 5:11 PM CT", "2020-05-15T23:11:48.842Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The University of Regina is preparing to sell a home it has owned since 1991, in order to free up some cash during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe house at 1001 McNiven Ave. had served as a home for the president of the U of R to live in, rent-free.\nThe\u00a0nearly 4,000-square-foot home, with five bedrooms and five bathrooms,\u00a0also had a $100,000 maintenance budget, paid for by the university.\u00a0Estimated taxes on the property for 2020 are\u00a0$8,525.08, according to the City of Regina's website.\n\"We have no interest in buying a new replacement house and that wouldn't be part of the package on offer for an incoming president,\" said Dave Button, vice-president of administration for the university.\nThe home had served as an incentive for incoming presidents at a time when the housing market lacked the choice it does now.\nIt wasn't a free-ride for the president, though, Button said.\u00a0It was assessed by the Canada Revenue Agency as a taxable benefit, in excess of $30,000 per year, he said.\u00a0\nHe says there had been plans to sell the home prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"It just makes good economic sense, and it makes sense for for the future president to \u2026 have their own choice.\"\nThere is an opportunity now to sell the home, since it is vacant.

The advisory will be lifted incrementally, as each phase of the work is completed and then approved by AHS and Alberta Environment and Parks.\nThat work, which will be done in five phases,\u00a0is expected to start Friday and finish in early September, the release said.\nFort McMurray has been hit hard by natural and economic disasters in recent years.\nMany residents are still dealing\u00a0with the aftermath of the 2016 wildfire, the\u00a0costliest disaster for insurers in Canadian history.\u00a0In all, about 2,400 homes and buildings burned in the fire and many homeowners lacked the proper insurance,\u00a0slowing rebuild efforts.\nMeanwhile, people in the northern Alberta community are reeling from job losses related to the pandemic and a gutting drop in oil prices.\nPeople who have lost everything for a second time may\u00a0decide to leave the community altogether, Scott said.\nThe flooding began April 26, when a 25-kilometre sheet of ice effectively dammed the Athabasca River, forcing the Clearwater River to reverse course and flood the city's downtown core. An estimated 1,230 structures were damaged.\u00a0\nThe last evacuation orders were lifted late Saturday but it may be weeks before people can truly return home.\u00a0\nMany homes swamped by flooding remain uninhabitable.

Those involved in the development industry\u00a0argued that not increasing the supply of land for home building\u00a0would drive house prices sky high, putting them\u00a0further\u00a0out of reach for young people and new Canadians.\nLand prices have tripled since the city decided to hold the urban boundary back in 2010,\u00a0said Kevin Murphy of Mattamy Homes.\n\"You're right on the cusp of unaffordable housing,\" added Andrew Brethour, a realtor who advises\u00a0builders.\nBut other costs matter beyond the price of a house, such as\u00a0transportation or proximity to social services, argued community organizations.\u00a0\nDr. Eugenie Waters, for instance, said she has patients who are seniors who travel from the suburbs to her clinic.\n\"I really worry about us falling into this trap that it's more affordable for people to move out to the ... new suburbs, and there won't be the social services out there.\"\u00a0\nMany presenters also wanted the city to show\u00a0far\u00a0more details about how much each of the three scenarios set out\u00a0would cost the city in infrastructure, and the implications for its climate change goals.\nIn order to absorb tens of thousands more people in existing neighbourhoods, staff recommend building a lot more shorter, multi-unit complexes instead of relying solely on controversial high-rises. These lower-rise buildings could be made of wood instead of concrete, which is more expensive.\nArchitect Rosaline Hill agreed with the city planning staff's vision. She argued that the entire city should be intensified in this manner, with the first\u00a0focus on areas that are the easiest to make\u00a0walkable, such as those near transit.\nThat may mean many established communities, or what Coun. Jeff Leiper called the \"bungalow belt\" neighbourhoods within the Greenbelt, could see change soon.\nBut Josh Kardish of EQ Homes said while those older areas were \"ripe\" for mid-rise and infill, he questionned whether the city could build enough housing for an additional 400,000 people without apartment towers.\nThe meeting opened Monday with a motion by Coun. Eli El-Chantiry to protect prime farmland to disqualify\u00a0any properties on the city's\u00a0formal \"agricultural resource areas\" list to be included in the urban boundary.\nMembers of Just Food say that still leave open the possibility for development on\u00a0some farms, like those outside the officially designated areas or land with poorer soils where animals graze.\nThe group\u00a0called on councillors to tweak the motion further so that it captures all land used for agriculture, so that no more farmland becomes housing.\nEven staff's projection methods for how it calculated\u00a0the how much additional\u00a0lands will be needed\u00a0came under fire.\nIt turns out, city staff used a different\u00a0definition for how much intensification this city is achieving. Recently, the City of Ottawa was hitting 50 per cent intensification, far exceeding the 40 per cent goal in its official plan.\u00a0\nBut for this boundary discussion\u00a0staff said it makes more sense not to count collective housing for seniors or students. The \"goalposts had moved,\" as the Greater Ottawa Home Builders' Association tried to explain it. That dropped Ottawa's\u00a0current intensification rate to just 38 per cent.\nMichael Wolfson, former assistant chief statistician at Statistics Canada now with the University of Ottawa, said he was \"baffled\" the city would omit retirement homes.\u00a0\nCity staff also said in its\u00a0report it\u00a0had no real data on the resale housing market, so the number of households they expect Ottawa to need might be high. Wolfson said that data exists and is \"critical\".\u00a0\n\"I'm afraid that the information provided to you by staff \u2026 is seriously inadequate for you, and for\u00a0citizens like myself,\" said Wolfson.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Sask. not seeing same COVID-19 impacts on housing market as rest of country", "description": "'We were seeing a lot of buyer confidence in the beginning of the year': realtor", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/real-estate-market-regina-covid-19-1.5533914", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5013574.1579367230!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/digital-mortgages-20190210.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 16, 2020 5:00 AM CT", "2020-04-16T11:00:28.182Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The CEO of Royal Lepage says now is not the time to go out and shop for a new home \u2014 or sell.\nPhil Soper said 2020 was off to a \"boisterous\" start as more homes were selling in volume before a state of emergency was declared\u00a0in Saskatchewan four weeks ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"We believe that things will ease and people will be able to move into a very different buying and selling process,\" Soper told CBC Radio's\u00a0The Morning Edition.\n\"I'm not saying things will\u00a0return to normal in 2020, but the market will loosen up as people's\u00a0stay-at-home restrictions are lifted.\"\nSaskatchewan's housing market has not been negatively impacted to the extent of the rest of Canada about a month into the pandemic.\nHome sales fell 14.3 per cent in March nationally but the Canadian Real Estate Association says it is too early to determine the pandemic's effect on prices.\nSaskatchewan sales dipped 6.2 per cent on a year-over-year basis (March 2019 compared to March 2020) while prices dropped 5.1 per cent.\nThere were three more residential sales made between March 18\u00a0(421) than there were during the same time last year (418).\n\"We were seeing a lot of buyer confidence in the beginning of the year,\" said Brin Werrett, a realtor with Royal Lepage, of Regina's market.\n\"A lot of young buyers out pulling the trigger on houses, where last year, maybe they were a little bit hesitant.\"\nSales were down 6.2 per cent overall but the Saskatchewan Realtors Association says housing sales saw increases in several of the province's largest cities on a year-over-year basis.\nThere were 274 sales in Saskatoon last month, a six per cent increase.

A government can accumulate and carry debt without necessarily\u00a0having to worry about ever fully settling the tab.\nThe federal government, for instance, has always carried some debt. At Confederation, with the new national government taking on the liabilities of the provinces, the federal debt stood at $75.7 million. The first budget was balanced, with $14 million in expenses matched by $14 million in revenue. But the federal government ran an annual deficit in three quarters of its first 150 years, according to a 2017\u00a0history of federal finances written by Livio Di Matteo, an economist at Lakehead University.\nBy 1914, the federal debt was $336 million. In 1945, after the Second\u00a0World War, the debt had reached $11.3 billion. By 1972, after the post-war expansion of social welfare programs, the debt was $26.2 billion.\nThere was much excitement recently over the prospect\u00a0of the federal debt reaching $1 trillion as a result of recent pandemic relief measures. But the accumulated debt almost certainly would have reached that mark at some point in the near future anyway.\nBy 2006, the debt was $481 billion. A decade later, it was $634 billion. Heading into this crisis, the debt stood at $685 billion.\nNone of those numbers constituted a crisis. But the fact of public debt is not a licence to spend without limits.\nIf a government's debt begins to grow faster than the national economy, public finances can become unsustainable. Financial markets can lose faith in that government's ability to repay its loans, while higher interest rates can make it more expensive to carry the debt. Higher spending and debt-to-GDP levels also can\u00a0limit a government's ability to respond to a crisis \u2014 like\u00a0the one we're experiencing now.\nIn the 1990s, for example, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio reached 66 per cent\u00a0and borrowing rates were nearly 10 per cent. Under pressure from international markets, Jean Chr\u00e9tien's Liberal government implemented deep cuts to get federal finances under control.\nOur current situation is not nearly that bad. Not yet, at any rate.\nHeading into this crisis, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio was 30.9 per cent. In April, the parliamentary budget officer projected that \u2014 even after a sudden drop in economic activity and a surge in federal spending \u2014 the ratio would reach 48.4 per cent. Borrowing rates are around one per cent and are likely to remain low for the foreseeable future.\nAnd there's little controversy right now about the need to spend public funds to support Canadians and keep the economy on life support. In fact, with a few exceptions, opposition MPs \u2014 including the Conservatives \u2014 have been calling on the government to do more and do it faster.\nStill, some are beginning to express concerns about the rapid accumulation of debt and asking what might need to be done once this crisis has passed.\nWatch: Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer calls on government to offer an economic plan\nIn the short term, priority has to be given to fighting a deadly virus and helping people and businesses get through the resulting interruptions to normal life. Failing to provide that support now would only make the situation worse.\nBut it's hard to know how events will unfold,\u00a0or what the fiscal situation will look like once the health crisis has passed. In an op-ed published\u00a0last week, economists\u00a0Paul Boothe and Christopher Ragan\u00a0explained why they see \"good reasons to worry about Canada's emerging fiscal situation.\"\u00a0As a counterpoint, three former analysts from the office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer argued that the\u00a0federal government's finances should remain sustainable\u00a0and concerns to the contrary are \"unwarranted.\"\nThe last time there was a real focus on reining in federal\u00a0spending was from 2010 to 2015, when Stephen Harper's Conservative government made a concerted effort to re-balance the books after the Great Recession.\nThat restraint might have given the federal government a bit more room to act now, but the Harper government's cuts in federal spending actually undercut economic growth at the time, as an analysis co-authored by former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge in 2016 demonstrated.\nThe Conservatives could boast during the 2015 campaign that they had balanced the budget, but the price was an economy that was more sluggish than it needed to be, while income inequality\u00a0and other pressures on households were allowed to linger.\nBeyond Canada, the post-recession push for austerity has been linked to deepening inequality.\nThat doesn't mean that fiscal restraint is bad, of course \u2014\u00a0but it might remind us\u00a0that balancing the budget should not been seen as\u00a0an end in itself.\nThe Conservative government's focus on quickly eliminating the deficit lined up with Harper's desire to reduce the reach of the federal government. It also fit within\u00a0a post-1990s consensus in and around federal politics that still focuses intently on whether the government's ink is red or black.\nJustin Trudeau shook up that consensus, but the Trudeau years haven't proved\u00a0that restraint is unnecessary, or\u00a0that the voting public doesn't care about balanced budgets any longer. Some of the Trudeau government's pre-pandemic spending might look wise in hindsight (one of the larger increases in spending was for Indigenous programs) but even Liberals might struggle to justify every additional dollar they've spent.\nThe post-pandemic years also might require a capacity for restraint that the Trudeau government has not yet demonstrated.\nBut the federal deficit isn't going to be the only thing worth worrying about in the wake of this pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has exposed the failings of long-term care in Canada and highlighted the importance of child care. Women and low-income earners have been hit hard by the economic shutdown and could face lasting setbacks.\nClimate change will still be a profound threat. Indigenous reconciliation will still be an unfinished project.\n\"The choice isn't to carry a debt [or] austerity,\" said Lindsay Tedds, an economist at the University of Calgary. \"There are way more choices than that.\"\nThe path forward might, for instance, involve both a review of federal spending and new investments. The focus, Tedds\u00a0suggests, should be on \"inclusive growth\" \u2014\u00a0a notion that emerged in recent years in response to concerns about income and gender inequalities and existing barriers to greater economic growth.\n\"In the aftermath of the recession, and as the calls for austerity mount, the question that will, in my view, be important\u00a0is how that austerity\u00a0is addressed,\" said Miles Corak, a Canadian economist who has done influential work on income inequality.\n\"If we have concerns about inequality, and particularly its long-run consequences, then it will be important that spending on government services \u2014\u00a0municipal governments, education, housing\u00a0and health care \u2014 are all adequately supported.\"\nTo that end, Corak said,\u00a0it could be worthwhile\u00a0to look at the revenue side of the equation to see\u00a0whether the federal tax system is \"progressive and fair.\"\nIdeally, the threat of this virus will\u00a0subside in time to give us all a moment to take stock. When that moment arrives,\u00a0it might be good to remember that the measure of this country's health can't be reduced to how close the budget is to balance.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Rents in Regina, Saskatoon expected to increase slightly in 2020: report", "description": "Vacancy rates in both cities have been declining according to CMHC", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/rents-regina-saskatoon-vacancy-rates-2020-1.5434307", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5031438.1563475078!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/home-rental-prices.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 21, 2020 7:59 AM CT", "2020-01-21T13:59:00.675Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Rent in Regina and Saskatoon\u00a0could slightly increase as vacancy rates slowly decrease, according to\u00a0Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's January Rental Market Report for both cities.\nRegina is still recovering\u00a0from slower economic activity brought on by changes in commodity price volatility, according to Taylor Pardy, senior analyst with the CMHC.\u00a0\nThe purpose-built\u00a0apartment vacancy rate in Regina was virtually unchanged in the past year \u2014 it was\u00a07.7 per cent in October 2018 and 7.8 per cent in October 2019 \u2014 though the\u00a0report says this is still high compared to the majority of Canadian metropolitan areas.\u00a0\nThe 2020 Rental Market Predictions and Insights from Rentals.ca forecasts that\u00a0the vacancy rate may drop in the next\u00a0few years to 7.3 per cent in 2020 and 6.6 per cent in 2021.\u00a0As a result, rent may stabilize and potentially increase in 2020.

It's like retracing and actually capturing a lot of our history, of our sadness, where our land was taken from us. Now we're taking something with such solid position in history back.\"\u00a0\nManitoba became the fifth Canadian province on May\u00a012,\u00a01870, when the Manitoba Act received royal assent. It was officially\u00a0enacted on July\u00a015,\u00a01870.\nThe act was based on a list of rights\u00a0drafted\u00a0by Louis Riel and his M\u00e9tis provisional government and presented to the federal government as conditions for the province to enter Confederation.\n\"[It was] led by the only Indigenous peoples in Canada to ever negotiate a province into\u00a0Confederation,\" Chartrand said.\nThe Bank of Montreal, built in 1913, stands just a 15-minute walk from where Fort Garry once stood, jutting out over what's now\u00a0Main Street at Assiniboine Avenue.\nAt the end of 1869, Riel and others took control of the fort and took over the administration of the Red River area until an agreement was reached with Ottawa.\n\"So there's no doubt in our mind \u2026 the footprints of our ancestors walked through this area,\" Chartrand said.\nHe's been inundated with texts,\u00a0calls and emails from people in the M\u00e9tis\u00a0community, he said.\n\"Over and over it's about just how proud our people are that this is happening.\u00a0Everybody knows the historic significance of that location, right by the Red River. Of course we were called, at one time, the Red River M\u00e9tis.\"\nAs part of the Manitoba Act, the federal government promised to set aside 5,565 square kilometres of land along the Red and Assiniboine\u00a0rivers\u00a0\u2014 which meet at The Forks near Portage and Main\u00a0\u2014 for 7,000 children of the Red River M\u00e9tis. However,\u00a0the government failed to follow through and most\u00a0of that land was never provided.\nIncreasing numbers of settlers and\u00a0land fraud\u00a0due to uncontrolled speculation\u00a0forced many M\u00e9tis to leave, in hopes of making a\u00a0living elsewhere.\nIn 1981, the MMF began a land claim case against the federal government for the\u00a01.4 million acres it was promised.\nIn 2018, the federation\u00a0was finally\u00a0awarded $154 million in compensation.\n\"I think it's going to lift a lot of eyebrows up: 'What's going on here? The M\u00e9tis, where are they coming from? All of a sudden they're coming and buying some historic, some really landmark locations?'\" Chartrand said about the purchases the MMF is now making.\nThe Bank of Montreal\u00a0\"is just one,\" he said. An announcement could be coming next week for another location in the downtown area and \"it's bigger than Portage and Main,\" he said.\n\"As they say in the movies, we're baaa-aack.\"\nWhen Chartrand became MMF president in\u00a01997, he stood at the corner of Portage and Main, waving the\u00a0M\u00e9tis\u00a0Nation flag.\n\"I remember saying 'One day, this will be ours,'\" he said. \"And I've made statements in the past that if we've got to buy our land back one acre at\u00a0a time, we'll do that.\"\nThe MMF has been in\u00a0negotiations with\u00a0BMO Financial Group for some time and it was difficult to keep it quiet, Chartrand said.\nThe Bank of Montreal announced plans last fall that it would be moving across the street into the office tower at 201 Portage Ave.\u00a0\nChartrand wouldn't reveal the purchase price, saying only that both sides reached a number they appreciated.\n\"Eventually that number will come out. I have to report it to my people,\" he said.\nOnce the transfer of the building is complete, the MMF will shift its business activities into it and begin to create the\u00a0heritage centre, which\u00a0will contain artifacts and stories about the M\u00e9tis\u00a0in Canada.\nChartrand is aiming for August as a grand opening for the business side of things, as long as restrictions due to COVID-19 will allow it. He didn't have a date\u00a0when the heritage centre will be ready.\nChartrand said more news is coming at the end of the week, when the MMF will announce a massive hiring program that will include 500 summer students across the province.\nAnother 200 people who are skilled in construction and carpentry will be hired to do housing repairs and new builds, he said, adding the federation is also expanding its communications department.\n\"We already set the stage for the investment of how much money will be set aside for these jobs.

I was pleasantly surprised,\" Yogaratnam\u00a0said. \"We were reading all the articles leading up to it seeing how the real estate market was kind of tanking and how home sales were decreasing. I realized very quickly that when you say home sales, it's not synonymous with home prices.\"\nShe said they have no regrets about forging ahead.\n\"It is a little bananas to be doing it during this time,\" she said. \"But on the other hand, there are still people looking. Some of the people that made offers on our place had already sold theirs. So there was desperation on their part to buy as well as [on] our part to sell.\"\n\"At the beginning, it was a complete shutdown,\" said\u00a0Ottawa realtor Gloria Yankowich.\nBut now, six weeks in, things are starting to change, she said, as buyers, sellers\u00a0and agents\u00a0figure\u00a0out creative ways to mitigate their risk through virtual tours and conditional sales.\n\"I\u00a0don't know how many of us in the past have bought a house sight unseen, but it is happening,\" Yankowich said.\nAccording to realtor Paddy McCarthy, agents\u00a0have been deemed essential so people can avoid \"financial catastrophe.\"\n\"Most people don't want to [list],\u00a0but there are people who don't have a choice,\" he said. \"In February, we might have received seven offers on a place. Now there's only two or three, but they're still selling.\"\nNevertheless, realtors know there could be lean times ahead, especially if the slowdown lingers into the summer.\n\"We work in a high-risk, high-reward industry,\" McCarthy said. \"There will be a lot of realtors leaving the industry\u00a0if they haven't set aside enough [savings] to weather this storm.\"\nRealtor Peggy Blair said she's also encountering clients who simply don't have a choice.\n\"I've met two people this week who are paramedics who are starting with the City of Ottawa, moving here from other centres. They have to find places to live,\" she said.\nBlair points out the Ottawa real estate market was \"superheated\" right up until the pandemic.\n\"We were already in a situation of \u2026 unprecedented tight inventory. It's simply gotten tighter because people who don't have to sell are not selling.\"\nAnd don't expect a COVID-19\u00a0discount, Blair warned.\n\"I have some prospective buyers ... who have been sitting on the fence\u00a0hoping that there will be bargains out there, and I have to keep telling them at this point there are no bargains,\" she said. \"I was involved in a multiple offer situation on Friday. That property sold for \u2026 $42,000 over asking. They had 12 offers. Pre-March 15, they probably would have had 30 offers.\"\nBlair was able to find a house for those paramedics. \"They're actually moving in this weekend,\" she said.\nListings have \"definitely dropped to a trickle,\" said\u00a0Deborah Burgoyne, president of the Ottawa Real Estate Board. \"Some people are actively out there trading, but I would say the majority of them are not.\"\nBurgoyne said the year was off to a great start before the pandemic.\n\"We had surpassed last year's numbers, and then starting the third and fourth week of March we started to decrease. And the first two weeks of April, we're significantly lower.\"\u00a0\nBurgoyne said despite that, she's not surprised some people are still buying homes.\n\"There was a real pent-up demand. There were a lot of people that couldn't get into the market. They were pursuing multiple properties and losing out for one reason or another.\"\u00a0\nThe pandemic might actually help some families looking to buy, Burgoyne said. \"You know what? Maybe I'll have a chance because there won't be 10 people pursuing this property. There will be three.\"\nThat's likely to continue the longer the pandemic goes on.\n\"If you're priced at market value, I still believe you're going to have a good return,\" she said. \"It's not a feeding frenzy the way it was.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Average Canadian house price rose to $540,000 last month, up 15% in past year", "description": "Outside of Toronto and Vancouver, average price was $410,000", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/crea-house-prices-february-1.5498922", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5165054.1559841646!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/open-house-housing-realtor-real-estate-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 16, 2020 9:50 AM ET", "2020-03-16T17:32:48.395Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The average price of a Canadian home that sold in February was $540,000, a figure that rose by 15.2 per cent in the previous 12 months, the group that represents Canadian realtors says.\nThe Canadian Real Estate Association said Monday that the number of sales rose, too, by 5.9 per cent.

It's set to become operational in 2021.\nThe centre handles 911 calls, calls from the public and handles dispatches for 54 detachments and districts.\nAccording to an RCMP internal report, the\u00a0RCMP added $1.6 million to Millbrook First Nation's proposal and put down zero rent for its preferred option \u2014 the\u00a0headquarters in Dartmouth.\n\"Millbrook First Nation\u00a0provided a proposal in good faith, but we now know that the competition was falsely stacked,\" wrote Chief Robert Gloade in a March 25 letter to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair requesting a re-do of the contract process.\n\"Obviously the first competition was tainted in favour of one outcome.\u00a0Millbrook First Nation is asking that this competition be repeated but performed by an objective assessment team with no predetermined outcome.\"\nCopies of the\u00a0letter were sent to Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller and Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett.\nBlair's\u00a0office referred questions to the RCMP, as did Bennett and Miller's spokespeople.\u00a0\nNova Scotia\u00a0RCMP\u00a0said the decision to relocate the communications centre to Dartmouth was the result of \"months of follow-up work\" that came to the best conclusion.\u00a0\n\"Our focus during the study and throughout the decision-making process was on the health and safety of our employees, operational requirements and fiscal responsibility,\" it said\u00a0in an emailed statement.\nThe RCMP reviewed six options before deciding on its headquarters, according to an internal 2017 report obtained under the Access to Information Act by former Liberal MP Bill Casey and provided to CBC News.\u00a0\nThose options included doing nothing, upgrading the existing Truro centre, moving to a new location in the city, building a new location in the city or moving the centre to Millbrook First Nation.\u00a0\nMillbrook's proposal was the second cheapest relocation option, behind the headquarters move. However, the RCMP report assigned an extra $1.6 million to every relocation except its headquarters option.\u00a0\nThe figure is based on how much the Mounties pay the federal Public Works department every year to maintain empty space in their headquarters that could be rented to other federal agencies.\u00a0\nThe RCMP also assigned zero rent to its headquarters option. Yet, according to Public Works records provided by Casey to CBC News, the cost of rental space in the building housing its headquarters is $547 per square metre\u00a0and total current annual rent is $10.5 million.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The process wasn't a fair process,\" said Gloade in an interview.\nMillbrook First Nation sits about five kilometres south of Truro in the geographic centre of the province. It proposed to place the emergency communications centre in the Millbrook First Nation Power Centre, which is on a high priority power grid that runs underground and also serves a hospital a kilometre away.\u00a0\nGloade said the advantages were many with his community's proposal. He said the existing employees at the Truro centre would not have to move to keep their jobs and there is lots of room for expansion in the commercial building.\nMillbrook already acts as the base for Nova Scotia Power whenever major natural events cause widespread power outages, Gloade said.\u00a0It also hosts an Onex Solutions Inc. data centre that holds data from the provincial education department and its cannabis operations, he said.\nCasey, who didn't run for re-election but raised the issue repeatedly while in Parliament, said the RCMP wanted the centre placed at its headquarters in Dartmouth and manipulated the competition to get their predetermined outcome.\n\"They cheated Millbrook First Nation out of a chance at this,\" said Casey.\nCasey said there were major problems with the RCMP's\u00a0selection process.\nThe RCMP's ranking chart for each of the six main options was based on seven categories using a three rating system \u2014 zero if it didn't meet standards, five if it met minimum standards and 10 if it met or surpassed standards, according to the 2017 report.\u00a0\nThe seven categories were: health and safety,\u00a0consolidation of resources, functionality of accommodations, financial impact, human resource sustainability, level of disruption and\u00a0potential for expansion.\nThe RCMP headquarters option rated 10s across the board.\nMillbrook's proposal rated a five on financial impact \u2014 primarily on the added $1.6 million, plus rent; a five on human resource sustainability, meaning the ability to staff the centre from the local population and a zero on ability to expand.\nIt scored an overall rating equal to the options of relocating to another building in Truro or constructing a new facility in the city \u2014 but at a cheaper overall price, according to the report.\u00a0\nCasey questioned why the First Nation proposal would rate so low on human resource sustainability since the centre in Truro has maintained its staffing for over a decade and all its employees would not have to relocate.\u00a0\nHe also challenged the low rating on ability to expand when the centre would be placed in a nearly vacant commercial building.\u00a0\nCasey said the move to RCMP headquarters would also potentially put people at risk in Nova Scotia.\nThe decision to move the centre to the Mounties' Nova Scotia headquarters would place it about 10 kilometres from the Halifax Regional Police's own communications facility.\u00a0\nA 2004 RCMP report that initially led to the centralizing of communications at the centre in Truro specifically recommended against placing it in Halifax because it posed a risk that one event could\u00a0undermine the communication centres\u00a0of both the regional police and the RCMP.\u00a0\nSeveral emergency organizations, including the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, recommend placing emergency operations centres in separate locations.\n\"To me it became a safety issue for all of Nova Scotia,\" said Casey.\nThe Nova Scotia RCMP said in a statement that it has contingency plans should an event undermine its communications centre once it's moved to Dartmouth. The statement said these continuity plans passed a third-party review.\n\"Contingency plan for 'H' Division RCMP includes a back-up RCMP [communications centre] located outside of the [Halifax Regional Municipality] and portable equipment that would allow us to restart operations should both the primary and back-up [centre] be non-operational,\" said the statement.\nThe 2017 report made no mention of the 2004 recommendation in its ranking of potential sites.\n"}, {"author": "Jeff Walters", "title": "Homeless population in Red Lake, Ont. declines; hopes to be model for Kenora", "description": "Goal is to eradicate homelessness from northwestern Ontario town in just a couple of years", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/red-lake-kenora-homeless-1.5541687", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5314728.1587591969!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/henry-wall.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 23, 2020 7:30 AM ET", "2020-04-23T18:18:00.757Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The success of a program in Red Lake, Ont., to get people off the streets and into transitional housing, should and can be replicated in other communities across the northwest, says the head of the Kenora District Services Board (KDSB).\nHenry Wall, the CAO of the KDSB, said over the past few years, the priority in the community at the end of Highway 105 was to get people living homeless into transitional housing. That housing is affiliated with the Red Lake homeless shelter.\n\"[The transitional housing is]\u00a0for individuals that are ready to start moving on, and so, it's part of the shelter program, but it's one step removed from having to be in a shelter,\" he said.\nThe program is successful, he said, with nearly half of those who identified as homeless, no longer at the shelter. Wall said the number of people staying overnight at the facility is down to about five.\nWall said the goal is to learn from the experience\u00a0in Red Lake, and attempt to replicate it in Kenora, which has a much higher homeless population.\n\"In the last five years, we've really had to look at how could we end homelessness. What are the missing links?\"\nA big reason for the success, Wall said, is partnerships with groups in the community. In Red Lake, the district social services board worked with the Red Lake Non-Profit Housing Corporation to secure an existing building and renovate it.\u00a0\nCommunity leadership, including mayor and council, has made the success possible, he said, pointing to re-zoning a building that was ideal for a shelter.\nShelters in the northwest are busy.\u00a0Facilities in Red Lake, Sioux Lookout, and Kenora had 17,000 nightly stays in 2019. About 9,000 of those stays were in Kenora.\nThe number of young people needing a place to stay has gone up sharply, Wall said, with 544 people between 16 and 24 needing a place overnight.\nWall said one other factor is people, particularly women, leaving northern communities who have no place to go.\nThere are many\u00a0\"numbers of people fleeing violence, ending up in urban centres, who have no home.\"\nHe said some are also fleeing human trafficking, and need a safe place to go.\n\"How do we ensure that when families come to the shelter for help, that help is there, that the\u00a0programs do what they need to do to support families, in particular women across our region.\"\nWall said the KDSB has helped create new housing for women in Red Lake, working with the Red Lake New Start for Women\u00a0shelter to build a brand new facility. The building is about a year away from completion.\nIt's\u00a0\"a\u00a0thing that was only dreamed of a couple of years ago,\" he said.\n\"We're starting to see people shift, that we are reducing the number of individuals that\u00a0are homeless in the community.\"\n\"If things keep going the way things are, we are quite confident that in Red Lake, in the coming years,\u00a0we will have almost ended homelessness.\"\nWall said the solution comes with a price, with the KDSB\u00a0spending about $2.9 million annually on programming and maintenance of transitional housing.\nIn the past three years, KDSB has supported\u00a0about $40 million\u00a0of capital investment\u00a0for\u00a0housing related projects.\nHe said other projects include transitional housing in Kenora, along with a bail-housing program.\nWall said while it could take a decade, he hopes Kenora is in the same situation, to eradicate homelessness as Red Lake is in now.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Metro Vancouver still a seller's market despite housing downturn, latest numbers show", "description": "Sales down compared to 10-year average, but climbed from Feb. 2019 to Feb. 2020", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/metro-vancouver-still-a-seller-s-market-despite-housing-downturn-latest-numbers-show-1.5483897", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5392539.1576085898!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/housing-recovery-bc-20191125.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 03, 2020 1:02 PM PT", "2020-03-03T21:02:54.517Z"], "source": null, "content": "Home sales in Metro Vancouver remain well below the 10-year average for the region but sellers continue to hold the\u00a0upper hand as the real estate board says demand for properties is\u00a0steady with buyers having little to choose from.\nThe Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver says 2,150 homes sold\u00a0in February, a nearly 37 per cent jump in one month and almost 45\u00a0per cent higher than sales in February 2019.\nBut the spectre of the recent housing market downtown remains\u00a0with board data showing last month's sales are 15.6 per cent below\u00a0the 10-year sales average for February.\nDemand for properties remains healthy but the real estate board says listings have fallen almost 21 per cent compared with the\u00a0number of homes offered for sale last February, and only marginally\u00a0increased between January and February of this year.\nThe ratio of sales to active listings is 17 per cent for detached\u00a0homes and as high as 28 per cent for condos, well above the point\u00a0where analysts say prices are likely to slip if the ratio falls\u00a0below 12 per cent.\nThe board lists the benchmark price for a detached home at just\u00a0over $1.4 million, down less than one per cent since February of\u00a0last year but up 1.9 per cent over the past six months.\nThe benchmark prices for townhomes and condos are $785,000 and\u00a0$677,000 respectively.\nCondos showed the largest price gain over the last six months at\u00a03.6 per cent, the real estate board says in its monthly statement.\nBoard president Ashley Smith said the condominium market was also\u00a0the busiest across the region in February.\nAgents are reporting more people attending open houses and\u00a0multiple offers being made in some sections of the market, she added\u00a0in a statement.\n\"If you're considering listing your home for sale, now is a good\u00a0time to act with increased demand, reduced competition from other\u00a0sellers, and some upward pressure on prices,'' Smith said.\n"}, {"author": "John Last", "title": "Yellowknife transitional housing on ice after N.W.T. housing corporation refuses to back project", "description": "The conversion of the Arnica Inn would have created 42 new housing units for vulnerable residents", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/transitional-housing-arnica-rejected-1.5471966", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5151954.1558993402!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/arnica-inn.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 21, 2020 3:34 PM CT", "2020-02-21T21:34:48.410Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A transitional housing project for vulnerable Yellowknife residents is now unlikely to go ahead, after the N.W.T.

And on the flip side, we're seeing landlords\u00a0\u2014 who need to pay the mortgages and property taxes \u2014 scramble to put their units on the market.\"\nPasalis says there's been a 25 per cent\u00a0increase in listings and he thinks that former Airbnb hosts are scrambling to lease out their units.\u00a0\nHe says investors who bought multiple units to list as short-term vacation rentals are now pivoting to leasing longer term after the Airbnb\u00a0market collapsed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnd he says a surge in listings has pushed the condo rental inventory from one-and-a-half months of inventory\u00a0(MOI) at the end of March to nearly 4\u00a0MOI at the end of April.\nAll that new competition for renters has meant a 3.5 per cent\u00a0drop in average rents for the month of April. Pasalis says he doesn't expect things to return to normal quickly and that may mean a soft rental market for some time.\n\"If immigration starts to decline, which typically happens during a recession, this is also going to weigh on rental demand in the short term,\" he said.\n\"We might see some condo investors take their chips off the table and sell their units.\"\nJaco Joubert has studied the effects of Airbnb\u00a0on condo rental vacancies.

He thinks that may have more than doubled in some buildings to as high as 13 per cent.\nAnd he says he's noticed rents have declined by a few hundred dollars.\n\"There are some rentals that are listing for quite a bit lower than it would have maybe a year ago,\" said Joubert, adding that price expectations are likely moving lower.\nFor example, he says he found a studio condominium listed in the downtown area that probably would have gone for around $2,000.

For 10 years in this apartment, he's tended to dozens of vines that have climbed up walls and now drape overhead. With his pending eviction, he said\u00a0he's been thinking about how to disentangle them for the move.\nBut first, Hatfield has to find a new place to live, and he, like many of his neighbours, is struggling to find something he can afford. He currently pays $550 per month, all-in. The average rent for a bachelor apartment in Halifax is $812.\nEvery tenant at 23 Crystal Dr. is being evicted this spring so the property owners can renovate the building and raise the rent. The owners have told tenants they want to keep the building \"affordable,\" and tenants can reapply after renovations.\nBut the proposed new rent, $875 per month, is too high for many people currently living there.\nIn a notice dated Jan. 30, 2020, the owners told tenants they would have to move out by the end of April for \"extensive demolition, repairs and renovations.\"\nIt's signed by Central East Developments,\u00a0a company co-owned by Spencer Meens and Adam Barrett, according to the Nova Scotia Registry of Joint Stocks. They did not respond to interview requests from CBC\u00a0News.\n\"It's what has been, I guess nicknamed, or phrased as 'renovictions,'\" said\u00a0Hatfield.\nIt's a scenario the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) described in its latest report on the Halifax rental market. It said\u00a0a record-low vacancy rate, coupled with record-high new development, is driving rents up and making housing less affordable.\nIn January, CMHC reported rental vacancy had dropped to one per cent,\u00a0which is\u00a0the fifth annual drop in as many years,\u00a0and the lowest number since it started reporting rental vacancy data in Halifax in 1990.\nMore than 4,000 new rental units have entered the rental market since 2017, but \"new apartment supply is not coming onto the rental market fast enough to offset increased demand,\" the report said. CMHC attributes growing demand to high rates of immigration and interprovincial migration.\nThe new construction has created what CMHC called a \"very high\" proportion of newer units on the Halifax market, compared to other Canadian cities.\n\"This has increased the quality of rental stock, incentivized older buildings to upgrade in order to compete and affected affordability, because rents have increased faster than disposable income,\" the report said.\nThe one per cent vacancy rate is top of mind for tenants in the building.\n\"That's really, really, really daunting when you're looking for a place,\" Hatfield said.\nProspective rentals have either been \"too gross\" or too expensive, so Hatfield is trying to find a roommate. But, he said\u00a0he worries about splitting living expenses.\n\"You're depending on other people to pay their bills, and you can't always do that,\" he said.\nIn the January eviction notice, Central East Developments listed five companies \"with apartments currently for rent.\"\nHatfield's downstairs neighbour, Daniel Kearley, said he's looked for apartments with each of the suggested companies. In some instances, he said he applied and was rejected.\u00a0In others, the prices were too high.\nKearley and Hatfield are both on fixed incomes, paid for by the province's disability support program.\n\"I'm having extreme difficulties finding anything,\" Kearley said.\nAfter 10 years working around housing and homelessness, Darcy Gillis has seen cases like the one at 23 Crystal Dr. before, but he said\u00a0they're becoming more common.\nGillis is a housing support worker at Dartmouth Housing Help, a non-profit that works with individuals who have challenges finding and keeping stable housing.\nGillis said\u00a0many apartment buildings in North Dartmouth are around the same age as 23 Crystal Dr.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which was built in 1976\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and renovations are to be expected.\nThere have been five recent complaints filed against 23 Crystal Drive's\u00a0owners under bylaw M-200, which sets minimum living standards for all residences, said a spokesperson for the Halifax Regional Municipality.\nThe spokesperson would not divulge the specifics of the complaints, but said HRM responded to each of them and closed the files.\nCentral East Developments bought the building in December, and Gillis said he respects the new owners for taking on deferred maintenance, but evicting tenants leaves them \"in a lurch.\"\n\"It's really unfortunate,\" Gillis said. \"There's no plan for individuals who are being mass evicted for building renovations.\"\nGillis is currently trying to help six tenants at 23 Crystal Dr. find new housing, but he said it's challenging.\n\"Really, there's just nothing available,\" he said.\n\"Low income is always going to be a barrier. And with the vacancy rates so low, the landlords aren't really considering people who don't have as much money.\"\nThe Nova Scotia government added more than 500 new rent supplements \u2014 which are meant to close the gap between what renters can afford and what the market is charging \u2014 to the 2020-21 budget.\nBut Gillis said additional rent supplements can become redundant in a tight rental market.\nSome tenants have already moved out of 23 Crystal Dr. The doors on six units hang open and renovations are well underway.\nIn empty units and common hallways, the floors have been stripped down to plywood\u00a0and construction crews are putting up walls to turn the bachelor apartments into one-bedrooms.\nIf any tenants remain come May 1, Gillis said\u00a0they have a few options.\nIf they're on income assistance, the province could move them into a hotel, temporarily. If not, Gillis said\u00a0he would usually refer them to a shelter. But lately, many Halifax shelters have been full.\n\"So... if the individual doesn't have family or friends, most of them would have to go out onto the streets, which is scary,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Samantha Craggs", "title": "Hamilton looks at an empty homes tax to ward off speculators and help local rents", "description": "More than half of vacant Vancouver homes are back on the market, but can it work in Hamilton?", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/vacant-units-1.5389684", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5376582.1574952894!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vacant-empty-homes-vancouver.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 09, 2019 4:27 PM ET", "2019-12-09T21:27:17.236Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Hamilton is investigating a new tax on empty homes to discourage speculators it says are driving up the cost of housing.\nThe city has a problem with wealthy buyers who purchase\u00a0homes and never live in them, says Nrinder Nann, a councillor for Ward 3 in Hamilton's urban core. They fork over millions for condos and houses, and the units sit\u00a0empty until they can resell them at a profit.\nThat makes it harder on people looking for affordable units, Nann said. She pushed Monday for the city look at establishing a similar program to\u00a0Vancouver's empty homes tax. Councillors unanimously supported it.\n\"I've received anecdotal information from residents that they cannot find housing accommodations in our city,\" she said. \"At the same time, there's also anecdotal information I've received from other neighbours that they know there's buildings that are sitting vacant. Not just buildings, but homes. Homes that could be rented out.\"\nHamilton has seen a rapid increase in housing and rental prices. A recent Social Planning and Research Council of Hamilton report shows around 20 per cent of renters spend more than half their income on shelter. The cost of rent is also outpacing inflation.\nBetween 2017 and 2018, the report says, Hamilton's average rents spiked 6.9 per cent \u2014 a rate higher than the provincial average. It also references a report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives showing someone earning minimum wage would have to work 54 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment here.\u00a0\nHousing prices have also been on an upward trend for years, even when sales are down.\nSeveral other councillors echoed her belief on\u00a0the impact of speculation. There's no local data around how much vacant property has driven up real estate prices. But after Vancouver implemented an empty homes tax,\u00a0vacant property fell by 15 per cent from 2017 to 2018. The program has also helped return just over half of previously empty homes to the rental market.\nThe vacancy rate there is less than one per cent. That city started taxing empty homes an extra one per cent in 2016, and recently increased it to 1.25 per cent. In the last three years, the tax has generated $39.7 million in net revenue, which the city puts toward affordable housing initiatives.\u00a0\nIt could\u00a0be challenging to identify what units are vacant, said Jason Thorne, Hamilton's general manager of planning and economic development.

While many essential products have gotten more expensive, there are some exceptions.\u00a0\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures price increases for a fixed basket of goods and services. With that data, analysts can then attempt to parse\u00a0economic or industry-specific trends that drive inflation.\nTaylor Mitchell, lead analyst at Statistics Canada, says the Consumer Price Index helps researchers like her \"isolate as much as possible the sources of price changes from month to month.\"\nThe latest full year\u00a0we have data for is 2018, so these cost increases cover 2008 to 2018 to mark a full decade.\u00a0\nThe CPI's average increase \u2014 which is weighted to give prominence to items Canadians spend more on, such as gas\u00a0\u2014\u00a0was 14 per cent over that time frame.\nMeanwhile, the growth in median income across B.C. was 12 per cent\u00a0from 2005 to 2015. (Those numbers are tied to the census, which is why they\u00a0don't\u00a0match the same 10 years as the CPI.)\nOne of the categories where British Columbians are likely to have noticed the biggest change is the cost of food and beverages.\u00a0\nMitchell says the increase in fresh produce and meat has been noted across the country over the past decade.\nThe main factors driving the increase, she says, are exchange rates (because most of our produce come from the U.S.), transportation prices, and difficulties with growing seasons driven by inclement weather.\u00a0\nLucas Herrenbrueck, an economics professor at Simon Fraser University, said another factor driving the increased cost could be a rise in incomes.\u00a0\n\"We know that the wealthier you are the more you will probably spend on the freshness of your food,\"\u00a0Herrenbrueck said.\u00a0\nAnother large price increase in B.C. over the past decade was for utilities such as\u00a0internet and electricity.\u00a0\nThe widely reported increase in internet access costs over the past decade appears as an 83 per cent hike in the CPI \u2014 a number all the more striking when one considers that it's been adjusted for increases in bandwidth and data.\nBritish Columbians\u00a0are also paying more to get around. Again, any gain in quality\u00a0is accounted for in the cost increase.\u00a0\nIt will surprise no one to know that\u00a0people in Metro Vancouver are paying a lot more for housing.\nNote that the rental cost noted below is for secondary rental housing, not purpose-built rental housing.\nPurpose-built rental housing has also\u00a0increased, up 46 per cent for an average two-bedroom apartment \u2014 to\u00a0$1,652 in 2018 from $1,131 in 2008.\nIt may surprise some British Columbians to learn some prices have\u00a0actually dropped since 2008.\nHerrenbrueck says people tend to notice when prices go up, but not when they go down.\u00a0\n\"You don't really notice the things that happened in your favour,\" he said.\nThe decrease in prices of consumer goods is most likely due to better international trade in the past decade, Herrenbrueck said, especially as shipping from overseas markets has gotten cheaper.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe warns, though, that a drop in prices doesn't benefit everyone.\n\"If gas prices go down then that's good for people who commute but bad for people in the oil patch,\" he said, as an example.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2677724014", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Singapore migrant workers deal with anxiety as living quarters become COVID-19 cluster", "description": "S11 dorm is home to labourers from India, Bangladesh and China", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/singapore-s11-dorm-coronavirus-1.5539303", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5539315.1587468999!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus-singapore-migrants.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 21, 2020 8:23 AM ET", "2020-04-21T12:23:55.196Z"], "source": null, "content": "Singapore will extend a partial lockdown until June 1 to curb a sharp rise in coronavirus infections in the city-state, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday.\nThe measures, which include the closures of most workplaces and schools and are called a \"circuit breaker\" by authorities, were initially set to run until May 4.\nThe city-state reported 1,111 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, bringing total infections to 9,125, after a record daily jump of 1,426 cases on Monday.\n\"We will therefore extend the circuit breaker for four more weeks,\" Lee said in a televised speech.\nLee said the extended lockdown period would help bring community cases down decisively and make sure infections in migrant dormitories do not spread into the wider community.\nSingapore's finance minister said at a media conference that the government would extend economic support measures, including wage subsidies, to help businesses offset the impact of the longer lockdown period.\nThe World Health Organization's regional chief said on Tuesday that Singapore \u2014 which has the highest number of reported cases in Southeast Asia \u2014 is facing \"very difficult challenges\" from a recent surge in infections but has the health-care system and risk management capacity to handle it.\nThe city-state has seen a sharp jump in cases in recent weeks fuelled by infections in cramped migrant worker dormitories, many of which are under government-ordered quarantines.\nFor Habibur Rahman, the only glimpse of life outside the four walls of the cramped Singapore dormitory room he shares with 11 other migrant workers are security guards urging people to stay apart and cleaners scrubbing down communal toilets.\nThe 25-year-old Bangladeshi is one of thousands of workers, mainly from South Asia, who came to Singapore to provide a better life for their families. Now, however, they are under government-ordered quarantine, battling boredom, frustration and anxiety in a sprawling dormitory complex called S11 at Punggol, home to about 2,000 of the overall cases.\n\"If one is infected, it would easily spread among others,\" Rahman said. \"Currently we are confined to our room. Everyone is scared. We are just praying to Allah \u2026 praying five times a day.\"\nS11 is one of many utilitarian housing blocks on the fringes of the modern city-state where more than 300,000 migrant labourers from Bangladesh, India and China live in rooms with bunks for 12 to 20 men, working jobs that pay as little as $20 Cdn a day.\nThese dormitories, in areas tourists seldom visit, account for more than 75 per cent of the country's total infections after the city-state recorded its biggest jump in new cases on Monday. Nineteen dormitories have been quarantined so far, according to government notices, affecting tens of thousands of workers.\nRights groups have said the dormitories have highlighted a weak link in Singapore's containment effort, which has otherwise won global plaudits. And critics say such mass quarantines could increase the risk of infection in the blocks.\nSingapore authorities say that they have taken preventative measures in migrant housing since the start of the city-state's outbreak in January but that the quarantine measures were necessary once the virus spread.\nS11, the company that operates the dormitory, the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment.\nReuters spoke with 12 residents at the S11 complex, a row of low-rise steel buildings of different colours behind high metal fences. Some workers declined to be identified for fear it would worry their families or put their jobs at risk.\nThe workers said they leave their rooms only to use the bathroom, and meals are delivered. Their days are spent streaming movies on their phones, peering out of balconies draped with laundry, or chatting with concerned family members back home, they said.\nSome S11 residents complained about the sanitation, the lack of precautions and monotony in the dormitories. Others praised the Singapore government's response.\nBut all were afraid of catching the virus.\nFor Nayem Ahmed, a 26-year old construction worker from Bangladesh, that fear was realized.\nOne of his roommates had been infected, so when he awoke on April 8 feeling feverish, he immediately alerted medical staff in the dormitory.\nThey tested him and while he awaited the results, he said, he was moved to an isolation facility outside the dormitory. Two days later, he was told he had been infected.\n\"I can't express how I felt when I heard that. I thought I would not live anymore,\" Ahmed said.\nAhmed said he was given paracetemol, and underwent blood tests and a chest X-ray in a hospital. After a few days, he was moved to a converted conference centre called Expo, which is being used to house patients with mild symptoms.\n\"I feel like I have got a new life,\" Ahmed said.\nAhmed said he is thankful to the Singapore government for providing health care and food, and making sure quarantined workers are paid. But he said more should have been done to address the risks of outbreaks in dormitories.\n\"Dormitories are crowded and dirty. No wonder the dormitories have become a hotbed for coronavirus infection,\" Ahmed said. \"Now we are paying the price.\"\nOther workers also flagged hygiene issues in the dormitories shortly after quarantine measures were announced on April 5.\nThe Ministry of Manpower has said it faced \"challenges\" at the start of the quarantine related to hygiene and the supply of food in the dormitories, but that it had been working with operators to improve conditions.\nS11, which operates the Punggol facility and another near the city's airport, advertises the \"cheapest dormitories in Singapore.\" The dormitory at Punggol can house up to 14,000 workers in four-story buildings on about 5.8 hectares, roughly the same area as eight soccer pitches, according to local media reports.\nThere are 43 such purpose-built dormitories in Singapore, housing 200,000 workers, 1,200 converted factories housing 95,000 workers and various other smaller temporary quarters, according to the Ministry of Manpower.\nSince the start of the outbreak, the Singapore government has said it has been advising dormitory operators to monitor workers for fever, encourage personal hygiene and limit mingling in common areas to reduce infection risk.\nBut Nizamul, 27, and other workers who declined to be identified, said that temperature checks were rare at S11 and that a fingerprint scanner was used for entry and exit into the complex just days before the government quarantine.\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease. Scientists say it spreads through droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, and by people coming in contact with contaminated surfaces before touching their nose, mouth or eyes.\nNizamul said before the quarantine he had shared a room with an Indian man who was put on sick leave because of\u00a0a cold and fever, then tested positive for the coronavirus days later when his health deteriorated.\nNizamul said he was moved to a public housing complex and given his own room, and has not tested positive.\nMiah Palash, 27, was one of the few S11 residents Reuters spoke with who said he did not know of any cases in his block.\nOnly allowed to leave his room to use a shared washroom, Palash said the biggest challenge was finding ways to pass the time and trying to ease the anxiety for his family back home.\n\"They're just wishing for me. I'm the only son. They're worried but \u2026 I call them every day,\" Palash said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "B.C. housing market bouncing back as buyers return, report says", "description": "Recovery fuelled by growing population, lower borrowing costs, pent-up demand, Central 1 economist says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/central-1-housing-outlook-2019-2021-british-columbia-1.5371826", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4660464.1526157778!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancouver-home-sales-20180302.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 25, 2019 6:55 AM PT", "2019-11-25T14:55:06.672Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "B.C.'s housing market is on the way back up, according to a report from economists at an agency that supports credit unions across Canada.\nCentral 1's B.C.

As her family grew over the years, they moved from one new development to another, seeking new home features and upgrading their garage. It was a \"bad habit,\"\u00a0she now says.\nHomes on the fringes of the city are as popular as ever. People line up when a builder releases a new block of housing\u00a0to lay money on a unit.\nBut city planners and politicians alike know\u00a0that growth comes at a cost\u00a0\u2014 pipes, transit, greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0\u2014 and have talked for years about growing in a more compact way, and\u00a0packing more homes into existing areas to limit those downsides.\u00a0\nYet, in a big report to be debated at a virtual city committee meeting May 11, city staff say what's realistic is to expand the urban boundary to allow\u00a0an extra\u00a023,300 homes at the fringes of the suburbs by 2046. That's\u00a0on top of the\u00a066,300 units already in the pipeline.\nSome 88 per cent of those yet-to-be-built units\u00a0would be houses that fit one family, with their own\u00a0front door. The rest would be apartment units.\nCoun. Jeff Leiper was shocked city staff would recommend adding so much land \u2014\u00a0the 1,281 hectares designated for new urban areas is bigger than his entire ward of Kitchissippi.\nHe's also disappointed by the\u00a0calculations staff have done, saying it appears they've based the need\u00a0for future land\u00a0on the housing trends of the past. Leiper wants the urban-rural divide to stay where it is.\n\"If we're going to be sustainable, if we are going to have 15-minute neighbourhoods, if we're going to have affordable public transit, if we're going to keep our taxes as low as possible, then we can't just give in to market demand for single-family homes,\" Leiper said. His ward in the core is the epicentre for new highrise towers and pricey infill developments.\nBut Ottawa's mayor agrees with city staff, who say holding the urban boundary\u00a0is too ambitious.\u00a0\n\"[That's] easier said than done. You've seen some real battles over the years. Everyone talks a good line about intensification, but when it's in their community\u00a0they're against it. There are dozens of examples,\"\u00a0Jim Watson said.\nWatson calls the scenario staff prefer a \"balanced approach.\" Ottawa's population is projected to rise by 400,000\u00a0to 1.4 million people by 2046, and the city\u00a0sees splitting the projected 195,000 more households it would\u00a0need almost evenly between\u00a0existing built-up areas\u00a0and undeveloped parcels.\u00a0\nThe city\u00a0can't risk supplying insufficient space\u00a0for the expected homes. The Ontario government requires Ottawa\u00a0show it has enough.\nThat's not to say the scenario\u00a0staff propose doesn't call for much more intensification than happens now. It does. By 2046, 42,700 more apartments, as well as 49,400 single-detached, semi-detached\u00a0and row homes could elbow into\u00a0existing Ottawa neighbourhoods\nStaff have even worked with a local architectural firm on\u00a0a new kind of structure that\u00a0might help meet the needs of\u00a0Ottawa families\u00a0while building a city that's more dense:\u00a0the \"613 flat.\"\nThat is, six-rooms and\u00a0three bedrooms per unit in short buildings that blend in with\u00a0their neighbours. It offers the elusive \"missing middle\" style of housing \u2014 neither a house, nor a highrise apartment.\nThe problem, staff write, is\u00a0it takes time to create policies, and more time yet to get\u00a0the building industry and housing market to shift to building a new kind of lifestyle, and\u00a0at the right price people can afford.\nA planner who studies how cities grow and change says a big reason families\u00a0especially\u00a0keep flocking to the suburbs is that North American cities have\u00a0not been very successful at delivering them exactly these kinds of options.\n\"Most of our cities have done either really high density in the centre, or quite low density in the form of single-detached dwellings,\" said Markus Moos, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo's school of planning. \"So if you're looking for green space immediately outside your home, single-detached dwellings are often the only affordable alternative.\"\nOn the one hand, governments\u00a0have to be sure they give neighbourhoods\u00a0the good transit, amenities and green space they need, Moos said. Ideally, before a new development\u00a0is built, so as not to lock in car-centric habits.\nBeyond that, Moos said\u00a0better ideas are needed to make sure people consider the full cost of where they choose to live.\nHe points to the idea of \"location-efficient mortgages\"\u00a0\u2014 financing incentives for homebuyers who are less reliant on their cars.\nAnd then there's mindset.\u00a0\n\"I would like to call for a cultural shift. We don't need to have a backyard in order to raise our kids. We don't have to live in a house,\" said\u00a0Naama Blonder, an architect with Smart Density in Toronto\nBlonder contributed to that city's policy for how to make highrise towers more family-friendly. Many newcomers to Canada come from countries where dense living is the norm, she noted. Buildings here just need to have families in mind: units with enough bedroom space and room for a stroller, as well as\u00a0common areas for teens to do homework.\nAnd, Blonder added, when battles about new highrise proposals happen, focus less on how tall a building could be, and more on pushing for a great street-level vibe and pathways that connect people to transit and parks.\nIn the meantime, families continue to\u00a0choose Ottawa's far-flung suburbs because they're affordable. They also like the newness, lack of maintenance\u00a0and, sometimes, having space for multiple generations to live under one roof,\u00a0said Deborah Burgoyne, president of the Ottawa Real Estate Board.\nBut subdivisions themselves are changing slowly, and many look\u00a0nothing like the\u00a0big lots on winding crescents of old.\u00a0New\u00a0suburbs are more compact. When the city issued a record number of building permits in 2018, more were for semis and stacked townhomes\u00a0than for single-detached models. Some apartment buildings are going up.\n\"Toodle around and you won't believe\u00a0what's out there now,\" Burgoyne said.\nAs for Lecours, she still loves her community in Orl\u00e9ans, she just wishes there were more small coffee shops and\u00a0community gardens, and more housing choices for renters\u00a0and downsizing seniors.\n\"If they plan properly, I think it is OK to expand,\" she said.\u00a0\"But it has to be done in a way where it serves the people.\"\n"}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "'Less bad' doesn't mean good: What Vancouver's housing market could hold in 2020", "description": "For the first time in five years, there were no major surges in any aspect of the market ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-housing-market-2019-2020-1.5407180", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5392539.1576085898!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/housing-recovery-bc-20191125.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 24, 2019 12:04 PM PT", "2019-12-24T20:04:02.415Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A funny thing happened in Vancouver's housing market in 2019: for the first time in many years, not much happened.\u00a0\n\"Condo prices have slowed down.

It has worked for the past 13 years in a contract with the City of Greater Sudbury.\nLandry says it's quite a challenge to help people find affordable housing.\n\"The cost of living and the price of

basically, our provincial and local governments need to look at the housing stock they have and see if there's any money to be pulled in to develop more affordable housing,\" he said.\nLandry added

New Year.\u00a0\nThe prediction for 2020 follows a year characterized by double-digit gains in London real estate, thanks to a steady influx of people moving from the Greater Toronto Area\u00a0looking to buy a\u00a0relatively small amount of homes available for sale.\u00a0\nAs of November 2019, the price of an average home in the City of London has\u00a0risen more than 12 per cent over the previous year, according to Earl Taylor, the president of the London and St.\u00a0Thomas Association of Realtors (LSTAR).\u00a0\n\"2019 was definitely what we would call a sellers' market,\" he said.\u00a0\"There's definitely more buyers than there are sellers right now.\"\u00a0\n\"I think 2020 will be very similar to 2019,\" he said of London's real estate market. \"We went from a high of over almost $427,000, which was up 12.7 per cent over November of 2018, so that's probably similar to what we're going to see in 2020.\"\u00a0\nWithin the greater London area, which includes the City of St Thomas, the numbers are slightly less dramatic, but no less buoyant, according to LSTAR. In Nov. 2019, home prices rose 10.7 per cent over last year to $416,116, putting the year in real estate on course to break records in terms of price.\u00a0\nAccording to data from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), while 2019 sales in the London area didn't reach the record-breaking volume of 2017 where 11,247 homes traded hands, Nov. 2019\u00a0sales numbers were on par to meet or beat 2018 figures\u00a0with about 9,700 homes bought and sold.\nFor 2020, the CMHC predicts market activity in terms of existing home sales will be steady, with about 9,200 home sales on the low end and 10,200 on the high end.\u00a0\nIt's for that reason home prices are\u00a0expected to again reach new heights in 2020, according to Anthony Passarelli, a senior market analyst with the CMHC.\u00a0\n\"On the high end $450,000 and on the low end\u00a0$430,000,\" he said. \"The average price in the City of London, the range for that\u00a0you would bump it up a little bit higher.\"\u00a0\nWith average prices in the city already hovering around $430,000 as of November 2019, it could mean home prices in London could easily close in on the $450,000 threshold\u00a0in 2020.\u00a0\n\"That ties in to why you're seeing some extra demand going to areas like St. Thomas and Strathroy because some people are going out a little bit further from the city centre to afford the home they want.\"\u00a0\nHigh real estate prices are also having an effect on London's tight rental market, according to Passarelli, who said the area's double-digit price gains have kept the overall vacancy rate hovering at around two per cent since 2016, which is about half of the city's historical vacancy rate of about four per cent.\u00a0\n\"Our research shows a lot of first-time buyers come from the rental market,\" he said. \"The rental market is affected because some of those renters that would normally have left the rental market to buy may stay an extra year and that causes the vacancy rate to be low.\"\nThe average rental price for a two-bedroom unit\u00a0in London is expected to climb to about $1,160 a month, up from $1,130 the year before, according to CMHC data.\u00a0\nThe reason behind that, according to Passarelli, is London's strong economy, which includes good job numbers, steady wage growth and plenty of immigrants settling in the city.\u00a0\n\"Immigration has been high in recent years, a lot of immigrants tend to rent when they first come to the country, especially the first year,\" he said. \"Census data consistently shows that.\"\u00a0\nPassarelli notes that while a number of new highrises in the city have just come online or are being built, Passarelli said it's not enough to offset an average rent increase\u00a0in 2020.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Stephanie vanKampen", "title": "P.E.I.'s housing crisis forces Syrian refugees into cramped quarters", "description": "'We're looking around for an apartment and we certainly don't have anything for August'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-syrian-refugee-family-1.5216875", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3230075.1448482821!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/apartment-for-rent-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 19, 2019 6:00 AM AT", "2019-07-19T09:00:00.929Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A group which sponsors refugees to come to P.E.I. is scrambling to find a home for a Syrian family on their way to\u00a0Charlottetown.\nThe couple and their 19-month-old child are flying from Jordan and will join members of their family already on the Island.\nBut due to a record-low vacancy rate in Charlottetown, the sponsors have not found a home for the new family.\u00a0\n\"When we first started this I don't think the vacancy rate was quite as bad as it is now,\" said Rosemary Henderson, chair of the Interfaith Refugee Sponsorship Group. \u00a0\nUntil a home can be found, the family will stay in a crowded three-bedroom apartment in Charlottetown that will house four adults and four children \u2014\u00a0including the newcomers.\u00a0\nIt can take months, even years, to finalize a sponsorship.\u00a0Henderson said part of the reason for the scramble is that the group only had two weeks' notice of the family's arrival.\n\"We didn't have enough money to just rent an apartment at some point hoping that they would come soon,\" said Henderson.\n\"Now we're looking around for an apartment and we certainly don't have anything for August but hoping perhaps we'll find something for September.\"\nThe latest family is the fifth family that the Interfaith Refugee Sponsorship Group has sponsored.\nThe group was formed in reaction to the Syrian civil war.

It is\u00a0an unbelievable economic development opportunity, social impact opportunity for the city of Hamilton, community engagement opportunity for our community to move forward.\nThis is not just about sports. It's about investment in infrastructure. It's about social impact. It's about dealing with all of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations which has been a major part of this. There are multiple reasons to do something that is economically sustainable, financially viable, socially impactful and community engaging. On so many different fronts this makes sense.\nWhat concrete infrastructure projects can we expect for Hamilton?\nSo, there's an opportunity to build a brand new aquatic centre\u00a0but then we looked down to Confederation Park. We've had immigration to Canada and there's an outcry for cricket pitches. So the city is building a world class cricket pitch but we're going to build a field house\u00a0with it so that we can have spectators there with\u00a0all the modern amenities,\u00a0a social area, meeting space, place to store their equipment, a place for the community to congregate and have some incredible cricket matches both at the local level and\u00a0the international level. Right\u00a0beside it, beach volleyball courts, both indoor and outdoor, so,\u00a0year round use. We're looking at refurbishing some of our older facilities like the Dave Andreychuk\u00a0arena to ensure our facilities are some of the best really in all of Canada, maybe North America.\nThe city of Vancouver promised,\u00a0for the Olympic bid,\u00a052 social housing units. In the end,\u00a0council approved a plan to rent half of those at market rates. Another 850 units were sold as condos at market rates out of range of\u00a0most people who desperately need housing. Can you guarantee your affordable housing estimates?\nKujavksi: You have a lot of progressive voices on that council who are going to insist\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I don't speak on their behalf \u2014 but I have a pretty strong suspicion and sense that they are going to be watching this very, very closely and are going to insist that these guarantees in terms of percentages for affordable housing are locked into the agreements that are signed.\u00a0So, this is going to be as simple as a bunch of business people that are putting up some money afterwards saying 'oh yeah I know I promised that but now it's going to be this.' All of this is being done openly and transparently in negotiations with the city of Hamilton who have to be a signatory to this thing if it ever comes to fruition.\nHamilton 100 says the city's portion of that $425B is going to be $100 million. They city says it's going to be $300 million. How do you account for such a huge discrepancy?\nKujavsky: One hundred per cent\u00a0of games related revenue\u00a0stays with the host community. That is estimated at in excess of $225 million dollars. And I will state right here that by the time we get to 2030, and you look at the additional revenue sources\u00a0and opportunities\u00a0through sponsorships or through sport related activities, that could bring in huge dollars, especially when it comes to broadcast rights,\u00a0 you're going to see that the host community share of this entire thing because of the revenues that stay locally is going to make this profitable, not just break even, but profitable.\nSo the difference is that you have incorporated projected revenue?\nMaychak: Yes. But it's also based on past games and it's very, very conservative.\nIf our three levels of government have $1.5 Billion available to spend, I think we should build 10,000 units of affordable housing instead of hosting the Commonwealth Games for 11 days. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HamOnt?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HamOnt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Onpoli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Onpoli</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cdnpoli</a>\nDan Jelly's comment raises this question \u2014 For $1.425 billion, why is the Commonwealth Games a better idea than spending that money on affordable housing, or LRT or any other bright idea that builds infrastructure?\nKujavsky: The issue then becomes 'well then why would you spend that money on affordable housing if we need money in our hospitals?'\u00a0And if you then spend\u00a0it on the hospital, someone else will say 'Well yeah but what about the water and sewer and hydro and fiber optics that all would have been a part of the LRT\u00a0investment that will be lost if that LRT project doesn't go ahead because 80 cents on every dollar spent on LRT would have gone to underground infrastructure?'\u00a0\nif you don't spend the money on the Commonwealth Games you will not get 75 percent funding for, for example, on amateur sports facilities and community projects that are needed in Hamilton, that have been identified by the city's real estate department. So, if we don't get the games what will happen is groups will go to the city and say 'we need this, we need that.' If the answer is always going to be 'well we're not doing any of that because we have to have this,' whether it's a health care related matter, an\u00a0education related matter or\u00a0affordable housing component. Then we shouldn't have any money spent, for example, on recreation. Any penny spent on recreation is not being spent somewhere else. So, when you get into this concept of we should never do this unless we fix all that in its entirety, there are things you will not have in your community, for example, a\u00a0place where you can send your kids to for into a sports program.\nMaychak: We feel strongly that our city, our province, has been under serviced in terms of hosting multi-sport games.\nKujavsky:\u00a0Out of the Pan American games you get Tim Horton's field, a new home of the Tiger Cats, which has\u00a0been incredibly important for the Tiger Cats to remain here and be profitable here. Just on the basis of the fact that because of the Pan Am Games over two thirds the cost of a brand new stadium were borne by the senior levels of government to the benefit of the community. Go and ask people in Hamilton if they, knowing what they know now, would say no you know what I would rather turn that down. I don't want it.

The message was posted on their door.\n\"No letterhead, no signatures, just, 'Unfortunately, your time is up at the Travelodge,\" she said. \"You have until Feb. 21 at noon to be gone.'\"\nIt's part of a larger situation members of the NDP caucus have been highlighting in the first two days of the spring sitting at Province House.\nOn Friday, the party introduced legislation for short-term rentals that would require anyone running an Airbnb-style service, regardless of size, to register with the province.\nThe bill, which is unlikely to pass in the Liberal majority legislature, would also require rental platforms to provide information about the obligation of hosts to collect and remit HST.\nA sliding scale of fees, ranging from $20 per year for someone who rents a room in their own home up to $5,000 a year for platforms such as Airbnb, plus $1 per night per rented room, would be collected and paid to municipalities.\nThe bill also includes fines for people who operate without registering.\nNew Democrat Lisa Roberts, the Halifax-Needham MLA, said the bill has more teeth than legislation\u00a0from the government that will not require all short-term rentals to register. It also comes\u00a0with lower fees.\nRoberts said she wants to see the government be more responsive to a growing problem that's seeing more people challenged to find an affordable place to live, or to stay in their existing situation as landlords look to renovate or rebuild to try to capitalize on a booming housing market with razor-thin vacancy rates.\nFor the NDP, that would include some kind of rent control. Although Roberts conceded there is \"mixed evidence\" when it comes to rent control, she said there needs to be some level of protection for renters while also allowing property owners to make reasonable rent increases as necessary.\n\"We are getting contacted by constituents who have seen rent increases in hundreds of dollars per month,\" she told reporters at Province House.\n\"We're saying that where there isn't major capital improvements that there should be some connection between the amount that rent can go up and the general CPI, the general inflation and cost pressures.\"\nPremier Stephen McNeil told reporters that his government has \"a number of announcements that will come out over the next period of time\" related to housing.\nHe\u00a0said the government is reassessing some investments already made to determine if the effect has achieved the desired outcomes.\nMeetings are also planned with the municipality and the private sector to see what partnerships are possible to provide more options for people looking for housing, he said.\nThe government has a first-time home buyer program for families, but McNeil said he also realizes some people are just trying to find shelter overnight while confronting other issues.\n\"We need to wrap services around them, whether it's addictions services or mental health. So those are the kinds of investments we would work with our partners to do.\"\nThere are other factors at play, too, said McNeil. The growth and development in the Halifax area has resulted in people who once had what they thought was an affordable place to live in the downtown being pushed to outlying communities.\nRent creep is now making its way to those areas, too, said the premier.\n\"And that's been the real domino effect that we're trying to put some support around and trying to work with the private sector to make sure that we provide some options,\" he said.\nThe premier said no single policy approach or partnership will fix the situation.\n\"This will require a multifaceted approach because everyone who finds themselves under-housed has a different reason, and that's why we need to continue to [work] on this.\"\nSparks, whose family is preparing to move to another hotel, said it's been difficult finding a new place to live, with landlords being very specific about prospective tenants and rents that far exceed the amount of money she has for housing.\nShe said she's planning to file a human rights complaint on the basis that she believes she's being discriminated against because she receives social assistance.\nIt would be one thing to deal with the situation if she were on her own, said Sparks, but knowing how it's affecting her kids has made it difficult.\n\"Seeing my\u00a0kids' faces, and knowing how disgusted they seem like they're feeling with me because of the situation that we're in, is just crushing my spirits right now.

Open houses are still well-attended and quality properties are being snapped up quickly. Even detached homes at higher price points are starting to move.\u00a0\u00a0\nLow supply and high demand have pushed up prices \u2014 particularly in the case of condos which are selling at all-time highs.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo cushion the economic blow caused by COVID-19, central banks around the world have cut interest rates. Anyone with an existing variable mortgage, or someone looking to get one,\u00a0can expect their borrowing costs to decrease.\u00a0The Bank of Canada cut rates by a full percentage point\u00a0since the beginning of\u00a0March.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe are also seeing investors flee the stock market and park their money in investment grade bonds. A result of this flight to safety is that fixed-term mortgage rates are dropping. Lower mortgage rates increase the amount a home buyer can borrow, which pushes up prices as borrowers are able to make higher offers.\u00a0\nWe also cannot forget about the mortgage stress test. On Feb.\u00a018, the federal government announced that the hurdle rate of the stress test would be lowered effective April 6.\u00a0 In anticipation of this change, many buyers re-entered the housing market, increasing demand on a real estate market with limited inventory.\u00a0 However, as of last Friday, the Department of Finance announced that changes to the stress test have been put on hold.\u00a0\nAll these factors are fuelling the housing market and not even COVID-19 appears to be able to slow it down\u00a0\u2014 yet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIt was just a month ago when stock markets were at an all-time high, largely due to the fear of missing out, whereas today it's\u00a0the opposite:\u00a0many people are panic selling.\nThe same could happen,\u00a0but to a lesser degree, with real estate, as buying psychology is fickle.\nIt's important to also keep in mind that, since all financial markets are interconnected, a stock market drop should affect the housing market. For example, many new buyers turn to the bank of mom and dad to help with their down payment. However, after experiencing a drop in their investment portfolio many parents will be less inclined, or no longer able, to help their children fund a down payment.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother important factor to consider is the potential loss of income that COVID-19 may cause. Some lenders might be hesitant to lend to applicants working in areas affected by the pandemic such as the travel or oil and gas industries.\u00a0\u00a0\nAll these variables can affect demand.\nIf I were a buyer, I would be cautious. Don't underestimate COVID-19's negative impacts on the economy, jobs and buyers' sentiment and avoid overstretching your budget \u2014 something that tends to happen when buying in a seller's market.\nMy advice to sellers who are looking to cash out or downsize\u00a0is to list their properties right away. Momentum is on your side and there is limited inventory, so sellers of quality homes are getting top dollar. The demand is currently high, but I wouldn't be complacent and assume that it will last. If offered a reasonable price, I would take it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you don't need to sell, I wouldn't and I'm not.

In both cases, councillors who were elected with him under the same party banner voted against him.\nIt highlights\u00a0another wrinkle in municipal politics that makes\u00a0it unclear how Delta's density debate will evolve.\u00a0\n\"Local government is unique, because even when people run together on a slate it's not like running on the provincial or federal party system where you might be whipped to vote a certain way,\" said Sylvia Bishop, a two-term Delta councillor who lost to Harvie in 2018's mayoral election.\n\"It can be very unpredictable. And right now, with the mayor's slate that he ran with, it's very unpredictable.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jordan Press", "title": "Low-income rates could rise as StatsCan moves to redraw poverty line", "description": "Poverty rates increased by 2.2 per cent the last time the measurement changed in 2008", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/statcan-redraw-poverty-line-1.5406874", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5383530.1585224326!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/food-price-report-20181204.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 23, 2019 1:04 PM ET", "2019-12-23T18:26:25.661Z"], "source": null, "content": "The national statistics office is looking at changes to the federally adopted poverty line which, if approved, could increase the number of Canadians regarded as living below the low-income threshold.\nThe last time the made-in-Canada measure was updated was in 2008; poverty rates increased by 2.2 per cent because the financial cut-off used to define low-income was raised.\nExperts suggest that a plan by Statistics Canada to recalculate the threshold by changing the \"market basket measure\" early next year could lead to a similar bump in poverty rates.\nThe measure calculates the minimum a person or family would have to earn to afford a basket of goods and services needed to reach a modest or basic living standard.\nThe Liberals adopted the measure as the country's official poverty line last year and set aside $12 million over five years to update the basket, which currently doesn't include things like wireless services.\nIn July, the top official at Employment and Social Development Canada and the minister at the time were told federal officials would decide \"on the actions to be taken\" with Statistics Canada's recommendations \u2014 including which to implement\u00a0and which to send for more research.\nA final report from Statistics Canada is expected in February.\nThe Canadian Press obtained copies of the briefing notes under the access-to-information law.\nStatistics Canada has published reports outlining possible updates to the cost of items in the basket of goods and services, as well as \"disposable income\" thresholds \u2014 how much income a family has left over after accounting for taxes and payroll deductions.\nA family or individual would be considered in poverty if the basket of goods strips away too much of their disposable income.\nOther updates proposed by Statistics Canada include reflecting changes to the national food guide in the cost of food, and updating transportation costs to reflect census data showing that while some low-income earners take public transit, others drive.\nThe agency also has suggested excluding capital gains taxes when calculating disposable income to avoid families \"appearing to be in poverty\" from a hefty tax bill, and putting homeowners with a mortgage and people in subsidized housing on \"more equal footing\" with renters when determining who is in poverty.\u200b\u200b\u200b\nGarima Talwar Kapoor, director of policy and research at the charitable foundation Maytree, said the cost of housing, for instance, has gone up faster in the last 10 years than earnings, which could drive up\u00a0the percentage of Canadians living in poverty.\nShe said a similar effect happened in the 2008 update, when costs rose faster than incomes.\n\"That trend is continuing,\" Kapoor said. \"The growth in costs is so much faster than the average income ... which would therefore translate to a higher poverty level.\"\nChanges to measuring poverty would likely result in an increase not only in the percentage of people in poverty but a slight increase in the raw numbers as well, Kapoor said.\nThe Liberals have said that, on their watch, more than 800,000 people \u2014 including some 280,000 children\u00a0\u2014 have been lifted out of poverty, and rates have dropped by about 20 per cent of where they were in 2015.

It's not really in our mandate, it's not something that we do, but it kept coming up,\"\u00a0said Andy Daggett, chair of the club's small donations committee.\u00a0\n\"So it was something we had to ask the question, like why is this such an issue\u00a0and \u2026 is there anything we can do to help?\"\u00a0\nAccording to statistics from the Canadian Real Estate Association, the median home price in eastern P.E.I. has nearly doubled in the last decade\u00a0\u2014 from $79,516 in 2009\u00a0to $151,000\u00a0in 2019.\u00a0\nThe survey was conducted for the club by MRSB Consulting in May and June of this year. It was available to people in eastern P.E.I. at 13 retail locations and online and received 529 valid responses, according to the company. Respondents were not required to answer every question, meaning the respondent numbers vary from question to question.\u00a0\nThe boundaries of the study encompassed most areas east of the Hillsborough Bridge\u00a0that links Charlottetown with eastern P.E.I.\nThe survey asked a range of questions\u00a0related to household makeup, income and finances\u00a0and people's satisfaction with their current housing.\u00a0\nWhile most homes in eastern P.E.I. have three or\u00a0more bedrooms, the survey found that more than half of households have one or two occupants.\u00a0\nAnd while most residents own their own home\u00a0rather than renting, not everyone is able to find suitable housing. The survey found 27 per cent of people have had to couch surf at some point. Thirty per cent of those under age 35 live with family or are currently couch surfing.\u00a0\nMeanwhile 40 per cent of respondents said it is difficult to meet their financial needs.\u00a0\nThe report also looks at\u00a0barriers\u00a0to increasing\u00a0the housing supply \u2014 and what solutions might exist.\u00a0\nCanada's 2016 census indicates a 2.2 per cent population growth in eastern P.E.I. over 2011. Meanwhile, numbers from\u00a0the Canadian Real Estate Association indicate that the number of new real estate listings has been declining.\u00a0\nThe MRSB study looked at Airbnb listings\u00a0and found 581 entire homes for rent in eastern P.E.I. in July 2019.\u00a0\nThe report concludes that the inventory of affordable housing needs to be increased, but that developers face barriers \u2014\u00a0including many people not able to pay market rates\u00a0and a lack of availability of financing from banks and government.\u00a0\n\"It's harder to do smaller units in the rural areas, and that seems to be certainly adding to the issue. It's just trying to get developers who are willing to do that\u00a0and finding the financing to help out with those things,\"\u00a0Daggett said. \"It seems to be there for the more urban areas and centralized areas.\"\nWith the report laying out the landscape of housing in the eastern part of the province, the club\u00a0is now looking at what it can do to help.\u00a0\n\"If you don't have somewhere safe and warm to stay, nothing else can really take place,\" Daggett said.\u00a0\nThe report outlines several options, including providing support to groups or individuals that are creating housing, the club building its own subsidized units, developing assistance programs\u00a0and lobbying government to change policies.\nThe report recommends supporting community groups\u00a0\u2014 that could include financial support. However,\u00a0Daggett said no decisions have been made yet.\u00a0\n\"I'm hoping by early next year we'll certainly have a better idea of\u00a0just what is the\u00a0role we want to play.\"\nHe said he hopes others will benefit from the information in the report, including government and developers.\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Bridgette Watson, Jodie Martinson", "title": "She fled domestic abuse.

We were looking at about three buyers for each property.

Instead, many of them continue renting.\u00a0\nAs real estate continues to become more expensive, this trend\u00a0will continue, said Jasmin-Tucci.\u00a0\nWhile the real estate market is going strong, the region is also struggling with a lack of affordable housing.\nMany organizations have been sounding the alarm for months. The CMHC\u00a0estimates that Ottawa's rental housing vacancy rate was at 1.6 per cent in 2018, the last year for which there is data.\nAcross the Ottawa River, the vacancy rate in Gatineau\u00a0sits at 1.2 per cent, the lowest in the province.\nThe Quebec government has put in place an emergency assistance program to help people who are homeless, as well as to assist cities that are coping with\u00a0a housing shortage.\u00a0\nWhile the price of homes in the region continues to grow, advocacy groups persist in their\u00a0push for investments in affordable housing.\u00a0\nThere are approximately 10,000 people on the waiting list for social housing in Ottawa,\u00a0according to data from the City of Ottawa.\n"}, {"author": "Christine Rankin", "title": "45 per cent of Hamilton renters living in unaffordable housing, new report says", "description": "Average rent in the downtown core, mountain has risen 40 per cent in 8 years", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/social-planning-research-council-hamilton-rental-prices-affordability-1.5377000", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1687684.1380196267!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hi-downtown-hamilton-8col.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 01, 2019 2:04 PM ET", "2019-12-01T19:04:26.555Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Reports released by the Social Planning and Research Council of Hamilton show that 45 per cent of renters are living in unaffordable housing and using a disproportionate amount of their income just for shelter.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Social Planning and Research Council of Hamilton (SPRC) is publishing documents over\u00a0the next few weeks on the rental housing crisis in Hamilton, where\u00a0prices keep rising and residents\u00a0can't keep up.\u00a0\nThe non-profit has\u00a0released its first four\u00a0bulletins\u00a0as part of a 15-part\u00a0series. The reports\u00a0show quickly rising rental prices that demand a greater percentage of people's incomes and how\u00a0evictions for reasons other than non-payment further the problem.\u00a0\nSara Mayo, social planner of geographic information service with SPRC, explained\u00a0that the group was influenced by industries lauding price increases in the housing market as a good thing,\u00a0and wanted to shed light on the downsides.\n\"The housing market is causing a lot of stress and negative situations for lots of people in Hamilton,\" she said. \"Not enough attention is paid to the rental market...there's not enough discussion of\u00a0the negative impacts.\"\u00a0\nPart of the problem, she said,\u00a0is that rental prices are surpassing inflation rates. While rental prices\u00a0were increasing at a rate close to inflation from 2001 to 2015,\u00a0the SPRC says the costs are now growing\u00a0exponentially.\u00a0\nBased on data from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the non-profit says that from 2015 to 2018, inflation rose by six per cent, while\u00a0rental prices\u00a0for private units increased by 21 per cent.\nIf prices were to increase by inflation, the SPRC says average market rent for a private rental unit would be $884 \u2014 instead, it's $1,009.\u00a0\nAnd if this cost seems low compared to what you see advertised online, the group says there's a reason for that.\u00a0\nThe average price\u00a0provided by the\u00a0CMHC, it says,\u00a0takes into account rent being asked by landlords and rents being\u00a0paid by current renters \u2014 the latter group brings this\u00a0average down.\u00a0Information\u00a0on rental websites, which only includes\u00a0prices\u00a0of when the units turn over, are higher because it shows the prices of places available.\u00a0\nHamilton is among the cities with the fastest growing prices when compared to neighbouring communities. The report says that between 2017 and 2018, Hamilton's average rents spiked 6.9 per cent \u2014\u00a0a rate higher than the provincial average.\u00a0\nThe non-profit says that the numbers are skyrocketing as\u00a0rents increase for\u00a0existing units and higher quality units\u00a0that cost more are built around the city.\u00a0\nAccording to the SPRC, eviction notices for reasons other than non-payment of rent,\u00a0such as\u00a0renovations that create these higher quality units, have more than doubled.\nThere were\u00a060 incidents recorded by the Landlord Tenant Board in 2010 and 150 recorded in 2018.\u00a0The non-profit said that the board does not track \"informal evictions,\" such as when amenities\u00a0like laundry rooms\u00a0close in a building, influencing its residents to live elsewhere.\u00a0\nThe number of these eviction notices, called L2 notices,\u00a0are highest in some of the most affordable rental neighbourhoods. The highest is in the Corktown and Stinson areas. Mayo said that when people move out, it allows these affordable prices to continually increase.\u00a0\nWhen it comes to rising costs, one-bedroom rentals in\u00a0the downtown core and mountain have seen the greatest increases in average rent, with a\u00a0whopping 40 per cent rise\u00a0from 2010 to 2018. The downtown core is also home to the most\u00a0rental units, while the mountain\u00a0comes second.\nThe mountain, however,\u00a0has\u00a0the largest number of family size units.\u00a0\nAreas with the greatest increase in average rent for two-bedroom rentals are the mountain and Hamilton's east and west ends.\u00a0\nWhen wages don't rise as quickly as rental prices, families need to pay a bigger part of their income for shelter. The SPRC's report says that 45.4 per cent of renter households are living in unaffordable housing, meaning they spend around 30 per cent of their income on housing costs.\nSome are spending even more \u2014 20\u00a0per cent of renters are spending 50 per cent or more of their income on housing.\nMayo said the\u00a0unaffordability rate shows the lack of affordable housing in Hamilton despite being\u00a0talked about as less expensive\u00a0than other places. When the housing market is discussed, she said, the problem is it often comes from a Toronto lens. And when the rates to live in Toronto are so high, it can paint a distorted picture of the rates in Hamilton.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0percentage of people using a high amount of their income is in line with\u00a0the provincial average \u2014\u00a045 per cent of people use 30 per cent of their income on rent, where 20.9 per cent use half of their income on average.\u00a0\u00a0\nMayo said\u00a0this highlights how people are struggling.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Because Hamilton has 'low rent,' it's seen as 'oh, it's not as much of an issue,'\" she said. \"Rents are cheaper here, but incomes are lower in Hamilton, so we still have affordability challenges despite lower rents.\"\u00a0\nShe added that people might feel pressured to stay in an area despite difficulties\u00a0because of the intimidating and unaffordable prices out there.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"People really feel trapped,\" she said. \"If they need to move because their job is in a different part of the city, well they can't move because if they leave their apartment, they'll leave affordable rent.\"\nThe non-profit\u00a0references a report from the think-tank Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, which shows that someone earning minimum wage would have to work 54 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Hamilton.\u00a0\nFuture bulletins from the non-profit will focus on impacts to renters and the difficulties they face, as well as the buildings they live in.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "What drives the cost of condo insurance?", "description": "In some cases, the rates are soaring but it's not a simple calculation", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/we-answer-your-burning-questions-about-things-like-milk-bags-tariffs-condo-insurance-and-printer-cartridges-1.5409407/what-drives-the-cost-of-condo-insurance-1.5409416", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4815823.1541373859!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancouver-rental-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 03, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-01-03T09:00:00.485Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "The insurance business is all about risk \u2014 so is that what's driving some condo insurance policies to go up in price?\nTracy Fuller helps explain how the prices are affected by things\u00a0ranging from climate change to extreme weather to the unique nature of condo living versus single-family homes.\nClick \"listen\" above to hear the segment, or\u00a0download\u00a0the\u00a0Cost of Living\u00a0podcast.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Toronto home sales jump 17.4% in December, average price up 12%", "description": "Condos saw the biggest price gains through 2019", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-home-prices-real-estate-december-2020-1.5417505", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5237158.1565097051!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/toronto-home-sales-20190605.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 07, 2020 11:05 AM ET", "2020-01-07T16:11:04.244Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Toronto Real Estate Board says home sales were up 17.4 per cent in December compared with the same month last year, while the average price was up almost 12 per cent in the month from a year earlier.\nThe December jump caps a surge in activity in the second half of last year, while a slower first half meant that overall 2019 sales were in line with annual medians for the decade.\nThe increased sales over 2018, even as new listings dropped 2.4 per cent year-over-year, helped push the average selling price for the year up by four per cent to $819,319.

With an abundance of potential places listed, he would schedule a visit and apply to live there.\nBut last year, most of what Fontaine and his girlfriend Anna\u00a0were seeing was out of their\u00a0price range.\nWhen they did find something close to the $890 per month they\u00a0were paying for their current place, the competition was stiff.\n\"A lineup of candidates [would be] waiting outside the door. Things changed very rapidly from a renting market to an owners' market,\" he said.\n\"So a friend mentioned to us that we could possibly swap apartments and find something affordable that way.\"\nAn apartment swap \u2014 an unconventional way to find a new apartment that exists thanks to protections for tenants in Quebec law \u2014 is not a new phenomenon. But with rising rents and the city's vacancy rate at a 15-year low, housing rights groups say it appears a growing number of Montrealers are opting to swap.\n\"People are struggling to find affordable housing, particularly families but also people that don't have a [good] credit record, foreign students or newcomers,\" said Youssef Benzouine, an organizer for the tenants' rights group Front d'action populaire en r\u00e9am\u00e9nagement urbain (FRAPRU).\nSince the lease is transferred, the current rent is locked in for its duration \u2014 and tenants can contest unreasonable increases with the rental board when the lease renews.\u00a0\nSwapping apartments is like stepping into a time machine where Montreal rents are at the level they were five or even 10 years ago.\nA two-bedroom apartment in Little Italy for $430 a month. A $550-per-month studio in the Plateau, with parking. A three-bedroom place in Villeray for $989 per month.\n\"Most people that are looking to swap an apartment are not in any rush,\" said Fontaine. That was the case for him and Anna. Their place worked for the time being, but somewhere\u00a0a bit larger, a place that would fit their skis and snowboards, would be ideal.\nAnd with limited parking in his current neighbourhood, a reserved spot would save him from getting so many parking tickets.\nSo they had a photographer friend of theirs take photos of their place\u00a0and made an online ad, with the place listed \"for swap only.\"\nThey saw a potential swap posted by two students living in Parc\u2013Extension; it was larger, had parking and even a yard. Because the tenants had\u00a0lived there for years, the rent was under $1,000.\nAn apartment swap is not explicitly defined in Quebec law. What the two tenants are essentially doing is a mutual lease transfer.\n\"Whether it's a swap or a reciprocal agreement or whatever you want to call it, the law still qualifies the tenant as a tenant,\" says Jamie Benizri, a lawyer who represents tenants and landlords with the firm Legal Logik.\nThat means that once you've found an ideal person to swap with, you send your landlord a notice to assign the lease with the name and address of the prospective tenant. Benizri recommends you do a credit check on the candidate and provide the report along with the application form.\n\"The credit check is going to be necessary, maybe even a docket search at the R\u00e9gie du logement, to make sure that there's no pending judgments against that person,\" he said.\n\"Letters of employment are often very, very helpful to build a file. So these three things for me are our pillar documents to show that somebody has the wherewithal and the capacity to replace you as a tenant.\"\nLandlords have 15 days to give the hopeful swappers a response, and the R\u00e9gie says that it can only be refused for \"serious reasons.\"\n\"Really, you can't discriminate,\" says Benizri. \"Now, you can profile and you can do a proper background check to make sure that the person can reasonably afford the rent, but in no other way could you discriminate against the candidate.\"\nWhile landlords are required to disclose the cheapest rent paid at an apartment in the last 12 months upon signing a new lease, that does not always happen. And in the current competitive housing market, a new tenant may just agree to pay the higher price.\nBenizri says tenants can go to the rental board if you find out, after signing, hat there has been an unreasonable rent increase.\nHans Brouillette, the director of public affairs with the\u00a0landlords' lobby group CORPIQ, said the phenomenon of swapping is \"kind of taking control of an apartment without the consent of the landlord.\"\n\"It should be the right of the landlord to decide who is going to live there,\" he said. \"It's very difficult for a landlord to refuse someone.\"\nProspective swappers with a lease below market value have no shortage of requests this year. What's tougher is finding someone who has what you want in return.\nOn Facebook groups and Kijiji posts, swappers often list a specific neighbourhood, size, maximum rent and other requests like pets being allowed or a backyard.\nAnn-July\u00a0Boily-Gagnon is looking for a place to live with her boyfriend. They want to stay in Hochelaga, and she says that\u00a0through swapping, it now looks like that is going to happen.\nAfter making a Kijiji ad for her $660-per-month studio and posting it in a Facebook group dedicated to swaps, the response \"has been quite fruitful,\" she said, and she's now setting up times to see prospective\u00a0apartments she\u00a0might swap hers for.\nTom Dunford acknowledges it's tough for those who don't already have a good lease to see attractive apartments that are out of their reach.\n\"It is very frustrating to see all these great apartments at great prices flying around, but if you don't have anything that's worth trading, then you're very much on the outside,\" said Dunford, who is looking to swap his place for the first time.\nWith a studio apartment in Mile End for less than $600 a month, he says he's getting lots of offers for a place that would be suitable for him to move in with his girlfriend.\n\"Now, with something of value that people want, the Kijiji response has surpassed my expectations,\" he said.\nAfter swapping last spring, Jacques Fontaine\u00a0says he and his girlfriend are\u00a0going to renew the lease on their\u00a0new place.\nHe said all last year's swap\u00a0cost them was $45 to provide their new landlord with a credit report, and\u00a0it was completely worth it.\n\"It's been very, very good for us, and I recommend it to anybody else,\" he said.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Joanne Chianello", "title": "The urban boundary debate is vitally important, so should it happen online?", "description": "Monday's virtual committee meeting a test of untried process at city hall", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/urban-boundary-untested-committee-format-1.5561471", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3314590.1580407926!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ottawa-city-council-table-in-andrew-haydon-hall.JPG", "publishedAt": ["May 09, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-05-09T08:00:00.484Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "There have been many firsts in Ottawa's municipal arena during these\u00a0COVID-19 days, from virtual council meetings to Zoom news conferences to online community open houses.\u00a0\nOn Friday, the latest \"first\" came from Ecology Ottawa and a number of other groups, which held an online rally\u00a0to call for holding the urban boundary steady.\u00a0\nAs far as rallies go, it lacked chanted slogans and crowds waving\u00a0placards. But while it didn't have the visual and audible impact an offline rally might, it did\u00a0attract\u00a0more than 500 people. Who can remember the last time an in-person rally attracted that many people to city hall?\nThe rally is in advance of one of the most important firsts ever at city hall\u00a0\u2014 a major policy debate Monday that will occur\u00a0online, with\u00a0public delegations phoning in their comments.\nThe once-in-a-decade issue is the urban boundary expansion, a policy decision that will literally affect the growth of this city for decades to come.\u00a0\nThe crux of the argument is this: the city says we need to add 181,000 homes to the city in the next 25 years or so.\nThe hold-the-liners want those new homes to be accommodated in existing neighbourhoods and on empty land already\u00a0approved for residential development.\nThe city's planners\u00a0\u2014 and Mayor Jim Watson\u00a0\u2014 don't believe residents\u00a0or builders are prepared for the sort of change communities would undergo if the\u00a0boundary remained steady. Instead, they're advocating to add\u00a0up to 1,650 hectares to Ottawa's\u00a0urban edges.\nMore than 23,000 new homes would be built in these newly urbanized\u00a0areas.\nAnd home builders have suggested that even 1,650 hectares won't be enough to absorb Ottawa's growing population, which the city forecasts at 1.4 million by 2046.\nAdd in serious questions about\u00a0housing affordability\u00a0\u2014 there are many points of contention\u00a0about how, or even if,\u00a0border expansion affects house prices\u00a0\u2014 plus rising infrastructure costs in a spreading\u00a0city, some communities'\u00a0unwillingness to accept dramatic change, and whether expanding the urban boundary squares with the city's declaration\u00a0of a climate emergency, and you've got yourself one messy policy debate.\nIt's hard to imagine, then, why anyone thought the urban boundary debate would be the ideal test-case for something the city has never tried in its history.\nEveryone is figuring\u00a0out how to live with the COVID-19 pandemic, including city hall, where councillors have met for three virtual council meetings so far.\u00a0\nThey went fine, but the public isn't allowed to participate at council the way they are at committee. When council voted in late March to\u00a0allow virtual committee meetings, it directed staff to figure out how to let the public speak, starting with the one on the urban boundary.\nThe rules for the virtual meeting will be\u00a0more stringent than in-person meetings. If you want to give your five-minute deputation, you have to register\u00a0online by 9 a.m. Monday, before the meeting starts. In so-called normal times, members of the public could\u00a0keep signing up to speak right through the meeting, until councillors began debating.\nAnd if you can't or are not inclined to register online, you could have done so by phone or email\u00a0\u2014but that deadline was Friday evening.\nThe mayor argued on CBC's Ottawa Morning this week\u00a0that sharing one's opinions virtually\u00a0actually makes it \"easier for the public to participate in the process, simply because you don't have to go and get daycare, you don't have to pay for parking or come down to city hall.\"\nHe may have a point: as of Friday evening, a whopping 150 people had signed up to speak\u00a0\u2014 and that's on top of the 150 who've already sent in written comments. The last time we saw that kind of action at city hall was for the Salvation Army debate, which spanned three exceedingly long days.\u00a0\nCoun. Shawn Menard, who's been\u00a0calling for the urban boundary to remain steady, said at\u00a0Friday's rally: \"This vote really\u00a0shouldn't be happening at this moment.\"\nHe argued more time is needed to question many\u00a0of the assumptions made in the staff recommendations, from the financial implications of expanding the boundary to the\u00a0declaration that the public wouldn't accept intensification.\nBut perhaps another reason the vote shouldn't happen is because it's a major policy decision being made in the most unusual times most of us have lived through.\u00a0\nYes, there's been a year of consultations.\u00a0 And the city says more than 45,000 people \"have been reached.\" The report's been out for three weeks\u00a0\u2014 longer than is legally required\u00a0\u2014 but during a time when we\u00a0are preoccupied with a dramatic and\u00a0stressful pandemic.\nThe city has argued that the urban boundary question\u00a0must be decided soon because it paves the way for other major policies that follow, including the official plan and transportation master plan updates. But city manager Steve Kanellakos mentioned recently the transportation plan work may have to be put off anyway, due to COVID-19 related constraints facing staff.\u00a0\nSo what's the rush?\nIn fact, there is no legal reason this decision needs to be made now. Council put off a byelection\u00a0for months, so it could certainly have given the public a bit more time to adjust to the COVID-19 reality,\u00a0to start paying attention to issues other than handwashing and physical distancing.\nAt the very least, it could have chosen a less vital issue with which to experiment with an untested democratic process.\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "Housing group wants city to license landlords", "description": "Renters, neighbours, landlords asked to fill out survey by Sept. 4.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-rental-accommodation-study-survey-1.5261705", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3348795.1449156434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/refugee-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 29, 2019 9:01 AM ET", "2019-08-29T13:02:52.361Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "An advocacy group for low-income tenants is urging the City of Ottawa\u00a0to crack down on shabby living conditions by licensing landlords, but landlords say that will just worsen the capital's rental housing crunch.\nThe city plans to come up with\u00a0new\u00a0rules this fall that could affect all\u00a0private\u00a0rental properties, from traditional apartments and rooming houses to student housing and short-term rentals like Airbnb.\nMembers of the advocacy group Acorn Ottawa have been going to public meetings to argue people shouldn't have to live with bed bugs, cockroaches or unresponsive landlords.\nAcorn's\u00a0solution is to license all landlords who own more than three units, and subject them to regular city\u00a0inspections.\n\"Bad landlords don't exist in just one area, or a couple of areas. They're throughout the city,\" said Acorn's Blaine Cameron.\nBut the Eastern Ontario Landlords Organization\u00a0says\u00a0the city simply needs to better enforce the bylaws it already has,\u00a0and target the\u00a0few problematic buildings for which it regularly gets\u00a0noise and property\u00a0complaints.\n\"Let's address those problems. Let's not bring in all kinds of regulations and\u00a0all kinds of cost and bother to the 95 per cent of landlords who behave\u00a0well and are maintaining their buildings well,\" said its chair John Dickie.\nBroad licensing\u00a0of landlords would be counterproductive, he added.\n\"It would discourage people from renting out units, which at this point, that's the last thing that should be done,\" said Dickie.\nAn\u00a0analysis of the rental market for the City of Ottawa describes how rents rose\u00a0sharply between 2016 and 2018, and the 1,123\u00a0new units that came on the market in that time couldn't keep up with 5,388 more renters.\nThe affordability\u00a0and supply of rental housing are\u00a0big issues but are more likely to be dealt with through the new official plan and homelessness strategy.\nMaclaren\u00a0Municipal Consulting, which the city hired\u00a0to\u00a0take\u00a0stock of Ottawa's wide-ranging rental issues, offered the city more policy choices to deal with housing conditions\u00a0in a report this month.\nToronto, for instance, has a registry of large apartment buildings and requires them to deal with pests. Oshawa actually licenses rental housing, but only near its post-secondary campuses.\nAnother option would be to have bylaw officers write tickets when they see an\u00a0unkempt property, the same way they write parking tickets, instead of only following up on\u00a0complaints.\nResidents have until Sept. 4 to fill out a survey\u00a0with their feedback, which will feed into what regulations or enforcement staff recommend to\u00a0city councillors this fall. Any new regulations will not extend to social housing or long-term care homes.\nA second survey on options for regulating\u00a0short-term rentals, such as Airbnb, closes\u00a0the same day.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/programs/daybreaknorth/fear-and-frustration-main-emotions-at-forum-on-seniors-housing-shortage-in-prince-george-1.5343201", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Isaac Olson", "title": "City of Montreal to exercise right of first refusal to turn properties for sale into social housing", "description": "Announcement part of city's plans to build 12,000 more social and affordable housing units by 2021", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/right-of-first-refusal-social-housing-1.5466347", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5466601.1581977835!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/plante.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 17, 2020 2:02 PM ET", "2020-02-18T00:31:47.665Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante says Montreal has identified 300 properties that it will attempt to buy and develop into social housing, using the city's right of\u00a0first refusal.\nThis means the city will have, before anybody else, the chance to buy land or buildings in areas where rental housing is particularly scarce, she told reporters on Monday.\nShe described the right of first refusal as another tool to respond to the city's rental housing shortage and \"offer quality housing at affordable prices and to maintain the diversity in our neighbourhoods.\"\nThe mayor stressed that exercising the right of first refusal is not the same as expropriation, as it only applies to properties that are already on the market and have an interested buyer.\nOnce a buyer makes an offer, the city has 60 days to step in on the\u00a0sale and match whatever offer is on the table, Coun.\u00a0Roger Beaudry explained.\n\"It's going to make no difference,\" said Beaudry, who is the executive committee member in charge of housing. \"It's going to be the city or the private owner that is going to own the land for the exact same price.\"\nThe city acquired the pre-emptive right to acquire property in 2016, in a landmark piece of legislation dubbed\u00a0R\u00e9flexe Montr\u00e9al, which was aimed at giving the city more powers over its own economic and social development and urban planning.\nSince then,\u00a0city has only exercised this power\u00a0to buy land for parks and other public infrastructure\u00a0while the rental housing vacancy rate has continued to erode, finally hitting a 15-year low of 1.5 per cent citywide this year.\nNotre administration se dote d'un nouvel outil pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des Montr\u00e9alais.e.s en mati\u00e8re de logements!

But Oxford fellow and bestselling author of Age of Discovery\u00a0Chris Kutarna says the task is far more complicated than many statisticians like to admit.\nKutarna\u00a0worries that Statistics Canada's\u00a0plan\u00a0to plunge into the ocean\u00a0of \"Big Data\" so\u00a0beloved of\u00a0retailers and credit card companies \u2014 described last week by chief statistician Anil Arora\u00a0\u2014\u00a0will inevitably create bias in the results simply because we are measuring the wrong things.\u00a0\n\"One of the\u00a0terrifying and most fundamental sources of risk is that we only consider what we're now measuring as real,\" said Kutarna, on the phone from London, England.\nFor example, long-standing data sets built on debt, spending, prices and gross domestic product simply close the door on\u00a0values such as family, respect, happiness and species\u00a0extinction.\n\"There is far more that is real and not being measured than there is that is real and we are measuring it,\" said Kutarna.\nOne practical example from his book is the failure of modern statistics to measure the value of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia which, despite providing value to billions, adds less to GDP figures than the old Encyclopedia Britannica which reached far fewer people.\nIn a recent speech, Stephen Poloz, governor of the Bank of Canada, described an economy changing so fast that our statistical models fail to grasp it.\nPoloz paraphrased the Solow Paradox, the observation by economist Robert Solow that\u00a0computers had led to an increase in productivity everywhere but in the statistics. Poloz suggested GDP is\u00a0being understated by as much as two\u00a0per cent.\nOne example he offered was the\u00a0way so many companies are distributing computer services to the cloud, turning whole computer divisions into a budget line item.\n\"How does StatCan deal with that?\" asked Poloz.\nLast week,\u00a0Arora\u00a0boasted to a gathering of the Empire Club that Statistics Canada was respected everywhere as a global leader, but he acknowledges\u00a0it is constantly struggling to keep up with changing technology and the shifting understanding of\u00a0how the world works.\n\"Look, that's what statistics is, right? To take what are evolving concepts, nebulous concepts, things that haven't even taken a lot of shape and then quickly try to turn them into numerics,\" said Arora in an interview.\nThe statistics chief calls it a \"team sport\" where governments and individuals need to decide which of the millions and millions of things that could possibly be measured should\u00a0be addressed by the some 5,000 employees at Statistics Canada. Their job, he says, is to bring scientific rigour to the process, so that the numbers are as accurate as possible.\n\"This is always going to be a journey,\" said Arora, adding\u00a0that finding and incorporating into our figures\u00a0what have so far been labelled intangibles may be a never-ending task.\u00a0\nPart of that journey that those employees are now undertaking is the attempt to mine the immense bodies of information embedded in Big Data, those\u00a0traces of activity we leave behind when we do almost anything on the internet\u00a0from buying to searching. Not only are they readily available for quick analysis but they reduce the employee hours required in traditional surveys.\u00a0\n\"Alternate sources of data are increasing exponentially and we\u00a0have the technologies and the mechanisms to convert them to public good with high quality statistics,\" said Arora\u00a0in his speech.\nWhen it comes to the inadequacies of GDP, a big part of the problem has less to do with Statistics Canada than how we continue to use familiar indicators that may be out of date.\nArora says the University of Waterloo's Canadian Index of Wellbeing\u00a0includes 200 indicators \u2014 from crime and safety to sustainable growth \u2014 most of which come from Statistics Canada data. But it's GDP that gets the attention.\nStatisticians are always groping to find the data sets that matter. But even in areas we think we know and understand, statistics are merely an indicator \u2014 an estimate, of reality. Things we don't understand are, by definition, even harder to measure.\n\"We live in this culture where what is real is what we measure,\" said\u00a0Kutarna, \"That\u00a0the things we measure are reality.\"\nIn which case, a certain amount of healthy skepticism, whether\u00a0about this week's inflation numbers,\u00a0about GDP, productivity or the many other financial statistics that are often offered as solid immutable facts, may well be in order.\u00a0\u00a0\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "What you need to know about COVID-19 in B.C. on April 19, 2020", "description": "Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced three new coronavirus deaths on Saturday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-bc-update-what-you-need-to-know-april-19-1.5537545", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5537752.1587315488!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sherry-ann-walters-vancouver.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 19, 2020 5:00 AM PT", "2020-04-19T23:06:35.130Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "THE LATEST:\nB.C.'s Minister of Public Safety Mike Farnworth\u00a0announced on Sunday morning that he has\u00a0has enabled\u00a0police to issue $2,000 fines for\u00a0people engaged in price gouging\u00a0and reselling of medical supplies.\nFarnworth said Consumer Protection B.C. had gotten more than 800 reports complaining about price gouging.\u00a0\nPeople who fail to self-quarantine after returning from travel can also face fines.\u00a0\nFarnworth said that with most people complying with physical distancing, there is no plan to close down public spaces at beaches and in parks.\nVancouver police arrested 14\u00a0people after a group of community members of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside broke into Lord Strathcona Elementary School on Saturday evening to use it for what they called \"emergency housing.\"\nSpokespeople for the group said the action was taken because\u00a0it was impossible for thousands of homeless people to follow the provincial government's instructions\u00a0to stay home amid the COVID-19 crisis.\nPolice said they will pursue charges of break-and-enter against the individuals arrested.\u00a0\nOn Sunday, the Vancouver Island MusicFest\u00a0announced \"with deep regret\" that the event is postponed because of COVID-19.\u00a0\n\"It's simply too risky for all of us,\" the festival wrote in an email.\u00a0\nThe festival, which takes place in the Comox Valley, was scheduled for July 10 to 12.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs of Saturday, B.C. had 1,647 confirmed cases of the virus and 81 people had died.

Beyond a small front porch is a locking front door, room for a bed and storage, along with a rear window. Each hut would be numbered to allow occupants to have a mailing address.\nThe initial pitch also included providing housing near an area where residents can grow food, a large temporary structure that could house people but also double as a mess hall, community centre and workshop with Conestoga Huts nearby, and\u00a0a campground-style area where tents could be erected with small fences around them. The total price tag was estimated to be less than $3 million.\nStaff who work on\u00a0homeless prevention asked\u00a0people who experience homelessness\u00a0about the idea, but the response was warm at best.\n\"We've not seen anybody express an interest specifically in the Conestoga Hut,\" said Craig Cooper, manager of homeless prevention at the City of London. \"We do have some individuals that sort of forage or live in vehicles or sheds on peoples' property, things like that, so the Conestoga Hut model might work for some of those individuals.\"\nCooper said they mostly see people who are looking for long-term permanent housing.\n\"We do look at different forms and options of housing and recognize that shelters and transition rooms aren't for everybody,\" he said.\n\"So we do look at different models of housing, but the ones that are transitional, they're shorter term and they might be that stepping stone that somebody might need in that moment\u00a0to get to a more permanent housing situation.\"\u00a0\nIn a letter to CAPS, van Holst, along with Coun. Shawn Lewis, noted that they heard there were five homeless individuals who considered lodging in Conestoga Huts.

You have an increase in homelessness amongst a population that typically wasn't homeless before.\"\nRent prices have increased by four per cent since last year, Appleby said.

Combined with a pledge to cut fees by 10 per cent, the Liberals estimated the measures would cost $535 million a year.\nThe presentation can be seen as making a case for more government action in areas where costs are determined by public policy \u2014 unlike prices for things like clothes and gasoline, which are market-driven, said David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.\n\"In that sense, affordability isn't something the market can help with. Instead of getting government out of the way, we need to get it in the way of rising costs for Canadians,\" said Macdonald, who studies the cost of child care in Canada.\nMacdonald co-wrote a report in 2017 that surveyed child care costs across the country. Although prices depend on the age of the child, spaces cost about $1,000 a month on average.\nBut the variation was huge among provinces: in Quebec, where the government subsidizes child care very heavily, median fees were under $200 a month; in Toronto, a space for a pre-schooler cost $1,212 a month, and one for an infant was $1,758 a month.\nThere are also expectations the budget will increase the value of the Canada Child Benefit for children under age one, a pledge the parliamentary budget officer estimated would cost $252 million in its first year.\nGarima Talwar Kapoor, policy and research director at Maytree, an anti-poverty foundation, said child benefits are critical to increasing family incomes, but it is less clear how much they address child care costs.\n\"If I were in government and were trying to address the child care affordability challenges that families face, I'd ask whether further investments in child benefits ... alleviate child care concerns, or whether systemic responses to child care spaces are needed,\" she said.\nInflation in housing costs has stayed just behind median wage growth, helped by \"downward pressures from falling interest rates\" that have lowered the cost of ownership, the presentation said.\nCosts remain high in many cities owing to a shortage of places to buy or rent, though.\nFinance officials calculated Toronto is the most unaffordable city in Canada, followed closely by Vancouver, in an analysis that compared average weekly wages in 12 cities once adjusting for the cost of living in each place.\nElsewhere in the country, there are \"uncertain and regional effects of policy response on jobs and cost of living\" when it comes to the federal approach to environmental concerns.\nLooking ahead, about one-quarter of people nearing retirement might not have enough money to pay for their golden years, notably those without workplace pension plans, the document said. Meanwhile, even the expanded Canada Pension Plan may not \"fully offset the decline in private pension coverage, leaving workers more exposed to risk.\"\nIf people aren't saving on their own for retirements, that might eventually reduce tax revenues coming into the federal treasury and increase money going out through old-age security payments, said Jennifer Robson, an associate professor of political management at Carleton University in Ottawa. That would be tough on the federal budget.\nShe said it's not clear whether an expansion of the Canada Pension Plan \u2014 by raising benefit amounts but also premiums over time \u2014 will be enough.\n\"Government can actually do quite a lot for people at the bottom end who don't have pensions,\" Robson said, \"but the ones that they tend to think about are the ones in the middle.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "What you need to know about COVID-19 in B.C. on April 29, 2020", "description": "2 more poultry plant outbreaks; B.C. extends provincial state of emergency by two weeks", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-bc-update-what-you-need-to-know-april-29-1.5548764", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5548767.1588129274!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-daily-life-vancouver.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 29, 2020 5:00 AM PT", "2020-04-30T00:13:35.799Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "THE LATEST:\nFour more people have died and another 34 infected with COVID-19 in B.C. as the province grapples with a series of outbreaks in meat plants, care homes, and prisons.\nIn total, 2,087 people have tested positive for the coronavirus across the province.

CREA says the average figure can be misleading because it tends to be skewed by activity in big, expensive cities. So they say another number, the House Price Index (HPI), is a better gauge of the market because it adjusts for the size of the market and the type of housing.\nThe HPI rose by 0.2\u00a0per cent on an annual basis in July. That's the first uptick since January.\nEleven of the 18 housing markets tracked by the index were higher, especially in central and eastern Canada.\nThe Greater Vancouver and Fraser Valley areas were down by 9.4 and 6.7\u00a0per cent, respectively, in the past year. Despite the price decline, the sales figure rose by 26 per cent during the month. \"Gains in Vancouver push the market back toward balanced market territory, suggesting the city is through the worst in terms of price declines,\" Toronto-Dominion Bank economist James Marple said of Vancouver's data.\nThe index fell by 3.5\u00a0in Calgary, 3.2 per cent\u00a0in Edmonton, 4.4 per cent\u00a0in Regina and 1.3 per cent\u00a0in Saskatoon in the past year.

It suggests slowdowns in the mining industry will trickle down throughout the economy, affecting the housing market going forward.\n\"The downturn in the mining sector is likely to impact the housing market, as these products provide some support for the housing market in Yellowknife,\" the report states.\nSigns of a slump were recorded in the data for last year, with fewer homes sold and fewer homes under construction.\nHome sales in the N.W.T. capital dropped in 2018, with 240 homes sold last year, compared to 454 in 2017. Construction began on fewer homes as well, with 53 starts in 2018, compared to 65 in 2017.\nDespite this, the average sale price of a home rose slightly\u00a0to $448,721 in 2018, up from $408,290 in 2017. That's likely because most of the homes sold last year were in the upper price bracket, the report says.\nThe report did not have up-to-date numbers on core housing need in Yellowknife, but it did note that in 2016, Statistics Canada found 15.5 per cent of families live in unsuitable, unaffordable or inadequate housing, compared to the national average of 10.7 per cent.\nData suggests the situation is similar in the other territorial capitals, with both Whitehorse and Iqaluit showing a higher core need than the national average.\nThe housing market in Iqaluit remains dominated by non-market housing, which includes social housing and housing subsidized by government and private businesses.\nNearly 25 per cent of rental homes are social housing rented out by the Nunavut Housing Corporation, while another 39 per cent are staff housing for territorial and federal government employees.\nHousing in Iqaluit continues to be \"among the most expensive to provide\u00a0in Canada,\" the report states, with more than 60 per cent of Nunavummiut unable to afford a place to live without some sort of assistance from their employer or the government.\nThe Nunavut government is spending $34 million this year on housing in the territory, including $12 million for emergency shelters, the report states, with 20 new public housing units expected for Iqaluit in 2019-2020.\nDemand is expected to continue to put pressure on the need for housing as high gold prices and investment in new and existing mining projects at Meadowbank and Hope Bay continue.\nHouse prices in Whitehorse rose slightly in 2018, with most indicators showing it was a seller's market, with rising prices and shrinking housing stock. Prices for 2019 are expected to rise again, with the price range for a home between $422,000 and $452,000.\u00a0\nThe rental market, meanwhile continues to be tight, sitting at 2.4 per cent in October 2018, which was the lowest vacancy rate in the past four years.\nThe CMHC report suggests that the population of young adults will keep the rental demand stable even as the population ages.\n"}, {"author": "Elizabeth McMillan", "title": "Forget Toronto.

Their 10-month old son is crawling around, as their greyhound paces the floor before dinner.\nThe couple has less than 800 square feet of living area.\nAnd though they know they could sell their downtown home in a matter of days, alternatives are hard to find; prices in their neighbourhood have skyrocketed since they bought the property in 2017.\nAs part of their home search, they've started pitching themselves in offers to sellers, assuring them they won't convert the property to an Airbnb. They even include a picture of their baby.\n\"It's quite common practice now to give a story about yourself and your family in hopes that they'll choose your offer over someone else's,\" said Dennis.\n\"We're trying to say that we're a young family that has expanding needs and is looking for something we can grow into, something where he can make new friends,\u00a0have a neighbourhood where he can run around and play,\" said Gray.\nThe growth in Charlottetown's housing market is far outpacing markets in many other Canadian cities. Data gathered by the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA)\u00a0shows house prices have jumped 38.5 per cent in the past three years.\nBased on the areas CREA normally tracks, only parts of Vancouver Island and Ontario's\u00a0Niagara region saw faster growth during the same time period. By comparison, prices rose 25.3 per cent in Toronto, 21.6 per cent in Ottawa and 33.3 per cent in Victoria.\nThe latest CREA figures peg the average house price in Charlottetown at $277,000, up from $200,000 three years ago.\nBut a market where buyers get into bidding wars is new for P.E.I., which recently surpassed 153,000 residents. Adding to the housing challenges, the rental vacancy rate in Charlottetown has been hovering around 0.2 per cent.\nIn the past decade, the smallest province's population has grown quickly. Thousands of immigrants have moved to the Island and many homes are being converted into short-term rentals for tourists.\nRealtors say people from other parts of Canada are also buying on the Island, attracted to the relatively lower prices and, in some cases, the investment potential.\u00a0\n\"It does happen, no question.\u00a0People are banging on doors, saying 'I really like your house, are you interested in selling?' And some people say\u00a0'yes, maybe we are if the price is right,'\" said Joel Ives, a real estate broker and the owner of Century 21 and Colonial Realty in Charlottetown.\u00a0\nOther factors driving up the average price are sales of high-end, luxury homes and a demand for starter homes that has outpaced the number of new builds, he said. When new homes do go up, they are more\u00a0expensive than older homes.\u00a0Properties in the $250,000 to $350,000 range are particularly hard to come by.\n\"I think as we get some more supply in, that's going to settle it down a bit more.\u00a0And it already has,\" said Ives.\nWith property and infrastructure getting more expensive, Ives\u00a0predicts young families will have to adapt to moving to semi-detached homes or duplexes\u00a0\u2014 something that is still rare in tree-lined neighbourhoods around Charlottetown.\n\"It's always been somewhat of a struggle. Parents have helped children buy houses for generations and that'll continue,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, some people are moving further outside the city, where it's still possible to find properties under $200,000.\nDian Miguel and Ainsley Kendrick, who both work in tourism, have been packing up their downtown apartment to move to a more rural area.\u00a0\nAfter a lengthy housing search, they heard of one\u00a0property\u00a0the afternoon it went on the market.\u00a0By 10 p.m. that night, they were the fifth potential buyers to visit \u2014 but still managed to nab it.\nWithout money they tucked away while working in Toronto, they said they too would never be able to enter the market. Even still, they've had to pay more than expected for a property that will need substantial work.\n\"We find ourselves looking at our budget every day,\" said Miguel.\nMiguel and Kendrick moved to P.E.I. two years ago, just as prices were rising and apartments had started becoming harder to find. Though the Island's housing prices may seem enviable to their friends back in Ontario, the move was a trade-off. They now earn half as much as they previously did.\n\"For people in an industry like ours, it's seasonal. We're not working for government, nothing is guaranteed for us. If the cruise ships stop coming, there goes half of our business,\" said Miguel.\nThough they\u00a0rely on the tourism industry, they're also\u00a0perturbed after\u00a0seeing\u00a0numerous neighbouring rentals sell\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and then\u00a0reopen as Airbnbs.\n\"It's a catch-22 for us,\u00a0because we want more tourists here, but we don't want them taking up spaces for the community. We think there are other options for that,\" said Kendrick.\n\"The rental market is way scarier right now than buying a house. That's why we made that leap to buying a home;\u00a0we felt we had less risk,\" Miguel said.\nMiguel and Kendrick are both part of a grassroots group, PEI Fight For Affordable Housing, that\u00a0thinks the various levels of government could do more\u00a0to tackle the Island's housing issues.\nDennis said she also worries that people who don't have the means to buy end up trapped living in undesirable rentals.\n\"There's a lot of vulnerable people who have been pushed to live in situations, very close by, that I don't even know if they're safe.\u00a0But where else can they go and what can they afford? We think about that a lot.

But if they don't, they will have\u00a0to contribute to the fund.\nThe number of units designated as social, affordable or family\u00a0housing depends\u00a0on the neighbourhood and the total number of units being built.\nFor example, to qualify for a permit to build 50 or more units downtown, a contractor would have to also agree to build social housing,\u00a0such as co-operatives\u00a0and rent-subsidized apartments, equal to 20 per cent\u00a0of the livable space of their building or make a financial contribution.\nThey would also have to build affordable housing equal to between 10 and 15 per cent\u00a0of the number of units they're building or make a financial contribution, and build family housing equal to five per cent\u00a0of the units in the project.\nWhat counts as affordable depends on the type of dwelling, and where it is located. For example, a studio apartment built at the extremity of the island would be considered affordable with a monthly rent of $585 or less, while a downtown apartment with three bedrooms or more would need to cost less than $2,000 per month to qualify.\nThe proposal falls short of\u00a0Plante's\u00a0election\u00a0promise.\nDuring the 2017 municipal campaign,\u00a0Projet\u00a0Montr\u00e9al\u00a0pledged to force developers to include 20 per cent of family housing units in projects of 40 units or more. These new rules favour a case-by-case approach rather than a quota for all large residential projects.\nThe Plante administration's initiative comes amid a housing crunch in the city.\nDriven by increased demand and rising real estate prices, Montreal's rental market has become increasingly competitive, leaving low-income families especially vulnerable.\nThe vacancy rate in the Montreal area\u00a0dropped\u00a0to 1.9 per cent in 2018, compared to 2.8 per cent a year earlier. The shortage is particularly acute for three-bedroom apartments \u2014 the rate in 2018 was 0.8 per cent.\n\"We're not in a crisis, it's not an easy time, but \u2026 we thought it would be worse,\"\u00a0Plante\u00a0said.\nDespite concerns raised by developers,\u00a0Plante\u00a0said she doesn't think the rules will deter promoters from building in Montreal, because the city \"is where people want to invest.\"\nBut Lionel Perez, the opposition leader at city hall,\u00a0said he believes the bylaw will do more harm than good.\nIn a statement, he said he believes the bylaw will lead to higher home prices in Montreal, in turn forcing families to move to the suburbs.\nThe Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal said that it supports keeping homes affordable for families on the island, but it also raised concerns that making residential development more expensive could put even more pressure on the housing supply.\n\"The vacancy rate is already very low, and any slowdown in housing starts will amplify the effect of housing scarcity and stimulate further price increases,\" said the chamber's president, Michel Leblanc, in a statement.\nC\u00e9line\u00a0Magontier, spokesperson for social housing advocacy group\u00a0FRAPRU, criticized what she called the city's lack of political will and ambition to take on\u00a0developers.\nThe city, she said, is waiting too long to implement the bylaw when real estate speculation is a problem right now.\nYoussef\u00a0Benzouine, community organizer with Project Genesis, said his biggest problem with the bylaw is the option for developers to make a financial contribution instead of diversifying their offering.\nHe pointed to the construction in the Triangle, a neighbourhood in\u00a0C\u00f4te-des-Neiges, where he said in many situations, developers chose to pay rather than build social housing.\n\"We saw that [financial compensation] is one of the loopholes of this kind of strategy,\" he said.\n\"It's better than nothing, but at the same time, it's not enough.\"\n"}, {"author": "Ian Bickis", "title": "Small businesses demand action, not just talk, on rent relief amid COVID-19 crisis", "description": "Government programs trying to keep businesses afloat but many are falling through the cracks", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/small-business-rent-covid-1.5534852", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5517894.1585767032!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/food-court-closed-coronavirus.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 16, 2020 3:28 PM ET", "2020-04-16T19:28:32.656Z"], "source": null, "content": "Small businesses are hoping for promised rent relief from both landlords and government as the COVID-19-related shutdown drags on and their bills pile up.\nThe urgency comes as some landlords have already started issuing eviction notices for businesses that didn't pay April rent, while those who were able to pay are stressed about the months to come.\n\"We don't want to be closed, we're forced to be closed...but we're still every single day racking up costs,\" said Barb Bushe, who co-owns The Point of Light gift shop in Newmarket, Ont.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday his government is working on on a program to help businesses and commercial landlords cover their rents for at least three months. Further details weren't immediately available since the federal government will have to co-ordinate with provinces on the program.\nLandlords, meanwhile, have generally offered short-term rent deferrals on an ad-hoc basis, but Bushe says she wants to see landlords share more of the burden that the mandated shutdowns have forced on the economy.\n\"It's all kind of coming down on our backs ... you can't push the debt down to the bottom (group) that have the least liquidity and not expect other players, mid-level players and large players, to really do their part.\"\nBushe said she's asked her landlord, Metrus Properties, for some level of rent forgiveness to share the burden. The company has so far offered a one-month rent deferral, with interest of prime plus one per cent on the unpaid rent over the rest of the lease term.\nMetrus did not respond to a request for comment.\nTaking a deferral would mean Bushe takes on further debt at a time when there's no clear picture of when the store will open, and what the economy will look like when that happens.\n\"No one imagines the economy is going to come roaring back,\" she said. \"And the money that you lose as you're closed, that money's lost for your year. It's very hard to make it up again.\"\nA recently formed campaign called Save Small Business proposes that the federal government would compensate landlords for two-thirds of whatever rent discounts they give tenants for three months, so if a landlord cuts a tenant's rent by $5,000 a month then the government would pay the landlord $3,300. The group suggests capping the payments at $6,000 a month and only offer it to tenants with less than $5 million in annual revenue.\nThe coalition says that its key criteria for any program are that it is rolled out fast, has broad eligibility, isn't based on deferrals or debt, and national.\nCIBC deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal has also called for direct government support for small businesses to avoid more job losses.\n\"Some sort of rent solution is essential to increase the effectiveness of other programs and limit the pace of increase in the unemployment rate,\" he said in a note earlier this week.\nTal proposed the federal government follow a model put forward by the Rental-Housing Providers of Ontario, where tenants pay what they can and then the government pays the rest. The government then recoups the payments from tenants later on.\n\"That cost-sharing approach towards rent payment would go a long way to ease the financial pressure facing commercial tenants,\" he said.\nWhile Thursday's announcement from federal government promises more support, its main relief programs so far are a $40,000 interest-free loan and 75 per cent wage subsidies, though it has also called on landlords to be accommodating.\n\"We continue to call on landlords to exercise compassion and refrain from evictions during this difficult time for businesses and all Canadians,\" said Ryan Nearing, press secretary to Small Business Minister Mary Ng.\nHe said earlier this week that both Ng and Finance Minister Bill Morneau are listening to small business owners and entrepreneurs and that they \"continue to explore options to provide support in these unprecedented times.\"\nThe response so far contrasts with some other advanced economies such as Australia's model, which has put a hold on commercial evictions and mandated that rents be reduced based on tenant's decline in turnover \"to ensure that the burden is shared between landlords and tenants.\"\nWhile there have been few cases of outright rent reductions from large landlords in Canada, some have shown more flexibility on terms.\nAleem Jima of Premier Eye Care in Calgary said that his landlord, Brookfield Asset Management, has offered a three-month rent deferral on base rent, and while he still has to pay operating costs, the base rent can be paid back over five years starting in January with a slight added per square foot payment.\nJima said he was grateful for the way they had structured the repayment, and that it contrasts with public offers from several commercial landlords offering a two-month rent deferral that must be repaid within a year.\nBrookfield did not respond to a request for comment.\nOther businesses are still working through negotiations with landlords, and trying to push alternative arrangements.\nMark Scantlebury, CEO of Extreme Telematics Corp. in Calgary, said the company is getting hit with both the oil price and the direct pandemic shutdowns.\nSince the company will be under financial pressure for months, Scantlebury is pushing for a longer-term payback or other arrangements that could hopefully satisfy the landlord, such as paying half-rent for a year and then making it up later to ease the immediate shock, while still giving the landlord cash flow.\n\"So you still are getting some money and covering off your cost, and we get half rent for double the period.

But staff say they made lease offers to three co-ops in the wake of that proposal, only to see all three offers rejected because of pricing and terms of the lease.\nSandra Singh, general manager of arts, culture and community service, says the city has listened to the concerns of co-op boards in coming up with the new discussion paper\u00a0\u2014 particularly as they relate to autonomy.\n\"The right and ability of them to manage their membership and to have autonomy over who's in their community is really important to them, and we absolutely recognize that,\" she said.\n\"What we want to do is enable co-ops who have different income mixes to generate or have housing charges that are responsive to those members.\"\nAll four scenarios would call for a minimum of 15 per cent of units to be dedicated to low income housing. And the cost of ground rent allocated to each unit should not exceed 30 per cent of household income.\nIn most cases, the ground rent would inevitably be less than the market use for city-owned land, which means that the difference between the market value and the amount paid is considered a grant.\nThe first of the four co-op scenarios is the most basic, with the co-op paying ground rent discounted from market value according to \"moderate rental income assumptions.\"\nThe second would be tailored to the actual make-up of the co-op by providing additional grants from the city based on anonymous\u00a0figures detailing the actual income and living space of co-op members.\nThe third option would involve redevelopment to make the most effective use of land, primarily in situations where the buildings are at the end of their lives and the site has high economic redevelopment potential.\nThe city says it would work to protect co-op members during and after redevelopment.\nAnd the final scenario would see a co-op choose not to renew,\u00a0in which case, the city would work to find a new non-profit operator for the building and give co-op members the option to stay in their homes.\nRetired librarian Nancy Hammum, who is chair of a co-op working group in False Creek South, says she is encouraged to see the city engaged in the process\u00a0but said the import of all scenarios will lie in the details.\nShe said co-op members are facing the same struggles as many Vancouverites.\n\"We're incredibly aware of millennials\u00a0and our own children \u2014\u00a0who have to pay higher prices if they don't\u00a0live in a co-op,\" Hannum said.\n\"We are supporting affordable\u00a0housing and we'll do what we can to make it work.

In\u00a0Calgary, Edmonton, Regina and Saskatoon, house prices fell.\nThe average house price\u00a0in Charlottetown rose from $200,000\u00a0to $277,000. Of the areas commonly tracked by CREA, only the Niagara Region and Vancouver Island saw higher percentage price increases.\nGreg Lipton, president of the P.E.I. Real Estate Association, said the seeds of the hot housing market were sown with the arrival of immigrants through the provincial nominee program.\n\"They came with a lot of money and they wanted something new, and we didn't really have a lot of new stuff at that time,\" said Lipton.\n\"New construction is very expensive. We're up to close to $200 per square foot nowadays to get anything built.\"\nP.E.I. has been one of the fastest-growing provinces population wise, and immigration has been a big part of that .\nFrom 2010 to 2018 more than 12,000 immigrants came to the Island. But at the same time, P.E.I. has the worst five-year immigrant retention rate of any of the provinces.\nWhen those immigrants leave, said Lipton, they are looking to get a return on their housing investment, so the price of that house goes up a little more.\n\"There's not enough housing here right now, affordable or any other kind of housing, so once again people will pay the price.\"\nBut immigration is not the only driver of house prices.\nVacation rental services, such as Airbnb\u00a0and VRBO, have also been a factor, as property owners have figured out they can get $200 a night for a unit\u00a0instead of $1,000 a month on a one-year lease.\n\"Airbnb\u00a0is something that we were very unprepared for,\" said Lipton.\nThe possibility of higher return has led to an interest in purchasing more properties to convert to vacation rentals.\n\"The duplex all of a sudden turns into, well, it's going to be a triplex. And the triplex is all single bedrooms with a shared kitchen and a shared bathroom,\" said Lipton.\nThat activity is driving up demand and, consequently, prices.\nAnd\u00a0it has led to a shortage in the rental market.\nIn 2018,\u00a0the apartment vacancy rate was 0.2 per cent. Under those circumstances, students are scrambling for a place to live. This is bumping up prices in the vicinity of UPEI.\n\"Anything that's within walking distance of the university \u2014 a single family or duplex or triplex \u2014 the prices on those are getting to be astronomical now,\" said Lipton.\n\"You can rent to a student and get four or five students in a place.\"\nAt $400 each, that can bring in $2,000 a month.\nThis combination of new immigrants creating more valuable housing stock and new uses for housing driving demand has\u00a0created some of the fastest growing home prices in the country.\nIt should be noted, however, that prices in Charlottetown are still some of the most affordable in the country.\nThe $277,000 average represents six years of the median household income in the city. That's about the same as in Halifax, where it is 6.5 years, but well under the national average of 10 years.\nIn greater Vancouver, the average home takes 20 years of median household income to buy.\nBut while those prices may mean it is still possible for a household of median income to afford to buy a home, and recent trends have made it easier for tourists to book their stay and students to find a place to live, Ann Wheatley of the Cooper Institute said lower-income Islanders are being squeezed out.\nWheatley said at the core of the problem is less focus on houses as a place to live.\n\"It's an investment, and it seems today in this market that it's a relatively safe investment for people who have the money to invest.\"\nRecent market conditions bolster the argument for government-owned affordable housing, she said.\n\"A very effective way of dealing with the shortage of housing is to provide more publicly funded, publicly run housing,\" said Wheatley.\nRather than funding private development of affordable units, Wheatley would like to see the government take direct charge of affordable housing, to ensure that it stays affordable.\n"}, {"author": "Jennifer Dorozio", "title": "New house prices drop even more in Calgary", "description": "Number of new houses being built plummets by nearly 16%", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-single-detached-home-prices-falling-1.5360281", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3360794.1451935866!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/calgary-real-estate-home-sales-housing-prices.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 14, 2019 5:47 PM MT", "2019-11-15T16:06:46.587Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Calgary's sluggish housing market continues to see\u00a0prices fall for new single-family detached homes.\nThere has been a 2.2 per cent decline in the average price\u00a0of new home\u00a0since July 2018, according to the New Housing Price Index released Thursday by Statistics Canada for September 2019.\nIt's a downward trend in prices and demand that comes as unsurprising news for Jim Sparrow, a long-time realtor with Royal LePage in Calgary.\n\"The resale prices have been falling for most\u00a0of the past five years since the price of oil fell,\" said Sparrow.\n\"We've sold fewer detached single family homes year-to-date than we did last year.\"\nDespite lower prices on new single-family detached homes, it's the slowest year in real estate sales the city has had in 23 years, says Sparrow.\n\"That's a long time,\" he said.\nAlong with a consistent drop in the prices of new single-family detached homes in Calgary, there was also a drop\u00a0in houses being built in the city.\nThere were 15.8 per cent fewer housing starts for single-family detached homes compared with the same period between January and September last year, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nThis is because there were already too many homes built previously than were needed, says Ann-Marie Lurie, the chief economist with the Calgary Real Estate Board.\n\"The resale side of the market is oversupplied as well. So there is a lot of products available for detached in new as well as in resale,\" Lurie said.\n\"Because of that, that adds that additional pressure on the new home side and is likely causing them to start reducing some of their starts activity.\"\nLurie says there has been an increase in the sales of detached homes in the under $500,000 segment and of apartments, semi-detached homes and half-duplexes.\n\"It's because they are, by far, the most affordable,\" said Lurie.\n\"For many people who, you know, are interested in a specific community, maybe they can't get into a detached home, but attached, that provides an option for them.\"\nDespite it being a slow year, Sparrow says detached homes still make up the majority of sales on the MLS in Calgary, just at lower prices.\n\"Buyers are really hard to find these days for homes in pretty much any price range,\" said Sparrow.\n\"If you're selling your house, you have to take a deep, deep breath and you have to lower your price to probably well below what you thought your house was worth. And even then, you're in for a challenging time.\"\nIt's not all downward trends.\u00a0Recently, sales of detached homes have incrementally increased in the past few months, but not in a significant way, says Sparrow.\n\"That's insignificant in terms of the number of properties sold. It's a really slow market and it's impacting everybody that's involved,\" he said.\nSparrow points to the struggling oil and gas industry in the province as a reason for the\u00a0downward shifts in the housing market in Calgary.\n\"There's a lot of people that aren't impacted by the price of oil. But ultimately, I think they will be because Calgary\u00a0still runs on oil and gas,\" he said.\n\"When you take this many people out of the industry \u2026 they have no choice but to leave the province if they want to make a living.\n\"It starts to take something away from the city.\"\nLurie says that Calgary's population growth is fairly average but that newcomers to Calgary aren't necessarily heading straight into property ownership.\n\"Most of that migration growth into the city has been more in terms of international migrants. So they're not necessarily owners immediately,\" she said.\nShe says that lending rates and competing products on the housing market play their part in the decline.\n\"There's the detached product, but there's also available supply options for attached products \u2026 which gives an alternative for people who are looking for more affordable product to the market,\" said Lurie.\n\"I don't think we're going to have any dramatic change in demand next year unless there's a shift in economic conditions.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "What you need to know about COVID-19 in B.C. on April 20, 2020", "description": "Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry will give her next update at 3 p.m. PT", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-bc-update-what-you-need-to-know-april-20-1.5538001", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5538093.1587386435!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-city-worker-clean-up.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 20, 2020 5:00 AM PT", "2020-04-20T23:36:49.792Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "THE LATEST:\nAs of Monday, B.C. has\u00a01,699\u00a0confirmed cases of the virus.\u00a0 Provincial Health Officer Dr.\u00a0Bonnie Henry announced that 5 more people have died for a total of 86 deaths from the novel coronavirus in B.C.\nA new outbreak has been reported at Chartwell Willow, a retirement community in Maple Ridge.\nHenry says 104 people are now in hospital, 49 of whom remain in intensive care.\nShe has also ordered\u00a0B.C. workers returning from the Kearl Lake project in northern Alberta to self-isolate after seven of them tested positive for COVID-19.\nSo far, 1,039 people have fully recovered from the\u00a0coronavirus.\nMetro Vancouver's transit authority\u00a0announced Monday morning it is laying off almost 1,500 employees and\u00a0reducing bus, SkyTrain, SeaBus and West Coast Express services.\nTransLink\u00a0said it was making several changes in its operating structure in a bid to lessen financial losses during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe salaries of senior executives are also being reduced\u00a0and maintenance, rehabilitation and expansion projects are being postponed.

We just don't want to be clobbered with over-densification and ignoring the existing community.\"\nConsultation on the proposals will close on March 24. Staff will make their recommendations to council in June.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "What you need to know about COVID-19 in B.C. on April 20, 2020", "description": "Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry will give her next update at 3 p.m. PT", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-bc-update-what-you-need-to-know-april-20-1.5538001", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5538093.1587386435!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-city-worker-clean-up.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 20, 2020 5:00 AM PT", "2020-04-20T23:36:49.792Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "THE LATEST:\nAs of Monday, B.C. has\u00a01,699\u00a0confirmed cases of the virus.\u00a0 Provincial Health Officer Dr.\u00a0Bonnie Henry announced that 5 more people have died for a total of 86 deaths from the novel coronavirus in B.C.\nA new outbreak has been reported at Chartwell Willow, a retirement community in Maple Ridge.\nHenry says 104 people are now in hospital, 49 of whom remain in intensive care.\nShe has also ordered\u00a0B.C. workers returning from the Kearl Lake project in northern Alberta to self-isolate after seven of them tested positive for COVID-19.\nSo far, 1,039 people have fully recovered from the\u00a0coronavirus.\nMetro Vancouver's transit authority\u00a0announced Monday morning it is laying off almost 1,500 employees and\u00a0reducing bus, SkyTrain, SeaBus and West Coast Express services.\nTransLink\u00a0said it was making several changes in its operating structure in a bid to lessen financial losses during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe salaries of senior executives are also being reduced\u00a0and maintenance, rehabilitation and expansion projects are being postponed.

Mark Grimes wants city staff to consider hiking the eligibility threshold, saying the current limit\u00a0doesn't reflect average home prices, which hit more than $800,000 by the end of 2019.\n\"It's just astronomical,\" he said. \"So any relief we can provide first-time home buyers to get into the market in Toronto, I think we should be doing that as a city.\"\nWith the current system, even if someone buys a higher-priced home, the rebate works by allowing buyers to skip out on paying the portion of tax that's slapped on up to $400,000 of the home's value.\u00a0\nThat cutoff is thanks to the last council-approved increase in 2017, which boosted\u00a0the potential cash back in buyers' pockets\u00a0by $750.\nBut a new member motion to council from Grimes, seconded by Coun.

Instead, verbal briefings were the standard. (With the notable exception of Jerome Kennedy, personal note-taking was also not common.)\u00a0\nThese were people who were charged with making decisions \u2014 critical decisions, with billions of dollars at stake \u2014 and yet some were not as prepared as one might assume, or expect.\nWe don't know what lessons are being learned at Confederation Building, but it did seem striking, then, that Premier Dwight Ball\u00a0and Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady assembled the media Tuesday to release the Muskrat Falls commission's final report, without giving journalists so much as a few minutes to read it first.\u00a0\nThis may not strike many readers as particularly unusual, but it is. On budget day, for instance, reporters have several hours to sift through a collection of documents to makes sense of it, while also being able to ask technical questions of experts. (More and more, however, journalists covering the budget are doing this while a cascade of politicians come before them to spin what they want the coverage to be about.)\nTechnical briefings are also common when, say, a new government policy is unveiled, or something like a new report on crab stocks. DFO did one of those just last week.\nWith the damning Muskrat Falls report, though, that kind of prepared rollout of information did not happen.\u00a0Instead, journalists were given a report that is highly complex, and which takes time to digest, while two politicians made verbal comments ahead of their reading. Right away, Ball and Coady set the narrative \u2014 noting, in particular, that the matter was being referred to the police.\nNo surprise, then, that this comment was a highlight of media coverage on announcement day. It's a classic bit of political framing.\nThe report itself (you can read all six volumes here) is captivating, sobering reading (as of this writing, I'm still reading it), and not at all likely to soothe the nerves of anyone nervous about Newfoundland and Labrador's economic future.\nMuskrat Falls is entwined with a dismal and worsening fiscal picture for the provincial treasury.\nThe latest report from the auditor general's office, in December, put the government's net debt at $15.4 billion. Julia Mullaley, who just this week moved from the auditor general's office to run Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corp., noted that works out to $29,250 per person, a new record high.\nIt's not just Muskrat Falls that has been racking up the debt. For every single year for the last seven years, we've been putting more debt on the proverbial provincial credit card. Those consecutive deficits add up to $6.4 billion of extra debt.\nMullaley's last report came out just a week after a delayed provincial fiscal update that revealed\u00a0government revenues had fallen sharply, to the tune of an extra $392 million.\n\"Dumpster fire\" is a metaphor that's being used frequently to describe the state of things with the government's finances.\nWhat's concerning is that latest news about the current shortfall and the cumulative debt were both revealed before two crises that emerged in the new year: a collapse in oil prices and COVID-19.\nJudge determines $12.7-billion dollar hydro mega-project was a misguided mistake; oil slightly above $35.00 per barrel; schools run out of hand sanitizer\u2026 and we might be headed to the polls before July. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlpoli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#nlpoli</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ukD2qRyNKU\">pic.twitter.com/ukD2qRyNKU</a>\nThey're not unrelated, although the cliff-like drop in oil prices involves OPEC and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. (If you ever want to get a sense of how comparatively insignificant N.L.'s production is, reading about games that oil giants play will do the trick.)\nThe day before the Muskrat Falls commission report was released, oil prices took their single biggest jump since the Gulf War.\nThe day after the report was released, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. There were signposts of the impact of the novel coronavirus everywhere: all of Italy basically shuts down, Dublin cancels its St. Patrick's celebration, the NBA suspends its season, Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson are diagnosed \u2026 the list goes on.\nAs for oil prices \u2026 well, now. The downward pressure on oil is inextricably linked to the roaring bear that has dominated the stock market for the last three weeks, culminating in what's already been tagged as \"Black Monday\" earlier this week: the biggest single-day drop since the 2008 banking crisis.\nBrent crude, the type of oil that Newfoundland and Labrador uses for budgeting purposes, dropped like a rock going over a cliff. In last April's budget, the government picked $65 as the average price per barrel of Brent crude. (The December update knocked that down to $63.20.)\nWhat will this year's budget put oil at?\nWell \u2026 we're not going to know for a while. The governing Liberals are focused now on electing a new leader, and we won't know whether it will be Andrew Furey or John Abbott until May 9. The budget was pushed back until a new leader, premier and possibly cabinet are in place.\nGiven how many things are being cancelled this week, maybe that's not entirely a bad thing.\nBut in an alley full of dumpster fires, it feels odd that we don't have a plan, at least for now, on how to handle a cluster of crises.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Jordan Heuvelmans", "title": "It's a seller's market, but the London region's housing inventory is down", "description": "LSTAR says that housing inventory is down 50 per cent compared to five years ago", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/housing-market-inventory-down-london-ontario-st-thomas-canada-1.5318009", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5146804.1558629790!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-sale-regina-sask-housing-market-home-house-remax.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 15, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-10-15T08:00:00.136Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The London St. Thomas Association of Realtors (LSTAR) has released its housing stats for September, and they show that available inventory is down\u00a0almost 50 per cent compared to five years ago.\nLondon is known for being one of the most affordable cities in the country, said Earl Taylor, president of LSTAR.\nWhen people come here to buy, they snap up what's available.\u00a0\n\"People are coming to St. Thomas, London, Elgin and Middlesex county because it is so affordable and that is eating up our inventory.

That's a tight squeeze for the average household after-tax income of about $48,000, said Daniel Martens of Martens Financial.\n\"It's still feasible,\" said Martens.\n\"We're getting to a point of it being inaccessible and too costly for Islanders to afford homes. We're at six times income now to purchase a home and things don't look like they're slowing down with home prices. So that's a bit concerning.\"\nWith five per cent down and a 3.5 per cent interest rate, the average family buying the average home is looking at a monthly payment of $1,314, or 33 per cent of their after-tax income. That's right on the bubble of the recommended 30 to 35 per cent maximum spending on shelter, and it doesn't include insurance or home maintenance.\nJust three years ago, that family could be expecting to pay 25 per cent of their after-tax income on their mortgage. If prices and incomes continue to rise at the same rate, in three years that would be 41 per cent.\nThat's a concern for Martens. A 25-year-old client who comes to him with no down payment, he said, will need about three years to save up for one. But that assumes house prices don't go up, so add another year. You could apply for the province's house down payment program. It's an interest-free loan, which Martens said has helped some of his clients, but it is still debt that can add a couple of hundred dollars a month to your payments.\nWith a standard 25-year amortization, that house is paid off when the client is 54. That's not too bad. But consider as well, interest rates are at historic lows. They are unlikely to stay that low for the next three decades.\nIf in 10 years, when the mortgage is coming up for its second renewal, the rates have gone up two or three per cent, that will add significantly to the payments. In order to keep them down, the temptation will be to extend the amortization period.\n\"What that does is now instead of 29 years to purchase your home and buy it could be 35 years before you're able to do it, and you could even be encroaching onto 40,\" said Martens.\nNow our 25-year-old is 65 before the house is paid for, and it gets worse if you start any later.\n\"I'll give you an example of a friend of mine. He's 30 years old he just purchased his first home. The numbers are very similar to what the averages are,\" said Martens.\n\"We've worked out a few different scenarios. But if the worst case scenario comes out he will be 70 years old before his house is fully paid off. That's scary.\"\nCPP and OAS payments would not even cover the mortgage payments. Continuing to work past 65 would be an absolute necessity, Martens said.\nSomething has to give, said Martens. He doesn't like the look of the Island if house prices continue to go up as they have been.\n\"We need mechanisms to help fight it because soon enough Islanders aren't going to be able to afford to live in the province they grew up in, and that's not something that I would like to see,\" he said.\nIn a statement to CBC News, the Department of Social Development and Housing said it is focused on increasing the supply of affordable housing not just in Charlottetown, but across the province.\nThis housing is aimed more at low-income households, but the department said that the rate of construction of new homes overall has increased.\n\"Although we are unable to\u00a0control the market, our goal is to increase the housing inventory for those most vulnerable,\" the statement said.\nHousing availability will be increased by these efforts, the province said.\n"}, {"author": "Nick Boisvert", "title": "City puts plan to tax vacant homes on hold, but the idea isn't dead quite yet", "description": "Tax in Vancouver didn't add many affordable units to the rental market, critics say", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vacancy-tax-delayed-2021-1.5451985", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5452005.1580855489!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/toronto-development.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 05, 2020 5:00 AM ET", "2020-02-05T10:00:00.750Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A proposed tax on vacant homes in Toronto will likely be delayed for\u00a0at least another year after the concept was found to be in need of more investigation during the city's 2020 budget discussions.\nOn Tuesday, Coun.\u00a0Brad Bradford asked the city's chief financial officer to complete a report on the proposal by the second quarter of 2020, after the city's upcoming budget has been set.\n\"We do need a made in Toronto solution.

Still, they argue that enough affordable units enter the rental market to make the system worthwhile.\n\"I think it's definitely a good idea;\u00a0it's a step in the right direction,\" said Raza Mirza, a member of the advocacy group Housing Action for Local Taxpayers Vancouver.\nHe\u00a0added that a vacancy tax should be part of a larger housing plan.\nMirza also\u00a0said Toronto could improve on Vancouver's introduction of the tax by more firmly establishing how many vacant units currently exist and measuring how many enter the rental market after a tax is introduced.\nVon Palmer, chief communications and government affairs officer at the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, said the city should instead give\u00a0developers incentives to build new rental properties.\nHe also noted that determining if a home is vacant can be difficult, and in some cases, potentially infringe on privacy laws.\n\"There are better ways to bring on more rental supply,\" he told CBC Toronto.\nBradford's motion calls on the city to examine the vacancy tax in relation to other initiatives that could boost the rental supply.\nHe said he would wait on the full staff report before committing to the idea, though he expects the tax to be an effective aspect of the city's overall mission to create more affordable rental housing.\n\"When we look at the Vancouver experience that they've just been through in implementing it there's certainly lessons that we can take from that,\" Bradford said.\n\"The nice thing about this is that these are rental units that are, for the most part, built and ready to go.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Stratford accepting applications for affordable housing project", "description": "35 units will available priced at 80 per cent of the local average market rent", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/stratford-ontario-affordable-housing-project-1.5200510", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200634.1562275688!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/britannia.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 06, 2019 6:00 AM ET", "2019-07-06T10:00:00.223Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As local residents cope with an increasingly tight rental market, the City of Stratford, Ont., is accepting applications for a new affordable housing project.\nThe rental building on Britannia Street\u00a0will include 35 units: 20 one-bedroom apartments and 15 two-bedroom apartments, says Eden Grodzinski, the city's manager of housing.\n\"All different types of households are welcome, whether it's a single mother with a child or seniors,\" Grodzinski said. \"It's just open to everybody.\"\nThe units are priced at 80 per cent of the current rental market, which works out to $825\u00a0a month for the one-bedroom units and $1080 for the two-bedrooms.

You don't have a choice,\" he recalls.\u00a0\nThe manager, Marion says, was insistent that electrical upgrades were needed in the aging 36-unit complex in Montreal.\u00a0\n\"It's dangerous for your life, and the bank wants you to leave,\" Marion says he was told.\nOther tenants received the same message \u2014\u00a0and many left, watching as their former apartments were given a fresh coat of paint, new windows and appliances, and the rent went up as new tenants came in.\u00a0\nSo-called \"renovictions\" are up sharply across Canadian cities, complicating an already challenging housing situation.\nIn 2018, there were 37,000 new apartments built nationwide, but demand increased by 50,000 units, according to tracking done by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nThe smallest provincial capital, Charlottetown, has one of the lowest rental vacancy rates in the country. It hovers just above zero per cent, and new Kijiji rental listings last just minutes before apartments are snapped up.\nIn Montreal, housing advocate Martin Blanchard says it's a scenario that has happened before \u2014\u00a0every time vacancy rates drop toward zero, new owners snap up rental stock, renovate the units and increase the rent.\n\"We used to get 50 to 100 calls per year,\" from people complaining about being forced out of their apartments by landlords, says Blanchard, a community organizer with Comit\u00e9 logement de la Petite Patrie, a housing advocacy group. \"Now we get many hundreds every year. It's a crisis.\"\nBlanchard points largely to foreign firms, which are buying up older apartment complexes in Canada's big cities and attempting to jettison existing tenants so the rent can be jacked up beyond limits set by provincial governments.\n\"It's a way of making outrageous profits in a very short time. So they've got a little money put down, you can make a lot of profit, but it involves putting people on the street.\"\nLegislation protecting renters varies from province to province, but often a tenant cannot be evicted simply because a landlord wants to renovate. Renters should be able to remain at an apartment under existing rules.\nIf construction is so significant that a tenant must temporarily move out, the landlord is often required to allow them to return to the unit \u2014\u00a0at the same price.\nBut building owners don't always follow the rules, says Kenneth Hale, director of legal services for the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario.\n\"These kinds of evictions deserve special scrutiny about whether the applications are being brought in good faith.\"\nTenants Ontario urges renters facing these circumstances not to agree to anything and to contact them, though acknowledge they are inundated with calls now as they seek to bring cases forward to the provincial tribunal, the Landlord and Tenant Board.\nMany of the cases that come across his desk involve low-level renovations that, he believes, are largely an excuse to get renters out in favour of those who will pay more.\nThe group has tracked a nearly four-fold increase in renovictions over the past couple of years, with cases reported to the centre soaring from 18 in 2015 to 71 in the 2018-19 fiscal year. It says the actual number is likely much higher, since the advocacy centre can only rely on what is reported to its office.\nHale wants new legislation to better protect tenants from renoviction.\n\"They should take away the economic incentive to evict people. And that would be by putting restrictions on the amount of rent increase that can happen in between tenants,\" says Hale. \"Because right now it's unlimited. And we just see it as an opportunity for landlords to rent-gouge, and that shouldn't be allowed.\"\nToronto city Coun. Paula Fletcher says she wants the provincial government to require that a building permit is obtained before a renoviction, and have building inspectors ensure that the renovation/demolition is so substantial that it is indeed imperative the tenant move out.\n\"I think the Ontario government needs to change the bar for the Landlord Tenant Board,\" she says.\nMarion is still holding on to his basement unit in Montreal, though two-thirds of the other apartments have been vacated, including that of his former neighbour Radina Papukchieva.\u00a0\n\"It was eight months of pressure, and it just became like a psychological stress,\" Papukchieva says.\n\"We had mice. Garbage wasn't getting picked up. They were doing everything to make us feel uncomfortable and unwanted in our own place.\"\nBut Papukchieva and Marion's former landlord disputes that. Abraham Kellner, the manager of the building, says plumbing fixes alone cost $100,000.\u00a0\n\"I can tell you that we did plumbing, electricity, kitchens, toilets, windows, floors,\" he says. \"I mean, it wasn't minor at all.\"\nThe company that bought the apartment tried to do the best for all parties and did everything in good faith, Kellner says.\nKellner wouldn't say how much rent new tenants coming in after the renovations\u00a0are being charged, but denied it had doubled.\n\"It depends on the apartment, but after it's renovated ... it's normal that it's going to be more,\" he says. \"But I wouldn't say double, and in some cases\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it's hard to say, it's a lot of apartments.\"\nPapukchieva\u00a0said she, too,\u00a0is paying more because of the move, going from a monthly cost of $725 to $1,000 just to stay in an increasingly pricey neighbourhood.\n\"They want to simply do cosmetic changes to the apartments, make them look super nice, keep it like that \u2014\u00a0they're not doing anything to the exterior of the building,\"\u00a0Papukchieva\u00a0says.\nSome tenants pre-empt renovictions by offering to pay more to stay. But others aren't given the choice.\nIn Toronto, Ivan Wadgymar resisted an eviction notice \u2014\u00a0but lost in a tribunal because the new owners converted the building from residential to commercial. It was at the hearings, seeing other tenants in the same position, that he says he realized the impact the rapidly growing number of renovictions is having on the fabric of his city.\n\"It took me going to those meetings and seeing people cry who are getting evicted as well to make me understand what a home is \u2026 how important it is to feel that you have a home. And then get kicked out of it.\"\nThe owner of the company that bought his building says they \"approach all projects with the rights and respect of the tenants and the law in mind.\"\n\"We care about our community and we are dedicated to working with our city throughout the process,\" says Basem Hanna.\nBut Wadgymar feels the neighborhood is changing and is increasingly unaffordable.\nHe now helps others fight against renovictions, though he's doing so from a bedroom in his mother's house, because the small-business operator is no longer able to afford rent in the area he called home for three years.\n\"I've been pretty depressed since this happened,\" Wadgymar says. \"I haven't even unpacked my stuff \u2026 I'm still absorbing this.\"\nThe building where he used to live is now fenced off, with construction supplies visible through the windows. His name has been removed from the buzzer on the door.\nWith its proximity to the downtown core, Toronto's Leslieville neighbourhood has become increasingly desirable. Many of its low-rise apartment buildings are more than 50 years old and are being scooped up by companies with a track record for renovictions, according to Fletcher, the city councillor for the area.\n\"I always say we cannot build affordable housing as fast as tenants in these types of rental situations are being evicted,\" she says.\nWhen some tenants in Fletcher's ward got notices to leave recently, she joined them in a protest outside the building. She also wants the Landlord and Tenant Board to demand proof that planned renovations are so extensive, that there is no other option but for a tenant to move out.\n\"There's only a few companies that come in and do this, but they seem to have a plan. Get in. Get the building. Give the notices. Renovate. Triple the existing rent,\" she says. \"It's a pattern.\"\n"}, {"author": "Danielle McCreadie", "title": "Social assistance increases don't go far enough, say advocates for poor", "description": "Despite 5 per cent increase in monthly rates, anti-poverty activists say gap is still too large", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/social-assistance-rates-budget-1.5484120", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5440054.1579901285!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/randy-hatfield.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 6:20 PM AT", "2020-03-10T21:20:41.649Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Social assistance rates will be going up in New Brunswick for the first time in six years, thanks to a $5.4 million boost in the 2020-21 budget presented Tuesday, but will it be enough to close a growing poverty gap in the province?\nThe current rates \u2014 which saw a slight increase of three per cent in April 2014 \u2014 sit at $537 a month for a single, employable person, $887 for single parents and $995 for a family of four.\nCome May 1, the rates will be increase five per cent, according to the budget proposed Tuesday by Finance Minister Ernie Steeves.\nAbout 15,000 people in the main social assistance programs affecting single recipients, or about two-thirds of recipients, will see the increase.\nIn 2021, those rates will also be indexed to the consumer price index, meaning they'll automatically rise with inflation. Other social assistance rates will stay the same.\nDespite the positive increases, advocates for\u00a0poor people in New Brunswick say the gap is still too large.\nRandy Hatfield of the Human Development Council in Saint John said\u00a0the five per cent increase was needed, but\u00a0over the past six years social assistance incomes have been eroded by inflation of 11.1 per cent, leaving people on low incomes with less and less money in their pockets.\n\"For a single person considered employable, the amount of welfare income they received before this announcement was only 39 per cent of the poverty line,\" said Hatfield.\nJean-Claude Basque of the Common Front for Social Justice said the five per cent increase doesn't go far enough in helping combat poverty in New Brunswick.\n\"This budget won't change a lot of situations, because the increases proposed are too low,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"Even the poverty reduction plan that came out last week is not going far enough.

precludes many young, single moms from entering the labour force,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nNot having inflation indexing so far for social assistance rates has left many people in the dust, according to Hatfield.\nWhile the small increases are a good thing, they only go so far.\n\"It provides a level of certainty and a preservation of the purchasing power of the initial amount, but it doesn't go to actually providing real increases,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"It doesn't address the fundamental inadequacies of welfare rates in New Brunswick.\"\u00a0\nThe executive director of Fredericton Homeless Shelters said the increases are \"way overdue.\"\u00a0\nThe rate of \"$535 a month is tight for anybody that's trying to survive out there, with the cost of everything going up the way it has,\" said Warren Maddox.\n\"From the homeless shelter's perspective, any increase to the social assistance amount on a monthly basis is a good thing.\"\u00a0\nMaddox said social assistance rates are increasing,

2015 and June 30, 2018, were either for short-term gain or long-term investment.\nThis was a time frame that saw the real estate market in the cities heat up, with\u00a0bidding wars over homes as well as\u00a0houses selling for record-high prices.\n\"Perhaps unsurprisingly, investment activity became more pronounced as the pace of average price growth increased, which makes intuitive sense since there is larger potential gains to be realized in a market where prices are growing rapidly,\" the report said.\nFor the report, the CMHC defined a short-term sale as a house bought and sold within a 24-month period.\nA long-term investment was considered a home purchased and leased out within 24 months \"since this illustrates that the buyer had no intention of living in the unit long-term.\"\nKitchener saw the most short-term sales and investment activity out of the three cities, the report said.\nThis is \"partly because Kitchener has the largest population,\" the report notes, but \"population size alone does not entirely explain the findings.\"\u00a0\nKitchener has seen a steady rise in short-term and investment sales\u00a0from 2012 to 2018, the report said.\nThat may be in part due to the ION LRT.\nIn 2012, 7.8 per cent of all short-term sales and long-term investments were within one kilometre of an LRT station.\nThat rose to 14.4 per cent in 2017, although the report notes those sales did fall in the first two quarters of 2018, which is also when prices started to stabilize in the local real estate market.\nThe report noted for short-term sales or long-term investments, one in five buyers were identified as being a \"non-local buyer.\" That means the buyer did not have an address in Kitchener, Waterloo or Cambridge.\nThe report said 72 per cent of those non-local buyers were from the Greater Toronto Area, followed by Guelph in second place and Hamilton in third.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "CMHC sees 'moderate overvaluation' in Canada's

inched down from high to moderate over the past six months.\nThat's one of the main takeaways of a quarterly report from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation on Thursday, in which the housing agency looks at some of Canada's biggest housing markets and assesses their risk level based on four factors:\nThe agency looks at these factors, tabulates them, and gives each market a colour-coded grade for how worried it is. Green means there's little evidence of a problem, yellow means there's some reason for concern, and red means there is a high risk.\nNationally, the CMHC\u00a0gives the housing market a yellow. It's the second quarter in a row for that rating, after assessments for the previous two and a half years\u00a0found there to be a high level of concern overall. Across the country, the CMHC says there's little evidence of widespread overheating, price acceleration, or overbuilding. But there's enough overvaluation to warrant a yellow flag.\n\"Moderate evidence of overvaluation continues to be the only sign of vulnerability for Canada as a whole,\" CMHC's chief economist Bob Dugan said. \"Imbalances between house prices and housing market fundamentals have narrowed with declining home prices in the resale market and a growing pool of potential first-time home buyers.\"\nWhile the national picture is looking OK, there are regional pockets of major worry in various places across the country.\nRegina was given a red warning flag for overbuilding, while Victoria, Hamilton and Toronto's markets were also given a red overall because they all scored solid yellows in every category except that one. \"However, conditions for these factors are showing signs of easing in all three centres,\" the CMHC said.\nVancouver used to be on the red flag list, but came off it in the past quarter, mainly because prices have come down a little even as fundamentals have improved \u2014 in the CMHC's estimation. While the city's real estate is still moderately overvalued, there's little evidence of the other three categories, which is why it was a yellow flag overall.\nMoving east from B.C., Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, Regina and Winnipeg all scored yellows overall, mainly because of overbuilding. Otherwise, it's almost all green except for some modest overvaluation in Winnipeg.\nAcross central and eastern Canada,\u00a0Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, Moncton, Halifax and St. John's were all deemed low risks overall, although\u00a0Montreal\u00a0and\u00a0Moncton\u00a0were singled out for overheating, while St John's is showing signs of\u00a0overbuilding.\nOverall, the agency says the real estate market is looking a little better mainly because average prices are ticking down, even as incomes and population levels keep rising.\n\"Combined with declining home prices in the resale market, these dynamics contribute to maintaining the average estimate of overvaluation near zero,\" the CMHC said.\n"}, {"author": "Ashley Burke", "title": "Lack of affordable housing on Vancouver Island forces family to sleep in a tent and a van", "description": "'I don\u2019t know how anyone could hear that story and not be heartbroken': Singh", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bc-housing-singh-crisis-1.5299158", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5299182.1569544219!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/betty-nicolaye.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 26, 2019 8:49 PM ET", "2019-09-27T02:23:36.741Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "\u00a0\nJagmeet Singh learned first-hand Thursday about the affordable housing crunch, when a weeping Betty\u00a0Nicolaye came to his campaign event to tell him that she and her family were living in a backyard because they couldn't find rental accommodations.\nThe NDP leader called her\u00a0story heartbreaking.\nNicolaye says she sleeps\u00a0in a tent and\u00a0her three children live in a beat-up motor home in a family member's yard, because her family can't find an affordable place to live in Campbell River, B.C.\u00a0\nThe 69-year-old has been searching for a house to rent since April, after her landlord put the home where she was living\u00a0up for sale.

The federal government will need to get creative, he said, adding he believes it could play a role in\u00a0\"breaking the logjam\" keeping many people out of the housing market.\nThe workplace is changing fast, thanks to widespread automation and the growth of the \"gig economy.\" Many millennials know they can expect their career paths\u00a0to be much different from those of their parents. Young Conservatives say they would like to see their party come up with policies to address that.\nThirty-three year old Alberta MP Garnett Genuis\u00a0said he would like to see policies that make it easier to work from home.\nMore and more stay-at-home\u00a0parents are operating home-based businesses, he said. Other parents may want to take parental leave while still being able to work on a few files from the office.\nHe said he'd like to see what he calls\u00a0\"family friendly\"\u00a0tax changes that would make those things easier.\nParents, he said, should be able to earn some income while on leave without facing aggressive income tax clawbacks, while the work-from-home tax deduction should be easier to access.\nThe Conservatives also should be thinking about policies to address the spread of automation, and to attract young people to the skilled trades, said 27-year-old Lauren McDonald, a former director of marketing for Premier Ford.\nShe points to the Ontario government's campaign to get young people to consider the\u00a0trades. It's intended to help address labour shortages, she said\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but it also could help young people consider a career path they hadn't before.\n\"When you traditionally think about skilled trades, you think about NDP and unions,\" she said.\nChambers said he wants to see the next Conservative leader do more to grow support among\u00a0minority voters. Doing that\u00a0 could involve everything from attending cultural events to putting forward\u00a0policies that speak to those communities' concerns, he said.\nChambers points to his own experience. His family is from the Caribbean and every year at Christmas, he said, he gets asked why he's a Conservative.\nHe said he believes it's something his party struggles with in many minority communities.\n\"They like our policy but they might think, as a minority, 'I shouldn't be a Conservative,'\u00a0because you don't see a lot of minorities in the party,\" said Chambers, a senior consultant with the PR firm Navigator.\nHe said he's heard people say\u00a0Conservative parties accept\u00a0diversity\u00a0\u2014 but don't necessarily celebrate it.\nTo improve that image, Chambers\u00a0said, Conservatives should take lessons from Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. Back when he was the federal minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, Kenney was a constant fixture at cultural\u00a0community events across the country \u2014 part of a (largely successful) Conservative\u00a0campaign to win over new voters.\nGenuis\u00a0said he would like to see his party tackle online hate aimed at\u00a0minority groups\u00a0as part of a larger emphasis on civil rights.\n\"We have a particular appreciation of the importance of freedom of speech that isn't shared by other parties in the same way,\" he said.\u00a0\"But I think we can and we must do both.\"\nHe cites something he heard about recently through his work as the party's critic on multicultural issues \u2014 an image being shared online of a mock \"licence\" for hunting Muslims.\u00a0\nHe notes that while\u00a0there are laws prohibiting some of the worst online behaviour, it's not always clear that the authorities are as quick to act as some community members would like.\n\"Clearly, there's a problem out there in this space.\"\nTechnology has created a host of policy challenges, from growing automation displacing workers\u00a0to new virtual currencies. Dennis Matthews wants to add social isolation to that list.\nA U.K. government investigation into loneliness suggested it's as harmful to human health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.\n\"It's a bigger question of what type of country and society do we want to build, and how we create a sense of patriotism, a sense of belonging that were hallmarks of conservative movements for so long,\"\u00a0said Matthews. \"How do you create a 2020 version of that?\"\nWhile it's not a problem that can be addressed overnight, Matthews points to social isolation as the kind of policy topic that could get many Canadians to engage with Conservatives.\nFinancial literacy means a lot more than just knowing how to use a bank account, said Chambers.\nHe said he'd like to see the federal government work with other levels of government to make sure young people know more about doing their taxes and how to invest.\n\"I think there are a lot of folks out there who know nothing about how money actually works.\"\nHe said it's an idea his party ought to embrace\u00a0because young people who understand money would\u00a0be\u00a0more likely to support the Conservatives.\nMcDonald, who's now director of\u00a0digital public affairs and campaign strategy at the lobbying firm Proof Strategies, said she knows that the plight of seniors might not be the most obvious policy topic for a millennial.\nBut she said she believes\u00a0many people her age are concerned about older Canadians.\n\"The huge baby boomer, silver wave is coming. They're seeing that and worry about what their parents are going to be [experiencing]\u00a0in terms of health care, long term care, hospital wait times,\" she said.\u00a0\"How are we positioning ourselves to be ready for that?\"\nOn this issue and others, McDonald argues Conservatives need to put more focus on the \"people\" side of policy.\n\"I know Conservatives, often times the language is 'the taxpayer', 'the voter', 'the constituent'. I think turning our minds to the people on the other end of the policy can help us think more intimately about how that's going to affect people in the long run.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "London population growth rate among fastest in Canada", "description": "Forest city's population growth rate last year second only to Kitchener-Waterloo", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-population-1.5464669", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4966749.1546635478!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/victoria-park-skating-london-ontario.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 18, 2020 4:01 AM ET", "2020-02-18T09:01:00.983Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "People are moving to the Forest City at a rate that has made\u00a0London the second-fastest growing city in Canada, according to recently released Statistics Canada estimates.\u00a0\nThe population growth rate of London and its immediate surrounding area in 2018-19 was 2.3\u00a0per cent, second in Canada only to Kitchener-Waterloo at 2.8 per cent.\u00a0\nThe population of London's census metropolitan area, which includes Strathroy and St. Thomas, is projected at\u00a0545,441 as of July 2019, making it almost a certainty that London has now pushed past half a million people.\nThe population figures are estimates Stats Can publishes regularly based on data extrapolated from census years. The last census year was 2016 and the next one is coming up next year.\u00a0\nWestern University sociology professor\u00a0Michael Haan, who is the Canada research chair in migration and ethnic relations, says one big factor is that London is doing a better job of attracting immigrants.\u00a0\nA few years ago, Haan was involved in research that flagged London was lagging as a destination for new immigrants.\u00a0\n\"London wasn't on the map until recently,\" he said.\u00a0\nBut that's changed due to a few factors.\u00a0\nHaan said one big plus is that Fanshawe\u00a0College and Western University are actively recruiting international students. In 2016-17 just under 10,000 international students came to London across all academic classes. He believes that number has\u00a0continued to grow.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"And those count in terms of the population estimates that Stats Can releases,\" he said.\u00a0\nAlso, the city in 2018 approved\u00a0a newcomer strategy, with a full-time immigration specialist focused on getting newcomers to Canada to consider London as their\u00a0landing spot. There's also a city website with links to information newcomers need.\n\"In the past, we weren't welcoming our share of newcomers, so the city rightly decided that they needed to become a little bit more proactive in attracting people,\" said Haan, who helped with research for the strategy.\u00a0\nAnother boost for London is the recent growth of the U.S. economy.\u00a0\n\"When that happens, manufacturing hubs like London tend to rebound a bit,\"\u00a0said Haan. \"So it's possible that people who\u00a0left during the downturn are now returning.\"\u00a0\nAnother plus for London is that despite a steady surge in real-estate prices in recent years, it still remains an affordable market for many of those who feel priced out of Toronto and other larger Canadian cities.\u00a0\nHe says an important component of this\u00a0is that London has housing options for aging Baby Boomers who've had enough of raking leaves and shovelling snow.\n\"London's housing market seems to appeal to people as they exit the labour market,\" said Haan. \"My hunch is that we're picking up some retirees from places like Toronto where people can liquidate their housing assets and move to a place like London with money in their pockets.\"\n\"A lot of the new housing types are being set up for people in their elder years,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Housing in Yukon: An election issue with no clear solution", "description": "'It's a community problem and we all need to be a part of the solution,' says Kwanlin D\u00fcn Chief Doris Bill", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-housing-affordability-election-1.5327251", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5327391.1571441543!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/whitehorse-real-estate.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 20, 2019 8:00 AM CT", "2019-10-20T14:00:00.725Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It's an issue that's come up throughout the federal election campaign in Yukon \u2014 affordability. More specifically, the affordability of housing.\nReal estate in Whitehorse\u00a0is\u00a0booming, and has been for a while. House prices have been on a steady upward climb in recent years. Rentals are hard to come by.\nThe most recent data from the Yukon Bureau of Statistics put the average house sale price in Whitehorse in the second quarter of 2019 at a record-high $529,500 \u2014 a 10.5 per cent increase from a year earlier. The average condo went for $354,700.\n\"We have a shortage of affordable housing \u2014\u00a0entry-level type housing,\" said Marc Perreault, president of the Yukon Real Estate Association.\n\"It pushes people into having to buy homes that are more expensive than they would like to, or could, or can. And it pushes the prices up because people are getting the prices they're asking for homes ... we've seen it for years now, and it's a difficult issue to address.\"\nFor Cory Levasseur and his partner, it was enough to drive them out of the territory. They originally moved up from Ontario last year when his partner found work in Yukon as a firefighter, but after a year they reluctantly decided to go back.\n\"To just find a, you know, just a house or apartment that would be affordable on our budget, it was next to impossible to find,\" Levasseur said.\n\"It was bittersweet. I did not want to leave \u2014 at all. And I still think about it every day.\"\nFor Meg Grudeski, housing coordinator for the Yukon Anti-Poverty Coalition, it's not just a matter of building more houses \u2014 although that's part of it.\nShe says Yukon simply does not have enough options for people with varied needs and financial resources.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Housing is growing as an issue as we see income disparity continue to expand \u2014 so the gap between folks who are on fixed income or low income, and folks who aren't, is getting larger,\" Grudeski said.\n\"There is a continuum of housing that needs to be available.\"\u00a0\nThat also means looking beyond Whitehorse, she says. Some people in Whitehorse may want to move back to their home communities, where housing is more affordable \u2014 but they won't if it means they can't access the services they need.\n\"People have to make very difficult decisions,\" she said.\nGrudeski\u00a0thinks it's something the federal government should take seriously, and partner\u00a0with local governments to find solutions.\u00a0\nDoris Bill,\u00a0chief of the Kwanlin D\u00fcn First Nation in Whitehorse, agrees. \u00a0\n\"Affordable housing is really a big issue in the territory. And I just really hope that whichever federal party gets in and forms government would make it a priority,\" she said.\n\"It's a community problem and we all need to be a part of the solution.\"\nSome in Whitehorse, including the Real Estate Association, have high hopes for the First Nation's plan to offer up land for lease on its territory. That could happen by next year.\nBut Bill says that's not the whole solution.\n\"It's not. It's maybe a portion of the solution, but there are other solutions out there that we need to explore,\" she said.\n\"Housing Yukoners\u00a0is not Kwanlin D\u00fcn's problem. It is everyone's problem. And government has a role in that.\" \u00a0\nYukon's federal candidates were asked for their take. They were asked how big of an issue they\u00a0think\u00a0housing is, and what solutions they might propose.\u00a0\nHere are some of their emailed statements, provided to Radio-Canada. They have been edited for length.\nLarry Bagnell, Liberal\n\"As I have said through out the campaign, the most important issues are climate change and housing.\n\"We have already funded a number of housing projects in the Yukon, both in Whitehorse and the communities. We have over 25 housing or homelessness initiatives with Yukon First Nations. But there is much more to do.\u00a0\n\"Starting\u00a0in 2020, we will implement the Canada Housing Benefit, a program that will assist over 300,000 families and provide an estimated average of $2,500 per year to each household that is having difficulty affording their rental payments.\u00a0\n\"Budget 2019 introduced the First Time Homebuyer's incentive, to help 100,000 first time home buyers, by having the federal government purchase up to 10 per cent\u00a0of their mortgage, thus making their mortgage payment lower.\u00a0\n\"We have also announced, that we would provide up to $40,000 interest free loans to up to 1.5 million Canadians to make their homes more energy and cost efficient, thus more affordable.\"\nJustin Lemphers, NDP\u00a0\n\"Access to housing is a critically important issue in Yukon. Without a safe place to call home, people are increasingly vulnerable and living at risk.\u00a0\n\"A New Democrat government will partner with provinces, territories, and municipalities to\u00a0create half a million units of affordable housing over the next 10\u00a0years. This will include social housing, community, and non-market housing, as well as co-ops. We'll make sure that affordable housing investments go to rural and northern communities too.\n\"We will spur the construction of affordable homes by\u00a0waiving the GST in Yukon\u00a0on the construction of new affordable rental units \u2014\u00a0a simple change that will help get new units built faster and keep them affordable for the long term.\n\"We will re-introduce\u00a030-year terms to CMHC insured mortgages\u00a0on entry-level homes for first time home buyers allowing for\u00a0smaller monthly payments.\n\"We'll also double the Home Buyer's\u00a0Tax Credit to $1,500\u00a0to help people with closing costs.\"\nLenore Morris, Green\n\"Housing is likely the number one\u00a0local issue in Yukon. Lack of access to affordable housing is a territory-wide problem but is most acute in the First Nations communities.\u00a0\n\"The solution is to build new affordable housing and\u00a0to renovate some of the existing housing. We need to increase our stock of public housing but I would also like to see incentives provided to private developers/builders, to build affordable housing, especially rental housing, rather than more high price condos and homes. I would also like to see this construction used as an opportunity to increase skills and capacity, in the communities in particular \u2014\u00a0to create jobs for people living there.\"\nJonas Smith, Conservative\n\"If we are going to attract, recruit and retain the workers we need across all sectors from health care and mental health services to responsible mineral development and aviation, the access to land availability and therefore accessible housing development costs is crucial to our territory's sustainability and self-determination.\n\"We are committed to tax cuts for small businesses, seniors and young families alike. We will eliminate the carbon tax and the GST on home heating fuel; a necessity here in the territory.\n\"I will work to ensure Yukoners have more money in their pockets, which can be allocated to their sheltering needs.\u00a0\n\"This, paired\u00a0with\u00a0what I think is one of the federal government's largest and most\u00a0important\u00a0roles; which is to support Yukon First Nations governments and their respective development corporations, with their land availability process, in order to make housing development costs more attainable for Yukoners.\"\nJoseph Zelezny, People's Party\n\"Housing is important just like everything else but more government interference is not the answer. The markets are inflated thanks to cheap debt and higher government fees and taxes. The incentives that exist in some cases due to government interference are backwards and also the value of houses reflect in part the devaluation of Canadian dollars.\n\"Cutting taxes and reducing the influence of government in\u00a0people's lives and repealing the economy-killing regulations like Bill C-69 and the carbon tax will enable prosperity and wage growth which will allow for a rebalancing between the value of a home and annual income. The gap is too great.\n\"Immigration numbers also must be reduced nationwide to reduce demand on limited supply.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "West End renter accuses developer of dirty tricks over relocation agreement", "description": "Longtime Reliance Properties tenant says he'll be stuck with $1,000 monthly rent increase from the company", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/west-end-renter-accuses-developer-of-dirty-tricks-over-relocation-agreement-1.5418037", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5423350.1578698774!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/relocation-agreement-dispute.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 10, 2020 10:07 PM PT", "2020-01-11T06:07:08.551Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A former resident\u00a0of a three storey walk-up in the West End\u00a0is accusing a developer of dirty tricks that\u00a0will result in a monthly rent increase\u00a0of $1,000, far beyond what he can afford or what is allowed under provincial legislation.\n\"We are about to be forced out of Vancouver at the hands of a real estate developer that is violating B.C. law and an agreement we have with them,\" said Kian Gray.\nIn 2016 Gray and his husband signed a tenant relocation\u00a0contract with Reliance\u00a0Properties\u00a0when they agreed to moved out of their home of 17 years to make way for a recently completed\u00a022-storey highrise at 1188 Bidwell.\nPart of the deal stipulated\u00a0that the\u00a0couple could rent in\u00a0the new building at the same rate they were being charged in the old one for two years \u2014 approximately\u00a0$1,400 per month.\nBut Gray says the tenancy agreement they've been handed by Reliance for the new building quotes the\u00a0market rate of\u00a0$2,400 per month, which they will have to pay. The company will then give out $1,000 monthly rebates for\u00a0the first two years\u00a0to comply with the relocation contract.\n\"They provide you with 24 months worth of post-dated cheques to cover the difference and ... at the end of the term you'll start paying $2,400,\" he said. \"We are not going to agree to these terms or sign a new lease that will allow them to do these things.\"\nGray says the structure of the agreement allows Reliance to effectively skirt\u00a0the Residential Tenancy Act's maximum annual allowable rent increase by locking in the higher value.\nThis year B.C.'s maximum annual allowable rent increase was set at 2.6 per cent. That's compared to the 58.3 per cent spike Gray faces when his rent goes from $1,400\u00a0to $2,400.\n\"Unfortunately we've spoken to our lawyers and apparently [Reliance] found a grey area in the way they worded [the contract],\" he said.\u00a0\nIn a statement, Reliance Properties\u00a0President and CEO Jon Stovell said the relocation agreement\u00a0exceeded tenant entitlement and obligations under the City of Vancouver's tenant relocation policies.\u00a0\n\"If they choose to move to the new 1188 Bidwell, they will be in a new unit in a new building with amenities, yet continue to pay their old rent for another two years,\" said Stovell.\u00a0\"That means for almost five years, Reliance Properties is providing significant monetary value by charging an old rent rate in a market where rents have doubled.\"\nAs per the tenant relocation agreement, Gray and his husband have been renting in a different Reliance property while awaiting the completion of the new building.\nGray said back in 2016 a City of Vancouver lawyer assured them that Reliance could only increase rents by the provincially mandated amount because it was law.\n\"The\u00a0City of Vancouver really failed us,\" he said. \"The City of Vancouver really did not do its research and placed far too much faith\u00a0in what the developers would do.\"\nHe said because of the assurances, he even agreed to speak at city hall on behalf of the redevelopment to help Reliance secure the permits it needed to start construction.\nThe City of Vancouver has yet to grant\u00a0Reliance an occupancy permit for 1188 Bidwell Street, saying in a statement to CBC\u00a0that it would not be issued until the final Tenant Relocation Plan report is deemed satisfactory by\u00a0the general manager of arts, culture and community services.\nReliance has made two other options available to seven former tenants.

The timber export market is in steep decline, especially in the United States where housing starts have slowed and timber prices have dropped, said Donaldson.\n\"From November to the end of February, we were averaging over $400 for 1,000 board feet for lumber exports to the U.S. and now, checking today, we're about $319 for 1,000 board feet,\" Donaldson said at a news conference. \"That's a significant drop in a short period of time.\"\nBut he said if export markets start to rebound, many of the curtailed mills can start up operations.

It was too cold. Yet, it is a sign that harvest time is getting closer.\u00a0\nHowever, many Canadian farmers are worried that a delay in the arrival of temporary foreign workers because of COVID-19 could result in decreased production, possible food shortages and, in turn, increased prices.\u00a0\n\"On a good day we can harvest 20,000 pounds of asparagus,\" says John Jaques of Sunshine\u00a0Asparagus Farms in Thamesville, Ont.\u00a0\n\"If we don't have labour and if we aren't capable of getting it out of the field and getting it packed, you know, that could be $40,000 worth of product there.\"\nAsparagus is one the first fresh vegetables harvested in Ontario every spring. Jaques, like thousands of other farmers across Canada, relies on temporary foreign workers. He has been hiring workers to help with the harvest for the past 20 years.\nHe was expecting 30 workers to arrive by April 24 from Mexico, ready for harvest the first week of May. Now he is not sure when they will all arrive.\u00a0\n\"We need all hands on deck to get it out of the field,\" says Jaques, whose farm has been in the family since 1850.\nEvery year,\u00a0 the Canadian agricultural industry employs about 60,000 temporary foreign workers. When Canada closed its border on March 21 to non-essential travel, it initially included these workers. They have since been granted an exemption due to the labour-intensive nature of Canada's agriculture industry, but even so, it's unclear how many will come this season.\nJaques is hoping some of the workers he employs will arrive at his farm next week. But flight schedules to Canada have been erratic, and once workers do arrive in the country they must be quarantined for 14 days. All these factors could delay his harvest further.\u00a0\n\"One of the things that COVID is doing is it's revealing to us a bunch of areas where our food system is vulnerable, and one of those areas is labour,\" says Evan Fraser, director of the Arrell Food Institute at the University of Guelph.\u00a0\n\"I think it's going to [create] a whole bunch of disruptions. The fact that we aren't able to get labour in the sort of seamless or frictionless way as we're used to means that planting will be delayed, and that things like pruning apple orchards won't happen with the same level of efficiency.\"\nIt's not just farmers who are dealing with COVID-19-related uncertainty.\nDel-Leon Walker arrived in Nova Scotia from Jamaica earlier this week to work on Charles Keddy's strawberry farm for his 14th season. He says it was hard to leave his wife and two children at an unpredictable time.\n\"They were feeling sad, but I sat with them and we talked about it, and they understand what we are going through and it's a pandemic, it's all around. It's here and it's in Jamaica,\" says Walker. \"So we just have to do what we have to do and just be safe.\"\nWalker says he also knows of someone who decided not to come to Canada to work on the harvest this year for fear of contracting the virus.\n\u00a0\"We understand that there are a lot more cases here, but we still made the decision to be here \u2026. This is work, and without work we will not survive.\"\nHe is currently in quarantine in his own room on-site at the farm. Walker is being paid for his time in quarantine, but is anxious to get to work.\u00a0\n\"We understand this is a serious time,\" he says. \"And we are happy with the work we have done over the years.\"\nBack\u00a0in Ontario, Jaques is renovating the bunkhouses for the workers in order to accommodate for physical distancing. He's also retro-fitting farm equipment so they don't sit so close together on harvest aids, as well as purchasing more to make up the shortfall.\n\"Some farmers are saying I don't have the bunkhouses to house my workers, so I'm only bringing in half as much, we're only going to pick half our crop. So there will be [production issues], I think that supplies will be tight.\"\nAt his on-site processing facility, where asparagus is bundled as well as pickled and put in jars, fewer workers will be able to work the line in order to accommodate physical distancing, further slowing production.\nAll of which increases Jaques' costs, and may cut into production.\nAnd that could mean higher prices at the checkout aisle.\u00a0\n\"I hope the prices are higher, because in order to cover the extra costs I think we need to have a higher price. But we'll see what happens \u2026 I don't make those decisions,\" says Jaques.\u00a0\nLast week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a program offering $1,500 per temporary foreign worker to each farmer to help recoup things like extra housing and equipment costs. But that does nothing to offset the delay in getting people to start work.\u00a0\n\"Our system is really struggling right now to figure out what to do in the absence of this labour or having this labour come in at a much smaller, slower rate,\" says Fraser.\n\"Perhaps some items that we used to get from Ontario farms may not be as plentiful this year, and they may be more expensive.\"\u00a0\nBut Fraser also says consumers should not worry.\u00a0\n\"I'm seeing heroic, Herculean efforts by our farmers, our food processors and by government to try to keep the system moving along as effectively as possible.\"\nThe issues with migrant workers could also be an opportunity for Canadians looking for work. An Instagram account @HelpCanadaGrow and a Facebook page were\u00a0 launched last week to connect local people\u00a0with farmers to help fill the labour gap.\u00a0\nQuebec, expecting a shortfall of 3,000 workers, has also announced a program to recruit 8,500 Quebec workers for the agricultural sector.\u00a0\nJaques has started looking at training local help to fill the gap at his farm, and some nearby families have also offered to help out in those crucial first few weeks of harvest. But he still expects a tough season ahead.\u00a0\n\"It's still a long road ahead. I think it's going to be a challenge training new workers.\"\nHe also hopes for a few more cold nights to delay harvest until his workforce is ready.\n\"I'm sure Mother Nature will co-operate. She always does.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Housing market rebounded in May from record lows earlier in the year, CREA says", "description": "Number of home sales inching higher, but prices still lower than they were in 2018", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/housing-market-may-crea-1.5175460", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4855461.1560521865!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cmhc-20180731.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 14, 2019 10:24 AM ET", "2019-06-14T16:18:13.053Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "May was the best month for home sales in 16 months, the Canadian Real Estate Association said Friday, as activity in big cities such as Toronto and Vancouver helped the national market rebound from the doldrums earlier this year.\nThe group that represents 130,000 realtors across Canada said the number of homes sold in May was\u00a01.9 per cent higher than it was in April. That's a modest uptick, but it's the third straight month that the figure has risen since activity plunged to its lowest level in more than six years in February.\nSales in May came in\u00a08.9 per cent higher than the trough they plunged into that month.\nCREA says about half the markets across the country actually saw slower sales in May, but big cities such as Toronto and Vancouver saw gains, which offset declines elsewhere.\nToronto Dominion Bank economist Rishi Sondhi said May's numbers suggest a modest rebound is underway, after a slowdown in 2018 and into this year.\n\"Home sales continued their improvement in May, stoked by healthy labour markets and the recent slide in mortgage rates,\" he said.\u00a0\"Furthermore, markets have had additional time to adjust to federal and provincial policy measures, which weighed significantly on activity last year.\"\nWhile sales seem to be rebounding, there are\u00a0still weakness on the price side.\nThe Multiple Listing Service House Price Index \u2014 a figure that CREA tabulates by aggregating sales prices across different types of housing, in different markets, in order to assess the overall market \u2014 inched down by 0.2 per cent in May compared to April, and by 0.6 per cent compared to where it was a year ago.\nThe MLS HPI spent most of the past decade posting nothing but annual gains of between three and 20 per cent, before flipping into negative territory for the past five months.\nThe slump means CREA's index of prices is now 1.4 per cent below the peak it hit in December. But there are wide variations across the country, punctuated by large declines through most of B.C. and the Prairies, and modest to strong gains in Ontario and points east.\nCREA\u00a0chief economist Gregory Klump blamed the mortgage stress test implemented in early 2018 for continuing to whipsaw the balance between supply and demand.\n\"The mortgage stress test continues to present challenges for homebuyers in housing markets where they have plenty of homes to choose from but are forced by the test to save up a bigger down payment,\" he said.\nMay was the busiest month for home sales in Canada since the federal government made it harder to get a mortgage in January 2018.\n\"Hopefully the stress test can be fine-tuned to enable homebuyers to qualify for mortgage financing sooner without causing prices to shoot up,\" Klump said.\nThe average price of a Canadian home sold in May was $508,000, CREA said. But stripping out big, expensive markets in Toronto and Vancouver from the calculation causes the average to drop by $111,000, to slightly less than $397,000.\n"}, {"author": "Karina Roman", "title": "By the numbers: Federal projected spending on direct supports due to COVID-19 hits $145B", "description": "Add in deferrals, credit supports and liquidity measures, and the response is in the hundreds of billions", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-19-economic-programs-1.5543092", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5542531.1587686579!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-coronavirus-ottawa-business-closed.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 24, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-04-24T20:17:52.345Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The federal government's latest projection of how much it will spend on direct support for Canadians to get through the COVID-19 crisis has now reached more than $145.6 billion.\nThose direct support programs account for approximately one fifth of the overall tally of the measures the government has announced related to the pandemic.\nOttawa estimates that overall total\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including\u00a0measures to\u00a0protect Canadians health and safety and to provide\u00a0business and tax liquidity support as well as the direct support for individuals, businesses and sectors\u00a0\u2014\u00a0amounts to more than $817 billion.\nBut much of that is not spending that will end up on the books. For example, a large portion, $300 billion, is a measure by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OFSI)\u00a0to free up capital for the banks.\nAnother big part of that overall total are tax deferrals and credit and loan guarantee programs:\nBut while there is a cost associated with those programs, deferrals, credit support\u00a0and monetary\u00a0measures essentially just put\u00a0off when the government gets paid.\nIt's the additional emergency funding and the direct support measures that will have the biggest impact on the deficit and debt in the government's financial books.\nHere are some of the most significant ones.\nThe biggest single program is the Canada emergency wage subsidy, or CEWS, which is aimed at covering up to 75 per cent of wages for businesses so that they don't have to lay people off. The Canada Revenue Agency has an online calculator to help businesses figure out how much they could get. The online portal to apply is expected to open Monday, with money starting to flow the week of May 4.\nThe fastest program out the door is the Canada emergency relief benefit, or\u00a0CERB, which has temporarily absorbed most Employment Insurance claims as well. It provides $2,000 a month for four months. The government has received more than nine million applications as of April 21, resulting in $21.3 billion in payments so far \u2014 so the price tag here may rise. And the government hasn't ruled out extending the benefit past the four months.\nThe Canada emergency business account, or CEBA, makes available, through banks, interest-free loans of $40,000 to qualifying businesses. Up to $10,000 of that amount is forgivable. The government says 428,000 small businesses have been granted loans as of April 24.\nAn\u00a0enhanced GST credit for low-income individuals was one of the first measures announced. Additional amounts were deposited in early April.\nThe $5.2-billion Canada student emergency benefit\u00a0accounts for the largest chunk of support aimed at post-secondary students. It provides $1,250 a month (and up to $1,750 for students who are caregivers) from May to August for current college or university students, those that were set to start in the fall and recent graduates who had finished their degree after December.

So it was really important to put money in the budget to not only maintain what we have\u00a0\u2026 but we also have units that are in enough disrepair from damage that we can't utilize them,\" she said.\n\"So we need to maximize our opportunities to get every single unit available for housing.\"\nThe province will\u00a0spend\u00a0$629,000 on building the\u00a0new housing units, compared to more than $12 million on upgrades over the next three years\u00a0\u2014 $7.2 million on public housing and $4.9 million on non-profit housing.\nDepartment officials could not\u00a0immediately say how many units\u00a0are in such disrepair that they can't be used, or how many will become available through the upgrades,\u00a0but Shephard said there are \"many\" in the northern part of the province and the Saint John region.\n\"So it's a constant struggle to keep up with it all.\"\nEarlier this year, the province signed a $299.2 million, 10-year agreement with the federal government under the National Housing Strategy.\nThe 2019-2022 New Brunswick Action Plan calls for an average of 50 new affordable housing units to be built in each of the first three years\u00a0\u2014 a mixture of NB Housing and private units with housing agreements \u2014 across the province.\nShephard said that's about 10 more per year than the previous plan and was negotiated in\u00a0consultation with stakeholders, clients and other departments.\nAn additional 1,111 units are expected to be\u00a0created in the final seven years.\nMeanwhile, to help address\u00a0homelessness this year, the department spent $2 million on\u00a0extra emergency shelter beds in Moncton and Fredericton, but\u00a0cut about 65 to 70 rent supplements, Shepard confirmed.\nIt's \"unfortunate,\" but necessary, she said.\n\"When you have 500 people living on the street, you have to try to provide them with enough resources to at least keep them safe.\"\nThe cuts to rent supplements is temporary, according to the minister. She expects the agreements with private landlords to subsidize units and make them available to people in need will be restored in the next budget.\n\"We have to work within our means and we're doing more than we've done before. So we need to make gains wherever we can. And when the opportunities arise, we need to maximize those opportunities.\"\nAsked about Montreal's proposed\u00a0bylaw that will compel\u00a0developers to build a certain number of affordable and social housing units, or contribute to a fund that will finance social housing, Shephard\u00a0called the idea \"interesting.\"\nShe said the majority of affordable housing units in New Brunswick are\u00a0already built by the private sector with the government's help to make a certain percentage of them subsidized units.\n\"But I think it's interesting that we could put that into policy and I think with the help of our municipalities that it's worthy of looking at.\"\nShe said the municipalities have been quite willing to be at the table to discuss the homelessness issue.\n\"So I think that they would welcome the conversation,\" said Shephard.\n\"Once we explore,\u00a0you know, the pros and the cons of it, I'm not sure where it will come out, but I think it's worthy of a discussion.\"\nShe is willing to commit to that discussion \u2014 or anything else that could benefit the housing strategy, she added.\nThe bylaw was\u00a0adopted by Montreal's executive committee in June and is going through public consultations now, said Coun. Craig Sauv\u00e9, the councillor responsible for housing.\n\"We think that in one year of signing this bylaw we'll be able to create 600 units of social housing and other several hundred units of affordable under-market housing and family housing,\" he said. \"That's just from this bylaw alone. So it's a pretty powerful tool and a lot of people are very excited about it in Montreal.\"\nOther jurisdictions are excited about it too, according to\u00a0Sauv\u00e9. Neighbouring municipalities are considering adopting it, he said, and he's been fielding\u00a0calls from officials across Canada, asking for details.\nThe bylaw is complex, said\u00a0Sauv\u00e9, but it makes it more expensive for developers to do the pay-out option, so they're more likely to build some turn-key affordable housing units.\nThat's\u00a0the \"best possible scenario\" for the city because it avoids the headache\u00a0of dealing with a construction project and delivers the units to citizens\u00a0in need sooner.\nIt's often referred to as the 20-20-20 bylaw, said\u00a0Sauv\u00e9, because it calls for 20 per cent non-profit housing, 20 per cent affordable sub-market housing and 20 per cent \"family housing,\" which means three bedrooms or more to create more housing stock for families to live within the city core.\nThe initiative comes amid a housing crunch in Montreal.\nThe rental market has become increasingly competitive, due to increased demand and rising real estate prices, leaving low-income families especially vulnerable.\nSauv\u00e9\u00a0said the bylaw\u00a0may not be a so-called magic bullet to solve homelessness, but he does believe it's a \"piece of the puzzle.\"\nMontreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante wants the bylaw, which still needs to be approved by council,\u00a0to be in effect by Jan.\u00a01, 2021.\n"}, {"author": "Laura Glowacki", "title": "Ontario's rising rents hurt the poor, Ottawa advocates say", "description": "Province raises cap on rent increase to 2.2% for 2020, highest hike since 2013", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/rising-rents-ottawa-ontario-1.5412991", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5413002.1577986568!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/rental-costs.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 03, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-01-04T01:06:40.655Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Advocates for retirees and people living in poverty in Ottawa are calling on the province to rethink raising rents in Ontario.\nLandlords can increase leases by 2.2 per cent this year.

Property taxes have risen and [so have] our maintenance and repair costs,\" Deeb\u00a0explained.\nMaintenance costs have climbed, Deeb said, because landlords\u00a0are now competing with larger condo developers to hire workers.\nThose developers can pay higher wages, meaning smaller landlords are also forced to pay more for\u00a0repairs.\nThese increases and dwindling profit margins have led to Deeb\u00a0selling some of his properties.\n\"Unfortunately what that's done is it's\u00a0driven all of the developers into the condo space to build expensive condos...and it's diminished the rental pool for more affordable housing,\" Deeb said.\u00a0\nQuibell herself wonders whether she could afford to find a home in Ottawa if she and her family of five had to move.\nThe 35-year-old Quibell currently pays about $1,500 a month for a four-bedroom garden home in Accora Village, a rental complex in Britannia.

Like other sectors of Canadian real estate, the sudden economic downturn will expose faults in a rental market dependent on high levels of borrowed money.\nThe quote from world-famous\u00a0investor Warren Buffett that \"only when the tide goes out do you see who is swimming naked\" may turn out to apply in this case.\nA report on Friday from property analysts Urbanation showed that while the 2020 rental market started the year strong, there were already early signs of a slowdown in rental price increases.

The Bank of Canada has said stress testing has shown Canada's financial system can take the heat.\nNonetheless, a report last week by business news service Bloomberg that Canadian property\u00a0\u2014 \"once safer than gold\" \u2014 is heading for a reckoning\u00a0was widely retweeted and sent shivers through the real estate sector.\nA two-decade, debt-fueled spending spree.

And mortgage deferrals are not free money if the banks continue to charge\u00a0interest on the amounts landlords\u00a0invested in hope of earning a profit.\u00a0\nBut one well-respected adviser to the private sector property market has warned that pain for landlords is not over.\n\"All this is going to hit the rental market first,\" says Ben Rabidoux, who runs North Cove Advisors, an information service for the professional residential real estate market. Of course, a warning to landlords of falling rents will be good news for renters.\nIn one respect, Rabidoux is far less gloomy than some about the home resale market overall, saying defaults remain unlikely so long as the economic meltdown caused by COVID-19 is less than six months.\nBut the real estate insider says there are strong signals that just as the supply of rental properties is hitting a peak, the number of people wanting to rent is falling.\nThe devastated Airbnb market, down about 95 per cent, is only part of it. Unemployed gig workers and students are moving in with relatives. Immigration has slowed to a trickle.\nAnd Rabidoux's research shows that the influx of non-permanent residents, including foreign students and people on work permits to fill gaps in Canada's tight labour market, both of whom depend on the rental market and normally about 200,000-strong, has gone into reverse.\n\"We have a 50-year high in rental units under construction and a 50-year high in completions of those rental units coming online,\" says Rabidoux. That's over and above the current flood of condos built to sell to Canadians as rental investment properties. And once underway, he says, those projects will continue to inundate the market over a two-year timeline.\nWhile people who have bought homes to live in them will be less affected, falling rental prices will inevitably impact other parts of the market, convincing some to rent rather than buy, said Rabidoux.\n\"You're going to see it bleed into the resale market\u00a0three, six, nine\u00a0months down the road,\" he said.\nBut for anyone renting, maybe now is the time to start shopping around.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Higher home prices, higher debt levels and how they affect our choices", "description": "What do booming housing markets mean for Canadian communities?", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/cars-clothes-and-classroom-costs-confound-canadians-plus-the-pecuniary-points-behind-politicians-promises-1.5297596/higher-home-prices-higher-debt-levels-and-how-they-affect-our-choices-1.5301209", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4080930.1494882967!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/realtor-gold-rush-20170420.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 27, 2019 9:00 PM ET", "2019-09-28T01:00:00.524Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When it comes to the Cost of Living, the biggest ticket item, for most of us, is housing.\u00a0Prices are way up, in Vancouver and Toronto, yes, but also around the country. \u00a0Our wages, in turn, haven't come close to matching those gains.\u00a0\nPaul Haavardsrud looks at how this matters to our life choices in ways many Canadians may or may not realize.\n"}, {"author": "Jason Vermes", "title": "Boomers, once critical of millennials, are more sympathetic to their housing plight, says professor", "description": "Parents 'recognize that their kids have it really different getting on the property ladder,' says Nancy Worth", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/checkup/boomers-once-critical-of-millennials-are-more-sympathetic-to-their-housing-plight-says-professor-1.5203404", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4906657.1587666422!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/crea-home-sales-20180413.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 08, 2019 12:30 PM ET", "2019-07-08T20:58:04.947Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Rebecca Goldstone calls herself a \"1 per cent millennial.\" Thanks to financial support from her parents, she graduated in 2016 without debt and landed a full-time job in Toronto soon after.\nNow a freelancer in commercial film, the work is steady.

That number jumps to 29 in\u00a0Vancouver.\n\"To put it simply, the price of homes has skyrocketed while earnings have remained stagnant,\" said Sutton Eaves, co-executive director of Generation Squeeze.\nOne change that could improve housing affordability, particularly for young Canadians, is by taxing housing wealth, Worth says.\nStatistics Canada, through their Canadian Housing Statistics Program, found that nearly 40 per cent of condominiums in Toronto are not owner-occupied, instead serving as investment properties.\n\"That means they're owned by investors or they're rented out as income properties,\" Worth said.\u00a0\n\"We really see a shift in, especially Toronto's housing market, of housing being about an investment \u2014 a way of making money, rather than being a place to live.\"\nGoldstone\u00a0expects she and her fianc\u00e9 will be able to purchase their first home within a decade. However, the freelancer worries for friends and colleagues who face high costs of living without support, and for whom home ownership is out of reach.\n\"I weep for my peers because I know most of them don't have that, and I feel lucky,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"Eventually I'm going to get there ... whereas I know that's not the case for a lot of people.\"\nWith files from Samantha Lui.\n"}, {"author": "Shanifa Nasser", "title": "In some battleground ridings, renters spend 50% or more of income on housing", "description": "Top 20 worst ridings for rental affordability unveiled in 2019 Canadian Rental Housing Index", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rental-affordability-housing-election-2019-1.5285814", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5178080.1560775983!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/housing-realtor-sale-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 17, 2019 10:00 AM ET", "2019-09-17T19:00:53.127Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Housing affordability is poised to be\u00a0a major ballot box issue in the upcoming federal election, with a sizeable portion of renters in some of the country's battleground ridings spending half or more of their income\u00a0on housing.\nAn analysis of the numbers in Statistics\u00a0Canada's 2016 long-form census that examined\u00a0income, affordability and overcrowding across Canada's 338 federal electoral districts shows that five of the country's worst ridings for rental housing affordability also happen to be among the ridings with the tightest races between the parties.\nOf the 20 ridings with the toughest affordability challenges, 11 are in Ontario and six are in British Columbia, with Nova Scotia, Quebec\u00a0and Manitoba rounding out the list with one riding each,\u00a0according to the 2019 Canadian Rental Housing Index, released Tuesday.\nIn those ridings, a quarter or more of renters reported spending at least 50 per cent of their income on rent and utilities. (Utilities were included in rent figures because the data didn't allow for costs to be separated out, according to the index.)\n\"These numbers clearly demonstrate why Canadians and housing advocates have been calling on our political leaders to take more immediate action to address the affordability challenges impacting so many families and individuals across the country,\" said Jill Atkey, CEO of the BC Non-Profit Housing Association, in a news release.\n\"Whichever party forms the next government will need to increase the investments into the National Housing Strategy in order to achieve its goals before this crisis gets even worse.\"\nOf the ridings identified in the index, Willowdale in Toronto\u00a0was the\u00a0worst for rental affordability;\u00a039 per cent of renters there reported spending half or more of their income toward rent.\nCBC News has identified five swing ridings\u00a0on StatsCanada's top-20 list for costly housing: Richmond Hill, King-Vaughan,\u00a0Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill and\u00a0Don Valley North in Ontario; and\u00a0Burnaby North-Seymour in B.C.\nThe other Ontario ridings on the list are:\nIn British Columbia:\nRounding out the list are\u00a0Ville-Marie-Le Sud Ouest-\u00cele-des-Soeurs\u00a0in Quebec, Halifax in Nova Scotia and Winnipeg South in Manitoba.\u00a0\nThe crisis of affordability in some markets hasn't been lost on campaigning party leaders. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau promised\u00a0last week to provide more help to first first-time homebuyers living in red-hot housing markets, including Toronto and Vancouver.\nThe Liberal plan would expand the number of first-time buyers eligible under the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's shared-equity program by\u00a0increasing the value of a qualifying home from approximately $500,000 to nearly $800,000.\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer\u00a0plans to\u00a0offer his own proposal on home ownership, according to the party's spokesperson.\u00a0\nWhether the leaders will\u00a0come out with campaign commitments\u00a0specifically aimed at renters remains to be seen.\n\"The data clearly demonstrates that our political leaders have not been able to find or implement meaningful solutions to the affordable housing crisis, and Ontario now has the dubious honour of being harder hit than anywhere else in the country,\" said Marlene Coffey, executive director of the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association.\nThe index released Tuesday also paints a picture of those hardest hit by affordability challenges: single mothers, Indigenous renters, new immigrants, seniors and Canadians under 30.\nThat last group is comprised largely of millennials, who are expected to make up as much as 37 per cent of the electorate in this election, according to Abacus Data.\nNearly a quarter of renters under 30 are at what the index defines as a \"crisis level of spending,\" with half or more of their income going to rent\u00a0\u2014 while at least half of seniors who\u00a0rent spent\u00a030 per cent or more of their income on\u00a0housing.\n\"For a long time, the conversation around rental housing affordability in Canada has focused on the population as a whole, but the numbers clearly show several key, vulnerable groups are bearing the brunt of this crisis,\" said Jeff Morrison, executive director of the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association.\nA disproportionate share of Indigenous families were also found to be struggling to pay rent, and overcrowding was found to be an issue in 43 per cent of Indigenous-led renter households, compared with just six per cent in non-Indigenous renter households.\nAmong immigrants now renting shelter who landed in Canada from 2011 to 2016, nearly 24 per cent were found to be at a crisis level in terms of the percentage of household income spent on shelter. In terms of overcrowding and overspending, the hardest hit immigrant-led households are in the Greater Toronto Area, with 55 to 60 per cent of those households in Richmond Hill, Vaughan and Markham spending 30 per cent or more of their income on rent.\nBut those suburbs still might be the more affordable option for those looking to own\u00a0a home in Toronto\u00a0\u2014 people like new mom Jessica Botello.\nBotello said she's encouraged by Trudeau's housing proposal but thinks ultimately it's better suited to those looking outside the city core.\n\"Honestly, it's a great idea, but for $800,000, it's not realistic for Toronto,\" she told CBC Radio's\u00a0Metro Morning.\nBotello recently put in an offer for a home in Toronto, only to find six others did as well. Ultimately, the home sold for $840,000\u00a0\u2014 a price she said she simply couldn't compete with.\n\"We were pre-approved for $745,000,\" she told\u00a0Metro Morning.\u00a0\"But if it's listed for that price, they want multiple offers\u00a0\u2014 and they get them.\"\nWhat matters to you this\u00a0election?

That can make it harder to find an apartment, particularly one that's affordable.\nThe region's residential vacancy rate fell from 2.9 per cent in October 2018 to 2.2 per cent in October 2019, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nThe low vacancy rate has prompted developers to build homes and apartment buildings.\n\"You just have to look around Dieppe, Riverview and Moncton to see the amount of building complexes going up, and the majority of them are apartment or condo buildings,\" Nadine Fullarton with the Moncton Northeast Construction Association said in an interview.\u00a0\nThe organization represents general contractors, trade and sub contractors and suppliers to the construction industry. Fullarton said members of the association have reported a 30 to 40 per cent increase in developers offering contracts for apartment and condo buildings.\nIn 2019, Moncton issued building permits for 16 new apartment buildings with 727 units, 68 new single-unit homes, and 114 duplex units.\u00a0\nCombined, residential permits accounted for 37.7 per cent of\u00a0$257.4 million in building permits issued last year, a new city record.\nLast year was also record-setting for Dieppe, where permits worth $96 million topped a $90 million record set in 2016. Dieppe's figures include permits for 314 new housing units, though the largest single permit was for the city's new arena complex.\nIn Riverview, the town issued permits worth a total of $25 million, shy of the 2015 record of $29 million.\u00a0\nAll of the construction activity means steady employment for people in the construction industry, Fullarton said. It's meant a shortage of workers in some trades that prompted the organization to plan a national and international recruitment campaign.\nThe region's immigration strategy calls for 2,700 to 3,500 immigrants per year by 2024 to sustain economic growth and fill jobs.\u00a0\nWishart said there are downsides, including the increase in the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment from $698 in 2018 to $732 in October 2019.\n\"If you're bringing jobs to the community and you need to find housing for them, that is becoming difficult, especially for families,\" Wishart said. \"Maybe it's a good problem to have, but I'm not sure we can build (housing) fast enough and or at the right types.\"\nIn recent years, monthly home sales reports from the Greater Moncton Realtors du Grand Moncton have described the region's housing market breaking records.\nParise Cormier, president of the association, called it a sellers market. The inventory of homes on the market has hit a 15-year low, which she said has resulted in some homes getting multiple purchase offers.\n\"Prices are slowly creeping up, but we don't have markets like you see in bigger cities,\" Cormier said.\nThe average price for a single-family detached home in Greater Moncton stood at $197,600 in December 2019, up 4.6 per cent from a year before and 18.9 from five years earlier.\nCormier said while the association representing realtors doesn't have firm data, anecdotally they're seeing a lot of people moving from more expensive markets in Canada.\u00a0\nA home selling for about $200,000 here would sell for about $1 million or more in Oakville, Ont., she said.\u00a0\n\"A lot of people are coming back home, a lot of people are retiring here, a lot of people coming here to start a family,\" Cormier said. \"We have a better quality of life, we see a lot of immigration and our employment is pretty steady.\"\nBut rising prices and increasing rents also make the city less affordable for those with a low income. Moncton has struggled to deal with people who are homeless.\nLisa Ryan with the Greater Moncton Homelessness Steering Committee told CBC in December that there needs to be a stronger push to build more affordable housing.\u00a0\n\"When we see developments coming into our community, or no policies attached to that, we need to get brave at saying this is wrong,\" Ryan said.\u00a0\nOn Monday, Moncton council ratified a new policy to be implemented later this year that could allow developments with affordable housing to move through the city's approval process faster.\nThe decline in vacancy rates isn't limited to residential housing.\u00a0\nIan Franklin, a vice-president with real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield Atlantic, said\u00a0the office space vacancy rate downtown is\u00a0\"quite low,\" around four per cent.\n\"There's obviously a need for more office (space) downtown,\" he said.

She wanted to hear first-hand what it's like to deal with unstable housing situations.\nBut instead of presenting her sober findings in a traditional thesis format, she also created a hand-drawn booklet that she hopes inspires decision-makers to actually fix the problem.\nAll of the women she spoke with live\u00a0on a limited income. Some had been homeless in the past, escaped violent relationships or survived childhood abuse.\u00a0\n\"You hear about this idea of invisibility,\" O'Neil told CBC's Information Morning. \"This sort of recurring theme of feeling disconnected.\u2026 One woman actually said, you know, my expiry date has come and gone.\"\nO'Neil said\u00a0some of the\u00a0women told her that they don't feel safe where they live.\u00a0\n\"So not feeling safe in the neighbourhood, having ongoing conflict with the neighbours, feeling threatened or challenged by landlords, or made uncomfortable by landlords or property owners,\" O'Neil said.\u00a0\nStill, she was surprised that so many found a way\u00a0to make a bad living situation better.\u00a0\n\"It shows the resourcefulness of women in dealing with really less than ideal \u2014 far less than ideal \u2014 circumstances, but also really draws attention to why should they have to be resourceful?\" said O'Neil.\nO'Neil's work is especially needed now that Halifax is in the middle of an affordability crisis, said\u00a0Claudia Jahn, director of community housing development with the Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia.\u00a0\nShe also advised O'Neil on her thesis.\nThe rental vacancy rate in Halifax is at a record low 1.6 per cent, and the provincial NDP has called for action now that 20 per cent of households\u00a0spend more than 50 per cent of their income on rent and utilities.\nShe said finding adequate housing isn't just a problem for older women.\nFor those with children, it can be\u00a0especially hard to find an affordable place to live, she said.\u00a0\nThe stigma is such a problem that the\u00a0Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission issued a warning this summer to landlords who refused to rent to families with children.\n\"Women with children are less mobile than men are because they are bound by a school district and don't want to move their children. So they are always tied to that community,\" she said.\u00a0\nSome women\u00a0might stay in a dangerous housing situation for the sake of their children, Jahn added.\n\"They don't want to uproot the children out of their schools, circle of friends, relatives. So making that step into a shelter is really the last, last resort.\"\nJahn has been working on housing affordability across the province since\u00a02003, and said things have only gotten worse as public housing deteriorates\u00a0and rental prices soar.\nAll the while new affordable buildings aren't being put up\u00a0fast enough, she said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Tweaking the system just a little bit here and there isn't really doing any justice for the severity of the issue,\" Jahn said.\u00a0\nBoth O'Neil and Jahn say for too long people tasked with creating more, and better, affordable housing\u00a0don't engage with the people who actually need it.\u00a0\nThat's the idea behind Home for Good, a joint project by Alice House, the Elizabeth Fry Society, the Marguerite Centre and YWCA Halifax. The three-year initiative\u00a0looks at the barriers women face once they leave supportive\u00a0housing programs.\nIn 2017, the groups interviewed 22 women between the ages of 19 and 60.\nWhat they found, said project manager Charlene Gagnon, is that the province needs an approach to housing that recognizes the needs of women as different from the needs of men.\n\"The programs that don't apply that gender lens, they really don't take into account things like women's economic security, being the leaders of single-income\u00a0households with children and histories of trauma,\" said Gagnon,\u00a0who travelled to Edmonton earlier this month to share the groups'\u00a0work at the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness.\nThe project will officially wrap up in January 2020, but Gagnon said the work is really just beginning.\nThe non-profits are now developing next steps, like credit counselling programs for women and online training for landlords to better understand what women renters face.\u00a0\nLike O'Neil, the researchers used animation\u00a0to share the participants' stories.\u00a0\n\"These are women who've worked really hard to go through programs,\" Gagnon said. \"They're told in their programming to be proud of where they come from and be proud of who they are, and then when they go tell their stories to landlords that actually becomes a barrier to them.\"\n\"That stigma is really alive and well in the province, and it's traumatizing in itself.\"\u00a0\nO'Neil's\u00a0creative approach to her research earned her the best thesis of the year at her university.\nBut for her, the real victory will be seeing her work translate into action.\u00a0\n\"I hope this would at the very least just generate an awareness that these women exist and are among us and have been huge parts of community life that maybe we don't value enough,\" she said.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": "Jordan Press", "title": "Feds, Alberta set to clash over cash for new

"source": null, "content": "Alberta is pushing back against the Trudeau Liberals' expectation that provinces and territories pick up half the cost of a new rent supplement, asking instead to substitute federal funding for their own.\nThe promised supplement was originally proposed as a joint funding venture between the federal and provincial governments.\nBut in negotiations over the funding arrangement, Alberta officials have sought to have their existing spending count towards the cost-matching approach instead of increasing funding as other provinces have said they would.\nThe details of the behind-the-scenes talks were provided to The Canadian Press by multiple people with knowledge of the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity, either because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss federal work, or to ensure relationships with governments and agencies weren't compromised.\nWhat has housing advocates concerned is that the new supplement may have limited effects if spending doesn't increase as originally envisioned.\nA spokeswoman for Alberta's housing minister says the province hopes to finalize a funding arrangement with Ottawa to streamline provincial rental assistance programs.\n\"We are working with the federal government to reach an agreement under the Canada Housing Benefit to better support Albertans in need of housing and our government hopes to co-ordinate this new federal funding with our rental assistance program,\" said Natalie Tomczak, press secretary to Alberta Housing Minister Josephine Pon.\n\"This will reduce duplication in the application process and ensure Albertans in need of housing can access the supports they need quickly and efficiently.\"\nWhat makes the new rent benefit unusual is that it will be tied to a person, rather than a social housing unit \u2014 meaning tenants won't lose the supplement if they move out of social housing, but rather get to apply it against the rent in a private unit.\nThe supplement is part of the federal Liberals' decade-long housing strategy and is slated to cost $4 billion when accounting for collective spending by federal, provincial and territorial governments.\nThe supplement spending is part of what the parliamentary budget officer has noted is $11.7 billion in cost-matching from provinces and territories contained in the Liberals' housing strategy, which is billed as carrying a $55-billion price tag.\nCost-matching provisions could lead lower levels of government to shift existing funds to meet federal demands without an overall increase in spending, the budget watchdog warned in a report earlier this year.\nPon spoke with her federal counterpart, Social Development Minister Ahmed Hussen, on Nov. 28. In a statement at the time, she said that Alberta's \"key unilateral spending commitments\" made as part of \"a sustainable financial framework\" must be treated as cost-matching under the housing strategy.\nThe housing benefit wasn't mentioned by name in the statement.\n\"The federal government must respect how, when and where provinces choose to spend our money in areas of core provincial jurisdiction,\" Pon's statement at the time said.\nEven though the housing benefit is mentioned in deals provinces and territories signed with Ottawa to get money through the Liberals' housing strategy, the main agreements didn't contain the fine print about the rent benefit. The Liberals have to sign separate deals for that because the benefit is tailored to fit with each jurisdiction's unique needs and programs.\nThe first such deal was signed with Ontario this month. Each side is to put up $730 million over eight years for a $1.46-billion total.\nAt an event in Ottawa announcing the agreement, a Liberal point man on the housing file said different provinces are challenged by different economic constraints, but argued spending a little more on housing could save governments money in the long-term from things like reduced health care costs.\n\"This initiative, small at start, is going to free up other resources to tackle some of the other challenges we have in the housing sector,\" said, Toronto MP Adam Vaughan, Hussen's parliamentary secretary.\nQuebec remains the only province that hasn't signed funding agreement to be part of the national housing strategy, but Vaughan said a deal is close.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/754686019567", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Colin Butler", "title": "Posh corner of London to get 55 affordable apartments, thanks to local church", "description": "The units will bolster the well-heeled northwest, an underserved section of the city", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-affordable-housing-1.5262750", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5262751.1567020582!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/gateway-apartments.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 29, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-08-29T08:00:00.899Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A London church is helping tackle the city's worsening poverty problems by building dozens of affordable apartments in the northwest area of the city.\nGateway Church\u00a0received city council's blessing last month to build two L-shaped buildings with a total of 80 apartments units, 55 of which will be offered at an affordable rate\u00a0on a five-acre parcel of land on London's Bluegrass Drive.\u00a0\nThe badly needed project comes at a time when the city is experiencing an\u00a0ever-deepening housing affordability crunch.\nNot only is the waiting list for some form of social housing thousands of names long, a recent report out of city hall said London's fleet of public housing stock is badly mismanaged with too many vacant units sitting idle thanks to\u00a0overlapping housing agencies that provide inadequate\u00a0oversight.\u00a0\nReport slams slow turnover, duplication in community housing\nAll of this is set against a backdrop of intensifying poverty and drug addiction made worse by\u00a0rising rents and booming real estate prices in the city.\u00a0\nIt's why the church wants to keep costs low, so people can live \"in dignity,\" according to\u00a0Rick Boyes, the lead pastor at Gateway Church.\n\"We will purposely keep the rents, most of the rents, to a thousand dollars and under,\" he said, noting the exact rate will be determined by the City of London.\u00a0\nThe project is being called \"inter-generational\" and looks to include a mix of older people, aged 55 and up, and younger people including young mothers and couples looking to start a family.\u00a0\nBoyes said the property will also include parks, gazebos, a soccer pitch, a splash pad and a skating rink in the winter.\u00a0\n\"We want it so that people will actually want to live here,\" he said, noting the entire community was designed with only one thought in mind.\u00a0\n\"If you don't want your family member in there then we don't want to build it,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nSteve Lehman, the councillor whose ward 8 constituency includes Gateway Church and some of the city's most well-heeled neighbourhoods, said the new affordable units are badly needed in his part of the city.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We actually have 133 affordable units in my ward, which out of 8,000 units across the city\u00a0is not a great representation,\" he said, noting that despite the shortage, it still took some convincing to calm jittery neighbours.\u00a0\n\"There is a stigma attached and people in the neighbourhood expressed concern that it would be attracting recovering drug addicts or a criminal element or some unfounded concerns,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"What they don't see is that affordability is affecting everybody.

Either that, or the average price for a house would need to come down\u00a0by half.\n\"These are massive numbers,\" said the report's lead author, Paul Kershaw, who described the numbers as a \"troubling portrait.\"\nThe report said the chasm between money made and money needed\u00a0is widest in B.C. and Ontario, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto. The price of a house in the West Coast city is quadruple what any millennial could \"safely\" afford, and triple their\u00a0budgets in the Six.\nIn Vancouver, millennials would need to make $200,400 every year in order to afford the average home.

The authors said it would take 21 years in Toronto.\nThe average time to save a down payment across Canada is 13 years, which is still eight\u00a0years longer than it would have taken in 1976.\nThe problem is also pronounced in Victoria and\u00a0Kelowna\u00a0in B.C., and in Hamilton and Kitchener in Ontario.

How will the public react to those?\" he said.\nDiversity in the provincial and city economies could help, but it may not isolate the city entirely from the effects of the pandemic, Markowsky said.\nThe economist told councillors\u00a0Winnipeg's relatively low housing costs and low property taxes could help residents avoid some of the fiscal damage from the crisis.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Why it was hard to sell or buy a home in Vancouver in 1981", "description": "Interest rates were the stumbling point ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/archives/why-it-was-hard-to-sell-or-buy-a-home-in-vancouver-in-1981-1.5242298", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Aug 27, 2019 11:30 AM ET", "2019-08-27T16:24:57.400Z"], "source": "CBC Archives", "content": "Many Vancouver homeowners were in a state of high anxiety 38 years ago.\nThat's because their homes reportedly had the highest prices in North America and they\u00a0came with corresponding high-priced mortgages that were hard to carry.\nAnd that combination of high prices and mortgages with high interest rates\u00a0made their homes hard to sell.\n\"So many houses are now for sale in Vancouver that it takes nine volumes to list them all,\" Russ Patrick reported on The National on Aug. 27, 1981.\nJust 300 homes had sold in Vancouver that August.

Vacancy rates or Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) rental averages? The \"million-dollar line\" for detached homes being at Main, Commercial, or Boundary?\u00a0\nEveryone agreed Vancouver was still in a housing crisis. But nobody could put a set metric to it.\u00a0\nSimon Fraser University\u00a0economist Josh Gordon said ending the crisis isn't the same as Vancouver suddenly becoming affordable to everyone.\u00a0\n\"A return to conditions of 2014 [when home prices were around 10 to 30 per cent lower than they are now]\u00a0would represent the end of the crisis, but it wouldn't represent the\u00a0solution to all our affordability problems,\" Gordon said.\u00a0\u00a0\nA point repeated by University of British Columbia economist Tom Davidoff.\n\"No matter what government does in the long run, Vancouver is going to be an appealing place for people to work, and it's going to be a hard place to build.

Non-Profit Housing Association CEO Jill Atkey\u00a0provided a more circuitous response.\n\"We can say we're no longer in a crisis when people are no longer experiencing a crisis within the housing system,\" she said.\u00a0\nFun fact of the day: average price of a Greater Vancouver house has increased as much in the past six months as it did from 1980 to 2006.\nEven though the monthly sales statistics are a main\u00a0barometer for talking about the housing market, those surveyed said there are better places to look for determining how much of a crisis the market is in.\u00a0\n\"The rental market is where the affordability issue is most critical,\u00a0because of course low-income people struggle the most with affordability, and they're most prone to be renters rather than owners,\" said Davidoff.\u00a0\nAtkey agreed, and said that while vacancy rates remain low, changes could be on the way, as governments at all three levels have been building rental stock and affordable housing at levels not seen in decades.\u00a0\n\"With every crisis there's a turning point. And I think what's interesting and and in some ways unique here in B.C. is that we are very much at that turning point and the stars are aligning,\" she said.\u00a0\nBut she's hopeful that the end of the crisis\u00a0\u2014 whenever that comes\u00a0\u2014 doesn't mean an end to current government funding and incentives for below-market housing.\u00a0\n\"Once we have it solved I'm really really hoping that we've got enough collective memory to prevent ourselves from getting back here again,\" she said.\u00a0\nAs for James? Her ministry responded to our question asking what defines a housing \"crisis\" and what would constitute a \"balanced\" market, but didn't answer with any specifics\u00a0\u2014 though she did highlight the taxes her government has implemented.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhich makes a certain amount of sense: if you don't define when a problem is solved, you can have maximum flexibility in trying to solve it.\u00a0\u00a0\nOr, as put most famously by Stanford economist Paul Romer, \"a\u00a0crisis is a terrible thing to waste.\"\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/programs/radionoon/are-you-being-priced-out-of-living-in-montreal-1.5174304", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Hilary Bird", "title": "Where is the N.W.T.'s $21.5M COVID-19 relief package coming from?", "description": "'In a lot of aspects ... it\u2019s money that we\u2019re not taking in,' said N.W.T.

In fact sometimes, those landlords are\u00a0barely covering their own\u00a0expenses.\nThat's what Kayla Andrade,\u00a0the CEO and founder of the advocacy group, Ontario Landlords Watch will\u00a0tell you.\nShe owns two triplexes, a fiveplex\u00a0and is currently buying a sixplex. She calls it her retirement plan, but it's not easy.\n\"Even for the price that we bought the sixplex at, it barely covers itself. And that's what the reality is for real estate in Ontario now. Sometimes these properties are not even covering themselves.\"\nAndrade is quick to suggest\u00a0the Residential Tenancies Act and the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) favour tenants.\nShe said the set of rules that govern the landlord-tenant relationship in Ontairo are part of a\u00a0\"broken system.\"\nLate last month, Andrade\u00a0met with a representative of Ontario Housing Minister\u00a0Steve Clark and after combing through the statistics from the LTB\u00a0tribunal, outlined her concerns. Andrade said landlords are filing the bulk of the applications and usually because a tenant hasn't paid their rent.\n\"It's all favoured toward protecting the tenants. A lot of it comes down to giving tenants lots and lots of time\u00a0and allowing them to appeal judgments and also apply for a stay. It ends up prolonging the eviction process,\" said Andrade.\nOn average, Andrade said it takes about five months to resolve an\u00a0LTB case, which often means five months in unpaid rent.\nAndrade\u00a0said with costs going up, some mom and pop\u00a0landlords are struggling to break even. Increases to taxes, insurance and utilities can often outpace what a landlord is legally able to increase the rent by each year.\n\"Every time you put your property taxes up or you're waiving development charges for a developer ... our property taxes go up,\" said Andrade.\u00a0\"So keep putting property taxes up and we have to re-evaluate our rental unit and the price that it's costing us to run that building and that's why you're going to see more rents increasing.\"\n\"But if you keep the cost low to the landlord, then we can keep it low to the tenants,\" Andrade explained.\nGail Ryder owns three properties in London and told London Morning's Rebecca Zandbergen\u00a0she's also frustrated by the restrictions in the legislation. \"We're not allowed to ask for damage deposits and I think that's probably been the biggest challenge for me. Recouping those losses in between tenants. Yes, I understand it is the cost of doing business but to a degree.\"\nRyder admitted it can\u00a0be challenging\u00a0choosing a tenant who receives funds through the Ontario Disability Supports Program or through Ontario Works, \"because there's no recourse for landlords to get their money. So if there's a default in payment, we have to take people to the board to get your money back.\"\nThat's one of the changes Andrade wants the Ontario government to consider. In a document prepared for Housing Minister Steve Clark, she writes, \"Tenants should not be allowed to receive rent money directly instead, the government funded rent program should stipulate that it must be paid to the landlord directly.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/756328003809", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Tony Davis", "title": "P.E.I. housing starts expected to decline sharply in 2020", "description": "'Currently there's an excess of housing starts'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-housing-peak-build-decline-oct-2019-1.5338196", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5277359.1582646722!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cmhc-housing-starts-20190809.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 30, 2019 12:00 PM AT", "2019-10-30T15:00:00.068Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "After years of rapid growth, housing starts on P.E.I. are projected to decline in the next two years in the latest Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation housing market outlook.\n\"For P.E.I., we expect a record level of housing starts in 2019,\" said Kelvin Ndoro, senior economics analyst with CMHC.\n\"In 2020 and 2021 we expect starts to trend lower.\"\nRecent Statistics Canada reports\u00a0have shown steep increases in the value of building permits and in building investment on P.E.I. This growth has come in response to record low vacancy rates and a tight housing market that has seen prices rise 38.5 per cent in Charlottetown in the last two years.\nBut Ndoro said his analysis shows there are already too many homes being built on P.E.I., which will lead to a supply and demand mismatch.\n\"Currently there's an excess of housing starts,\" he said.\n\"When deviations between actual and fundamental levels are high or positive, this gets resolved very quickly in the short term, and that's by housing starts declining.\"\nCMHC's housing market outlook, released last week, projects as many as\u00a01,700 housing starts in 2019. The report suggests that will decline\u00a0to a maximum of 900 in 2020, and to 725 in 2021.\n\"Housing starts in Atlantic Canada, generally, they go through a lot of swings, up and downs,\" he said.\nThough P.E.I.'s\u00a0population has been increasing over the years, Statistics Canada has recorded more people moving out of the province to other parts of Canada.\n\"We have started to see a reversal in interprovincial migration,\" he said.\nAs recently as 2016-17 P.E.I. gained almost 450 in population from other provinces, but in each of the last two years that has been under 200.\nAnother factor expected to reduce demand is people waiting longer to form their own\u00a0households.\n\"Young adults, they\u00a0will room together more often or they live with their parents more longer,\" said Ndoro.\nTrends and norms are also changing with young adults. For example, said\u00a0Ndoro, people are marrying later in life and that also affects forming a household.\nWhile the number of new homes being built on P.E.I. is projected to peak in 2019, Canada as a whole peaked in 2017. Ndoro said that is because housing markets don't operate the same across the board.\n\"In the past few years Atlantic Canada has actually been at polar opposites in what is happening in the rest of the country, and affordability is one of the key factors,\" Ndoro said.\nWhen other areas in Canada become unaffordable, more people tend to choose Atlantic Canada because it is often more affordable, he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2681758151", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2681861813", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Mike Rudyk", "title": "Faro's abandoned homes have all been sold", "description": "170 housing units sat empty for years after the Faro mine closed in 1997", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/faro-yukon-abandoned-homes-sold-1.5381828", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5382597.1575398719!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/faro-houses.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 03, 2019 8:00 AM CT", "2019-12-03T14:00:00.852Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Town of Faro in Yukon has no more empty and abandoned homes for sale.\nThe town acquired dozens of\u00a0abandoned properties about three years ago, many of them apartment complexes with multiple housing units.

Our municipal infrastructure can now drain out. There is real progress being made.\"\nThe Clearwater River \u2014 which overran its banks on Monday, flooding the downtown core\u00a0\u2014 dropped about a metre overnight, Scott said.\nA massive ice jam that initially stretched along 25 kilometres of the Athabasca River now measures about eight\u00a0kilometres and continues to melt rapidly.\nThe flooding began Sunday, when a 25-kilometre sheet of ice effectively dammed the Athabasca River, forcing the Clearwater to reverse course and flood the city's downtown core. An estimated 1,230 structures have been damaged.\u00a0\nWhile some areas remain swamped, images of the downtown Friday show floodwaters have receded significantly.\u00a0\nSome areas that were under a couple of metres of water, with abandoned cars completely submerged, now only have puddles of pooling water in the street.\u00a0\u00a0\nMunicipal officials had said a return to the flood zone will happen in stages. Essential businesses, including key government infrastructure, grocery stores, hardware stores, gas stations, hotels\u00a0and pharmacies will be given priority.\nBusinesses spared the worst of the flooding will be inspected and allowed to open first.\u00a0\nDamage assessment teams, consisting of building and safety codes inspectors, were deployed Thursday, the municipality said in a news release.\nOnce inspections are completed, operators will be able to return to their properties to assess damages\u00a0and begin the recovery process.\nSome homes, while accessible, may not be safe, cautioned Scott Davis, director of emergency services.\u00a0\nUtilities have not been fully restored. Sewage back-ups may have left permanent damage, and a boil water advisory remains in effect for much of the region.\nWATCH | Assessing the damage from Fort McMurray's floods:\nMunicipal crews do not have the capacity to inspect each property damaged by the floodwaters, Davis said.\u00a0\"Homes may not be safe to occupy and you may not be able to live in your home,\" he said.\n\"We're not able to do the assessments inside the home. We rely on the homeowner and the insurance company to make that determination.\"\nA virtual community townhall was held\u00a0Thursday to provide an update on the river breakup and flood. Environment Minister Jason\u00a0 Nixon said a number of provincial conditions must be met before evacuees can return.\n\"Those conditions include floodwater no longer being an imminent threat, the availability of critical infrastructure and essential services and hazards in the area being secured,\" he said.\n\"There is no question that the recovery process in this community will be lengthy.\"\nThe flooding comes as Fort McMurray is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and an economic downturn caused by crashing oil prices. A raging wildfire in May 2016 forced the evacuation of the entire city and destroyed 2,400 homes and buildings.\nScott said the people of Fort McMurray are resilient.\u00a0\n\"We've been through hard times, and I think every Canadian has seen us go through it, and we always bounce back and come right back out the other side as strong as ever,\" Scott said.\n\"We're going to do it this time as well, and we are feeling very optimistic, especially with the signs we're seeing today.\"\nAt a news conference Friday, Nixon said an ice jam on the Peace River 24 kilometres downstream of the community of Garden River has expanded by 20 kilometres to a total of 44 kilometres.\n\"The increased size of that ice jam, the combining of the ice jams in that area is certainly having an impact on Garden River, Nixon said.\n\"We know several thousand people\u00a0could be affected by flooding in Little Red River Cree Nation.\" A state of local emergency for the area was declared on Monday.\nBackflooding\u00a0in creeks and other areas has cut off road access to the east side of Garden River but no houses have been flooded, Nixon said.\nHe said 560 people have been evacuated\u00a0from Garden River and at least 400 of them need support finding shelter and food, he added. The provincial operations centre is working to get shelter and supplies to evacuees.\nResidents of Fox Lake, upstream of Garden River,\u00a0are also preparing to evacuate, Nixon said. That could involve the evacuation of as many as 6,000 more people, he said.\nAn evacuation order issued Sunday is still in effect for Fort Vermilion residents that reside east of 50th street, north of the golf course, River Road, and Boreal Housing.\nBut once the jam\u00a0moves again, the situation will become less dire, Nixon said.\n\"My understanding is most of those areas where it could hold up from that point on are not very populated areas. We'd still obviously want to protect infrastructure \u2014 roads or bridges in those areas \u2014 and we'll watch it closely.\n\"But the anticipation is when we can break it past this place, where\u00a0the ice can flow on out of here and we can finally move past this situation.\"\nScott Long, executive director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, said the agency is working with the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, Fort Vermilion and Garden River, ensuring that evacuees have the supports they need.\n\"Dewatering is taking place, damage assessment teams are out,\" Long said. But he cautioned that there is no firm timeline for people to return home.\n\"We are well aware that people need to get back to their homes as quickly as possible but there are a number of steps to make sure that it's safe for them to do so.\"\n"}, {"author": "Eric Rankin", "title": "Proposed class action lawsuit alleges B.C.'s housing speculation tax unfairly targets women and seniors", "description": "Legal challenge seeks injunction to stop tax pending court decision", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-speculation-tax-lawsuit-1.5345331", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5345430.1572652952!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/the-owners-of-this-oak-bay-home-near-victoria-are-among-those-hit-by-b-c-s-housing-speculation-tax.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 01, 2019 5:17 PM PT", "2019-11-02T00:39:10.769Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A major legal challenge has been filed in B.C. Supreme Court, aimed at killing\u00a0the province's housing speculation and vacancy tax.\nThe lawsuit, launched on behalf of nine homeowners from Greater Victoria and Metro Vancouver, is seeking certification as a class action.\nIf given the go-ahead by the courts, the class action would represent all foreign owners, satellite families and Canadian residents outside B.C. who have been hit by the tax.\nThat would cover 9,200 of the almost 12,000 property owners forced to pay $115 million since the tax was imposed in 2018, according to provincial government figures.\u00a0\nB.C. residents who own unrented second or additional homes would not be covered\u00a0because of the way the legal action is framed \u2014\u00a0but they could benefit if the speculation tax is overturned.\nVancouver lawyer Lawrence Wong is handling the lawsuit \u2014 as well as\u00a0another action filed Sept.\u00a026 on behalf of six other homeowners, who allege B.C.'s speculation tax is unconstitutional and beyond the power of the provincial government.\nWong says the proposed class action would absorb the first lawsuit, if it's approved.\n\"This tax is a tax grab ... a vehicle for [the B.C. government]\u00a0to rake in more tax money,\" said\u00a0Wong.\u00a0\n\"There is a huge element of propaganda ... because the government calls it a speculation tax and unfortunately the people who are affected are seniors and homemakers and people who are married to foreign spouses.\"\nThe lawsuit also seeks an interim injunction to halt collection of the tax while the case is considered, arguing the levy is causing \"irreparable harm\"\u2014\u00a0forcing some people who can't afford the assessments to sell their homes.\nIt also alleges women and seniors are unfairly targeted, caught up in an overly broad tax designed to penalize foreign and domestic real estate speculators and turn empty homes into affordable housing.\nThe B.C. government says it brought in the anti-speculation measure because rich investors were driving up market prices by buying homes and condos, then leaving them vacant. \u00a0 \u00a0\nClaire Carlin is among the nine petitioners seeking the injunction and class action status.\u00a0She says she's a prime example of homeowners being unfairly assessed the speculation tax. \u00a0 Carlin, 63, is a retired University of Victoria professor who is married to\u00a0Bruce Wonder, a U.S. citizen.\nShe says they have \"an unconventional marriage,\"\u00a0where he spends most of his time living in Bellingham, Wash., while she's lived in Victoria for 30 years.\n\"My condo is not vacant. I live in it. It's only my name on the title,\" said\u00a0Carlin.\nBut she says she's considered a member of a \"satellite family\" under the act, because his retirement income is higher than hers and he pays taxes in the U.S..\n\"I find that infuriating because I've been a professional woman all of my life ... and, suddenly, I'm defined as a 'satellite'\u00a0of my husband, which has never been the case,\" she said.\nAs a result, Carlin's been assessed the highest rate under the speculation tax \u2014\u00a0 two\u00a0per cent of her home's assessed value.\nThat means she will owe more than $20,000, money she can't afford.\u00a0Carlin says she could be forced to sell her home.\n\"I feel as though I'm being slapped in the face by my country,\" she said.\nB.C.'s finance minister says because the case is before the courts, it would be inappropriate to comment on the specifics.\nBut Carole James does say\u00a0the speculation and vacancy tax is a \"key measure to tackle the housing crisis in B.C.'s major urban centres\" and maintains\u00a0\"99.8 per cent of British Columbians are exempt from paying the tax.\"\n\"I'm optimistic our plan is working.\"\nCarlin doesn't share the minister's optimism \u2014\u00a0even though she also believes real estate speculation needs to be controlled.\n\"I agree that it's a shame to have property sitting vacant when we have a crisis in rental housing,\" she said.\n\"But this law is like a sledgehammer that's having unintended consequences.\"\nThe B.C. government has yet to file a legal response.\n"}, {"author": "Lauren Pelley", "title": "Toronto backed the Liberals \u2014 so what could the city get back from Trudeau?", "description": "Throughout campaign Liberals made pledges on housing, transit, gun violence", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-backed-the-liberals-so-what-could-the-city-get-back-from-trudeau-1.5331171", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5330123.1571783430!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-liberals-20191022.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 23, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-23T11:22:57.055Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Every single one of Toronto's 25\u00a0ridings backed\u00a0the Liberals in Monday's federal election. So what will the city get back from Justin Trudeau now that he's forming a minority government?\nIn a campaign marked by scandals, from revelations of Trudeau wearing blackface to questions over Conservative leader Andrew Scheer's dual Canada-U.S. citizenship, policy issues took a backseat to finger-pointing over the gaffes and foibles of party leaders.\u00a0\nBut against that backdrop, Trudeau did make sweeping pledges on issues of critical importance to Toronto residents and city officials.\n\"His campaign promised to continue investing in transit expansion in Toronto, in affordable housing, and in kids and families as an important element in addressing the roots of gun violence \u2014 three important priorities for our City,\" said Mayor John Tory in a statement on Monday night.\nOn the housing front, and likely of interest to residents in an area where rent is sky-high and the average house price is more than $800,000, Trudeau's incoming government plans to offer first-time home-buyer subsidies of 10 per cent on new home purchases and five\u00a0per cent on resale homes, with certain restrictions.\nThe Liberals also hope\u00a0to build 100,000 affordable homes over a decade\u00a0\u2014 a goal that's five times smaller than was proposed by the NDP under\u00a0Jagmeet Singh.\nWhile the New Democrats only won 24 seats, Coun. Mike Layton\u00a0\u2014\u00a0son of the party's late former federal leader Jack Layton\u00a0\u2014 hopes the minority scenario allows the party to encourage bolder action from Trudeau's ranks.\n\"We've got two parties there that are going to want to outdo one another, and hopefully what that will mean is they'll get together and work out a scenario so that we can see money activated quickly in Toronto for affordable housing,\" he said.\nThe \"easiest\" thing the Liberals could do out of the gate to get shovels in the ground, Tory said on Tuesday morning, would be to quickly make parcels of federally owned land available for housing projects.\n\"At my request, they've done an inventory, not just in Toronto but across the country ... I think this will be something they'll get strong support on from the New Democratic Party,\" he added.\nMore money could also start flowing through the Liberal's National Housing Strategy, a 10-year plan that\u00a0includes the $4-billion Canada Housing Benefit, which the federal government previously said would provide an average rent subsidy of $2,500 annually beginning in April 2020.\u00a0\n\"We'll have to make sure they keep their word on that,\" Tory warned.\nOn the transit file, the Liberals promised an additional $3 billion in public transit funding each year. And a big Toronto-specific pledge came late in the campaign: investment in the city's transit priorities.\nThe announcement came the same day Tory and provincial officials revealed a potential agreement on the transit front, with council poised to back Premier Doug Ford's Ontario Line\u00a0in exchange for the province scrapping plans to take over the entire subway system.\u00a0\nAnnounced back in April, the proposed transit line\u00a0is set to run from Ontario Place, across the downtown core, and\u00a0up to the Ontario Science Centre. Longer than the city's in-motion plans for a long-awaited downtown relief line, the route\u00a0would cost close to $11 billion to build, the province says.\n\"This agreement that we see is a good omen, and the Liberals' commitment to public transit, stated in the last [term], should materialize in getting things built here,\" said Ryerson University professor Murtaza Haider.\nThough the Ontario Line route has stirred controversy over potential delays, amid questions about whether the proposal is feasible from the Liberals and others, Tory expressed hope that he'll be able to facilitate discussion between both higher levels of government.\n\"It's my job to bring them both to the table to help build transit,\" he said.\nGun violence in Toronto has also been a key issue, with hundreds of shootings recorded annually, and it's also an area where the Liberals focused some of their campaign energy.\nThe federal government previously introduced\u00a0Bill C-71, expanding firearm background checks, and\u00a0rolled out more gun-control policies\u00a0mid-campaign\u00a0with a promise to ban semi-automatic assault-style rifles.\nThe party also pledged to give cities more power to restrict or ban handguns. It's a move welcomed by Tory, who\u00a0said \"considerable\" additional investment in neighbourhoods and families\u00a0will also be crucial to preventing violence.\u00a0\nThe question now is how many of the promises potentially affecting Toronto will become a reality\u00a0\u2014 since a minority parliament could create some hurdles for Trudeau, and lead voters\u00a0back to the polls sooner than they'd like.\n\"It's going to be more difficult for the Liberals to put forward their agenda going forward,\" said University of Toronto political science professor Andrew McDougall.\u00a0\n\"So we're going to have to see what the other parties think about those priorities.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Government lays out fine print of new CMHC program that could contribute 10% to price of first home", "description": "Program will be limited to first-time buyers who earn under $120K a year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cmhc-first-time-buyer-program-1.5178055", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5178080.1560775983!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/housing-realtor-sale-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 17, 2019 9:09 AM ET", "2019-06-17T16:23:51.786Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The government on Monday released details of\u00a0a program announced during the last federal budget,\u00a0an initiative that could see Canada's housing agency contribute up to 10 per cent of the price of a buyer's first home if certain conditions are met.\nUnder the\u00a0fine print for the First Time Home Buyer Incentive program, which was announced\u00a0in March and will officially launch in September, a first-time homebuyer who earns less than $120,000 can qualify. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation would kick in up to 10 per cent of the purchase price of the home, providing the borrower comes up with the minimum amount for an insured mortgage, which is now at five\u00a0per cent.\nThere's also a requirement that the total value of the mortgage plus the CMHC's portion don't\u00a0eclipse $480,000. A government official says that\u00a0effectively means the program is only available for properties worth a maximum of about $565,000, regardless of whether or not they have met the\u00a0other requirements.\nIf that bar is met, the CMHC may kick in an additional five\u00a0per cent of the purchase price of a resale home. For a newly built home, the CMHC\u00a0may contribute\u00a0up to 10 per cent.\nThe\u00a0stakes from the CMHC\u00a0would be\u00a0interest free, meaning no ongoing cost to pay down, like a mortgage does.\nBut the government says in exchange for its stake, the CMHC\u00a0would get\u00a0to participate \"in the upside and downside of the change in the property value\" \u2014 which means they would be\u00a0entitled to any corresponding increase in the value of a home when the buyer eventually sells. On the flip side, the government would\u00a0also be on the hook for any share of the loss if the property depreciates.\nOn a home costing $500,000, if the borrower puts up $25,000 and the CMHC puts up the same amount, the CMHC\u00a0would then\u00a0own\u00a0five\u00a0per cent of that home. So if, down the line, the house appreciates\u00a0to $600,000 and the borrower wants to sell, they would have to give the CMHC\u00a0five per cent of the sale price \u2014 $30,000 in this example \u2014 not the $25,000 the CMHC put down in the first place.\nWhile a bill would\u00a0be paid down the line, the savings over the years could\u00a0add up. In the example above, the program would save a would-be borrower $286 a month in mortgage costs over the life of the loan,\u00a0$3,430 a year.\n\"This will mean more money in the pockets of Canadians and will help up to an estimated 100,000 families across\u00a0Canada,\" said Jean-Yves Duclos, the Liberal MP and cabinet member in charge of the CMHC.\nFinancial adviser Rajiv Bissessur\u00a0says the program will likely help some people, but ultimately, it\u00a0amounts to just another form of debt for overleveraged borrowers.\n\"It's an interest-free loan, but it's still a loan they will have to pay back,\" he said.\nHe also said\u00a0the relatively low cap on prices and loan amounts\u00a0won't do much to help people who need it most, to\u00a0buy in some of the more expensive markets. \"We are not really fixing the problem.\"\nThe program must be paid back within 25 years \u2014 or if the buyer sells before that \u2014\u00a0but there's no financial penalty for buying the CMHC out of its stake, at whatever the fair value of the home is at the time.\nApplications will be accepted as of Sept. 2 for home sales that will close no earlier than Nov.\u00a01.\nIn addition to offering these programs itself, the government has earmarked $100 million a year to help fund other organizations that already offer similar programs.\nThat's a group that could include Toronto-based Options For Homes, which\u00a0has worked with 3,000 homeowners over the last quarter century on a similar model \u2014 putting up money to help them become home purchasers, in exchange for a stake in the property down the line.\n\"[This]\u00a0will go a long way to help to improve access to home ownership for middle-income earners and make progress in tackling affordability issues,\" CEO Heather Tremain said.\n\"We've been using the shared equity mortgage model for more than 25 years and have seen first-hand the positive impact it can have on working Canadians looking to achieve the dream of home ownership.\"\nBut some are critical of the government's program because they say it does little to help buyers in expensive cities that need the most help.\nMortgage Professionals Canada, which represents brokers across Canada, noted the $560,000 cap on the program makes it essentially useless in Toronto and Vancouver, where even entry-level homes cost far more.\nAgain, FTHBI helps aspiring homebuyers buy homes which cost less than approx $500,000. While this program may help in some parts of Canada, the average May 2019 home price reported by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TREBhome?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TREBhome</a> in the GTA, where the announcement was made, was $838,540.<a href=\"https://t.co/yb7CfUSCv8\">https://t.co/yb7CfUSCv8</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qT23CPAh6n\">pic.twitter.com/qT23CPAh6n</a>\nJames Laird, president of mortgage brokerage Canwise Financial, said the government program could actually reduce a would-be buyer's purchasing power in some cases. Eligibility is capped, where the amount being borrowed must be no more than four times the person's\u00a0annual income, but standard mortgage stress test rules allow for borrowers to get between 4.5 and 4.7 times their income.\n\"Those who would be attracted to the program would be Canadians who are trying to purchase at their maximum qualification,\" Laird said.\u00a0\"However, because the program diminishes how much you can qualify for, it doesn't serve the needs of the group it is targeted at. Canadians can get a larger loan by not participating in the program.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Vancouver-area home sales rebound from last year as prices inch downward: REBGV", "description":

in the Metrotown area.\nMembers of Stop Demovictions Burnaby\u00a0and tenants facing possible eviction\u00a0are gathering at\u00a0a public hearing to oppose four applications that could mean the demolition of eight existing residential buildings.\nBuildings on the chopping block include:\u00a04960 Bennett St.,\u00a06525 Telford Ave., 6444 Willingdon\u00a0Ave.,\u00a04241 Maywood St. and four buildings on Marlborough Avenue.\u00a0\nThe applications are now up for consideration after Mayor Mike Hurley replaced Derek Corrigan in Oct. 2018 and put a year long moratorium on demovictions\u00a0while forming a\u00a0housing task force to consider reforming city\u00a0rental policies.\nIn a statement, Zhan Dong, who has lived in the building on Willingdon Avenue\u00a0for 14 years, said developers don't care about tenants.\n\"The prices are skyrocketing, and we live in fear of becoming homeless, but developers just want to work with the government, not with us,\" said Dong.\nC\u00e9cile Revaux, a spokesperson with Stop Demovictions Burnaby, said the group is demanding city hall not approve rezoning until people are sure they will be able to move back \"into the same neighbourhood at the same price.\"\n\u00a0All four developers of the pending projects have promised to include non-market and affordable rental units in the new buildings, but Stop Demovictions\u00a0says there is no legal obligation for developers or the city to house people in the interim.\n\"They don't have much to offer because there isn't much on the market,\" said Revaux in an interview on CBC's The Early Edition. \"We still feel a lot of fear and uncertainty.\"\nCity Coun.\u00a0Pietro Calendino said the mayor's task force on housing has completed its review of tenant policies and will submit its\u00a0findings Tuesday night to the city's planning and development\u00a0committee. He said there were renters advocates on the force and they were \"very strong in ensuring we had a renters protection plan enacted.\"\nAccording to Calendino, new city policies that came out of the task force's findings mean tenants must be provided with moving expenses and be given the option to come back at the same rate, plus whatever increases the province's Residential Tenancy Act\u00a0allows.\nDevelopers must also help find housing in the neighbourhood for displaced tenants before they begin demolition.\u00a0\nRevaux said, so far, the tenants she has spoken with have had \"barely any help\" locating new homes and have been shown printed ads from Craigslist with prices above their current rents.\u00a0\n\"'When we meet people\u00a0on the ground, the situation has not changed that much',\" said Revaux.\nThe group is demanding no eviction notices be sent until every tenant in the four buildings has access to a stable housing nearby at the same price they pay now. Tenants also want the city to force developers to maintain the buildings people are still living in up until they are demolished.\u00a0\nTo hear interviews with\u00a0C\u00e9cile Revaux\u00a0and\u00a0Pietro Calendino, tap the audio link below:\n"}, {"author": "Richard White", "title": "OPINION | Calgary's slogan should be 'The Family Friendly City'", "description": "Let\u2019s stop being ashamed of our big suburban homes with their double garages", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-family-friendly-city-richard-white-1.5451558", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5191020.1580845424!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/livingston-display-2.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 06, 2020 5:00 AM MT", "2020-02-06T12:00:00.990Z"], "source": null, "content": "This column is an opinion from Richard White, who has written extensively on Calgary's urban development.\nWhile most cities try to encourage young and restless global entrepreneurs to move there and set up a business and thrive in the 21st century economy, maybe it's time for Calgary to try something different.\nPerhaps Calgary would be wise to focus its marketing on a different demographic.\nLet's stop being ashamed of our affordable, big infill and suburban homes, with their backyards and double garages. Let's start to brand Calgary as \"North America's Family Friendly City.\"\u00a0It is our sweet spot!\nRecently, I sold two very cool Bob lounge chairs\u00a0on Kijiji (which I had previously purchased on Kijiji) to a Calgary newcomer who had just bought a new house in Airdrie with two living rooms\u00a0\u2014 a fact he shared with me several times.\nAfter we loaded the first chair into the back of his new Kia Telluride, with his young daughter sleeping in the back seat, I had to ask, \"What brought you to Calgary?\"\u00a0\nHe told me he and his wife were living in a small flat in Paris with two children and another on the way and decided they needed to live somewhere more family friendly.\nHe smiled and said, \"We were living the good life in Paris, but realized we needed more room.\"\u00a0\n\"Why Calgary?\" I asked.\nIt turns out these two IT professionals, born in Cameroon, picked Calgary because they could get a good paying job in their profession\u00a0as well as a big house and a big vehicle to get around in.\u00a0\u00a0\nThen the light bulb went on!\u00a0\nCalgary shouldn't be focusing on trying to attract the young-and-hip\u00a0tech worker, looking for big city culture and nightlife. We should be trying to attract the 30-something tech workers who are looking to settle down and raise a family.\u00a0\nCalgary needs to play to its strengths.\u00a0\nWhile Calgary is the fifth most livable city in the world (The Economist 2019 survey), it probably isn't in the top 50 (maybe 100) of the most exciting places to live for young entrepreneurs.\nI am betting Amsterdam, Austin, Berlin, New York, Barcelona, Paris, London, San Francisco, Melbourne, Sydney, Seoul, Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal enter their minds\u00a0long before Calgary. If Calgary ever does.\nIronically, as I was researching family-friendly cities for this piece, a German relocation service called Movinga published its Best Cities for Families 2020 findings that ranked 150 cities around the world. Calgary was ranked eighth.\nNot surprisingly, the top 10 was dominated by northern European cities, but a big surprise was Quebec City coming in at No. 2, just behind Helsinki.\u00a0Montreal finished ninth and Ottawa 14th. Neither Toronto nor Vancouver made it into the top 20.\u00a0\nCalgary ranked high in several of the 13 factors Movinga measured: affordability, education, air quality and neighbourhood safety.\u00a0Our high unemployment rate hurt us, as did children's activities, which surprised me.\nOne of the biggest barriers to raising a family in many cities is housing affordability.\u00a0\nSo, rather than talking up our new library, music museum, bike lanes or festivals, Calgary should be promoting the fact that you can buy an 1,800-square-foot house just minutes from downtown,\u00a0for under $500,000 US, or an even bigger house in the suburbs for the same price. This is unheard of in Vancouver, San Francisco, New York or London.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it comes to renting, a small one-bedroom apartment rents for $3,400 US in San Francisco or New York City \u2014 if you can find one.\nYou could get a $450,000, three-year fixed mortgage in Calgary for about $1,800 US per month, which would be an annual saving of $19,000 a year.\u00a0Or you could get a 625-square-foot, one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in Sodo (the shiny new 35-storey residential building on 10th Avenue in the Beltline) for about $2,000 Cnd. or $1,523 US per month, and pocket $1,900 per month, or $22,800 per year.\u00a0\nAnd yes, we should quote value in US dollars. Not only does it make our housing look more affordable, it also makes it easier for internationals to understand.\nAccording to a\u00a0study done by Zoocasa, based on December 2018 data, the most affordable North American\u00a0cities were:\nYes, Calgary is No. 1.\nSecond on the list of what makes Calgary attractive to parents is our average commute time: 26 minutes.\u00a0Compared with 68 minutes in San Francisco or 74 minutes in London or 43 minutes in New York City, this is a great selling feature for parents of a young family.\nCalgary is a great place for families to live because it is clean and safe, relative to other big cities. Also, our schools and health-care facilities are attractive and inexpensive, when you compare them to most other cities. Plus Calgary has one of the most child-friendly (read, fun-looking) hospitals in the world. Yet I can't recall ever seeing the Alberta Children's Hospital in a promotional video.\u00a0\nUNICEF's \"Child-Friendly Cities\" initiative encourages cities around the world to consider the perspectives, needs and interests of children when making decisions and developing policies and programs.\nAmong its key points, the initiative calls for children to \"live in a safe, secure and clean environment with access to green spaces,\" and to \"meet friends and have places to play and enjoy themselves.\" Hey \u2014 that's Calgary.\nDid you know that every Calgarian is within a five-minute walk to a park?\nYes, Calgary is blessed with over 5,600 parks and open spaces, as well as 1,000 kilometres of pathways, over 100 dog parks (dogs are a big part of family life these days) and 1,000 city playgrounds (that's about five per community, and that doesn't include school playgrounds).\u00a0\nAnd our modern recreation centres offer a plethora of programs and activities that makes them a welcoming gathering place for people of all ages and backgrounds.\nWhile some might say Calgary isn't family friendly because it is so car-oriented, I would argue most international families would love the fact that they can own a car and drive their kids to places, rather than using crowded transit or cycling \u2014 especially in the middle of winter.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd while it is legitimate to lament Calgary's car dominated culture, Calgary drivers are some of the most pedestrian-friendly in the world. There are not many cities where drivers routinely stop and let families cross the street (walking or cycling).\nCalgary is also one of the most ethnically diverse cities in North America, making it an attractive place for international families looking to raise a family in a welcoming society.\nBack in 2002, Richard Florida wrote a book called The Rise and Fall of the Creative Class.\u00a0His premise was that, in the 21st century, young creative professionals would choose where they wanted to live and work based on how bohemian, gay-friendly and ethnically diverse a city was.\nThe creative class included everyone from software engineers to dancers, from IT professionals to chefs.\nFlorida argued it would be the employees, not the corporations, who would determine what cities would thrive in the 21st century, as companies would move to cities where their employees wanted to live, or were already living, to avail themselves of the knowledge workers they needed.\nWe saw this exact situation play out when Amazon was determining where it would locate its second headquarters.\u00a0\u00a0\nFlorida created several indexes (bohemian, diversity, talent, gay) to help cities identify their strengths and weaknesses in attracting the creative class. Soon cities around the world were scrambling to see how they measured up and trying to determine how they could get themselves a higher ranking.\u00a0\nWhat Florida missed was the \"family friendly\" index.\u00a0\nWhat happens when the 20-somethings reach their 30s? Most of them pair up and start raising families, which means they start thinking about a house instead of an apartment, a mortgage instead of rent, a car instead of transit or a bike, and schools and playgrounds\u00a0rather than bars and festivals.\u00a0\u00a0\nPerhaps Calgary Economic Development should adopt the moniker, \"Calgary: The Family Friendly City\" or maybe \"The Family Fun City,\" as we try to diversify our economy.\nAnd how about including more families having fun in our promotional videos, rather than the young and restless.\u00a0\nJust a thought.\nThis column is an opinion.

Supreme Court judge has rejected a Chinese woman's bid to certify a class action lawsuit against a foreign buyers tax designed to tackle the province's housing affordability crisis.\nJustice Gregory Bowden dismissed Jing\u00a0Li's claim after finding that the 20 per cent tax levied against foreign purchasers of residential property in B.C.'s hottest housing markets does not discriminate against either Asian or\u00a0Chinese buyers.\nIn a 43-page decision released Friday, Bowden found that the tax draws distinctions based on immigration status \u2014 not ethnic or national origin.\nAnd that people who don't have Canadian citizenship, including Chinese nationals, don't have to pay the tax if they are permanent residents or provincial nominees.\n\"The structure of the tax is not responsible for any unequal burden on Asian persons,\" Bowden wrote.\n\"It is not a numbers game. Buyers from Asian countries, such as China, receive equal treatment that is proportionate to the demand from those countries.\"\nThe judge's decision comes after a landmark summary trial held to determine the fate of legislation the previous Liberal government introduced in 2016 in order to cool an overheated\u00a0Lower Mainland housing market.\nThe tax initially required foreign entities (including foreign nationals) to pay an additional 15 per cent on the purchase of residential property in Greater Vancouver.\nThe current NDP government increased the tax to 20 per cent in February 2018 and expanded the reach of the tax to include the Fraser Valley, Capital Regional District, Nanaimo Regional District and the Central Okanagan.\nLi moved to Canada from China in 2013 to complete a master's degree in public administration.\nShe entered into a contract to buy a half-million dollar condo in Burnaby\u00a0in July 2016, the\u00a0month before the tax came into effect.\nHer\u00a0closing date was in November, which meant she would have to pay an additional $83,850 as she was neither a permanent resident nor a Canadian citizen.\nThe case was decided through a summary trial in which\u00a0both Li and the government argued the case through written affidavit evidence and expert reports from an array of academics who have been among the most widely quoted voices on the housing crisis in the past decade.\n\"It is not disputed that there has been a housing affordability problem in the [Greater Vancouver Regional District] for a number of years,\" Bowden wrote.\n\"Home ownership in Vancouver became less affordable than all other cities in Canada. Vancouver had become one of the most unaffordable real estate markets in the world.\"\nThe judge explained\u00a0that the provincial government decided to follow in the footsteps of jurisdictions including Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel and Australia in implementing a foreign buyers tax.\n\"Local factors did not appear responsible for the inflation of housing prices and public\u00a0commentary pointed to foreign demand,\" Bowden\u00a0wrote.\nLi argued against the tax on a number of different grounds. She claimed that the province was trying to usurp federal powers over immigration and citizenship.\nAnd she also accused the province of violating Section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects against discriminating on the basis of race,\u00a0national or ethnic origin or colour.\nThe judge found that the tax was intended to \"dampen demand\" and discourage foreign nationals from purchasing real estate. He said it was designed to make the local housing market more affordable without denying non-Canadian citizens the opportunity to own, rent or lease housing.\nHe also rejected Li's claim that the tax perpetuates prejudice, stereotyping or disadvantages of Chinese people in B.C.\n\"It is also notable that there was overwhelming support for the tax among Asians living in Greater Vancouver,\" Bowden wrote, citing the research of urban studies professor Andrew Yan.\n\"Professor Yan states that Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Chinese descent are equally impacted by housing affordability and equally will benefit from any measures that improve affordability.\"\n"}, {"author": "Isaac Olson", "title": "'Now is the time for action,' says Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante, as Montreal vacancy rate hits 15-year low", "description": "Tenants' advocates worry critical housing shortage will lead to 'renters finding\u00a0themselves on the streets'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-low-rental-housing-rates-1.5428726", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3510284.1544202334!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/moving-day-scavengers-20140701.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 16, 2020 4:30 AM ET", "2020-01-16T09:30:00.414Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Montreal is running dangerously low on available rental housing, and\u00a0the city's mayor is calling on both Quebec and Canada to help.\nThe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) released its rental market report Wednesday, showing the city's rental vacancy rate is the lowest it's been in 15 years \u2014 1.5 per cent.\u00a0\n\"Now is the time for action,\" Montreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante tweeted in response to the CMHC findings.\nThe city will continue to work with the federal and provincial governments to find solutions, as they have an \"important role to play in the area of housing, in particular so that investments in social and affordable housing are quickly confirmed,\" she said.\nShe said the administration is \"working tirelessly to develop housing adapted to the needs and budget of Montrealers ... but we cannot do everything alone.\"\nLe taux d\u2019inoccupation des logements locatifs dans la grande r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al a atteint 1,5 % en 2019, r\u00e9v\u00e8le la <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SCHL_ca?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SCHL_ca</a>.

In 2019, 8,500 new units were added to the city's rental stock \u2014 1,000 more than in 2018.\nWith a record number of people migrating to the region, nearly every available apartment is occupied, especially in boroughs\u00a0such as the Sud-Ouest and Verdun, where the vacancy rate has dropped\u00a0as low as 0.5 per cent.\nApartments with three bedrooms or more are in the highest demand, with an average monthly rent hovering around $1,070 per month and a vacancy rate of 0.7 per cent.\nAnd things aren't looking much better off-island, as the vacancy rate in the suburbs has dropped to 1.2 per cent.\nThe rise in housing prices has also played a role, as fewer people under 35 are buying properties.\u00a0At the same time, with the aging population, more older homeowners are\u00a0downsizing to rentals, the report says.\nThe availability of rental housing in Montreal is on par with what's happening across the country. The national vacancy rate stood at 2.2 per cent. That's down from 2.4 per cent in 2018, making it the lowest level since 2002.\nSome landlords and developers say Quebec's\u00a0strict regulations \u2014 rent control, costly building permits, zoning laws \u2014 are hurting the industry and making the situation worse.\n\"The more regulations we have, we have\u00a0less production of new housing stock,\" said Hans Brouillette, spokesperson for the Corporation des Propri\u00e9taires Immobiliers du Qu\u00e9bec\u00a0(CORPIQ), a landlords'\u00a0association.\nThe first step, he said, is to scale back on provincial and municipal regulations that raise costs for investors looking to build or renovate properties.\u00a0All the extra\u00a0costs get passed onto the renters, he said.\nProperty owners who can't raise rent enough to cover those costs\u00a0may turn to other options such as subdividing the property, letting their family move in, or hosting short-term rental services like Airbnb, he said.\nThey may even resort to leaving\u00a0the property vacant because it's not profitable to invest\u00a0tens of thousands of dollars in a unit that can only be rented at a nominal rate under the province's rental control laws, he said.\u00a0\n\"The rents are too low for the trouble of managing those apartments or renovating them,\" Brouillette said.\nHowever, those very regulations and policies that are\u00a0keeping more rental stock off the markets, according to Brouillette's group,\u00a0are what\u00a0tenants' advocacy groups say Quebec needs to tighten up.\nA provincial coalition of housing advocacy groups, RCLALQ, is demanding Quebec's housing minister come up with short-term emergency measures.\n\"Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest must act quickly if we want to prevent renters from finding\u00a0themselves on the streets on July 1,\" said RCLALQ spokesperson Maxim Roy-Allard in a statement.\nRents are becoming unaffordable\u00a0for many tenants, says RCLALQ, with\u00a095,000 Quebecers\u00a0paying more than 50 per cent of their income toward shelter, forcing them to cut back on other necessities.\nAnd the competition for rental units creates other problems as well, the group says.\n\"These low vacancy rates intensify the discrimination experienced by tenants as owners become more selective,\" tsaid RCLALQ.\n\"Even if discrimination is prohibited under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, many landlords do not hesitate to discriminate or use different schemes to avoid renting to certain people.\"\n"}, {"author": "Alex Brockman", "title": "In Nunakput, residents grapple with the N.W.T.'s most complex challenges", "description": "'How do we survive?

Families in all four of the Arctic communities that make up the Nunakput riding find themselves in similar situations\u00a0as they deal with the high cost of living, inadequate housing, and distance from the government services that are supposed to help them.\u00a0\nSix candidates are running to represent Nunakput\u00a0in the Oct. 1 territorial election: Annie Steen, Jackie Jacobson,\u00a0Alisa Blake\u00a0and Holly Campbell\u00a0from Tuktoyaktuk; Sheila Nasogaluak from Sachs Harbour; and Herb Nakimayak, the incumbent from Paulatuk.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhoever is elected will be tasked with addressing the complex issues families like Illasiak's face in the territory's biggest and most northern riding.\u00a0\nNunakput is made up of Tuktoyaktuk, Ulukhaktok, Sachs Harbour, and Paulatuk\u00a0\u2014 some of the territory's most expensive communities.\nIn Paulatuk, flour sells for $23.79 for a five-kilogram bag, a two-kilogram bag of sugar costs $10.29, and a kilogram tin of coffee sells for $30.99. In Yellowknife, the same bag of flour was $8.99, the sugar was on sale for $2.50 and the coffee was $18.99.\nGetting out on the land isn't cheap either\u00a0with trips often costing $2,000 or more, explained George Krengnektak, a hunter with one eye and tobacco stained hands.\u00a0\n\"I don't want my family, my grandchildren to go hungry,\" Krengnektak, 72, said. \"I bring food for them all the time. I don't like to see them hungry for meat and fish.\"\u00a0\nSlow economic activity in the region compounds this problem.\u00a0\nUnemployment across Nunakput is 24 per cent, three times the N.W.T. rate. Nearly half of\u00a0workers work part-time or only part of the year, while only one in four are employed full time year-round.\nOil and gas exploration and extraction remains stagnant in the region, and many work a few different jobs to make ends meet.\n\"The oil companies all pulled up their stakes and went south, you've got no one in the region right now,\" said Eddie Dillon, the chair of the Tuktoyaktuk Community Corporation.\u00a0\nThree of the four communities are fly-in only for the entire year, and Tuktoykatuk is still getting used to having year-round highway access.\u00a0\nIt's been nearly two years since the $300-million Inuvik Tuktoyaktuk\u00a0Highway opened, but people in Tuktoyaktuk say they still aren't seeing the transformative changes that were promised.\u00a0\nTourism has increased, though it isn't driving the economy in a meaningful way, and the community isn't getting the support it needs to care for tourists who come, Dillon said.\u00a0\n\"It's nice to talk about tourism, but we haven't gotten the dollars to upgrade the facilities to meet the tourism needs,\" he said.\u00a0\nBut some are worried that even if the road hasn't changed things yet, it may in time become a wedge between Tuktoyaktuk and the coastal communities, simply because Tuktoyaktuk is no longer isolated.\nThe road gives Tuktoyaktuk the ability to control costs in a way that the other communities, who rely solely on barges and airplanes for re-supply, can't.\n\"The reality of living in Tuk is different than the reality of living in Sachs Harbour,\" said Vernon Amos, the chair of the Sachs Harbour Community Corporation.\u00a0\n\"There's a core set of problems that are common in all communities, but each community has its own unique set of problems.\"\nFor example, while all the communities are dealing with the effects of climate change, in\u00a0Tuktoyaktuk, homes are about to fall into the ocean, with community officials crying out for relief from the federal and territorial governments.\u00a0\nPeople have started talking about splitting the riding, with one MLA representing Tuktoyaktuk and another representing the coastal communities.\u00a0\n\"Family-wise we're still connected, whether there's a road or not.

She\u00a0blames a\u00a0housing official for giving her wrong information, which forced her to leave her home.\n\"You can't get any answers from the [housing] board here,\" Green said.\u00a0\"It felt like nobody was listening.\"\u00a0\nGreen is one of many on the housing waitlist across the riding \u2014 which is also a larger issue throughout the Northwest Territories.

It's no longer the cheap area,\" Gonzalez said.\nShe said new businesses in the area have helped revitalize the neighbourhood, but housing costs have risen as a result.\u00a0\n\"People are having a hard time finding something that they can afford rental-wise, [and] purchasing a home has become really expensive,\"\u00a0said Kayla Lessard, the community development coordinator with Ford City Neighbourhood Renewal.\nLessard added that as a result, it's pushing some people out and\u00a0away from the place\u00a0they used to call home.\nNot long ago, one could find a one-bedroom apartment in the realm of $550 or $650, Gonzalez\u00a0explained.\u00a0Now, however, apartments cost\u00a0closer to $1,000.\u00a0\n\"That was unheard of two years ago even. And so, across the city, but specifically in Ford City, seeing that happen is kind of shocking,\" she said.\nGonzalez\u00a0explained that\u00a0many residents in the neighbourhood have been forced to resort to living situations that aren't necessarily safe or legal.\nShe gave an example of a man in the area who lives in a basement apartment that regularly floods and has black mould.\nGonzalez said he can't afford anything else, adding that for others in similar situations, there's a fear that if they file a complaint about their unsafe living conditions, they'll end up on the streets because they'll have no where else to go.\nWith the federal election around the corner, Gonzalez said she'd like to see candidates push for more subsidies for low-income individuals; more incentives for landlords to keep their homes affordable; and more investment towards geared-to-income housing.\nThe Liberal party\u00a0aims to build 100,000 affordable housing units over the next\u00a0decade. They would also encourage home ownership through a first-time home-buyer incentive that subsidizes up to 10 per cent of the purchase of a new home and five per cent on resale homes \u2014 with restrictions.\u00a0\nIn a statement, Windsor-Tecumseh\u00a0Liberal candidate Irek Kusmierczyk said, from his experience as a Windsor city councillor, he's seen that there is \"absolutely a shortage of affordable housing,\" as well as as a long wait list for affordable housing.\u00a0\n\"As the member for Windsor-Tecumseh, I want to advocate for our community to make sure we benefit from our Liberal government's new, 10-year investment of nearly $20 billion in social infrastructure,\" said Kusmierczyk, adding that the Liberal party will prioritize significant new investment in affordable housing as well as seniors' facilities.\u00a0\nThe NDP have a more ambitious plan, committing to building 500,000 affordable housing units in a decade.\n\"This is a real challenge for people,\" said Cheryl Hardcastle, the NDP candidate in Windsor-Tecumseh.\u00a0\n\"First of all, the opportunities that young people have to be first-time homebuyers is nearly impossible now. The second thing is the variety of housing options that we have is extremely limited now,\" Hardcastle said. \"So, regarding your income or stage of life for instance, you want to downsize as a senior, the market just is not accommodating people that way and in a way that they can afford. So it really is a big concern.\"\nShe added that, in addition to building more units, the NDP will work to make things easier for first-time homebuyers; will implement a foreign buyers tax on residential properties bought by people who do not live in Canada; and will find ways to develop a greater variety of housing options for would-be\u00a0residents.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the Conservative party\u00a0plans on reviewing the so-called \"stress test\" to help first-time homebuyers get approved for mortgages and allow people to take out longer mortgages for lower monthly payments.\u00a0\nLeo Demarce, the Conservative candidate for Windsor-Tecumseh, said the Conservative\u00a0party will also look at federal Crown land and bring it to the market to provide development for affordable housing. Furthermore, he added that the party is looking to eliminate the federal carbon tax, which he said has a huge cost on affordability.\u00a0\n\"Personally I am going to go into the communities and talk about affordable housing with our city councillors and our mayors and talk about really reaching out to the developers in terms of creating developments for affordable housing, as opposed to larger houses with more condensed access, more condensed housing,\" Demarce said, adding that he'd like to prioritize housing for seniors as well.\u00a0\nWindsor-Tecumseh Green party Giovanni Abati said there is certainly a housing crunch.\u00a0\n\"The Green party is pushing for giving incentives, either tax incentives if people want to donate land or property, tax incentives like removing the GST from builders if they want to build affordable housing or senior's homes or childcare spaces, there's a need for all that.\"\nDaniel Burr, Windsor-Tecumseh People's Party candidate,\u00a0said it's necessary to look at the causes of affordable housing issues in the riding, pointing to high levels of immigration in Canada as a concern.\n\"Immigrants are settling in large cities like Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and driving up the housing prices in those cities,\" he said.\n\"We're seeing a trickle down effect in Windsor as far as the housing prices in Windsor from people moving from Toronto are \u2014 you know, driving up to housing prices in Windsor.\u00a0So if we can lower the immigration levels to more realistic levels for Canada, I think that will help with affordable housing.\"\nHe said there is no housing plan included in his party's platform, but there is a plan to make life in general more affordable.\nLaura Chesnik, Windsor-Tecumseh Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada (MLPC) candidate,\u00a0said the government needs to invest in high-quality public housing, adding that there needs to be more units in place to address rent control, private monopolies of buildings\u00a0and to protect individuals against discrimination when they seek housing.\u00a0\n\"One of the MLPC policies is that housing is a right and so it should be enshrined in the constitution as a basic human right,\" she said.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Estefania Duran", "title": "Metro Vancouver home sales surge 23.5% in July compared to last year", "description": "Fraser Valley saw an increase of 13%; benchmark prices fall", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/metro-vancouver-home-sales-july-2019-1.5234986", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5119539.1556766415!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-sale-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 02, 2019 1:46 PM PT", "2019-08-02T23:48:27.051Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Following what was considered to be one of the worst Junes in almost two decades, home sales have gone up.\u00a0\nThat's according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver (REBGV), which saw a jump of 23.5 per cent across Metro Vancouver this July compared to the same month last year.

The incident was later diagnosed as\u00a0a case of sudden infant death syndrome.\n\"My attempts at giving her CPR didn't work,\" Paquette\u00a0told CBC News from her home in Chilliwack. \"I had to call on my son Lucas to help...\u00a0and he saved her life.\"\nThough Eleanor survived, the baby,\u00a0now just over six months old, suffered severe brain damage. She's partially blind and has been diagnosed with epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Paquette says she spends many of her days travelling to medical appointments across\u00a0the region.\nBut\u00a0she has four other kids to care for, and the family is in dire financial straits. Paquette couldn't afford to pay the December rent on her three-bedroom apartment as she grapples with health, food and living costs.\nPoverty advocates say Paquette's\u00a0situation has become all too common in the Fraser Valley and beyond, as the unaffordability crisis hits families across the province.\n\"As the cost of living increases, the cost of housing, the cost of child care \u2014 particularly for children with special needs \u2014 people are falling into poverty,\" said Helesia Luke, a spokesperson with the poverty advocacy group First Call B.C.\nA recent provincial report card found that\u00a0one in five children in B.C. are in poverty.\n\"This is not a problem exclusive to the metro region at all,\" said Luke, \"As people leave those urban centres to get more affordable housing, housing prices in those [other]\u00a0areas go up as well.\"\nPaquette hopes\u00a0her family will get accepted\u00a0into an affordable home provided by B.C.

A mother should never ever have to be put in this position \u2014 to really be faced\u00a0to look at paying expenses and bills, or paying your rent,\" she said. \"It's really hard.\"\nPaquette is a former support worker for vulnerable women, now\u00a0off work and collecting a monthly disability payment.\nThe family moved to Metro Vancouver from Cranbrook, B.C. in 2017, where they lived in subsidized housing. Leaving that behind was a tough decision for Paquette, but she felt it was necessary.\nHer six-year-old son Boden\u00a0has autism and she said there are more health services available for him in B.C.'s Lower Mainland.\n\"We left B.C. Housing for market rental \u2014 and we've just been trying to survive ever since,\" she said.\nSince then, she's had three more kids.\u00a0Eleanor\u00a0and her twin brother, Max, were born in June. The family of six has since settled in Chilliwack.\nTreating both Boden and Eleanor's disabilities on a limited income has been a\u00a0challenge. Paquette\u00a0has to make weekly trips to Vancouver for medical services, often for days at a time. The costs of food, fuel, accommodations, and medications have piled up.\n\"I'm just overblown with the amount of appointments we have make,\" she said. \"We see a pediatrician once a month, a neurologist once a month, physiotherapy, occupational therapy. We see a dietitian, we see an ophthalmologist... It's put us into a financial crisis.\"\nPaquette asked to be\u00a0issued an eviction notice prior to the day before her rent was due, knowing she couldn't afford it.\nThe document allows her to apply for a $700\u00a0crisis supplement\u00a0from the Ministry of Children and Family Development. She's hopeful she can put the dollars toward a delayed rent payment.\nPaquette has been working closely with housing advocates at the Salvation Army. Captain Matt Kean said the organization has been working\u00a0to find housing options for her.\nB.C. Housing would not comment on the circumstances due to confidentiality, but noted there are more than 20,000 people on its registry whose needs are assessed on a case-by-case basis. The agency offers subsidized units to families \u2014\u00a0but advocates say they can be difficult to access.\nViveca Ellis, a community organizer for the B.C. Poverty Reduction Coalition, said single mothers with more than three children struggle to find adequate housing in Metro Vancouver and across the province.\n\"They end up waiting on the affordable housing lists for a very long time, because there is not enough large family stock in British Columbia.\"\nIt's a future that feels fragile, and uncertain.

The agency found 53 per cent of men and 39 per cent of women over 65 were working in 2015, up sharply from 38 per cent and 17 per cent respectively in 1995.\u00a0\nBreidburg's report also found the net worth of Toronto-area seniors had risen in the past decade, citing employment incomes, retirement savings instruments and government support programs as contributing factors.\u00a0\nGreater financial means, combined with better overall health, leave a growing number of seniors feeling able to maintain their homes, she said.\nBut Breidburg said conditions in the city's over-heated real estate market may also be playing a role, noting that not all deferred downsizing plans are voluntary.\u00a0\n\"We found that more seniors want to age within their communities where they know friends and family,\" she said. \"But because\u00a0limited options are available for them, they stay in their homes\u00a0longer.\"\nBreidburg said lack of appropriate options can include a dearth of smaller homes as well as a shortage of affordable options, citing the supercharged real estate conditions that have made Toronto-area home prices among the highest in the country for the past several years.\nOn Tuesday, the Toronto Real Estate Board issued a report pegging the average July home sale price at $806,755. That figure was up 3.2\u00a0per cent from the same time the year before and reflected a 24.3 per\u00a0cent boost in year-over-year sales.\nThe Canadian Real Estate Association's latest market forecast\u00a0released in June projects that the national average price will drop\u00a00.6 per cent by the end of this year to roughly $485,000.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "A condominium?

Officials at the Department of Indigenous Services say they are fully committed to supporting Nunavut's efforts, but the necessary funding has yet to materialize.\nPatterson said Nunavut's Department of Health is working with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated \u2014 the organization that represents Inuit in Nunavut \u2014 to develop a regional plan, which will be unveiled in March. He says he is hopeful that the federal government will make the necessary financial commitments by then.\nBut there is a larger problem \u2014 clinics alone won't lead to the elimination of TB.\n\"TB numbers will drop but if we don't fix other problems \u2014 housing, food, employment \u2014 the numbers will come back,\" Patterson said.\u00a0\nThe housing crisis among Inuit is a major factor in the spread of TB and addressing the current housing needs in Nunavut will cost more than a billion dollars.\nPhilpott said it's time for Canadians to wake up to the fact that their fellow Canadians are dying as a result of underfunding.\n\"It comes time to put our money where our mouth is ... Canadians have not done what's right,\" Philpott said.\u00a0\nShe said the answer is to create unavoidable political pressure, which will only happen when all Canadians make northern living conditions a priority.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "From big bargains to bank breakers, Edmonton real estate stays stagnant", "description": "About 60 properties listed at less than $100K and 60 listed for more than $2 million", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/real-estate-edmonton-alberta-1.5406951", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5401030.1577125502!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-sale-graphic-edmonton-image.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 03, 2020 6:00 AM MT", "2020-01-03T13:00:00.755Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Search high or low in Edmonton's real estate market and you'll find similarly sized clusters of properties waiting to be sold.\nOn the low side, about 60 Edmonton properties were listed at less than $100,000 late last year.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, roughly the same number of properties were listed for more than $2 million.\nIn this sluggish market, the struggles can be similar for sellers, whether the home has a spiral staircase and room for a baby grand piano or is a one-bedroom condominium in an aging building.\n\"(They're) different leagues but it's interesting that some of the same pressures apply but in\u00a0different ways,\" said Michael Brodrick, chair of the Realtors Association of Edmonton. \"The whole market has been subject to these pressures on price.\"\nBut every real estate market is defined by opposing forces, which means if things are rough for sellers the possibilities are great for buyers.\n\"At the high end, you're getting very good value for your money.

B.C.-based credit union Central 1 said the same thing about real estate in that province, predicting a 4 per cent drop in prices.\nSo why isn't the Canadian economy in free fall?\nCarolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor\u00a0of the Bank of Canada offered some clues among the conflicting signals in her speech to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce on Thursday.\nToday's GDP numbers offer more clues.\nBut those expecting to feel bucked up by Wilkins may have been disappointed. The talk\u00a0was not exactly a buoyant explanation of why the Canadian economy did not need interest rate cuts.\nPerhaps suffering contagion from Alberta's current gloom, Wilkins' speech was mostly a litany of reasons why the Canadian economy was in trouble.\n\"There was the drop in oil prices last autumn and there are ongoing transportation constraints, as you well know,\" she told the Calgary crowd. \"Escalating trade tariff actions by the U.S. and China\u00a0and\u00a0the related uncertainty\u00a0that's around that has undermined trade and business investment.\"\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough\u00a0for an Alberta audience that has\u00a0also been suffering\u00a0a real estate bust,\u00a0she was not exactly cheery on that subject either.\n\"Housing here at home\u00a0\u2014 the linchpin\u00a0in the recovery since the crisis\u00a0\u2014 has slowed sharply.\"\nAnd there was more. The population was aging. Spending wasn't so hot. The inverted yield curve threatens. Canadians are burdened with red tape. Canada trails competitors in R&D.\n\"Our read of the speech was still-cautious optimism,\" said Brian DePratto in a research note\u00a0from TD\u00a0Economics after Wilkins spoke.\u00a0\nThere was optimism there, but it had to be carefully picked out from amidst the misery.\nWilkins' main optimistic\u00a0point was that many of the worries the bank has are temporary. Despite the danger of continuing trade sniping between the U.S with both China and Europe, the lifting of tariffs between Canada and the U.S. over steel and aluminum is\u00a0a positive sign.\nSome of the best news was not necessarily great for an audience that sees so much of its bread and butter in the oil and gas sector that Wilkins saw fading in relative importance to the Canadian economy.\n\"Recent data\u00a0that we've seen so far suggests that investment\u00a0in the non-energy sector has started off the year in positive territory,\" said Wilkins. \"[Digital] economic activities now make up\u00a0the same share of nominal GDP in Canada as mining, oil and gas combined.\"\nA positive note for Alberta in that regard was that the province had the third biggest digital economy, including within the petroleum sector and in farming.\nAlso among the signs the Canadian economy is not going to hell in a handcart is\u00a0employment.\n\"The labour market has been strong, with solid growth in jobs and steady growth in wages,\" said Wilkins.\nShe said data shows that\u00a0in petroleum and construction, companies are not laying off workers even if they are not giving them as many hours. It is one more indicator to support the bank's contention that employers are expecting the economy to bounce back.\nWhat she did not say to the Calgary audience was that the oil and gas boom, while an enormous contributor to GDP, was not good for the larger Canadian industrial economy. As oil sales rose, so did the\u00a0loonie, pricing industrial producers out of their traditional export markets, leading to relocations and bankruptcies.\nBusinesses outside the main oil-producing regions would not see those heady days return.\nSimilarly Wilkins's boss, Stephen Poloz, himself has pointed out in the past that while house construction may stimulate\u00a0the economy, simply bidding up the prices of houses is not necessarily productive use of capital.\nOutside the West,\u00a0house prices may have stabilized. And while the wider B.C. economy remains strong, housing\u00a0is only going through a \"recession\" if you compare it to the absurd price rises of the previous decade. Anyone else would call it a brief correction back to something approaching normal, and certainly far from\u00a0the collapse so many have predicted.\nEven Central 1, the credit union predicting this year's 4 per cent decline, says prices will be slightly below flat in 2020, with sales bouncing back. By 2021, sales, prices and housing starts are predicted to resume at a healthy level.\nThat fits with the overall picture Wilkins painted:\u00a0Barring horrible trade war fallout, a return to stronger growth, a gradual increase in oil and gas and housing investment\u00a0\u2014 though at a more moderate rate than previously \u2014\u00a0while the digital knowledge and service economy continues to dominate.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "The fall real-estate update: Economists predict gradual rebound", "description": "It is rare to see a V-shaped recovery, writes personal finance columnist Mark Ting", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/the-fall-real-estate-update-1.5301302", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4970662.1585795521!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancouver-real-estate-20190103.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 29, 2019 9:00 AM PT", "2019-09-29T16:00:00.229Z"], "source": null, "content": "Spring is usually the hottest season for real estate but that wasn't the case in 2019. We saw inventories build and prices trend downwards.\u00a0However, things appear to have changed since then.\nAccording to the Canadian Real Estate Association, national home prices have increased for six consecutive months. The national home price index is up by 0.9 per cent\u00a0since August 2019.\nEconomists from RBC and Sotheby's have declared the housing correction over and expect a gradual rebound over the near term.\u00a0Homes priced up to $1 million have seen an uptick in selling activity,\u00a0whereas the higher priced luxury market, which has been hit the hardest, remains soft.\u00a0\u00a0\nSince the spring, sentiment around real estate has improved. Interest rates have been dropping and prices have adjusted downwards. This means that buyers can afford more \"house\" compared to last year.\nThere is also a greater sense of urgency to purchase compared to last spring due to the China/Hong Kong conflict.\u00a0Some fear that if the conflict escalates, as many as 300,000 Hong Kong/Canadian dual citizens could flood our local market and drive up prices.\u00a0\nIt's hard to generalize our real estate market.\u00a0 It isn't one \"Lower Mainland\" market \u2014 it is more like 30 submarkets. Overall, I'd say it is more or less balanced, with lots of hot and cold pockets. It really depends on the location and price point.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPre-sales and newly built condos aren't selling very well.\u00a0Not only is there currently a large number available on the market, there are more expected over the next year.\nSeveral pre-sale projects have been cancelled due to a lack of demand with some developers needing to offer incentives to entice buyers.\u00a0\nThis past June, a developer was famously offering buyers a years' worth of avocado toast, but since then they have had to up the ante. Now, instead of toast, one developer is giving away a Telsa worth $55K with every home purchase.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother area not doing well is the luxury market. This has been the hardest hit with price drops, in some areas, of 40 per cent. The main reason for the lack of buyers is that, despite the 40 per cent\u00a0price drop, the luxury market is still expensive. A home worth $7 million\u00a0in 2017 would still cost over $4 million\u00a0today,\u00a0a price few can afford.\u00a0\u00a0\nThose buying in the luxury market in 2017 were often foreign buyers and that market has completely dried up.\u00a0Many have suggested that foreign buyers used our real estate market as a bank account. Well, instead of making deposits, they are now making withdrawals.\u00a0\nFor the first time in decades, the Chinese have become net sellers of global assets, which includes Vancouver real estate. As a result of this behavioural change, the areas of our market that were popular with foreign investors are now struggling.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother consideration that will have an impact on real estate is the upcoming election. Exactly how the election will affect housing is hard to quantify as we don't know who will win, whether they will follow through with their pre-election promises or, if they do, how fast they implement their plan.\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not rushing into this market even if some experts say that it has bottomed.\u00a0It can bounce along the bottom for quite some time. It is rare that you see a V-shaped recovery with real estate unless there was a major crash.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the end of the day I use spreadsheets. If the math works, be it a home for you to live in or a revenue property,\u00a0then I would be inclined to go through with a deal.\u00a0If the math doesn't work, then be patient and try again when the numbers make more sense.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Hand sanitizer is a hot commodity these days, because health experts say the best way to protect yourself is to keep your hands clean, either with soap and water or \u2014 if that's not available \u2014 an alcohol-based sanitizer.  Frances Steciuk said she found hand sanitizer at her local Shoppers Drug Mart in Toronto last week, but didn't buy it because she felt the price was inflated.\u00a0\"I kind of hit the roof,\" she said, recalling her reaction when she saw travel-size, 60-ml bottles of hand sanitizer selling for $3.99 each. She\u00a0recalled paying half that price previously.  Loblaws, which owns Shoppers, told CBC News the brand Steciuk's local store was selling wasn't one of its typical brands.\u00a0To meet local demand,\u00a0the store had to go with a different brand that was still available. Based on the wholesale cost, the $3.99 price tag is still in line with its usual price structure, a spokesperson said.\u00a0\n(Themba Hadebe/Associated Press)\nA visitor pretends to hold up this upside-down house in South Africa, in this photo taken March 5, 2020. With its roof on the ground and its floor in the air, the house is attracting tourists who want to see the world from a different perspective. Located near Hartebeestpoort, about 75 kilometres north of Johannesburg, the house is inverted on the outside and inside. Visitors can take pictures of themselves in rooms that have sofas and chairs hanging from the ceiling. The kitchen is also upside down with appliances appearing to defy gravity.\nAs the global number of coronavirus cases hits 120,000 people in more than 100 countries, chances of stopping its spread are now considered unlikely.\u00a0So public health officials have turned their attention to slowing it down. As CBC's Kelly Crowe writes, the key is to \"flatten the curve\" \u2014 a reference to an epidemiological graph of a disease outbreak.\u00a0A large spike on that graph, representing a sudden increase in people with infections, can be catastrophic even for health-care systems in highly developed countries like Canada.\u00a0Read more on this story here.

We have one income,\" she said.\nDouthwright shares the home with her husband, Mike, and five children:\u00a0Alivia, 10, Kyliee, 8, Kaden, 5, Brooklyn, 3,\u00a0and Liam, 7 months. The three-bedroom home is part of a cul-de-sac development of 12 identical homes owned by Klavdia Gonopolskiy of Halifax.\nDouthwright said\u00a0she moved into the home because the street offered a safe place for her children to play with neighbours. The current $1,300 monthly rent, which includes cold water but no other utilities, fits her family's budget, she said.\nThen on Feb. 29, Douthwright said\u00a0she received a notice from her landlord about the rental increase, which she said\u00a0she can't afford.\nDoughwright said two neighbours she's friends with received rental increases of $25 a month, and another\u00a0received no increase at all. After the increases, those neighbours will be paying between $1,325 and $1,375.\nDouthwright sent an email to her landlord\u00a0asking why her increase was\u00a0so much more than her neighbours.\nIn an email reply, Gonopolskiy said Douthwright was not honest about how many of her children would be living in the home when she signed her lease. Gongolposkiy said she'd charge $1,450 per month to a large family who wants to move in.\n\"If I will need to rent a unit to a family of 6: 2 adults and 4 kids with a big dog, I will ask for the same price,\" Gonopolskiy wrote.\nShe wrote that she would not discuss how much she charges her other tenants as the amounts are \"confidential.\"\nDouthwright said\u00a0she doesn't understand why she and her family are being treated differently and doesn't believe it's fair.\nMegan Deveaux, a community legal worker with Dalhousie Legal Aid in Halifax who specializes in residential tenancy disputes, said landlords in Nova Scotia can increase rents by any amount once per year, as long as they give tenants adequate notice.\nBut there are several grounds for a tenant to appeal, including that they are being singled out in some way and receiving a rent increase much larger than others who live in similar-sized units in the same building.\nDeveaux,\u00a0who wouldn't comment\u00a0on Douthwright's situation, said\u00a0tenants can appeal a rent increase that's too high compared to market rates for a similar unit. But she said\u00a0leeway is given to landlords who have made improvements to their properties or who are incurring extra costs.\n\"The landlord's burden at that point is to demonstrate that this is a reasonable increase, even though it's different than everybody else's,\" Deveaux said.\nShe said landlords have no legal authority to bar family members living together in a home, unless there's a safety issue such as a restraining order against another tenant in the building.\nLandlords can charge more rent for more residents in a unit, but only if they can demonstrate an increased cost burden as a result.\nGonopolskiy denied in an interview that\u00a0she is discriminating against the Douthwrights and said she too has children. She\u00a0said\u00a0she purchased the buildings on Romaz Court in 2016, about a year after she immigrated to Canada from Israel.\nHer experience as a landlord has been good, she said, but\u00a0dealing with Douthwright has been hard work.\nShe said\u00a0Douthwright's rental cheques\u00a0are routinely returned with insufficient funds, and that she pays her rent late nearly every month. Gonopolskiy\u00a0said it often takes dozens of messages to collect a month's rent.\nIn May 2019, the residential tenancies board issued an eviction notice to the Douthwright family for chronic late payment of rent. Gonopolskiy said\u00a0she allowed the family to stay in an attempt to be compassionate.\n\"Because they have kids, I said, 'OK, now you know you can stay. If you will pay your rent, I will still give you time,' because they were already overdue,\" she said.\nGonopolskiy said\u00a0the new rental amount\u00a0is fair market value for the unit, and the discrepancy in rents between units has to do with when her various tenants moved into Romaz Court.\n\"If I rent her unit to another family, I would ask for this amount. It's a price on the market. They are almost there two years, and it's the first time I give them an increase,\" Gonopolskiy said.\nBoth Douthwright and Gonopolskiy have appealed to Nova Scotia's residential tenancies board for relief. That hearing will take place on April 6.\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Douthwright said\u00a0she's filed a complaint with the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission.\n\"My family is just as good as everybody else's, no matter how many kids are in it. It should not have anything to do with an increase of rent,\" she said.\n\"We take care of this place. My kids don't bother anybody. My kids are great people, they're respectful. I just feel like it's very unfair.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "London's weather, traffic and gas prices for Friday", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-s-weather-traffic-and-gas-prices-for-friday-1.5334871", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334875.1571996138!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pumpkins-o-plenty.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Oct 25, 2019 5:47 AM ET", "2019-10-25T09:47:24.535Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Thank you Donna Currie\u00a0for this Fall photo of pumpkins at a local nursery.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nYou can share your pictures with us by emailing them to londonmorning@cbc.ca.\u00a0\nTop Story:\u00a0Local elementary teachers hold a strike vote.

In the two decades since, his childhood and future prospects have been shaped by the global financial crisis, the advent of the iPhone, social media and accelerating climate change.\nToday, he turns 20. He works as a car mechanic and as he\u00a0enters a new decade, he's considering his prospects for education, a relationship, and the idea of someday buying a house.\u00a0\nHe's\u00a0bracing for challenges\u00a0previous generations didn't have to face.\n\"It's really difficult to be able to afford things nowadays,\" said Parks, who lives with his parents in White Rock.\u00a0\n\"The whole economy has made it super difficult to live day-by-day.\"\nThe cost of living has risen for everyone, but it'll be harder than ever for post-millennials like Parks to achieve the milestones of previous generations, like buying property.\nIn 2000, the average price of a single family home in the Greater Vancouver real estate area was $376,000. Adjusted for inflation today, that would be about $533,000.\nThe average price of a single family home in November 2019 was $1.57\u00a0million.\u00a0\nBecause wages haven't caught up, working harder won't make up for the glaring difference, said Paul Kershaw, a policy professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of advocacy group Generation Squeeze.\n\"Gen Xers had the worst earnings, but home prices hadn't gone up as crazy as they have now,\" Kershaw said.\n\"Millennials had better earnings than Xers but they had much more challenging home prices. And now you've got post-millennials \u2026 they're inheriting both: challenging earnings and really frightening home prices.\"\nA common sentiment across generations is the desire for security, Kershaw said.

Her landlord,\u00a0Paval Kanagathurai, bought her building at the corner of King Street West and Cowan Avenue through a numbered company in August 2017.\u00a0\nSoon after, Goldfeder says the landlord started renovating the first floor to turn it into a Domino's Pizza, a process she says involved turning off the heat, which was never fully restored.\n\"It's been horrendous \u2026 I haven't been able to live in my unit for a lot of the winter,\" Goldfeder said. \"It's so cold, it goes down to like 12 to 14 degrees in here and I have four of the portable units on all the time.\"\u00a0\nA Toronto by-law requires landlords to maintain a minimum air temperature of 21 C\u00a0in tenants' units between September and June. Landlords are also not allowed to withhold vital services, like heat, under Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act.\u00a0\nDespite reporting the issue to Municipal Licensing and Standards, and a violation notice issued by the city, Goldfeder says she still doesn't have adequate heat.\u00a0\n\"He's definitely freezing me out so I leave,\" she said.\u00a0\nWhen it gets too cold in her apartment, Goldfeder says she stays with friends who live in the area.\nIn a statement, Kanagathurai told CBC Toronto he does not want to \"comment on matters that are before the courts,\" but the allegations made by his tenants are \"either outright false or otherwise coloured to disguise the truth of the matter.\"\u00a0\nGoldfeder has considered moving, but so far says fighting for heat is still better than looking for affordable rent in Toronto. She pays $750 a month, less than the\u00a0average $1,081 per month rent for a bachelor apartment in Toronto, according to\u00a02018 data from\u00a0Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation (CHMC).\u00a0\nGetting priced out of the city is a fear Goldfeder shares with other tenants facing eviction from the same landlord at 410 Queen Street West.\nCBC Toronto spoke to a tenant from each of that building's three rental units, who've had a potential eviction hanging over their heads for almost a year. The tenants say Kanagathurai turned off the central heating used by two of the three units soon after buying the building\u00a0in December 2018.\u00a0\n\"We'd be sitting in our kitchen with our parkas on and gloves on, like that's how cold it was,\" said Paddy Gallagher, one of the tenants affected. \"He gave us portable heaters \u2026 and they were blowing fuses left and right.\"\nThe landlord installed a new heating system in the units\u00a0a few months ago \u2014\u00a0before an eviction hearing at the\u00a0Landlord Tenant Board (LTB). Kanagathurai\u00a0is trying to evict all of the tenants so that he can personally use the units.\u00a0\nAn affidavit Kanagathurai filed with the LTB for the eviction application\u00a0says the landlord plans to move into the Queen West building with his family to run the Domino's Pizza franchise he opened on the ground floor.\n\"My family has made the decision to move into the building where we work for both financial and family reasons,\" Kanagathurai's affidavit says. \"We will be listing our current family home on the market for sale.\"\u00a0\nChim Kan is another one of the tenants there. When he, Gallagher and others were trying to figure out whether they could fight the eviction notice, Kan discovered that Kanagathurai didn't personally own the building, but instead had bought it through a numbered company.\n\"This landlord is not like a mom and pop shop kind of landlord,\" said Kan. \"He actually owns multiple buildings and he's doing the same thing.\"\nCBC Toronto obtained property and business records that show in total Kanagathurai's companies own a dozen buildings in the city, which each include rental units and a Domino's Pizza franchise.\u00a0\nThe landlord also owns two houses in his name about an hour north-east of Toronto\u00a0that were purchased for more than a million dollars each. \u00a0\nFor the moment, Chan, Gallagher and the other tenants of 410 Queen West aren't going anywhere.\nThe eviction for personal use was dismissed in late December by the LTB because of an amendment that was made to the Residential Tenancies Act in 2017. Since that change was made, rental units owned by a corporation can't evict tenants for personal use.\u00a0\nEarlier this month,\u00a0Kanagathurai offered each unit at 410 Queen West $20,000 to move out, but the tenants rejected that offer, and now the landlord is appealing the LTB decision to Divisional Court.\u00a0\nIn the last four years there's been an 84 per cent increase in private landlords seeking evictions to reclaim a property for their own personal use, and a 294 per cent jump in applications for so-called \"renovictions\" in Toronto, according to an affordable rental housing report released last fall.\u00a0\nThat's part of the reason these eviction attempts don't surprise Parkdale legal worker, Cole Webber.\u00a0\n\"There is a big financial incentive for landlords to get rid of longtime tenants,\" Webber told CBC Toronto. \"Part of the problem is that of course there's insufficient enforcement of the rules.\"\u00a0\nAs a result, Webber says the onus is on tenants to be proactive and put pressure on their landlords themselves.\u00a0\n\"There's a lot of money to be made in real estate in Toronto \u2014\u00a0that's really what it comes down to,\" he said.\nGoldfeder understands that for her landlord\u00a0this is business, but she's still looking for accountability when she heads back to the LTB in March.\u00a0\n\"I think this is disgusting behaviour from human to human,\" Goldfeder said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "How produce stickers contribute to climate change", "description": "Also: The biggest players in battery storage", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-fruit-stickers-climate-change-1.5462794", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4865457.1540993844!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/what-on-earth-logo.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 14, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-02-14T19:02:58.599Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Hello, people!\u00a0This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world.\u00a0(Sign up here\u00a0to get it in your inbox every\u00a0Thursday.)\nThis week:\nAbout three years ago, Susan Antler was at a composting facility in B.C. when a truck full of rotting avocados pulled up.\nIt was \"51 feet, 52 feet [approx. 14 metres] \u2014 like, [a] massive truckload,\" said Antler, executive director of the Compost Council of Canada. \"And the facility just wouldn't accept it.\"\nWhy? Because each of those thousands of rotting avocados was \"contaminated\" by a little plastic PLU (or price\u00a0look up) sticker. It carries a number, standardized around the globe, that identifies the type of produce and whether it's conventionally or organically grown, to help cashiers enter the right price at the supermarket checkout.\nJane Proctor, vice-president of policy and issue management at the Canadian Produce Marketing Association, said while the stickers are voluntary, most chain supermarkets require them. \"It is not a regulatory requirement,\" she said. \"It's a business requirement.\"\nThe stickers are too small to be screened out in the waste sorting process, but don't break down during composting. Antler said they end up sprinkled as \"foreign matter\" through the finished product \u2014 compost that's destined to be used to enrich soils in places such as gardens, farmland and parks.\u00a0\nThe stickers aren't toxic and don't harm the compost \u2014 although presumably they add microplastics to the environment \u2014 so it's mostly a cosmetic issue, Antler acknowledged. But there are strict guidelines about how much foreign matter is allowed in compost, especially higher grades. And too much can make compost unmarketable.\nMindful of the old adage \"garbage in, garbage out,\" composting plants that want to produce and sell higher grades of compost need to be careful about what raw materials they take.\nIn the case of the B.C. facility, Antler offered to remove the stickers from the avocados, but the composting plant manager declined. \"He just sent the truck away, so that material went to landfill.\" She's pretty sure it happens all the time. \"The scale of waste is massive.\"\nIt's not just a waste \u2014 it could also speed up climate change.\u00a0\nAt a compost plant, organic matter typically decomposes in the presence of oxygen, generating CO2 and compost that can nourish plants. At a landfill, it decomposes without oxygen into methane, a greenhouse gas that has about 30 times the global warming impact of CO2 over a century. (Some organics plants use anaerobic digestion, which also generates methane, but it is captured and burned so it doesn't go into the atmosphere.)\nBut there are solutions, including other ways to affix the PLU to bulk fruits and veggies, such as:\nPaper stickers or certified compostable plastic stickers, which have been successfully tested in the U.S.\nInk stamps like the ones used to label eggs.\n\"Branding\" with lasers.\nProctor said produce sellers often don't see the extra investment as worthwhile when many customers don't have access to municipal composting. She added that the recent introduction of scannable barcodes on PLU stickers \u2014 which Canadian stores are expected to adopt soon \u2014 requires the labels to show fine detail and maintain durability, which only plastic enables.\nIn the meantime, you can help by making sure you take the little stickers off your fruit and veggie peels and rinds before tossing them in your green bin at home.\n\u2014 Emily Chung\nEmily Chung's piece on wood buildings last week garnered a lot of feedback from readers, some of whom were concerned about the safety of the material itself. \"I have reservations regarding wooden highrise buildings,\" said Bob Miller. \"These include: Wood burns. Wood is not recyclable. Wood is subject to rot.\"\nThis article from last year highlights the concerns of some fire chiefs and also includes a comment from a senior researcher at Natural Resources Canada.\nOther readers were concerned about where all the wood would come from.\n\"Are you seriously promoting the denuding of our planet's trees as a green solution! Methinks this is seriously flawed logic,\" wrote Simon Faunt.\n\"We already cut and clear-cut, unfortunately, too many forests,\" said Joan Thompson. \"Can and will we replant enough trees to maintain the natural wildlife spaces, clean our air and prevent soil erosion... I'm not sure. We build and we build and we build. There are no restrictions. We need to consider each option carefully \u2014 pros and cons.\"\nLast week in this space, we discussed the stock market slide for a number of the best-known oil and gas companies. This week, we're highlighting some of the biggest players in lithium-ion battery storage, which will be a key industry in the global transition away from fossil fuels. All of these companies supply car manufacturers (as well as electric utilities). In addition to upstart Tesla, there are a couple of Chinese newcomers \u2014 Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and BYD \u2014 as well as more established names like South Korea's LG Chem and Japan's Panasonic. The chart below reflects 2018 figures for each company's total storage capacity.\nOil companies are having a rough spell, and so are countries dependent on the profits from extracting oil. According to a report by the International Monetary Fund, as fossil fuel demand decreases, the wealth of Gulf oil producers like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates could dry up in 15 years. \nBrad McLaughlin says it should be easy for a northern country like Canada to build the kind of home that is so efficient it makes more energy than it uses.\nBut McLaughlin, the general manager of MCL Construction Ltd. in Quispamsis, N.B., is beginning to wonder if reducing residential greenhouse gases is really a priority in this country.\nHis certified net-zero home has maxed out energy efficiency. The house has insulated concrete walls, triple glazed windows, 44 solar panels and a backup rechargeable battery system.\nOn a sub-zero February afternoon, it's sending excess electricity back to the provincial grid in exchange for NB Power credits to be used on the coldest days, or at night when the sun is down.\nBut the three-bedroom, two-bath home stubbornly refuses to sell. It has been on and off the real estate market since 2017.\n\"It hasn't moved,\" McLaughlin said. \"We had a lot of people through it.\"\u00a0\nStarting out, McLaughlin's asking price was $695,000. By May 2019, he had lowered it to $570,000. This week, he put the two-storey house back on the market at $495,000.\nMcLaughlin points to mortgage \"stress tests\" and indifference from bank-hired appraisers as obstacles pushing buyers away from these higher-than-average priced homes. McLaughlin feels the federal government could do more to kick-start construction of these kinds of homes.\nHis first suggestion would be to revamp the mortgage stress test introduced to cool red-hot housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto. McLaughlin said the test lacks flexibility and is locking people out of the net-zero-carbon housing market by denying them mortgages for homes with higher purchase prices, without allowing for the fact the buyer won't have any heating and electricity costs.\nHe said appraisers are at a loss when it comes to a sustainable house like this.\n\"Around here, they just don't know how to value it.\u2026They just say, 'Well, there's a similar house down the street,'\" he said. \"Well, sure it might look the same, but it's a lot different.\"\nMcLaughlin isn't alone in his thinking. The Canadian Home Builders Association and the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) are also calling for changes to the system. CREA national president Jason Stephen, who is a Saint John realtor, said the stress test should be adjusted to suit regional markets across the country.\n\"If this was a system that was brought in to address escalating housing prices, month over month, or year over year, we just don't have that, which is why we always say there's not one housing market [across] the whole country,\" Stephen said.\nDuring the 2019 election campaign, the federal Liberals promised to introduce a $5,000 grant to buyers of net-zero homes and to offer interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to homeowners and landlords for energy saving retrofits. The program has yet to be introduced.\nOther efficiency programs are already available to builders and buyers in New Brunswick.

Because each of those thousands of rotting avocados was \"contaminated\" by a little plastic PLU (or price\u00a0look up) sticker. It carries a number, standardized around the globe, that identifies the type of produce and whether it's conventionally or organically grown, to help cashiers enter the right price at the supermarket checkout.\nJane Proctor, vice-president of policy and issue management at the Canadian Produce Marketing Association, said while the stickers are voluntary, most chain supermarkets require them. \"It is not a regulatory requirement,\" she said. \"It's a business requirement.\"\nThe stickers are too small to be screened out in the waste sorting process, but don't break down during composting. Antler said they end up sprinkled as \"foreign matter\" through the finished product \u2014 compost that's destined to be used to enrich soils in places such as gardens, farmland and parks.\u00a0\nThe stickers aren't toxic and don't harm the compost \u2014 although presumably they add microplastics to the environment \u2014 so it's mostly a cosmetic issue, Antler acknowledged. But there are strict guidelines about how much foreign matter is allowed in compost, especially higher grades. And too much can make compost unmarketable.\nMindful of the old adage \"garbage in, garbage out,\" composting plants that want to produce and sell higher grades of compost need to be careful about what raw materials they take.\nIn the case of the B.C. facility, Antler offered to remove the stickers from the avocados, but the composting plant manager declined. \"He just sent the truck away, so that material went to landfill.\" She's pretty sure it happens all the time. \"The scale of waste is massive.\"\nIt's not just a waste \u2014 it could also speed up climate change.\u00a0\nAt a compost plant, organic matter typically decomposes in the presence of oxygen, generating CO2 and compost that can nourish plants. At a landfill, it decomposes without oxygen into methane, a greenhouse gas that has about 30 times the global warming impact of CO2 over a century. (Some organics plants use anaerobic digestion, which also generates methane, but it is captured and burned so it doesn't go into the atmosphere.)\nBut there are solutions, including other ways to affix the PLU to bulk fruits and veggies, such as:\nPaper stickers or certified compostable plastic stickers, which have been successfully tested in the U.S.\nInk stamps like the ones used to label eggs.\n\"Branding\" with lasers.\nProctor said produce sellers often don't see the extra investment as worthwhile when many customers don't have access to municipal composting. She added that the recent introduction of scannable barcodes on PLU stickers \u2014 which Canadian stores are expected to adopt soon \u2014 requires the labels to show fine detail and maintain durability, which only plastic enables.\nIn the meantime, you can help by making sure you take the little stickers off your fruit and veggie peels and rinds before tossing them in your green bin at home.\n\u2014 Emily Chung\nEmily Chung's piece on wood buildings last week garnered a lot of feedback from readers, some of whom were concerned about the safety of the material itself. \"I have reservations regarding wooden highrise buildings,\" said Bob Miller. \"These include: Wood burns. Wood is not recyclable. Wood is subject to rot.\"\nThis article from last year highlights the concerns of some fire chiefs and also includes a comment from a senior researcher at Natural Resources Canada.\nOther readers were concerned about where all the wood would come from.\n\"Are you seriously promoting the denuding of our planet's trees as a green solution! Methinks this is seriously flawed logic,\" wrote Simon Faunt.\n\"We already cut and clear-cut, unfortunately, too many forests,\" said Joan Thompson. \"Can and will we replant enough trees to maintain the natural wildlife spaces, clean our air and prevent soil erosion... I'm not sure. We build and we build and we build. There are no restrictions. We need to consider each option carefully \u2014 pros and cons.\"\nLast week in this space, we discussed the stock market slide for a number of the best-known oil and gas companies. This week, we're highlighting some of the biggest players in lithium-ion battery storage, which will be a key industry in the global transition away from fossil fuels. All of these companies supply car manufacturers (as well as electric utilities). In addition to upstart Tesla, there are a couple of Chinese newcomers \u2014 Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and BYD \u2014 as well as more established names like South Korea's LG Chem and Japan's Panasonic. The chart below reflects 2018 figures for each company's total storage capacity.\nOil companies are having a rough spell, and so are countries dependent on the profits from extracting oil. According to a report by the International Monetary Fund, as fossil fuel demand decreases, the wealth of Gulf oil producers like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates could dry up in 15 years. \nBrad McLaughlin says it should be easy for a northern country like Canada to build the kind of home that is so efficient it makes more energy than it uses.\nBut McLaughlin, the general manager of MCL Construction Ltd. in Quispamsis, N.B., is beginning to wonder if reducing residential greenhouse gases is really a priority in this country.\nHis certified net-zero home has maxed out energy efficiency. The house has insulated concrete walls, triple glazed windows, 44 solar panels and a backup rechargeable battery system.\nOn a sub-zero February afternoon, it's sending excess electricity back to the provincial grid in exchange for NB Power credits to be used on the coldest days, or at night when the sun is down.\nBut the three-bedroom, two-bath home stubbornly refuses to sell. It has been on and off the real estate market since 2017.\n\"It hasn't moved,\" McLaughlin said. \"We had a lot of people through it.\"\u00a0\nStarting out, McLaughlin's asking price was $695,000. By May 2019, he had lowered it to $570,000. This week, he put the two-storey house back on the market at $495,000.\nMcLaughlin points to mortgage \"stress tests\" and indifference from bank-hired appraisers as obstacles pushing buyers away from these higher-than-average priced homes. McLaughlin feels the federal government could do more to kick-start construction of these kinds of homes.\nHis first suggestion would be to revamp the mortgage stress test introduced to cool red-hot housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto. McLaughlin said the test lacks flexibility and is locking people out of the net-zero-carbon housing market by denying them mortgages for homes with higher purchase prices, without allowing for the fact the buyer won't have any heating and electricity costs.\nHe said appraisers are at a loss when it comes to a sustainable house like this.\n\"Around here, they just don't know how to value it.\u2026They just say, 'Well, there's a similar house down the street,'\" he said. \"Well, sure it might look the same, but it's a lot different.\"\nMcLaughlin isn't alone in his thinking. The Canadian Home Builders Association and the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) are also calling for changes to the system. CREA national president Jason Stephen, who is a Saint John realtor, said the stress test should be adjusted to suit regional markets across the country.\n\"If this was a system that was brought in to address escalating housing prices, month over month, or year over year, we just don't have that, which is why we always say there's not one housing market [across] the whole country,\" Stephen said.\nDuring the 2019 election campaign, the federal Liberals promised to introduce a $5,000 grant to buyers of net-zero homes and to offer interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to homeowners and landlords for energy saving retrofits. The program has yet to be introduced.\nOther efficiency programs are already available to builders and buyers in New Brunswick. NB Power offers as much as $10,000 in incentives for construction of energy-efficient homes, and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation has a 15 to 25 per cent discount on mortgage insurance costs, depending on the level of efficiency of the home.\u00a0\n\u2014 Connell Smith\nAre there issues you'd like us to cover?

She wanted the financial security that comes with home ownership\u00a0and a deeper sense of community.\nAlong with two friends, the adjunct teacher at Ryerson University and Humber College helped design and build an eco-friendly, co-living home on Meadow Wood Road.\n\"We were three single women and we decided not to wait for a prince on a white horse. And we wanted to get into the market, to have equity,\" she told CBC Radio's\u00a0Metro\u00a0Morning\u00a0on Friday.\nThe straw-bale house has what are known as European biowalls: no moisture barrier inside the first-floor walls allow fresh air to cycle through the residence. There are photovoltaic cells on the roof to convert sunlight into energy, a battery bank in the basement and a diverse garden surrounds the property.\nThe home also has a shared kitchen, living space\u00a0and\u00a0three suites for each co-owner offer a good deal of privacy whenever its desired.\nThe experience turned Bradbee into a co-housing evangelist.\u00a0\n\"Whether your live with family or roommates, generally you don't want to be alone. I know I don't want to be alone all the time. So it provides that kind of shared space,\" she said.\nHer house has become a kind of Mississauga landmark. And as people desperately look for creative ways to break into the current housing market, co-housing is quickly emerging as a viable option.\nThis week, the provincial government released a set of guidelines to help prospective buyers navigate the complicated process of financing a property and living under the same roof as other\u00a0unrelated owners.\nLesli Gaynor\u00a0helped consult on the new guidelines. She's an\u00a0agent with Forest Hill Downtown Real Estate and owner of GoCo\u00a0Solutions, a company dedicated to helping people get into co-owned homes in the GTA.\nGaynor says she's approached about two times a week by those interested in discussing co-ownership.\u00a0\n\"As prices rise and it becomes more and more difficult to stay in your neighbourhoods, co-ownership will become more and more prevalent,\" she said.\n\"It's no surprise. People are shut out of this market. So it's one way to at least give them a hope that they might be able to get into the market by combining resources.\"\nGaynor serves a diverse client base, including young families hoping to reduce expenses by sharing child care and seniors looking to stave off loneliness and take care of one another.\nShe believes that co-ownership will \"explode\" in popularity once Canadian financial institutions come to see the value of lending to would-be buyers trying to own a piece of a property.\nThe province's new guidelines are a \"good start\" she says, but other incentives would help. Zoning, assistance with the cost of retrofitting single-family homes into spaces for co-owners and credits for sustainable living are all good ideas, Gaynor says.\nThere are also legal challenges.\n\"The biggest challenge is the exit plans. Getting in is not as difficult as getting out,\" she said.\nBradbee\u00a0and her friends established a legal contract and stuck to a strict policy of \"consensus decision making.\"\nShe recently bought out her friends and is selling her formerly co-owned space. It's listed for more than $2.5-million.\nBut Bradbee won't sell to just anybody.\n\"I want someone who is going to love it and carry on the legacy.\"\nAs for those would-be buyers hesitant about the

And there just aren't the same number of affordable housing units that there were even, say, three years ago.\"\nThe shortage of affordable housing is so bad that housing support workers at the organization are advising people not to leave their apartments unless there is a safety risk.\nAnother factor is what Devlin calls \"renovictions.\"\nShe said there's a trend in Halifax of companies buying apartment buildings that have relatively affordable rents, evicting tenants in order to do renovations and then increasing the rent when the renovations are complete \u2014 effectively removing affordable units from the housing stock.\nCurrent rental prices at 25 Vimy Ave. range from $535 to $695, depending on the size of the units, said Barrett.\u00a0Once the renovations are done, he hopes to charge $700 to $800 for one-bedroom apartments and $900 to $1,000 for two-bedroom units \u2014 a rate he calls affordable.\n\"Of course rent is going to have to go up to justify the money that's being spent,\" he said. \"We're going to go in, we're going to clean it up, it's going to be a benefit to the neighborhood.\"\nBarrett said the building is \"not really fit for humans to live in\" right now.\n\"People can't live with bedbugs and cockroaches and prostitution and drug dealing going on. It's not safe and it's not a good thing.\"\nBarrett said the building also has issues with rats, mould and water infiltration. BlackBay plans to put a new roof, windows and siding on the building, fix electrical problems and install a new kitchen and bathroom in every unit.\nHe said BlackBay is not receiving any outside funding to make the changes.\nHousing Minister Chuck Porter said in a statement on Saturday that the province has taken steps to improve access to affordable housing, including through capital contributions to increase the number of units, allocating more\u00a0rent supplements\u00a0and grants and loans to low-income homeowners for essential repairs.\nThe NDP's housing critic, Lisa Roberts, said the provincial government has largely relied on rent supplement programs to\u00a0help people with low incomes afford housing.\n\"It's a poor use of public dollars because it's public dollars that transfer to the private sector and they never create us units,\" she said.\nRoberts said in addition to the loss of many long-term rental units to short-term rental businesses such as AirBNB, there have been few affordable housing units built in recent years.\n\"The province\u00a0either has to get serious about doing it or it has to get out of the way and let somebody else do it and fund them to do it,\" she said.\nProgressive Conservative municipal affairs critic Elizabeth Smith-McCrossin\u00a0said the public needs to understand the underlying issue behind affordable housing needs.\n\"Why are there so many people on low and fixed income?\" she said.\u00a0\"I think we need to be looking at the source of the problem and trying to look at ways to ensure people have more money so that they have greater access to things like their housing needs.\"\nSmith-McCrossin said there should be more collaboration between the private sector and all three levels of government to meet people's housing needs\nAs for the tenants, Barrett said the company has tried to assist them with the eviction by offering cash, helping with living arrangements and moving expenses, but few tenants have called his office to accept those offers.\nA notice from the company dated July 16 reminds tenants that power, heat and water in the building will be cut at the end of the day on Aug. 3, and police, bailiffs and the fire department will be on site to board up windows and remove any remaining occupants.\nZwicker hopes he'll be out before then. He has accepted an offer from a family member to stay in Lower Sackville.\nHe says if that wasn't an option, \"I wouldn't have any place to go. That's a bottom line \u2014 I wouldn't have a place to go.\"\nZwicker said some residents\u00a0still don't have a home lined up.\n\"They're just waiting for the day that the company comes and puts everybody out.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Co-living trend coming to Zibi development", "description": "Building by American company will feature common bathrooms, kitchens, lounges", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/zibi-co-living-ottawa-gatineau-1.5190469", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Jun 26, 2019 12:45 PM ET", "2019-06-28T13:42:27.765Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A growing American company focusing on the dorm-like \"co-living\" trend is planning an expansion into Canada with a highrise at the Zibi site on the Ottawa River.\nNew York City-based Common has set up co-living spaces\u00a0in six major American cities, with plans for seven more. The company is also eyeing Toronto.\nIts developments\u00a0usually feature small, private living quarters and shared bathrooms,\u00a0kitchens and lounges, with other common amenities such as gyms and pools.\nIn theory, the arrangement helps tenants lower their rent.\nThe Zibi building on the Ottawa side of the river would rise roughly 20\u00a0storeys and have 252 beds, and would include some private apartments. Construction could begin in 2020 and the first tenants could move in\u00a0as early as\u00a02022,\u00a0according to Common.\nThe precise mix of units will be figured out as floor plans are finalized over the next few months, a Common spokesperson said in an email.\nRent would start\u00a0at $1,225 a month for a co-living bedroom\u00a0and $2,065 a month for a traditional unit, Common said. That includes\u00a0WiFi, hydro, heat and water.\nIn a November 2018 report, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation put the average rent for a bachelor apartment in Ottawa at\u00a0$881, and a one-bedroom at\u00a0$1,088, but given Zibi's desirable location, rents there are generally expected to be higher.\nAn Ottawa architect who isn't involved with the project said the model is a good fit for people who want to live in shared spaces, as well as people who are looking for a short-term rental.\n\"They don't see a\u00a0need to pay a huge amount of rent for a lot of square footage they're not going to use, but they also don't want to live in a hotel or couch-surf,\" Toon Dreessen, president of Architects DCA, told CBC Radio's\u00a0Ottawa Morning.\n\"It's one thing to Airbnb, stay at a friend's house or\u00a0with family for a week or two, but you want a sense of permanence.\"\nSeniors looking for a mix of community and independence\u00a0have turned to this model in places such as Sooke, B.C., Dreessen said.\nThe first residents started moving into the $1.5-billion, 15-hectare\u00a0Zibi development in the fall. As many as 5,000 people are expected to call Zibi home by the time it's finished around 2030.\nThe developer says the project strives to be environmentally friendly and respectful\u00a0of\u00a0the sacred Algonquin land it's built on, but\u00a0some Indigenous groups and their supporters have protested Zibi\u00a0and challenged the development in court.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1563094595933", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Alex Migdal", "title": "A $4.8M chandelier under Vancouver's Granville Bridge draws divided response", "description": "Public art piece, paid for by developer, criticized for excess in a city grappling with a housing crisis", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/spinning-chandelier-granville-bridge-1.5379911", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5379983.1575164609!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/granville-chandelier.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 01, 2019 8:00 AM PT", "2019-12-01T20:09:31.746Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As Pierre Blais\u00a0crossed the noisy\u00a0construction site Wednesday on Vancouver's Beach Avenue, dodging the forklifts and street sweepers, he nearly didn't see the massive chandelier dangling above him.\nIt wasn't until he paused and a construction worker pointed above, twirling her finger in a circular motion, that he stumbled upon\u00a0the city's newest public art installation.\n\"It's gaudy,\" said Blais, a 51-year-old small business owner, gazing at the chandelier's 600 faux crystals. \"If that was the demographic they're aiming for, they nailed it.\"\nBlais, who has lived for five years in the neighbourhood, reflects the polarizing response to the installation since its grand unveiling this week.\nIn a city grappling with a housing and homelessness\u00a0crisis, the chandelier has ignited criticisms of Versailles-like grandeur and excess, fuelled by its eye-popping $4.8-million price tag.\nThe piece, titled Spinning Chandelier,\u00a0was designed by B.C. artist Rodney Graham, who based it on a\u00a02005 film installation of a whirling chandelier.\nThe fixture spans 7.7 metres in height and 4.2 metres in length and is made of stainless steel, LED lamps and polyurethane faux crystals.\nEvery so often, the chandelier descends from the north end of the Granville Bridge, spins for about\u00a0four minutes while flashing its lights, then retreats into the bridge's underbelly.\nCrews are taking the new Spinning Chandelier art installation for a spin before its unveiling tonight. <a href=\"https://t.co/2QykrsT1JX\">pic.twitter.com/2QykrsT1JX</a>\n\"The price tag is way too high for what it is,\" said Janice Rafael, a 58-year-old retired artist, who walks by the area daily.\u00a0\nRafael said she wishes part of that money had gone to adding artwork or amenities at May and Lorne Brown Park,\u00a0a small, busy\u00a0green space\u00a0a block away.\nThe installation\u00a0was commissioned and paid for by the luxury property developer Westbank as part of its Vancouver House project.\u00a0The site's centrepiece\u00a0is a twisting, Jenga-like highrise, just north\u00a0of the chandelier.\nIn a written statement, Westbank\u00a0said there will always be critics when it comes to spending on public art.\n\"There is a pervasive attitude in our city that we must choose between contributing to social infrastructure or making other contributions, whether artistic or cultural, that are seen as less functional,\" the developer\u00a0wrote.\n\"Westbank does not view this as an 'either or' situation.\"\nWestbank was required\u00a0to provide a public art piece for Vancouver House under the city's bylaws.\nIt first pegged the cost at $1.2 million in its 2015 proposal to city council, but that\u00a0number ballooned\u00a0to $4.8 million as the project's complexity came to light.\nThe city allowed Westbank to pool funds from three other\u00a0developments\u00a0to create one larger installation. Westbank covered the entire cost of the chandelier and is\u00a0on the hook for any maintenance.\u00a0\nAs part of the city's\u00a0rezoning conditions, Westbank\u00a0will contribute 106 new rental homes and more than $21 million in\u00a0levies to the city.\nUnits in the Vancouver House, however,\u00a0cater to the wealthy: A three-bedroom unit is listed at $6.9 million, while a two-bedroom penthouse is up for nearly $9 million.\nThe development has\u00a0drawn\u00a0a flurry of activity to\u00a0a historically industrial area, where the homeless have often sought refuge\u00a0under the bridge.\nEric Fredericksen, head of public art for the City of Vancouver, said\u00a0the chandelier will bring more people to the\u00a0\"rough and functional\" space. But he's\u00a0mindful of the criticism.\n\"For the artist, I think he was thinking more abstractly about the sculpture and the light possibilities in the chandelier. I'm not sure how much the social implications are in there,\" Fredericksen\u00a0said.\n\"But they are there now and I think they'll be part of the reading of the piece, which is a spectacular object. I'm curious as to how that conversation will play out over time.\"\nFor some, the chandelier is best viewed as a feat of design. Desmond Williams, a 59-year-old engineer, scrutinized the chandelier as crews tested out the chandelier.\n\"I don't know if it's the best public art that I would see for this area. I haven't decided,\" Williams said.\nJust then, the chandelier began to spin, its crystals flaring out like\u00a0wings.

When she looked her a hotel-room-sized unit, all she could think was: \"This can't be me.

And then here I am like the master of my own castle.\"\nAndresen said she found it particularly hard to accept because her partner Michelle Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, 30,\u00a0is a former foster child, who wouldn't\u00a0have the same opportunity.\u00a0\nHer partner has joked she has \"co-opted\" Andresen's family, and gets the benefits from being a part of it.\u00a0\n\"She enjoys that, but [the apartment] is definitely a privilege,\" said Andresen of her family's gift. \"It is unearned, undeserved, pretty much unfair.\"\nAndresen had never expected to own a home, even the small condo where she is living.\u00a0Prior to heading to Australia to finish her bachelor's degree, she said she had accepted the idea of renting for the rest of her life.\u00a0\nHer family used to live in Metro Vancouver, where housing prices have skyrocketed in the last decade \u2014 though there have been recent signs of a decline.\u00a0\nHer mother and grandparents decided to sell their homes in the midst of the boom to move to Vancouver Island. But there was enough extra to give Niki and her brother money for their down payment.\u00a0\nAndresen was still in Australia when the sale happened, and was surprised to hear her mother offering to buy her an apartment in a new city.\u00a0\nShe said initially, she didn't take the idea of owning a home too seriously. She was heading into an unpaid internship, and had to drop a paying job to take it. She said she was having trouble affording food.\nWhen her mother suggested that she'd accrue some rent money if she had an apartment, Andresen took the chance.\n\"It was a feeling of just sort of confusion and then like an acceptance because how can you turn down a gift that amazing?\" said Andresen.\u00a0\n\"Especially when I know who it's coming from and how much it matters to my family that I have a place to stay and housing security.\"\nAndresen said she's especially thankful, considering the rental vacancy rate in Victoria is just 1.2 per cent.\u00a0\nGiven the tight market, she said she's resolved to share how she purchased that apartment with anyone who asks.\u00a0\n\"I think it's important to talk about where the money comes from in the sense that it highlights who is able to access housing right now,\" said Andresen.\u00a0\nThis view is shared by Harper's Bazaar online contributor Jen Doll, who wrote about how the idea of self-made success is often a myth.\u00a0\nPeople like to believe that if you're good enough, you can start a business, buy a home, and live a great life.\u00a0\n\"What does it mean to be good enough? Generally it means that you probably have been privileged in some way or another,\" said Doll. \u00a0\n\"And if you're not that's the other thing, the other side of this. If you are really able to pretty much come from nothing and make yourself something \u2014 that deserves so much more acclaim.\"\nIn 2011, Doll faced a similar conundrum as Andresen. Her parents offered her proposition: they could give her the money for 10 per cent of a down payment in New York City now, or after they died.\u00a0\nShe took the money, bought the apartment and until recently kept quiet about how she was able to afford it. Now, she is trying to share how the story when she can, but said that finding the ideal setting for this conversation can be hard.\n\"What I pull people aside in the break room and tell them, 'Hey, guess what?'\" said Doll, imagining how she could broach the subject with colleagues. \"We don't walk around with debt and assets on our faces.\"\nMeanwhile, Andresen has been considering new ways to conceive of success, that don't favour people who have rich parents. One idea, she suggested, would be to stop viewing wealth as a measure of success altogether. In that case, big purchases, like buying a home, would no longer be seen as markers of an individual's accomplishments.\u00a0\nShe pointed to a quote by the former mayor of Bogota, Gustavo Petro: \"A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It's where the rich use public transportation.\"\nIn Canada, Andresen said, Petro's ideal is reversed.\u00a0\nAndresen said society, generally, would benefit if we shift our priorities away from material wealth and consumption.

The fire department issued a hazard compliance order related to both buildings on May 13.\u00a0\nA city official\u00a0said the fire inspector has been working with the property owner to bring the buildings into compliance.\u00a0The buildings\u00a0are\u00a0listed for sale on several real estate websites.\u00a0\nBober said he doesn't blame the fire department, but he also said the city's enforcement of the rules\u00a0is making a bad situation\u00a0worse.\u00a0\n\"I think that all of our city and provincial policies need to work hand-in-hand to protect \u2026 the currently existing rental stock,\" said Bober.\nBober has appealed his eviction to the Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission and is awaiting a hearing scheduled for July 26. He\u00a0said he plans to ask the commission for more time for the tenants to find another place to live.\u00a0\n\"This is an instance where actually the application of city policies is ... basically causing people to be rent-evicted,\" he said.\n\"Not through landlords rent-evicting, but through cities pushing landlords to rent-evict.\"\nCBC\u00a0News reached out to the owners of the buildings but did not receive a response.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Alex Migdal", "title": "How LGBT renters in Vancouver are finding safe living spaces", "description": "They're not only contending with the city's pricey rental market, but also the worry of discrimination", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lgbt-renters-vancouver-1.5217493", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5217517.1563579029!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/lgbt-housing-west-end.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 20, 2019 6:00 AM PT", "2019-07-20T13:00:00.762Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Pablo Mu\u00f1oz, a 29-year-old designer, was hunting in 2011 for a one-bedroom apartment in Vancouver. Like\u00a0most renters, he brought along the person he'd be living with \u2014\u00a0his boyfriend.\nThey viewed about ten places, and among them, a few of the landlords were startlingly direct: Were the two a couple?\u00a0Mu\u00f1oz was caught off guard at first, unsure of how to respond. But each time he fielded the question, he answered truthfully.\n\"I found that having to be explicit about that was not fair,\" Mu\u00f1oz said. And the question spurred doubt whenever his applications went unanswered. \"I always wondered, 'Is this straight couple getting this apartment that I'm not?' \"\u00a0\nMu\u00f1oz's experience reflects the struggles that LGBT people face when searching for rental housing in Metro Vancouver. They're not only contending with\u00a0the region's sky-high rental prices and near-zero vacancy rates. There's an added worry: whether their sexual orientation or gender identity will hinder their search, and finding spaces where they can feel safe.\n\"At least daily, we have someone either calling or coming into the space, saying, 'Can you help me find a place to live?'\" said Heather Wong-Mitchell, management of finance and administration at Qmunity, an LGBT\u00a0centre in Vancouver's West End neighbourhood.\nStudies suggest LGBT renters' concerns are warranted. A U.S. government housing study in 2013 showed that same-sex couples received fewer responses to email inquiries about rental units than straight couples. A 2016 study found that LGBT people filed housing discrimination complaints as often as women and people of colour, highlighting a need for stronger protections in some states.\nIn B.C., tenants are protected under the province's human rights code, which stipulates that landlords can't refuse to rent to a tenant because of their sexual orientation. If\u00a0renters do encounter discrimination, they can take their case to the B.C.\u00a0Human Rights Tribunal.\nBut LGBT renters say that prejudice\u00a0can appear more subtly, making it harder to pinpoint\u00a0and challenge.\n\"That's the thing about discrimination,\" Mu\u00f1oz said, referring to his unanswered rental applications. \"You never know if that was an actual factor.\"\nIn 2015, Mu\u00f1oz, who now lives in Toronto, decided to circumvent the rental system. He co-launched Homes for Queers, a Facebook group that connects LGBT renters in Vancouver.\nMembers\u00a0apply before gaining page access and must agree to be respectful. The listings are more personal than typical Craigslist ads: renters often note their gender identities, sexual orientations and preferred pronouns.\u00a0\nToday, the\u00a0community boasts about 3,800 members; similar groups have popped up in cities like\u00a0Victoria, B.C., Seattle, Wash.,\u00a0and Portland, Ore.\u00a0Wong-Mitchell, with the Qmunity centre, said the Vancouver page is\u00a0one of the first resources she highlights when approached by prospective renters.\n\"Folks are able to find housing where\u00a0they can be a little bit more confident around their safety and security,\" she said.\nUnease from LGBT renters might seem at odds in Vancouver,\u00a0home of Davie Village, the well-established LGBT enclave in the West End. But the area's desirability\u00a0has\u00a0priced out many people. The average cost of a one-bedroom in the West End is $1,983, and $3,200 for a two-bedroom, according to PadMapper, a rental listings site.\nThose numbers mean LGBT renters must contend with having fewer dollars in the city, or move to the suburbs, where queer communities are smaller and the resources are more sparse.\nChris, a 34-year-old sales associate who identifies as trans, says he's never lived in central Vancouver, out of financial necessity. (He asked not to disclose his last name because he isn't fully out at work). In 2018, he moved from Vancouver to Port Moody, B.C., for the cheaper housing.\n\"It would be great if I could afford the West End or any places where there's a queer community,\" he said. \"But I don't think it's ever seriously crossed my mind. It's not in my budget.\"\nBut his current living situation, he said, is the best he's had in his five years in B.C.: a six-bedroom, two-bathroom house, which he shares with five roommates.\nThey live communally, which means they share all the household expenses and\u00a0hold meetings every second week. It's a housing model that's popular in the LGBT community, as roommates usually screen each other to ensure their values align.\n\"It doesn't mean that you hang out 24-7,\" Chris said. \"It means that you have the support of a community when you need it and you're also able to give that support. That's something that's very important to me.\"\u00a0\nLaws in B.C. protect tenants from discriminatory landlords, but not roommates in shared accommodation. Robert Patterson, a legal advocate with B.C.'s Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre, said the exception is meant to allow someone to choose a roommate of a certain gender, for instance, or someone from their country of origin.\nBut it also means that a roommate could deny someone over their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\"It's a glaring lack of protection for LGBT people,\" Patterson said.\nThe centre doesn't collect data on LGBT discrimination.\u00a0But the last housing case, based on sexual orientation, to go before the B.C.\u00a0Human Rights Tribunal\u00a0was in 2010.\nA judge ruled in favour\u00a0of the complainants, a gay man and a two-spirited man, who claimed their landlord in West Vancouver\u00a0had used homophobic remarks, forced into his way into their home and physically assaulted one of them. The two men were awarded $15,000.\nMost cases, however, aren't as extreme and don't end up in a tribunal. An LGBT\u00a0renter's strife can simply stem from not feeling comfortable in their own home.\nJustin Lawrence, 31, moved to\u00a0Vancouver in the spring to start working at the international airport. He said he never felt at ease in his previous home in Calgary, which he shared with three roommates. Lawrence was the only gay man.\u00a0\nThere was no overt discrimination, he said, but his roommates' body energy and attitude suggested discomfort.\n\"I know there's still people out there who still don't like our community,\" he said. \"Now, when I go into an interview for a house, one of the things I look at is whether I can connect with a person.\"\nThat's ultimately what he found. In April, Lawrence posted on ad on the Homes for Queers Facebook page and, a month later, moved into a three-storey house in New Westminster\u00a0with three roommates. One of them, Kira, a transgender woman, has become one of his closest friends, he said.\n\"It's been easy. She looks out for me and checks up on me,\" he said.\u00a0\"It's the first time in three-and-a-half years I've been on my own that I can actually call a place home.\"\nAre you an LGBT renter with a housing story to share?

But once the effects of the\u00a0pandemic begin to wane, there are fears in some quarters that the massive government spending could lead to inflation. That would mean\u00a0a confusing and uncertain outcome.\nAfter more than a decade in which official measures of rising prices showed inflation close to zero, a return to rising prices, and the rising interest rates that central banks have traditionally used to contain them, could well upend the way we think about money and investment.\nNot only are\u00a0central banks lowering rates and buying up bonds in the hope\u00a0bond holders\u00a0do something else with the money,\u00a0governments around the world are spending trillions of dollars they don't have to keep households and businesses solvent.\n\"Let's just call this simply what's going on. We're printing a lot of money to provide liquidity in the system,\" former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge told David Parkinson at the Report on Business last week.\nWhile Dodge agreed that the Bank of Canada's plan to pour money into the economy with quantitative easing\u00a0(QE) was the right thing to do, he said there will be consequences.\nQE\u00a0may be hard for most people to grasp intuitively, although some of us will be familiar with the term from when the U.S. and Europe flooded markets with cash to prevent the 2008 credit crunch from spiralling into something worse.\nIn an era when almost all money consists of digits in computers, when the Bank of Canada's Stephen Poloz began QE last Wednesday, he wasn't actually \"printing\" $100 bills. What the bank did was conjure a billion dollars into existence and used it to buy bonds on the market.\n\"It is the last best trick our governments have to save the good ship economy,\" economist Armine Yalnizyan once told Michael Enright on CBC Radio's Sunday Edition in an explanation of QE that stands the test of time.\nBut, of course, the Bank of Canada is not the only source of cash flooding into the Canadian and world economy.\nGovernments around the world are\u00a0borrowing from the future and running up deficits at levels not seen since the Second World War as they hand\u00a0out emergency aid to businesses and ordinary people.\nIn the short term, with so many people out of work and whole industries in contraction, inflation is the least of our worries.\nOne of the reasons for all that government spending is to prevent the exact opposite of inflation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a spiral of deflation. Aggregate prices could fall because of the crash in demand as people stop buying, not just gas and plane rides and cars and houses, but the industrial inputs that go into their creation.\nMost economists worry that\u00a0deflation is much worse for an economy than inflation because, rather than spending their money, consumers can benefit by holding off until prices are lower, leading to even lower demand.\nBut like everything else about this unprecedented pandemic and the unprecedented government reaction, it is not entirely certain what the longer term effects will be.\n\"Though it seems like deflationary end times to some right now, the COVID-19 scare is going to pass, and we will be left with monetary and fiscal bazookas having been fired,\" worries market analyst Gary Tanashian on the site Seeking Alpha.\nOnce a government has started pouring stimulus money into an economy, it is notoriously hard to start pulling it back out again, especially, as in the U.S. case, during a presidential election year. Similar forces will be at work in Canada where, because of the Liberal minority government, an election could happen at any time.\nTanashian suggests the inflation is already happening now, but is disguised by the temporary COVID-caused crash in demand. And once the lockdown begins to lift and everyone roars back to working and shopping and eating out, there will be too many dollars chasing too few goods and services. And that's the classic definition of inflation, which he sees showing itself by the end of 2020, and surging over the next two years.\nIf we do see a return to inflation,\u00a0it's hard to predict how it will play out. But central banks likely will start raising rates to keep it in hand.\nExisting bonds,\u00a0a great investment over the past decade as interest rates fell lower and lower, will no longer be good to hold. The value of assets such as housing will fall as borrowing costs rise. Outstanding consumer loans will become a bigger burden.\nEmployment incomes that rise with inflation will be a better source of money for the working young than cash piles held by the rich and old. Spending money now will be better than waiting, because the price of things you want will go nowhere but up. And a generation who's never seen it will have to figure out inflation all over again.\nFollow Don @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1610175043833", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Bridgette Watson", "title": "Vancouver mayor calls massive First Nation development a 'gift to the city'", "description": "Squamish Nation plans to build 11 housing towers on reserve land in the heart of the city", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-mayor-first-nation-development-gift-to-the-city-1.5351953", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5348935.1573184653!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/squamish-nation.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 07, 2019 7:54 PM PT", "2019-11-08T03:56:19.744Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart says he supports a local First Nation's plan to build a large-scale housing project in the centre of the city that is raising\u00a0concerns about the pressures it will place on city infrastructure and services.\nThe Squamish Nation is planning to construct 11 housing towers with 6,000 housing units on 11 acres of property\u00a0it owns at the south end of the Burrard Street Bridge.

And many young people are choosing to go the minimalist lifestyle with these smaller dwellings.\n\"As you see prices go up in the city and houses are becoming unattainable to certain groups of people as well, it's not just about affordable, it's about attainable as well \u2014 affordable to some people has a different definition,\" McIntosh said.\n\"Being able to have a home at the age of 20, or perhaps there are a lot of people who just don't want all the square footage, they do want to live a more simpler life and they do want a smaller home...\u00a0so I think there is a market here in Greater Sudbury for this sort of thing,\" she said.\nMcIntosh also says tiny houses could be a good solution to help with the city's\u00a0Housing and Homelessness Plan.\n\"The people who are living on the streets who need a place to sleep, there's the shelter and then we want to move from the shelter to another accommodation so you can move to a rental accommodation,\" she said.\u00a0\"Perhaps at some point you can move onto a smaller home toward home ownership yourself, so it's part of a continuum of providing homes.\"\nHouses are considered tiny when they are smaller than 400 square feet and while many of these houses come on wheels, they can also be built on a foundation, often for a fraction of the cost of a regular house.\nHowever, many municipalities in Ontario and across the country don't allow for tiny houses to be considered permanent homes. Municipalities have\u00a0bylaws about housing and what is considered a house, such as they\u00a0cannot be on wheels and that houses need to be a certain square footage.\u00a0\n\"The policies of the past few decades were focused on a bigger and more spread out footprint and we're starting to see a reversal in the trends and we need to create the tools necessary for developers to be able to build smaller homes in the shifting market that's happening,\" McCausland said.\u00a0\nIf the motion is passed, city staff will bring a report back to council in 2020. McCausland is hoping that it will\u00a0lead to more housing opportunities.\n\"It's one step in a process, so it'll allow staff to go and look at what's necessary to make smaller and tiny homes a reality in Greater Sudbury,\" he said. \"What I hope it leads to is developments that are more walkable, more focused on community and less focused on cars.\"\n"}, {"author": "Robin De Angelis", "title": "Tenants of Oxford St. apartments worry rent increase could leave some on streets", "description": "Owner CAPREIT says it needs to raise rent to cover cost of major renovations, repairs", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/oxford-street-apartment-complex-rent-increase-1.5196573", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5196581.1562020003!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/366-368-oxford-st-w.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 02, 2019 5:30 AM ET", "2019-07-02T09:30:00.114Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A group of tenants at an Oxford Street apartment complex is worried they won't be able to afford their homes if the company that owns the property hikes their rent.\nGeorge Reynolds has lived in the buildings at 366-368 Oxford St. W. for more than 25 years.\u00a0\nHe said there has never been an issue with rent, until the property was taken over by Canadian Apartment Properties Real Estate Investment Trust (CAPREIT).\n\"I have experienced moderate, reasonable increases in my adult life but never anything like this. This is just outrageous,\" Reynolds said.\nCAPREIT bought the property three and a half years ago and has since made major repairs and upgrades to the complex.\nReynolds and other residents are concerned they will have to shoulder the cost of the renovations, to the tune of hundreds of dollars over the next three years.\nIn Ontario, the provincial government sets guidelines for how much a landlord can raise the rent each year. The limit for 2019 is a 1.8 per cent increase, while the limit for 2020 has been set at 2.2 per cent.\nLandlords that want to increase the rent further to cover capital improvement costs can apply to the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) for an additional increase, with a maximum of 3 per cent on top of the provincial guideline for up to three years.\nThat means the residents at 366-368 Oxford St. W. could see an increase as big as 4.8 per cent in 2019 and 5.2 per cent in 2020.\nThey would also owe any additional rent since November 2018, which is the date of the first rent increase CAPREIT requested in its initial application to the LTB last July. According to the LTB, tenants do not have to pay the difference until an adjudicator makes a ruling on the landlord's application.\n\"I live on a pension,\" said Cindy Bailey, who has lived in the building for more than two years. \"It would affect me so much, that I don't even know if I could live here.\"\nReynolds echoed\u00a0those concerns, adding that finding another place to live would be next to impossible in London, where there is a lack of affordable housing.\n\"There's no place to go for renters in London. Rents are sky high all over the city, we have no choice and CAPREIT knows this,\" he said.\nTrish MacPherson, executive vice president of operations for CAPREIT, said the company knew extensive work needed to be done when it bought the property in January 2016.\n\"Major maintenance had not been done in many years,\" MacPherson stated in an email to CBC London.\n\"We have invested over $700,000 in new roofs, boilers, elevators, energy efficient lighting and paving since our purchase.\"\nCAPREIT applied to increase the rent above the provincial guidelines, she said, to cover the cost of these investments, which were needed \"to maintain the building safety and quality.\"\nBut the tenants argue the cost of the renovations would have been reflected in the price CAPREIT paid for the property, given the age and condition of the buildings.\nThe tenants also say that some of the work could have been done over a longer period of time, instead of all at once.\u00a0\n\"They buy older properties cheap, they know they have these extra expenses obviously because they're buying them cheap and they're old, but then they expect the tenants to pay for these expenses,\" Bailey said.\nBailey and Reynolds were among a group of tenants who appeared at a LTB hearing in London on Friday to plead their case.\nA written decision will be issued by an adjudicator, which will determine how much CAPREIT can increase the rent based on the negotiations during the hearing.\nReynolds said although the final increase may end up being less than anticipated, it will still have a negative impact on many tenants. He worries some people will end up homeless as a result.\n\"My position is that housing is a human right and a human need, and it shouldn't be commodified like this by very large powerful wealthy corporations like CAPREIT,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Sidney Cohen", "title": "'We are not in a crisis': New N.W.T. government delivers $1.9B budget", "description": "Fiscal situation is 'not what was hoped in the last budget but it is manageable,' says finance minister", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/19th-legislative-assembly-first-budget-1.5475739", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5475778.1583192022!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/caroline-wawzonek.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Feb 25, 2020 3:54 PM CT", "2020-02-28T21:31:31.452Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Northwest Territories government proposes to spend $1.9 billion on operational costs in the next fiscal year, but little new funding has been allocated in key areas said to be in crisis by several residents, advocates and front-line government workers.\nThe proposed budget includes no major spending increases in the Child and Family Services division or Education, and a decrease in spending on the NWT\u00a0Housing Corporation.\nAhead of her budget speech, Finance Minister Caroline Wawzonek told reporters the money that is being spent in these areas are amounts that departments need in order run existing programs. It's \"not reflective, necessarily\" of the government's 22 new mandate priorities, she said.\u00a0\nAccording to this budget, the government plans to spend $25 million on its mandate goals over the next three and a half years of this Legislative Assembly, $10 million of which it proposes spending in the upcoming fiscal year.\u00a0\n\"Anyone in government is going to sit here and say we'd always like to have more money,\" said Wawzonek, adding that it's what government does with the money it has that matters.\u00a0\n\"The Northwest Territories economy is stable, but it is not growing,\" Wawzonek said in her budget speech on Tuesday afternoon.\nWith that in mind, the government is proposing to spend $1.983 billion on operational costs in the 2020-21 fiscal year, up from the $1.87 billion it pitched to spend in the year prior. Meanwhile, it's projecting to make about $2.186 billion in revenues.\nThough the government expects to bring in about $203 million more than it will spend on delivering programs and services in the next fiscal year, this doesn't mean it's sitting on a pile of extra cash.\nThat operating surplus will be put toward the $398.6-million capital budget, which has already been approved by the assembly.\nThis leaves the government with a cash deficit of $195.6 million \u2014 money it will have to borrow, pushing the territory closer to its federally-imposed borrowing limit.\nThe government estimates its borrowing will reach nearly $1.2 billion in 2020-21. The debt cap is set at $1.3 billion.\u00a0\nFinance officials said on Tuesday that the government is in talks with the federal government about raising the borrowing limit, which last went up in 2015.\u00a0\n\"Our immediate fiscal situation is not what was hoped in the last budget but it is manageable,\" Wawzonek told the legislative assembly.\n\"We are not in a crisis.\"\nThere are no new taxes in the 2020-21\u00a0budget, but finance officials said property tax mill rates in the smaller communities that don't collect their own property taxes, and in \"the hinterland\" which includes the diamond mines, as well as some fees, will rise with inflation on April 1.\nThe vast majority of the government's revenues \u2014 82 per cent \u2014 is expected to come from the federal government. This includes a $1.4-billion territorial formula financing payment, which is meant to help the territorial government administer programs and services comparable to those in the provinces.\nAs was always the plan, the carbon tax will rise to $30 per carbon-equivalent tonne of greenhouse gas emissions on July 1, with plans to return a majority of that money through rebates\u00a0to residents and businesses.\nNotably, the government raised just $317,000 from the cannabis excise tax in 2019-20, less than half of what it initially projected. This coming year, it expects to bring in $331,000 from cannabis sales.\u00a0\nThe government also estimates it will get about $33 million in royalties and fees from mining and oil and gas operations. This is down about $6 million from 2019-20 estimates.\u00a0\nFinance officials said the decrease is due in part to market conditions, and to discrepancies in forecasting by the companies themselves.\u00a0\u00a0\nThose looking for major changes in the areas of education, child and family services or housing, won't find them in this budget.\nDespite public and internal outcry over a Child and Family Services division in which staff say they are overworked and under-resourced, the government proposes increasing the division's budget by just $280,000 from the year before.\nEarlier this month, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment was subject to a critical review of the Auditor General of Canada, in which it was called out for not providing all students in the territory equal access to quality education.\nIt's unclear whether any changes were made to this budget as a result, but the budget does propose $604,000 to bring the Northern Distance Learning program \u2014 in which students take courses that aren't offered in their own schools via video conferencing \u2014 to five more schools.\nThere is also $129,000 to expand \"northern studies curricula.\"\nTo the NWT\u00a0Housing Corporation, the government is planning to contribute about $2 million less than it did in the previous fiscal year. The corporation does plan to spend $2.2 million more on minor renovations to its housing stock.\nWhile education officials and others have lamented the slow pace of change in government, Wawzonek said she takes a different view.\n\"Sometimes I think acting too quickly is the reaction of government,\" she told reporters.\n\"The approach that we want to take is to actually stand up and take the criticism of not acting fast enough and instead take the time to make sure that we're using our money the best possible way.\"\nAfter a near-strike and renewed collective bargaining, the government will spend $39 million more on wages for unionized employees.\n$3.9 million for 72 long-term care beds in Yellowknife, which will be set up in the old Stanton Territorial Hospital building.\n$1.9\u00a0million for air tanker fleet operations to fight wildfires.\n$2.5\u00a0million for running the new Stanton Territorial Hospital, which includes money for orderlies, behavioural health workers, lab services and more.\n$268,000 to promote N.W.T. as a tourist destination.\n$1.6 million to support the RCMP.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "What it's like being 30 and going through the 3rd recession of your adult life", "description": "Millennials who coped with previous economic downturns share tips on surviving", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/millennials-recession-tips-covid-1.5531820", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5531477.1587392464!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-closed-sign-football-field-sports-guelph-kitchener-wate.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 14, 2020 12:07 PM MT", "2020-04-14T18:07:34.336Z"], "source": null, "content": "As Canada braces for a recession some experts are already comparing to the Great Depression, some millennials are taking a close look at their finances for the first time.\nHowever, the majority of this generation's members \u2014 born between 1980 and 1996 \u2014 have been through this before.

The limit for 2019 is a 1.8 per cent increase, while the limit for 2020 has been set at 2.2 per cent.\nLandlords that want to increase the rent further to cover capital improvement costs can apply to the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) for an additional increase, with a maximum of 3 per cent on top of the provincial guideline for up to three years.\nThat means the residents at 366-368 Oxford St. W. could see an increase as big as 4.8 per cent in 2019 and 5.2 per cent in 2020.\nThey would also owe any additional rent since November 2018, which is the date of the first rent increase CAPREIT requested in its initial application to the LTB last July. According to the LTB, tenants do not have to pay the difference until an adjudicator makes a ruling on the landlord's application.\n\"I live on a pension,\" said Cindy Bailey, who has lived in the building for more than two years. \"It would affect me so much, that I don't even know if I could live here.\"\nReynolds echoed\u00a0those concerns, adding that finding another place to live would be next to impossible in London, where there is a lack of affordable housing.\n\"There's no place to go for renters in London. Rents are sky high all over the city, we have no choice and CAPREIT knows this,\" he said.\nTrish MacPherson, executive vice president of operations for CAPREIT, said the company knew extensive work needed to be done when it bought the property in January 2016.\n\"Major maintenance had not been done in many years,\" MacPherson stated in an email to CBC London.\n\"We have invested over $700,000 in new roofs, boilers, elevators, energy efficient lighting and paving since our purchase.\"\nCAPREIT applied to increase the rent above the provincial guidelines, she said, to cover the cost of these investments, which were needed \"to maintain the building safety and quality.\"\nBut the tenants argue the cost of the renovations would have been reflected in the price CAPREIT paid for the property, given the age and condition of the buildings.\nThe tenants also say that some of the work could have been done over a longer period of time, instead of all at once.\u00a0\n\"They buy older properties cheap, they know they have these extra expenses obviously because they're buying them cheap and they're old, but then they expect the tenants to pay for these expenses,\" Bailey said.\nBailey and Reynolds were among a group of tenants who appeared at a LTB hearing in London on Friday to plead their case.\nA written decision will be issued by an adjudicator, which will determine how much CAPREIT can increase the rent based on the negotiations during the hearing.\nReynolds said although the final increase may end up being less than anticipated, it will still have a negative impact on many tenants. He worries some people will end up homeless as a result.\n\"My position is that housing is a human right and a human need, and it shouldn't be commodified like this by very large powerful wealthy corporations like CAPREIT,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2681718948", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Andrew Kurjata", "title": "You aren't allowed to live in your RV year round, regional district warns", "description": "'People are doing things like installing wood-burning stoves ... they're really moving in'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/rvs-trailers-illegal-living-1.5247484", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5247601.1565836030!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/no-rvs.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 14, 2019 7:33 PM PT", "2019-08-15T15:32:26.672Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "RVs are not houses\u00a0and old campers are not cabins.\nThat's the message from the Thompson-Nicola Regional District, which is cracking down on the use of recreational vehicles as permanent dwellings in B.C.'s Interior.\nRegina Sadilkova, the director of development services for the district, said people living in recreational vehicles are\u00a0an\u00a0ongoing problem, but one that seems to be growing.\n\"There's always more and more used recreational vehicles that may not be roadworthy for sale for less and less money. so they buy them, they park them,\" she told CBC\u00a0Daybreak Kamloops\u00a0guest host Rob Polson.\n\"Then they start building onto them: Decks, porches, roofs.\"\nSadilkova\u00a0said aside from being unsightly, the souped-up dwellings fail to comply with the standards required for permanent homes, such as having a proper sewer or septic hookup.\u00a0\nShe also said many of the vehicles are parked along lakes or rivers, which poses environmental concerns.\nFinally, she said that unlike a new\u00a0out-building or home expansion, RVs\u00a0and trailers do not add to property values, so the regional district is missing out on revenue it needs to operate.\nNot everyone agrees with the regional district's message.\nMerlin Blackwell, the mayor of neighbouring Clearwater, said most people in his community are supportive of allowing people to live in RVs and trailers year-round.\n\"We have a housing crisis in this province,\" he said. \"There really isn't a lot of housing.\"\nBlackwell said he's interested in exploring all options for adding housing stock, and the community already has a \"tiny home district\" zoned for homes on lots as small as 400 square feet, and that both Clearwater and the regional district are undertaking a housing needs review.\nAcross the country, local governments have been grappling with how to handle people moving into recreational vehicles on a permanent basis.\nA Calgary man managed to pay off $85,000 in debt by moving into a trailer and parking outside big box stores or industrial areas around the city.\nIn Saskatchewan, the Rural Municipality of Mervin changed its zoning bylaw so that landowners living in trailers or campers have to apply for a $200 permit to stay on some lakeside properties.\nAnd in B.C., the rise of RV dwellers has been documented as a response to growing real estate\u00a0prices in the Lower Mainland.\nBut that rise has come with an increase in the number of garbage, rats and other problems, according to residents of neighbourhoods where RVs congregate.\u00a0\nSadilkova said\u00a0the regional district would work with social agencies to find placements for people who are genuinely unable to afford a place to live in the Thomson-Nicola region.\nBut, she said, most of the people she's found violating the rules do have the means to live elsewhere\u00a0and are simply choosing not to.\nShe warned that people living in recreational vehicles are subject to tickets of up to $250, and that repeat offenders could be taken to court.\nSadilkova also said that, while in the past the regional district has only responded to complaints about people living in RVs and trailers, its elected board of directors have now directed staff to be more proactive in enforcing regulations as\u00a0 illegal dwellings grow in number \u2014 and in size.\n\"People are doing things like installing wood-burning stoves,\" she said. \"They're really moving in.\"\nBlackwell said he sympathized with the regional district, and neighbours concerned at having year-round RVs in areas that aren't equipped to handle them.\n\"We really need to find a different solution other than having people living year-round in RVs, because it isn't a great way to live.\"\nInterviews produced for\u00a0Daybreak Kamloops\u00a0by Jenifer Norwell.\nSubscribe to\u00a0Daybreak Kamloops\u00a0on CBC Listen, and connect with CBC Kamloops\u00a0on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n"}, {"author": "Lien Yeung", "title": "Where to buy in a cooling housing market?

such appreciation relative to neighbouring communities, long-term potential and reviews from real estate agents.\nUptown is bordered by Eighth Avenue to Royal Avenue and Fifth to Eighth streets.\nThe area is home to a\u00a0large mall, the city's main library and many restaurants that line the streets.\nThose amenities have transformed New Westminster from a sleepy \"bedroom community\" to\u00a0a place where residents can live, work and play, she says.\nComing in second on the list is\u00a0the\u00a0Lynnmour area\u00a0in North Vancouver and number three was Sea Island, adjacent to the Vancouver

policy with city hall have led to faster construction, he says, which has\u00a0translated into approximately $50 per square foot in savings for buyers.\nBuilding a new home in New

central banks \u2014\u00a0the \"bazooka\" as German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz\u00a0labelled it, a term quickly adopted by the financial\u00a0media \u2014 has left economic actors stunned and immobilized.\nAs markets continue to\u00a0gyrate and tumble\u00a0there is increasing evidence that even free money, now being offered at nearly zero per cent, is simply not enough to reassure the world facing an inscrutable\u00a0future.\nEvidence of that paralysis came from close to home yesterday.\nWhile the headline from the Canadian Real Estate Association's monthly release boasted of a resurging property market, far more revealing was what the group's economists said about the future.\n\"As providers of the most accurate and timely housing data and statistics, CREA cannot credibly update its quarterly forecast at this time,\" said the association in bold type at the top of its\u00a0data report for February.\nLess than two weeks ago, when Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz announced his\u00a0first big interest rate cut, there were fears the sharp fall in lending costs would goose the Canadian property market with the attendant\u00a0danger of recreating a real estate bubble.\nNow even the experts aren't sure. And things are changing quickly. Only last week there were\u00a0accusations\u00a0that the central bank was scheming to restart the economy on the backs of overborrowed Canadians.\nSuddenly, what seemed like a reasonable concern over the threat of more reckless borrowing has transformed into new worries that the spring property market and the retail sector are crumbling as house hunters and shoppers stay home.\nAnd housing is only one sector\u00a0under assault by a tangle of interdependent consequences of the new coronavirus for which no one had developed strategies. Canada's fossil fuel sector knew there were challenges ahead, but they did not include a sudden plunge in demand followed by a vicious price war.\n\"The macroeconomic backdrop is completely uncharted waters for oil and gas companies,\" said\u00a0Tom Ellacott, vice-president of the energy research company Wood MacKenzie.\nWith no way to know what energy prices for the rest of the year will be, investment plans made a few weeks ago have become meaningless.\nThe caricature of so many of us closeting ourselves with bales of toilet paper and emergency supplies in the safety of our homes applies to investors as well. As world leaders, including\u00a0Prime Minister Justin\u00a0Trudeau, repeatedly announce updated ways of coping with the virus, investment plans made yesterday\u00a0are out of date today.\nAs the Bank of Canada governor once told us during the disputes with the U.S., the main economic impact of trade uncertainty was that companies and individuals considering whether to spend money\u00a0cut their investment plans\u00a0until they could see the way forward.\nIf that is how investors reacted to ambiguity over the future of trade, it is no wonder the current set of unknowns has\u00a0them bewildered.\nWill government\u00a0rules to slow the spread of the virus get stricter yet? Will the shortage of parts we saw when Asian factories closed recur in the U.S., our biggest trading partner, as cases and deaths climb? Will the path of the disease in the U.S. and Canada be staggering like in Italy or mild like in Singapore?\nWill job losses lead to a vicious circle of collapsing demand? How many consumers or businesses will default on loans? Can the consumer confidence that has recently been leading the economy bounce back?\nAnd just as the bizarre quest for too much toilet paper was accelerated by social media feedback, a new round of uncertainty for investors has been caused by investors themselves.\nWhy do markets keep selling off even as experts reassure us stocks will bounce back? Is there something wrong that we don't know and everyone else does? Will the economy and the market structure crack under the strain?\nWith so many questions unanswered, even more rate cuts and a suite of government plans to inject money into the economy at various levels apparently are not enough\u00a0to make that uncertainty go away. And there is no point in telling people not to panic.\n\"First, those who are already panicking are unlikely to listen. Second, those who aren't will start to wonder if they should,\" wrote emergency preparedness expert Simon Wessely in the\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0on the weekend.\nEverything will change when we know \u2014\u00a0or at least think we know \u2014\u00a0the answers to some of those questions. And while we are waiting,\u00a0rather than staring into the abyss, perhaps this is the time to think ahead and imagine\u00a0an inevitably brighter future.\nFollow Don on Twitter\u00a0@don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Hannah Kost", "title": "Calgarian who was in Tehran when Soleimani was killed says he fears war", "description": "Sadra Semnani was visiting family in Iran when a U.S. airstrike killed Gen.\u00a0Qassem Soleimani", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/iran-canada-tehran-airstrike-general-qassem-soleimani-donald-trump-iraq-1.5417591", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5418275.1578434659!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sadra-semnani.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 07, 2020 5:26 PM MT", "2020-01-08T00:26:51.319Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Iranian Canadian Sadra Semnani\u00a0said he\u00a0was visiting family in Tehran on Friday when the story broke.\n\"When I woke up, I saw the news and I freaked out at first, because I thought, 'OK.\u00a0This is a war,'\"\u00a0Semnani\u00a0told Doug Dirks on\u00a0The Homestretch\u00a0Jan. 6.\nIslamic\u00a0Revolutionary Guard Gen.\u00a0Qassem Soleimani, who was considered a heroic figure in his home country of\u00a0Iran, had been slain\u00a0near\u00a0Baghdad's airport on Jan. 3 \u2014 and\u00a0U.S. President Donald Trump ordered\u00a0the airstrike that killed him.\nSadra Semnani, who has been living in Calgary since 2011 with his wife, said\u00a0the targeted killing and its ongoing\u00a0fallout have left him worried for what is next.\u00a0\nTensions between the U.S. and Iran stretch back\u00a0decades\u00a0but have been simmering\u00a0since\u00a0Trump pulled\u00a0out of Iran's atomic accord in 2018 and imposed\u00a0sanctions that crippled Iran's economy.\nThe airstrike that killed\u00a0Soleimani\u00a0followed an acute increase in U.S.-Iranian hostilities in Iraq\u00a0since\u00a0pro-Iranian militias attacked the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.\nSoleimani designed Iran's policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against ISIS.\nHe's considered responsible for multiple\u00a0attacks on U.S. troops and American allies.\nTrump told media following the airstrike\u00a0that\u00a0Soleimani was planning \"sinister attacks\" on U.S. diplomats and service members. However, he didn't release evidence of what those attacks could entail.\nSome analysts and officials fear that Soleimani's death\u00a0represents a political\u00a0boiling point.\nShortly after Soleimani was killed, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that a \"harsh retaliation is waiting\" for the United States.\nOn Tuesday, Iranian state TV said Tehran had launched surface-to-surface missiles at an air base housing U.S. troops in Iraq.\nUpon learning of\u00a0the general's death,\u00a0Semnani\u00a0said\u00a0the civilian reaction in Tehran was immediate.\n\"They started putting banners and posters of him up in like five hours, six hours. It was crazy. I was shocked. And, you know, people were scared,\" Semnani\u00a0said.\nSoleimani's\u00a0significance in the country,\u00a0Semnani\u00a0explained, is weighty.\nFor Iranians, the general was perceived as a protector for\u00a0a country familiar with conflict and political strife.\n\"[Iranians] believe that [Soleimani] was the most powerful man in the region, and that this guy could bring safety to Iran,\" Semnani said.\n\"And now, with him out of the picture, that could make us \u2026\u00a0really in a bad position and that could hurt [the] Iranian people.\"\nFrom France to Iran,\u00a0Semnani said even his\u00a0apolitical\u00a0friends attended funerals and marches.\n\"They're not supporting [the] regime that much, but they went to the funeral because \u2026 they wanted [the world to] see them, and see they don't need another war in the region,\" Semnani\u00a0said. \"And another 10 years of instability.\"\nSoleimani's killing,\u00a0Semnani\u00a0said, happened at the \"worst possible time\" for the Iranian people.\nIn November 2019, protesters in 100 cities and towns in Iran demanded top officials\u00a0step down\u00a0after the country's government announced gasoline price hikes of at least 50 per cent.\nThe Iranian government countered with a brutal crackdown that killed more than 100 protesters.\n\"After the November protests, the country was divided \u2014\u00a0people were really angry. The economy was really in a bad position,\"\u00a0Semnani\u00a0said.\n\"But with this happening, [the] country united again. And that makes it hard for like moderate people to talk about negotiation \u2026 because the hard-liners are going to say that\u00a0if you're talking about negotiation, you're allying with the U.S.\"\u00a0\nThe result,\u00a0Semnani\u00a0said, is that those who want peace could feel pressure to remain silent.\n\"That makes it harder for the people that wanted something good and peaceful out of this situation,\"\u00a0Semnani\u00a0said.\nPolitical fallout from\u00a0Soleimani's killing is ongoing.\nOn Jan. 4,\u00a0President Trump threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites \"very hard\" if Iran attacks Americans or U.S. assets.\nThose sites, the president tweeted, would include targets \"important to Iran & the Iranian culture.\"\nOn Jan. 5,\u00a0Iran abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal and its provisions that block Tehran from having enough material to build an atomic weapon.\n....targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.

community.\nHowever after two years of battling with the town, they've sold their home \u2014 without ever living in it.\n\"For us, the most frustrating part of all this has been their unwillingness to work together with us on finding a solution,\" Puddister told CBC Radio's St. John's Morning Show.\nThe tiny home shell sits on wheels on the couple's land in Pouch Cove with space for a full kitchen, bathroom appliances and a loft large enough to accommodate a queen-sized bed. When the couple brought their\u00a0home to Pouch Cove, the town told them their home was too small to meet their\u00a0home regulations.\u00a0\n\"When we first brought our tiny house shell down to our property, it was under the understanding that their intention was to change regulations to allow us to live in our tiny home,\" Puddister said.\n\"They had promised that publicly at council meetings ... and for whatever reason, it seemed just parking it on our property caused a really big problem for them.\"\nThis isn't the first time Puddister and Ward have\u00a0had trouble with regulations. The couple previously tried to bring a tiny home to Torbay, but were told the same thing, that the home was too small.\nAccording to current town bylaws, a house needs to be at least 80 square metres, or about 860 square feet. That's more than\u00a0twice as big as the couple's tiny home.\nPuddister said she and Ward tried to find different ways to work with the Town of Pouch Cove\u00a0to address their concerns, but nothing seemed to work.\n\"Anyone else in this province parks an RV or a trailer, or any kind of mobile structure that they might have on their own property,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"I just didn't think that parking something on wheels on your own land was an issue.\"\nPouch Cove Mayor Joedy Wall says the town has looked into including smaller homes into future subdivisions in the community, but not about a \"one-off\" example like a tiny home.\n\"We've done a whole lot of thinking about this,\" Wall said.\nThe town submitted a proposal to the Department of Municipal Affairs and Environment\u00a0to reduce the minimum house size regulations from 80 square metres to 50, or about 540 square feet. Wall said the proposal was submitted to the department seven months ago, but has yet to hear a response from government.\nMeanwhile, in a statement to CBC, the department\u00a0said a review of the proposal is underway, adding \"it can take anywhere from six months to more than a year to complete the full review of new municipal plans and development regulations.\"\nPuddister said she understands the importance of respecting the town's rules, but sees tiny homes as a way to move these regulations forward.\n\"That's kind of [why] we started all this. Going in to show the town why tiny homes are such a positive thing in communities. And how important it is to have diverse housing in a community,\" she said.\n\"Having people living in a neighbourhood who come from different backgrounds \u2026 who have different lifestyles. And how much growth that can spur on in a town.\u00a0If this was a public perception problem, let's address that. But they refused all of those options. So it felt like they had taken that personally.\"\nGerard Lewis, a consultant working on issues of local governance, spent three decades working as a municipal administrator. He said communication between residents and council is integral to help things move forward in a community.\n\"It's a built-in, innate\u00a0comfort feeling. We like to do that which we know we have done before,\" Lewis said.\u00a0\"And there is a reluctance to try something new. One thing I've always said to other people is you should take the attitude of not how we can say no, but how we can say yes, and look at ways of exploring options so we can move it forward.\"\n\"People need to be listened to,\" Lewis added.\n\"It's not necessarily that they have to be told yes to everything \u2014\u00a0but let them understand the parameters under which you have to operate, the rationale why. If we turn people off, that exacerbates the situation.\"\nThe couple posted their tiny home for sale on Facebook, with a listed price of $22,000. The new owner of the tiny home plans to take it off the property in May. But the town of Pouch Cove thinks this isn't soon enough.\nThe town took the couple to court on Friday\u00a0for violating an order to remove the tiny home immediately. The town would not comment on the case.\nPuddister said it's\u00a0another challenge they have to face.\n\"It can be very disempowering\u00a0to wait so long and put your life on hold. Tim and I have delayed starting a family because of all this. That's time we'll never get back.\"\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "New $63M 'blueprint' to end homelessness in Regina released", "description": "Contributions from the three levels of government have not yet been confirmed ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-homelessness-plan-to-ber-revealed-1.5182810", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3449336.1475084161!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/lighthouse-saskatoon.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jun 20, 2019 9:48 AM CT", "2019-06-20T17:00:02.334Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A plan to\u00a0end homelessness could\u00a0cost $63 million over five years, but the researchers and advocates\u00a0behind it say the price tag is far cheaper than not acting.\nThe blueprint, called\u00a0\u00a0\"Everyone is Home:\u00a0\u00a0A Five-Year Plan to End Chronic and Episodic Homelessness in Regina\", outlines the actions that must happen to end it.\nHowever, now the plan needs funding. The roles and contributions of the three levels of government have not\u00a0been confirmed yet.\nThe strategy is\u00a0based on a \"housing first\"\u00a0philosophy,\u00a0said Terin Kennedy, who is Director of Regina's Plan to End Homelessness. The model\u00a0provides long-term housing arrangements to homeless people while also connecting them with social and health supports.\n\"It's not only just putting the people in the homes, it's having those supports; meeting these people where they're at,\" she said.\n\"We're not looking for sobriety. We're looking to\u00a0get them in there and get these wraparound supports for them.\"\u00a0\nOf the $63 million, $38 million would go toward program supports.\u00a0\nAdvocates say\u00a0it could cost the public $75 million over the next five years if no action is taken, adding that one homeless person with addictions and mental health issues uses about $55,000 a year in health care and corrections costs alone.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn contrast, it said implementing the plan would only cost $15 per day per person.\u00a0\nThe plan lists 270\u00a0new \"housing first\" spaces as priority investments. These would cost $5.5 million per year. Only 30 currently exist. It also calls for 80 additional units of supportive housing, with a $15 million price tag.\nThe researchers are hoping\u00a0for $40.5 million from the province specifically\u00a0for treatment spaces, intensive case management spaces and for new permanent and affordable housing units.\nThe plan suggests close to\u00a02,200 chronically and episodic homeless people could be helped.\u00a0\nA plan like this\u00a0might\u00a0have\u00a0allowed Roy Ironchild\u00a0to spend a few more nights indoors rather than seeking warmth in vents during cold Saskatchewan nights, the Regina man said.\nIronchild became homeless after a bad separation around six years ago.\u00a0\n\"I failed to kind of adjust. There was a lot of coping mechanisms I needed at the time,\" Ironchild told CBC Radio's The Morning Edition.\n\"I was out and about. I was out in the alleys;\u00a0I was out in the parkades; I was out in abandoned buildings. You name it, I was out there.\"\nLiving on the street was a lot of work and a highly stressful situation, he said. Ironchild slept anywhere he could \u2014 construction sites, heating vents \u2014 even in \u201340 C windchill. He said he would sometimes wake up to find\u00a0someone left him food or money, but he still had to become very resourceful and alert.\n\"You, generally, after years and years, you get used to always keeping one eye open, you know when you sleep,\" Ironchild said.\u00a0\"So, like physically that takes a toll on you.\"\u00a0\nThat's not a problem for Ironchild anymore. He has since moved into a housing first program with the Phoenix Residential Society.\n\"It was like winning the lottery,\" he said.\nThe biggest thing for\u00a0Ironchild\u00a0was having\u00a0a sanctuary. A place to live allowed him to do things that so many take for granted, like making plans with friends.\nIronchild said he hopes the new\u00a0plan\u00a0clears up misconceptions about homeless people. He said guilt and shame compounded all the other\u00a0struggles he faced during homelessness.\nHomeless count assesses needs in Regina, Saskatoon, P.A.\n\"This is an important moment in time \u2014 where we change how we deal with people who have nowhere to go,\" said\u00a0Robert Byers, chair\u00a0of the Regina Homelessness Community Advisory Board and CEO of Namerind Housing Corporation.\u00a0\nHe wants the homeless population to hear that \"these community leaders and this community care \u2014 and that you do belong.\"\u00a0\nHis speech on Thursday was guided by his personal experience.\u00a0\n\"Growing up in Saskatchewan, I never felt like I belonged. At 14, I discovered drugs and alcohol,\" Byers said.\nHe said 25 years of addiction followed and he was homeless during portions of that time. Then somebody reached out to him.\u00a0\n\"Once I believed that somebody cared, that's when my life started to change,\" he said.\nByers noted that, like himself, 80 per cent of homeless people identified in Regina's last count were Indigenous.\u00a0\n\"But it's important to realize that this is not just a homelessness issue, nor is it just an Indigenous issue \u2014\u00a0but it does speak to the truth and reconciliation calls to action, which (are)\u00a0important to all of us.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "David Common & Perlita Stroh", "title": "Even in an 'affordable' Canadian city, cost-of-living squeeze has people putting pressure on politicians", "description": "Cost of living is a big federal election issue, even in places where daily expenses are lower than average", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cost-of-living-federal-election-richelieu-1.5280573", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5281699.1568325203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/anais.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 15, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-15T08:00:00.050Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu lies on the banks of a picturesque river about half an hour's drive from Montreal, its main street a collection of charming cafes and historic storefronts. There are many lists of Canada's most affordable cities based on different criteria, and Saint-Jean ends up on nearly every one \u2014\u00a0but even so, people are feeling the pinch.\nThat's because the cost of living in this \"affordable\" city of nearly 100,000 is still only 3 per cent below the national average, according to figures compiled by global relocation firm Salary Expert.\n\"Anxiety about the cost of living consistently polls as one of the top issues in this campaign,\" says CBC political analyst Eric Grenier. \"Canadians report concern over the cost of groceries and fuel in particular.\"\nHousehold expenses for the average Canadian have been climbing, from food and fuel to house prices and rent. For every dollar Canadians earn they owe an average of $1.77, and that debt continues to grow. All of which is making cost of living a big issue heading into the federal election, according to a CBC-commissioned poll.\nThat's the case even in this Quebec community, where residents typically face less financial pressure than many of their fellow Canadians.\nOn the surface, much about Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu is\u00a0unremarkable. The median age is 42, compared to Canada's 41. Individual income averages $34,058, about $150 less than the rest of the country.\nUltimately, though, it comes down not just to how much you make but how much you spend, and this community has a small edge.\n\"We have low housing prices,\" says city councillor Maryline Charbonneau. \"A high quality of life that is still affordable.\"\nThe average home purchase price in the community is $315,000 compared to the Canadian average of $480,000.\nHigh employment rates help to make the home-price-to-household-income ratio 4.24, half of what it is in many other major centres. That makes home ownership an option earlier in life, plus paying off the mortgage possible much sooner, allowing residents to allocate more of their income to other expenses or savings.\nIt's an economic advantage many residents are well aware of. Anais Buro has lived in many places and the most recent of her 22 moves was to this community, and when asked if she'll ever move again her reply is a very direct: \"Hopefully not!\"\nOther costs are low, too. Saint-Jean borders vast farmland that supplies inexpensive fresh produce four months of the year.\nPlus, child care is not a crushing expense, due to large provincial subsidies. At most, people like Buro would pay $21.95 a day per child, though it can be as low as $8.05. In other provinces, daycare rates are at least double, if spots are even available.\n\"I think it's really sad to think that families have to worry so much,\" says Buro of places where daycare is more expensive and harder to find. \"We've heard of families [in other provinces] who waited till the first child was in school before they had a second. That's something we don't even think about here.\"\nThe majority of those who live in the French-speaking community also work here, making the commute not only easy, but coming home for lunch a routine.\nFor those who don't work locally, the city has a busy and sleek bus terminal, with 40-minute dedicated-lane service to downtown Montreal. Regular commuters pay as little as $8 roundtrip. A comparable ride on neighbouring southern Ontario's GO Transit runs $18.\nAnd since residents live outside a major city but far enough to not be considered a suburb, car insurance rates are lower than in many comparable communities.\u00a0\nOf course, even Saint-Jean is not a utopia.\n\"Public transport is not that accessible, especially for people not going downtown,\" says Buro. \"So we have to have two cars just to get around. Once we've paid for that it feels like there's not much left.\"\nCouncillor Charbonneau commutes daily to Montreal, but admits she'd like to see government invest more in transit and \"put more money into other forms of active transportation\" to allow residents to move easily without using their cars through the city.\nQuebec continues to offer generous rebates on the purchases of new electric vehicles, but for those who still can't afford one, gas prices are among the nation's highest \u2014\u00a0often 12 cents more than next door in Ontario.\nAnd all the services and incentives need to be paid for, which explains why Quebecers have shouldered the highest total tax burden in the country since 1982. Taxes are, by far, the single largest expenditure of any family.\nAn individual living in Quebec earning $50,000 would pay $10,380 in combined federal and provincial tax, according to a tax calculator developed by Thomson Reuters. In Ontario, the burden would be $8,660 or the Yukon, $8,309.\n\"We feel like we're being taxed like we're in the higher levels, although we are considered middle class,\" Buro adds.\nAll of which leaves Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu just slightly ahead of most other Canadian communities when it comes to cost of living. And that has residents paying attention to what the federal parties vying to lead the country in the upcoming election plan to do in terms of reducing the overhead.\nAnd if those in one of Canada's most affordable cities are feeling the financial squeeze, imagine other parts of the country, particularly the Greater Toronto Area and B.C.'s Lower Mainland where living costs in nearly all categories have been on the rise for years, even as income has failed to keep pace.\nHousing prices increased 44 per cent nationally between 2013 and 2018, for example.\nProperty taxes have also shifted northwards as provinces from coast to coast have downloaded responsibilities (and the costs that go with them) to towns and municipalities.\nWith various polls pointing to the rising cost of living as a primary concern of voters heading into the next election, the parties have taken note, says Eric Grenier.\n\"The Conservatives have made it the centrepiece of their campaign, while the New Democrats are also trying to capitalize on that anxiety and concerns about income inequality.\"\nThe Liberals, meanwhile, are pointing to housing policy changes, including a program to provide first-time buyers with 5 per cent towards the purchase of a home.\nMany across the country, even in \"most affordable\" Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, indicate they'll be looking for a candidate, party or leader who can help improve their financial situation. In CBC's poll, for example, one-third of Canadians surveyed said it was their No. 1 concern.\n\"Family issues are most important to me for the election,\" a Saint-Jean resident told CBC News while out with her family at an annual end-of-summer fair.\nMeanwhile, some in Saint-Jean say they would settle for a government that has a plan to at least slow the rising costs of daily life.\n\"Anybody who's going to help us maintain this quality of life is definitely going to have our vote,\" says Buro.\nAnd with that, she returns to her backyard chickens, collecting the eggs they produce for her daily. Sometimes it's the less tangible benefits that make a place desirable.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/743566915581", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2681758523", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Michael MacDonald", "title": "McAdam's sale of $1 housing lots a success, mayor says", "description": "10 of the lots have been sold and the remaining 6 have deals pending", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/one-dollar-lots-mcadam-mayor-1.5349895", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4235867.1501872821!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mcadam-railway-station.png", "publishedAt": ["Nov 06, 2019 2:42 PM AT", "2019-11-06T18:42:16.493Z"], "source": null, "content": "A year after a tiny village in New Brunswick announced it would sell 16 housing lots for one dollar apiece, the mayor says the novel bid to attract newcomers to McAdam has been an unqualified success.\n\"It was a great idea,\" Ken Stannix said in an interview Tuesday. \"But more importantly, it's the ideas and the energy that these new people are bringing to the community and the province as a whole.\"\nAs of this week, 10 of the lots have been sold and the remaining six have deals pending. With one lot recently cleared for construction, Stannix figures there will be 16 new homes standing on the community's east side within the next three years.\n\"I think the approach that we took is going to work out for us,\" Stannix said, taking a break from decorating the town's historic train station for an annual Christmas event.\nIn all, more than 600 people applied to buy one of the dirt-cheap lots after they went on the market amid much fanfare in November 2018.\nStannix said the idea for selling lots for less than the price of a cup of coffee was first raised at a meeting in 2012, when it was apparent the village was in decline.\nLike many other communities on the East Coast, McAdam couldn't compete with the lure of high-paying jobs in Alberta's oilpatch.\n\"We were bleeding population to the West,\" Stannix said.\nAt the time, Stannix had recently moved back to his hometown with his wife Kate after he retired from a 32-year career in the Canadian military. Soon after he was elected mayor in 2016, the dollar-lot idea started to gain traction.\nThe village council also moved ahead with an aggressive plan to tear down derelict homes and buildings to improve property values.\nOf the 25 rundown properties identified, 17 have been flattened.\n\"As soon as we tore the old houses down, people were buying the ones next to them,\" said Stannix, adding that 75 homes have been sold in past three years alone.\nDuring that time, the village's population has grown by 100 to 1,250, and the new dollar-lot homes will continue that trend.\nAs for those moving in, Stannix said they are an eclectic bunch.\n\"We have retirees. We have young people. We have families. We have new Canadians \u2014\u00a0couples from India and Jamaica,\" he said, adding that several of them are from Ontario and Quebec.\nOne of the conditions of sale is a two-year deadline for building a house that is at least 1,200 square feet.\nDevelopers tried to snatch up all 16 properties, but Stannix told them the village, about 70 kilometres southwest of Fredericton, wasn't interested.\n\"We wanted people to come in and\u00a0put their personal stamp on the house that they wanted to build,\" he said. \"And we wanted to make sure they understood what the lifestyle is like in McAdam.\"\nThe mayor said prospective buyers were told to expect a laid-back atmosphere, where snowmobiling, hunting, fishing and nature walks are the main ways to unwind.\n\"In McAdam, rush-hour traffic is three people coming to an intersection and saying, 'No, you go first.\"'\nMeanwhile, officials from another town have already asked the mayor if he can help them duplicate the dollar-lot sales scheme.\nAs well, Stannix has his eye on potential properties along an undeveloped street in town that could soon be sold off for far less than they are actually worth.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Cars, clothes and classroom costs confound Canadians \u2014 plus the pecuniary points behind politicians promises", "description": "Cost of Living for September 28, 2019", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/cars-clothes-and-classroom-costs-confound-canadians-plus-the-pecuniary-points-behind-politicians-promises-1.5297596", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301254.1569630286!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cost-of-living-for-september-28-2019.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 27, 2019 9:00 PM ET", "2019-09-28T01:00:00.795Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "More than 10,000 Canadians tried out our Inflation Game\u00a0and we dig into what people think about how their cost of living is changing \u2014 and why.\nPlus how the rising cost of housing \u2014 even outside of hotspots like Toronto and Vancouver \u2014 is like a metaphorical pair of handcuffs.\nWe also take a look at just what economic principles drive\u00a0what you are hearing this election campaign.\n"}, {"author": "David Common & Perlita Stroh", "title": "Even in an 'affordable' Canadian city, cost-of-living squeeze has people putting pressure on politicians", "description": "Cost of living is a big federal election issue, even in places where daily expenses are lower than average", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cost-of-living-federal-election-richelieu-1.5280573", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5281699.1568325203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/anais.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 15, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-15T08:00:00.050Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu lies on the banks of a picturesque river about half an hour's drive from Montreal, its main street a collection of charming cafes and historic storefronts.

In CBC's poll, for example, one-third of Canadians surveyed said it was their No. 1 concern.\n\"Family issues are most important to me for the election,\" a Saint-Jean resident told CBC News while out with her family at an annual end-of-summer fair.\nMeanwhile, some in Saint-Jean say they would settle for a government that has a plan to at least slow the rising costs of daily life.\n\"Anybody who's going to help us maintain this quality of life is definitely going to have our vote,\" says Buro.\nAnd with that, she returns to her backyard chickens, collecting the eggs they produce for her daily. Sometimes it's the less tangible benefits that make a place desirable.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/743566915581", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2681758523", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh commits to have more than 300 candidates by next week", "description": "Singh says party would also work with province to address high power rates in N.L.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/jagmeet-singh-visiting-st-johns-1.5268350", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5268935.1567535013!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/singh-in-st-john-s.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 03, 2019 9:04 AM NT", "2019-09-03T19:46:40.305Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "While the New Democratic Party has\u00a0few federal candidates in place at the moment, party leader\u00a0Jagmeet Singh says he will have more than 300 candidates committed to running for the party by mid-September.\nThe NDP\u00a0leader was in St. John's on Tuesday, supporting candidate and former MP Jack Harris and promoting the party's New Deal for People, aimed at lowering the cost of living.\nSingh said more candidates are coming soon.\u00a0\n\"We've got about half the candidates, and by the end of next week we'll have 302, so we'll be about 90 per cent of the way,\" he said.\n\"We're absolutely confident that come election time that we'll have all candidates in 338 ridings so people can surely vote NDP wherever they live.\"\nSingh said the party has taken more time in its recruiting to do things differently, like having more diverse candidates across the country in advance of the election expected Oct. 21.\u00a0\n\"We haven't seen a lot of representation in the House of Commons that reflects our country, and one of the biggest gaps has been women,\" he said.\n\"We can't change that by just hoping it'll change on its own;\u00a0it takes some effort, and I've made this a really big priority for me as leader.\"\nThat's taken more time to get candidates in place, but Singh said while the other parties appoint candidates, the NDP follow a\u00a0democratic process.\nThe NDP leader said more than\u00a0half the party's candidates are women\u00a0and\u00a0nearly 10 per cent are Indigenous.\nAlthough the party has just two of seven candidates in place in Newfoundland and Labrador, Singh\u00a0said he's \"absolutely confident\" the party will have a full slate of candidates in the province.\nJagmeet Singh visited the Newfoundland Housing and Homelessness Network on Tuesday morning\u00a0to share the party's plan for the province.\n\"I know that right now in Newfoundland and Labrador, there's a lot of struggles,\" he said.\n\"Things are getting more and more expensive, people are working harder and harder but they're not getting ahead.\u2026\u00a0That's something we've got to change.\"\nSingh, who was born in Scarborough, Ont., moved with his family to Newfoundland and Labrador when he was one.

We've seen the carbon tax come into play in July. Obviously that\u00a0caused the price of everything to go up: fuel, groceries, diapers, whatever you want to\u00a0look at. We've seen housing costs higher than they've ever been before. Lot prices [are] completely unaffordable.\"\nOn government transparency: \"We ask questions on behalf of Yukoners\u00a0in the Legislature and we're not getting answers that Yukoners deserve. Anything we ask regarding details, whether it's\u00a0dollar figures or timelines, they [the Liberals] don't answer the questions and they seem to forget that this is taxpayers' dollars that they're spending and they really need to be accountable\u00a0about how they're spending them.\"\nOn electoral reform: \"We did try to work with the government. We worked with the NDP, but unfortunately the Liberals' go-it-alone approach certainly has backfired on them.\u00a0Premier [Sandy Silver] has said that nothing can happen now until spring. That's unfortunate. We offered directly to the premier the option of having a special sitting\u00a0to bring this issue forward. This wasn't a priority for myself and the Yukon Party, we just honestly were trying to work with the government ... on this and it's unfortunate that they've been rather\u00a0pigheaded about moving forward.\"\nOn the Peel Watershed: \"Looking back at the whole year, it has to be finalizing of the Peel Watershed Regional Land Use plant that was 15 years in the making. It's\u00a0very significant in that it's a new era of government-to-government relationships ... Being on the banks of the river in Mayo, celebrating with all of Yukon, signing that document \u2014\u00a0that was a profound moment in my life.\"\nOn electoral reform: \"Something that I'd like to redo would be the electoral reform commission and the stalling there. From the beginning, you know we were really in earnest wanting to work with the opposition on the draft terms of reference on the process. At every turn it seemed to be stalled, let's just say that. From the beginning, our platform committee was a nonpartisan commission. So again we're gonna have to rethink things and come back.\"\u00a0\nOn the government's agenda in 2020: \"We talked about the banning of single-use bags. We talked about the banning of conversion therapy. We're working on electrification of the Alaska Highway.... We're introducing an energy retrofit loan program that we talked about a lot this session. We're also introducing leave provisions for those who have experienced domestic violence and\u00a0expanding\u00a0the early kindergarten program.... But I would say that I'm really excited about Yukon University. That's massive. That's a big deal\u00a0for the nation.\"\nOn climate change: \"I think climate crawled its way to the top of the pile this year because we've hit this critical mass \u2014 not only like, nationally or internationally, but locally. So I mean, I think I saw the biggest numbers for sure in any kind of rally that I'd ever seen with the climate strikes this fall.... It's great that [the Liberals] accepted the amendment that I made to their motion to declare a climate emergency. I guess part of the problem is\u00a0that they say they've got a 'climate lens' which they're using to make decisions, but they can't share that climate lens.\"\nOn the government's vision: \"I think what we see is,\u00a0a bit of it almost feels like\u00a0governing by survey:\u00a0'What is a hot topic issue right now?\u00a0What are people saying about it? Can the government make decisions that won't offend people?' If they offend people, it\u00a0goes back to survey or goes back to consultation. I don't necessarily see things that have been just government-driven. I've seen lots of things community-driven that government has picked up on, but very few that are government-driven.\"\nOn issues for 2020: \"We need to talk about housing and housing affordability and accessibility. It's one thing to say that we've got\u00a0more than 200 people on the Yukon Housing wait list. But what about people who aren't on that wait list? What about people who are paying substantially more than 30 per cent of their net income [for housing]? We're going to continue to talk about climate change. What are the actions that follow up with that?\u00a0Minimum wage,\u00a0pharmacare, [and] the\u00a0availability of dental services.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "52% of B.C. voters say Justin Trudeau's blackface history is a 'serious' issue: poll", "description": "New polls reveal Conservatives with big lead over Liberals in British Columbians' voting intentions", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/justin-trudeau-blackface-poll-bc-1.5290612", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5278235.1570114245!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/may-scheer-trudeau-singh-composite.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 24, 2019 9:41 AM PT", "2019-09-24T16:41:14.124Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Justin Trudeau's blackface history doesn't appear to be having an impact on voter intentions in B.C., even though\u00a052 per cent of British Columbian voters consider it a serious issue.\nThose are some of the findings in two polls conducted during different weeks in September by research company Insights West.\nThe polls found that the Conservative Party of Canada holds the lead in B.C. with 29 per cent of voter support in both surveys, compared to 17 and 19 per cent for the Liberals.\nThe NDP\u00a0registered at 14 per cent support in both polls, with 13 and 14 per cent for for the Greens.\nWhen asked if they generally approve or disapprove of the way each party leader has performed their job, the Green Party's\u00a0Elizabeth May emerged with the highest approval rating \u2014 51 per cent.\u00a0\nNDP leader Jagmeet Singh followed with a 46 per cent approval rating, Andrew Scheer of the Conservatives with 35 per cent and Justin Trudeau 34 per cent.\nBritish Columbians rated the environment and climate change as the top issue facing the nation by a substantial margin (23 per cent)\u00a0over personal income, wages and the cost of living (12 per cent) and housing prices and affordability (11 per cent).\u00a0\nHowever, a distinct split was detected when a respondent's political affiliation was considered.

That's the lowest range since the summer of 2017, he says, and a big reason why is the bond market.\nUnlike variable rate loans which take their cues from the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, lenders finance fixed-rate loans based on the rates they can get in the bond market. Essentially, they'll borrow money themselves at one rate, loan it out to a borrower at a higher rate\u00a0and make money on that spread.\nSo current rock-bottom interest rates on fixed loans are no coincidence, considering the yield on a five-year Government of Canada bond dipped below 1.3 per cent this month. If a lender can borrow funds for as little as 1.3 per cent then turn around and make money by loaning it out for twice that rate, they have every incentive to keep offering those deals.\n\"The hard cost of funding these loans is going down,\" Laird said. \"And at the same time we are at the tail end of the most competitive market, when lenders fight for [business], so that's when they are willing to thin out their margins a bit to attract volume.\"\nVariable rate loans are also sliding lower, too.\nMost borrowers prefer the peace of mind\u00a0of fixed rate loans, but lenders can tempt borrowers to variable rate loans with even better rates \u2014 even if they're only temporary.\nLaird says typically it takes a spread of about a full percentage point to entice most people to make the leap. Which is why those loans are even less popular than usual because that premium has almost completely vanished.\nHe says the best variable rate loans are about 2.65 per cent at the moment, which is barely better than the fixed rate, for a lot more risk.\nAnyone signing up for that loan today is \"assuming the Bank of Canada is going to be forced to drop their rate once or twice. That would be the only way to justify taking it,\" he said. The bank's benchmark rate is 1.75 per cent.\u00a0\nTrading in investments known as overnight index swaps suggests investors think there's about a 50 per cent chance of a rate cut by the central bank\u00a0this year \u2014 but two would be very unlikely, and never mind any more beyond that.\nLower rates could be good news for those who've already bought, too.\nA recent report by National Bank found that a little more than one out of every six mortgages in Canada is up for renewal this year, and as recently as January the bank was calculating that most of them could expect to be paying between 70 and 90 more basis points on their next loan than they were on their current one. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point, so a jump of 70 basis points would be a loan that went from 3 to 3.7 per cent, for example.)\nBut thanks to the steep slide\u00a0in mortgage rates since the start of the year, most people with loans\u00a0up for renewal now have no need to fear a big jump in their rate when the time comes.\n\"With the recent drop in mortgage rates, those households will be renewing at rates barely above their previous ones,\" National Bank economist Matthieu Arseneau\u00a0said.\nLaird doesn't see anything on the immediate horizon that could derail the era of lower rates, but he does think the federal election in October is worth paying attention to for how it relates to housing.\nHousing policy is bound to come up on the campaign trail, and he expects to hear a lot of talk about changing stress test rules and extending amortization periods in the coming months.\nBut until that happens, Laird's expectations for the mortgage market can be summed up succinctly:\u00a0\"Pretty cheap money.\"\n"}, {"author": "Kimberley Molina", "title": "Housing crunch adding to back-to-school stress, students say", "description": "University, college students facing rising rents, dwindling supply in Ottawa", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/finding-housing-difficult-students-say-1.5271764", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5031438.1563475078!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/home-rental-prices.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 06, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-06T08:00:00.809Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Students at Ottawa's universities and colleges say the city's housing crunch is adding unwanted stress as they struggle to afford tuition and settle into school.\n\"It's been really hard to just find a place that works for me, that fits my budget and that I can call a home,\" said Maria Rey, a third-year student at Carleton University.\nRey said finding suitable housing has been more challenging this year than the previous two.

That will increase the cost of products like building materials and food for some of her most vulnerable constituents, said\u00a0Lela Evans.\nThe government's suggestion that people on the north coast deal with the change by purchasing from Quebec instead of Newfoundland is \"shocking,\" Evans said, especially considering Premier Dwight Ball is the minister responsible for both Labrador affairs and Indigenous affairs.\n\"When they were told that in the meetings, the people in my district, the communities and the town halls, they were actually shocked,\" she said.\nIn September, freight service to Labrador's north coast was cancelled. Freight shipments from Lewisporte were stopped when the Woodward Group and Labrador Marine were contracted to start shipping from Happy Valley-Goose Bay. That means goods have to be trucked to that Labrador community, then brought to the north coast by either air or sea, depending on the time of year.\nThat change adds both logistical challenges and costs for shipping to the north coast, Evans said.\nEvans, a rookie MHA, used the opportunity of her first questions in the House of Assembly to address the ferry changes, which she said will have the biggest effect on the most vulnerable people in her region.\nBuilding materials, for example,\u00a0will increase in price, she said, which will raise costs not only for individuals and businesses but for Torngat Housing, an organization that builds homes and makes repairs for her district's Inuit population.\n\"There's going to be less houses built, and there's going to be less repairs because of this additional cost, so it's going to impact them greatly,\" Evans said.\nPeople are also concerned about increases in food prices in a region where they're already high, she said.\n\"Food security is a big issue on the north coast because of the increased cost of actually getting materials into the north coast because there's no roads,\" Evans said.\nHer constituents expect to spend more on food both in local stores and when ordering in bulk for the winter months, she said.\n\"Now everybody is going to have to find a way to get all that food supplies trucked up to Goose Bay and then put on the boat.\"\nThe changed ferry route could hurt people living in Newfoundland as well, Evans said, if north coast residents begin ordering supplies from Quebec instead of established suppliers on the island. But what is most important, she said, is the hardship for Inuit people and vulnerable people in her region.\n\"Regardless of how it's going to affect the island and the province, we've got to look at our people, because our people are the most vulnerable.\"\nThe Transportation and Works Minister Steve Crocker\u00a0says the government has cut down on freight fees to offset any increased costs to Northern Labradorians.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Colin Butler", "title": "As London's homeless problem grows, so do attempts to find solutions", "description": "Representatives of churches, charities, shelters and aid agencies met to cook up ideas for the cause", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-homeless-1.5444583", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5389843.1581701224!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/downtown-london-poverty-homeless.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 29, 2020 4:06 PM ET", "2020-01-29T21:06:29.612Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Almost a hundred people representing London's churches, charities, shelters, soup kitchens and aid agencies met Wednesday in downtown London to come up with novel ways to help solve the city's expanding homeless\u00a0crisis.\u00a0\nThe crisis comes amid rising real estate prices, a broadening gap between rich and poor and an almost constant presence of people who are drug addicted or\u00a0mentally ill in the city's downtown.

But what upset the couple most\u00a0was a hateful message scrawled\u00a0across the wall targeting their sexual orientation.\u00a0\n\"I had an anxiety attack,\" Madey said.\n\"I was so distraught. I couldn't believe it. I'm scared when someone writes something like that.\"\nIn an email to CBC News, Durham Region police spokesperson Const. George Tudos\u00a0said \"the investigation is still ongoing and does not meet the criteria to be classified as a hate crime at this stage.\"\nHe added that\u00a0if there is enough evidence to lay charges, police would have to consult with the crown, who in turn would have to seek advice from the Attorney General's office to determine whether hate crime charges are warranted.\n\"This is a mischief to property charge based on the information in the report,\" he said.\nOverall, the couple says they wish they could've gone through the process of evicting the tenant faster, and they still haven't received any of the money they're owed.\nBy the time the place is cleaned and ready to go back on the market, 10 months will have passed without them collecting any rent for the property.\n\"When the tribunal is inefficient it hurts people who are paying taxes and providing a home for people to live in,\" Seguin said.\nJordan Donich, a lawyer who represented the couple says by the time the couple came to him, the situation was already bad. But\u00a0his concerns span beyond this case.\n\"Why would you take a chance of supplying the market with affordable housing, or any type of housing if it means you have to wait half a year to get rid of a tenant, and you never recover your money?\" Donich said.\nThe lawyer says in Madey's and Seguin's case, he was surprised that it took three months for them to get a hearing date, and even though they have an order, they haven't really won.\n\"What's a win is getting your money back,\" he said.\n\"Unfortunately, just getting the judgment is half the way,\u00a0and in this case almost half a year later.\"\nDonich says\u00a0tenants like theirs\u00a0often know how to play the system. And if they don't care about having bad credit, it can be challenging to recover the money they're owed without pursing further legal action.\n\"This is a systemic problem and probably only experienced landlords or corporations know this.\"\nThe Landlord and Tenant Board's website states a review is being conducted of all tribunals, including the LTB, to identify areas for improvement and make services more streamlined, cost-effective and efficient.\nThe Ministry of the Attorney General is conducting the review.\n\"As a first step in this review, effective Jan. 1, 2019, the government combined the three former tribunal clusters accountable to the Ministry of the Attorney General into a single cluster called Tribunals Ontario,\" a spokesman for the ministry said in a written statement to CBC News.\nThe ministry says\u00a0combining the tribunals is not what's causing the delays, however it\u00a0is\u00a0working on addressing resources\u00a0the Landlord and Tenant Board needs to adjudicate cases. In the meantime,\u00a0tribunals are processing applications and hearing cases in the usual manner.\u00a0\nMadey says\u00a0they'll give one more renter\u00a0a shot, before considering selling the property. But so far they haven't had much luck with their last two tenants.\n\"We're understanding, we're kind, we're gentle,\u00a0and then they turned against us.\"\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Fed chair sees North America as an economic oasis in 2020: Don Pittis", "description": "Solidifying our trade link with the U.S. means optimism could spread north next year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fed-economy-future-1.5391444", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5393240.1576103971!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-fed.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 12, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-12T09:00:00.793Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A positive outlook for the North American economy means the U.S. Fed has largely taken rate cuts off the table in 2020.\u00a0But for Canadians looking for new mortgages and renewals, the good news is that rate hikes are unlikely, too.\nAs usual, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell added the proviso that the central bank would not hesitate to stimulate the economy again if the U.S. were to be hit by an unpleasant economic\u00a0surprise.\u00a0\nBut unlike U.S. President Donald Trump and many market commentators,\u00a0Powell and his advisers foresee no need for more interest rate cuts in the coming year. Effectively, Powell\u00a0said, after successive cuts totalling\u00a0three-quarters of a per cent, the central bank will now sit tight and wait for the effect of that stimulus to kick in.\u00a0\n\"One thing that we're mindful of is that we've cut rates three times since July,\" Powell told a gathering of reporters at yesterday's\u00a0monetary policy news conference. \"And we do believe that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and that it will take some time before the full effects of those actions are seen in the economy.\"\nPrevious research has shown that while rate cuts have an immediate impact on stock and bond markets, their stimulus effect can take six months to\u00a0a year to work their way into the wider economy. And like\u00a0cannabis edibles, you don't want to have too many before you've seen the effect.\nThe group of bankers who participate in making the interest rate decision were not only confident in their outlook, dropping the word \"uncertainties\" from their statement, but in agreement, approving the policy unanimously.\nOne of the uncertainties that seems to be off the table is the North American trade agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico\u00a0\u2014\u00a0now revised with the support of Democrats\u00a0\u2014\u00a0into what some are now calling\u00a0NAFTA 2.1.\nThe final resolution of that agreement, which is expected to be ratified by Congress in the new year, secures Canada's close integration with what Powell sees as a strengthening U.S. economy.\nWhile the percentage of Canadian jobless rose in the latest November figures, that could change if an apparent worker shortage in the U.S. continues to disseminate north across the border.\nU.S. unemployment figures fell to 3.5 per cent the last time around and wage growth was well above inflation. As one report noted, the rate of wage increases\u00a0outpaced the mortgage rate for the first time since 1972.\u00a0\nPowell expects unemployment to stay low and wage growth to stay relatively high.\nQuestioned as to why the low jobless rate and rising wages had not pushed inflation back up to the central bank's target of two\u00a0per cent, Powell noted the weakening relationship between\u00a0falling unemployment and rising inflation. He also seemed to say the official unemployment rate was an imperfect measure of how many workers were available to be enticed into the U.S. labour force.\n\"Even though we're at 3\u00bd\u00a0per cent unemployment, there's actually more slack out there,\" said Powell, noting that the risk of keeping rates low to draw more people into the workforce is not something to be feared.\nIn fact, Powell once again said that a lack of inflation was a greater risk. In a circular phenomenon, he said, persistently low inflation led to low inflationary expectations, which led to lower inflation, and thus lower interest rates.\nAnd persistently low rates make it impossible to stimulate the economy with cuts once a downturn comes.\u00a0\nPowell hopes to break that cycle.\nAs noted previously, Canada has a relatively healthy rate of inflation, though the statistics for calculating the Canadian core rate are different than\u00a0those used by the Fed.\nBut one of the reasons sometimes given for Canada's higher inflation rate is that poorer people get a bigger slice of the income pie, meaning they spend instead of saving, helping to push prices higher.\nFor Canadian homeowners or those looking to buy, the prospect of\u00a0U.S. interest rates remaining low may be reassuring, because no matter what the Bank of Canada does, five-year mortgage rates are heavily influenced by the U.S. central bank rate.\nTrump may be disappointed that Powell did not add more stimulus, but the 2020 election may tie Powell's hands even further. By tradition, central bankers avoid hiking or cutting in the immediate run-up to an election on the grounds that they do not want to be seen as interfering in politics by boosting or weakening the economy in a way that may offer one party advantage.\nPowell noted the positive effects of a North American trade deal in reducing investment uncertainty. He also\u00a0implied that the greater danger for the U.S. economy was not the resolution of NAFTA 2.1, but\u00a0the much more dangerous dispute between the biggest\u00a0global trading powers:\u00a0China and the U.S.\nAnd the fact is that\u00a0while it is reassuring that the team formulating yesterday's outlook were both unanimous and moderately optimistic, it is useful\u00a0to recall that a year ago,\u00a0the Fed got things quite wrong,\u00a0as Powell described in his look-back at events of 2019, when it was forced to bail out an unexpectedly weak economy.\n\"Rather than modestly increasing the target rate for the\u00a0federal funds rate this year, as\u00a0seemed appropriate a year ago, we reduced it by three-quarters of a percentage point,\" he said.\nWhile it may not have been intended that way, the description was a salutary reminder that no one\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not even the U.S. Federal Reserve\u00a0\u2014 can reliably predict the economic future.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Single parents hit hard by food insecurity", "description": "The year-long series explores why so many in N.L. are struggling to put food on the table", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/fed-up-part-1-single-parents-1.5426188", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Feb 19, 2020 8:00 AM NT", "2020-02-19T14:14:45.991Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Feeding her three children is something Dara Squires loses sleep over.\u00a0\n\"There's definitely probably hours a day that, you know, you're sitting at work and you're like, 'OK, got to get home, feed the kids.

Do I need to come up with something else?'\" she said.\u00a0\n\"I spend a lot of hours in the evening kind of trying to come up with ways to make more money \u2026 so that we're a little more comfortable. So it's difficult to balance those needs a lot of the time.\"\nSquires, a working single mother of three,\u00a0is part of the growing number of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians facing food insecurity \u2014\u00a0the struggle to afford food or have access to food. This province has the highest rate of food insecurity among Canadian provinces.\u00a0\nAnd, according to data compiled by Proof Canada \u2014 a research team that investigates and publishes annual reports on food insecurity using data from Statistics Canada\u00a0\u2014\u00a0single parents just like Squires\u00a0are the most likely to face food insecurity in the province.\nThe issue is one the Single Parent\u00a0Association of Newfoundland\u00a0is familiar with.\u00a0\n\"The majority is single moms,\"\u00a0said Elaine Balsam, the group's executive director.\u00a0\n\"Some are working at low wages, and they are not making ends meet. They do not have the food, they run out. So there's severe cases.\"\nBalsam said with some jobs offering only part-time hours, some single parents are working two or three jobs to get food on the table and keep the household afloat.\u00a0\n\"When you have to choose between paying the bills and food? Food usually comes near the end,\" she said.\nSometimes parents make another challenging sacrifice: skipping meals to make sure their children don't go hungry,\u00a0said Natasha Bader,\u00a0co-ordinator at the St. John's Women's Centre.\nFood insecurity can have a wide-ranging\u00a0impact on children, too. It can affect their behaviour and their ability to learn in school. Food insecurity can also limit their opportunities for growth and development, engaging with their friends and community.\n\u00a0\nSummer camp is one example, said\u00a0Ellie Jones, program director at Thrive, a non-profit organization that provides programs and services for vulnerable people.\u00a0Since children can't use services like school lunch programs, the demand for food in the summer can be even\u00a0greater in some cases.\n\"They might be fortunate enough to go to camp, but they don't have food to send with them to camp, a\u00a0lunch or a snack,\" Jones said, which can have a stigma attached to it.\u00a0\nSo, what makes single parents more susceptible to food insecurity? A lack of high-paying employment and a missing second income are among the top reasons, according to Valerie Tarasuk, a professor at the department of nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto.\n\"If we've got two adults, we've got two kicks at the can,\" Tarasuk said.\nThe wage gap is another obstacle for single mothers to overcome, said Tarasuk.\u00a0\n\"There's lots of studies showing that women in Canada on average make less than men. Employment is more difficult for them,\" she said.\n\"If you've got a lone parent, a woman trying to manage that situation, [they are] just less able to have had the opportunities to amass that financial cushion.\"\nAnd if you think only people who are unemployed or who rely on social assistance are facing food insecurity, think again, said Tarasuk.\n\"The rise we've seen in Newfoundland and Labrador in terms of food insecurity rates not only suggests that there is increasing vulnerability amongst people on social assistance \u2014\u00a0but also that more people in the workforce are struggling,\" she said.\nChild-care costs can eat up a significant chunk of a household income, leaving less money for groceries, said Balsam.\n\"Some people even delay returning to work until their children are in school because\u00a0basically they're working a low-paying job \u2026 to pay child care \u2014 and they can't get ahead that way,\" she said.\nIt is a cycle that can be\u00a0hard to get out, said Danielle Douglas, an organizer with\u00a0Parents for Affordable Childcare in Newfoundland and Labrador, a grassroots organization advocating for quality affordable and accessible child care.\n\"What's being shared amongst the members in our network is that a lot of individuals, most of which are women, cannot return to work because they cannot afford to work. They cannot afford the cost of child care.\"\nOther line items in a household budget\u00a0are on the rise, too, like\u00a0the prices of housing and electricity.\nAnd the looming possibility of even higher power bills\u00a0is top of mind, said Jones.\u00a0\n\"If you don't pay your power bill and get that disconnected, you run your risk of being evicted. And housing trumps whether or not you've got food in your fridge,\" she said.\nAnother aspect of food insecurity is not being able to afford quality food \u2014\u00a0fresh fruit, vegetables, and other staples of a balanced diet.\u00a0\nThe average Canadian family will pay up to an extra $487 for food this year, according to Canada's Food Price Report 2020.\n\"Look, it was only a few months ago that celery was $9.99. Like, who's paying 10 bucks for celery?\" said Heather Bartlett, executive director at\u00a0Daybreak Parent Child Centre in St. John's.\nFresh produce generally costs more than pre-packaged, processed food, and that's one reason more families are buying lower-quality\u00a0food, in order to try to stretch their budget, she said.\n\"I've heard a lot of our families say that they're buying their groceries at Dollarama,\" Bartlett said. \"You can't purchase fresh fruits or vegetables at Dollarama.\"\nThe anxiety that often accompanies the concern about having enough food can manifest as shame, said Bader.\u00a0\nAnd it isn't something that's talked about often.\n\"[People] don't want to be pointed out or have to tell their story, because there is a lot of stigma attached. Or there's assumptions in place about addictions.\u00a0That's just a lot of judgments put onto the person, so they don't want to come forward.\"\nSquires can relate to that, saying her experiences have changed her view on assumptions like these.\n\"I think sometimes people look at families that are struggling and are like 'Well, you know, if they're struggling why are they doing this thing?' But often that's the thing keeping them sane,\" Squires said.\n\"I never judge a parent who smokes or has a drink on a Friday night or something like that, because there are so many things you don't see that they're giving up.\"\nOne thing is for certain, say all four women:\u00a0the solution\u00a0to food insecurity isn't going to come overnight.\nBalsam, Bader, Bartlett and Jones say some sort of policy or all-encompassing approach\u00a0is overdue, but in the meantime, several changes could create some momentum in tackling the issue.\nFor Bader, that starts with addressing\u00a0the province's minimum wage. It's the second lowest in Canada at $11.40 an hour.\n\"I think there's an assumption or a bias around that, you know, it might be people on social assistance who struggle with food insecurity,\" Bader said.\n\"In fact, it's people in general, making minimum wage who struggle with food insecurity as well.\"\nSquires wants to see a drop in food prices, and more support for those who wonder how they'll provide meals for their families.\u00a0\n\"The price of [food] just keeps going up and up and up. And the income isn't going up with it,\" she said.\n\"There's no one you can go to as a parent, I mean, and say 'I need some kind of food credit this month' or something like that.\"\nBalsam said people need to ditch their assumptions and be in tune with the struggles people in their community are facing.\u00a0\n\"It's everyone's problem. It's not just problems of a single parent,\" she said.\u00a0\"Once we get the community on board, this will help everyone in the long run.\"\nFed Up is a yearlong series by CBC NL, in collaboration with Food First NL,\u00a0exploring the issues surrounding food insecurity and why many people in the province are struggling to access food.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Banff's rental vacancy rate surpasses 1.1%", "description": "'It is good to see the availability of rental apartments exceed the 2022 target already'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/banff-vacancy-rate-housing-1.5314743", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5220054.1568427080!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/banff.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 09, 2019 11:34 AM MT", "2019-10-10T14:25:59.283Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The effort to make it easier to find a place to live in Banff appears to be paying off, says the mountain town's mayor.\nFor the first time in many years, the rental vacancy rate in Banff reached 1.1 per cent in 2018, up from 0.6 per cent in 2017, according to a report released this week.\nThe town has a strategic plan that specified a goal to reach one per cent by 2022, partly through initiatives to encourage private developers to build new housing.\n\"After several years of a zero per cent\u00a0vacancy rate, it is good to see the availability of rental apartments exceed the 2022 target already, and there is a strong likelihood that we will grow in 2019,\" said Mayor Karen Sorensen in a release.\n\"But we have a way to go to achieve a healthy vacancy rate of between three and five per cent, as identified in the\u00a0Banff\u00a0Community Housing Strategy.\"\nBanff has 173 more rental units this year than a year earlier, including 131 units in the newly built Ti'nu Apartments.\nOther projects in development include price-restricted, for-purchase housing on\u00a0Banff\u00a0Avenue, and new rental apartments on Cave Avenue.\nSharon Oakley, Banff's manager of sustainable housing, says the uptick in availability is welcome news, as young people arrive for the winter to take jobs on the ski hills.\n\"We are one of two communities that sit in a National Park so our boundaries are tight, land is at a premium, and it's expensive and we can only build up three stories,\" she said.\n\"So this is great news for us because all of those\u00a0lifties that come from Australia will be hearing, 'wow, the vacancy rate has increased, there might be a place that we could get.'\"\nThe scarcity of rental homes in Banff has also led to an overcrowding problem.

So when we start to see wiggle room with the vacancy rate that means that may be decreasing,\" she said.\nLiving in Banff is also getting more affordable, another report suggests.\nAccording to the Job Resource Centre's fall Bow Valley Labour Market Review, average\u00a0Banff\u00a0rental rates decreased by 12 per cent compared with the same period last year.\nRental rates for three-bedroom units had the biggest decrease at 22 per cent.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1602858563981", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Stephen Poloz to step down as Bank of Canada governor at end of term", "description": "Central bank's board says a search for a successor is underway", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-of-canada-poloz-1.5386780", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5386791.1575645306!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/boc-rate-announcement-20191030.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 06, 2019 10:22 AM ET", "2019-12-06T19:46:02.055Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Bank of Canada says Stephen Poloz won't seek a second term as governor when his seven years in the job expire next year.\nBefore becoming head of Canada's central bank in 2013, Poloz was chief executive of Export Development Canada.\nPoloz, the bank's ninth governor,\u00a0replaced Mark Carney, who left the Bank of Canada to become governor of the Bank of England.\u00a0\nSherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said Poloz had big shoes to fill and has done well.\n\"I think he has done a great job,\" Cooper said. \"If you just look at the Canadian economy, it's been remarkably stable.\"\nPoloz's term expires on June 2.\n\"The role of governor of the Bank of Canada has been my dream job,\"\u00a0Poloz, 64, said in a written statement about his decision.\u00a0\"I will leave it next June with gratitude and great pride.\"\nThe board of directors of the central bank says it has begun a search process to select his replacement.\nThe statement also notes that during Poloz's time as governor, the bank has \"created the conditions for steady economic growth, low unemployment\u00a0and inflation close to target through very challenging times.\"\nThe board of directors of the central bank said it has begun a search for his replacement.\nThe Bank of Canada expects to complete the recruitment process by the spring of next year and, subject to approval by the federal finance minister and cabinet, have Poloz's replacement in place for June 3, 2020.\nCarolyn Wilkins, the senior deputy governor, is most often mentioned as a possible successor to Poloz, who has been strongly supportive of his second-in-command at the bank.\nWilkins has often taken the lead in answering questions regarding the central bank's monetary policy report, and the senior deputy governor sometimes makes the opening statement.\nHowever, being senior deputy governor\u00a0is no guarantee of the top job. Tiff Macklem, the senior deputy governor under Carney, was passed over in favour of Poloz.\nOther possible successors include Jean Boivin, global head of research for the BlackRock Investment Institute and a former deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, and Paul Rochon, the deputy minister at the Finance Department.\nCooper pointed to Evan Siddall, the chief executive at Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., as another possible replacement, but added that Wilkins is the most likely candidate.\n\"I think they'd like to have a woman for the first time as the governor of the Bank of Canada,\" she said.\nPoloz surprised financial markets when he cut the bank's key interest rate in January 2015 by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75 per cent in response to a sharp drop in oil prices.\nThe governor was criticized by some for not signalling to investors the possibility of a rate cut, but he defended the decision by saying that statements that explicitly guide market expectations are best reserved for extraordinary times.\nThe interest rate cut proved to be prescient as the drop in oil prices took a bite out the economy that year, and Poloz moved to cut the bank's key rate again in July 2015.\nIn an effort to improve communications, the Bank of Canada began last year having a member of its governing council give a public speech a day or so after interest rate announcements that do not also come with an accompanying monetary policy report.\nThe search for a new Bank of Canada governor comes at an interesting time for the central bank.\nThe bank kept its key interest rate on hold at 1.75 per cent when it made its rate announcement earlier this week, but many economists have suggested it may look to cut its key interest rate early next year.\nThe Bank of Canada has kept its overnight rate target on hold for more than a year due to what it has said has been the resilience in the Canadian economy.\nIn doing so, the central bank has stood out from many of its international peers that have moved to loosen monetary policy and cut interest rates in response to worries about a weakening global economy.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "B.C. lowers

and Freedoms, and is beyond the power of the provincial government.\nIt seeks\u00a0an injunction to stop the province from imposing the tax.\u00a0\nThe lead plaintiffs in the case are an elderly couple from Oak Bay near Victoria \u2014\u00a0Denise Pettersson Simpson, 72, a Canadian citizen, and her husband\u00a0Robert Simpson, 93, a U.S. war veteran who received a Purple Heart

I couldn't understand how this could apply to us,\" says Denise Simpson. \"We didn't buy the house, we inherited it. We're not speculators.\"\nThe B.C. government imposed the speculation tax in November 2018, saying it was designed to target foreign and domestic real estate speculators, turn empty homes into affordable housing, and generate tax revenue to be used for housing initiatives.\nRich offshore investors have been blamed for driving up market prices \u2014 buying homes and condos for investment purposes, often leaving them empty.\nThe Simpsons allege they've fallen victim to an overly broad tax.\nThey say they've repeatedly declined purchase offers from speculators, and recently paid off the Oak Bay mortgage so Denise could move back to Canada permanently after Robert dies.\nNow they face an uncertain future.\n\"We were in the act of settling in when this hit,\" says Robert Simpson.\u00a0\"[We're]\u00a0surprised the government greed for money could drive us out of here.\"\nIn July, the B.C. government revealed the speculation tax is expected to put $115 million into provincial coffers this year.\nThe Simpsons say they can only take part in the lawsuit because it's being handled pro bono \u2014\u00a0without charge \"for the public good\" \u2014 by a Vancouver-based law firm.\nLawyer Kailin Che says the firm hopes to finance the legal costs by crowdfunding through a website called \"saynotospectax.com.\"\nThere was a similar attempt last year to raise funds online for a different speculation tax challenge on behalf of Alberta-based B.C. property owners, which\u00a0has yet to proceed.\nBut Che\u00a0says this case will be fought in court \u2014 and could grow.\n\"I believe this petition is the first step to building a larger constitutional challenge that might evolve into a greater class action,\" says Che. \"And we anticipate there will be other lawsuits to follow.\"\nThe civil action alleges the speculation tax \"infringes the petitioners' right to liberty protected\" under the charter.\n\"Choosing where to establish one's home is a quintessentially private decision that goes to the very heart of personal autonomy,\" states the lawsuit. \"The state should not be permitted to interfere in this private decision-making process \u2026 the act effectively coerces the petitioners to rent out their homes.\"\nThe B.C. government has yet to file a legal response.

But the provincial government ordered the salaries be made public as part of a larger move to shake up the new home warranty program earlier this year.\nThe newly released document shows the President and CEO of Tarion, Howard Bogach, earned $681,616 in base salary and incentives in 2018, and an additional $87,794 in car allowance and pension contributions.\n\u00a0In total, Tarion paid out more than $4 million in executive compensation last year. The corporation also paid $520,000 to its 16\u00a0board members, half of which typically have experience in the\u00a0homebuilding industry.\n\"It's pretty outrageous,\" said Karen Somerville, president of Canadians for Properly Built Homes (CPBH), an advocacy group for consumers of newly built homes.\n\"We would encourage [Consumer Services Minister Lisa] Thompson and Premier Ford to take a hard look and consider capping their salaries, as they did in the case of Hydro One.\"\nLast year the government stepped in to cap the base salary of Hydro One's CEO at just $500,000\u00a0\u2014 though incentives can push the salary as high as $1.5 million.\nA Tarion spokesperson said they did not have access to\u00a0Bogach's base salary before incentives were added.\u00a0\nSomerville suggests the Progressive Conservatives consider a similar cap for Tarion executives, given that Hydro One is a much larger corporation.\n\"We're looking forward to seeing what the Ford Government has to say about this and how they're going to justify this,\" Somerville said.\nTarion is a mandatory service, though many homeowners Somerville deals with don't see the value in what they're paying for, she said.\u00a0\nShe questioned why Tarion only pays out a maximum of $300,000 in settlements for confirmed defects to new homes\u00a0\u2014 an amount she says sometimes doesn't cover the full cost of repairs\u00a0\u2014 when the CEO is making more than double that in a\u00a0year.\n\"Then there are all those other people who have had their claims denied,\" she said.\nIn a statement to CBC, Tarion spokesperson Melanie Kearns\u00a0said the compensation structure is performance based, to attract and retain talent.\n\"We use market salary surveys and independent external HR compensation experts to review our board and executive compensation programs and we benchmark our compensation against Ontario's other\u00a0administrative authorities as well as comparable public sector organizations,\" she wrote.\u00a0\nAs for the board of directors, Tarion's website said members' compensation is reviewed every two years and, with the exception of the board and committee chairs, the board's remuneration hasn't changed since 2005.\u00a0\nThe provincial government has been calling Tarion \"broken,\" since it was elected last year.\nPublishing executives salaries was just the latest of several promises Progressive Conservatives have made when it comes to reforming the home-warranty provider.\nThe government has ordered the creation of a new regulator for the home-building industry in the province in an effort to address the perceived\u00a0conflict of interest of having developers on the board regulating their own industry and resolving disputes between builders and homeowners.\nConsumer Services Minister Lisa Thomson has also floated the idea of ending Tarion's monopoly on home warranties in Ontario and opening the market to other providers.\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "What profits at Canada's big banks are saying about the odds of a recession", "description": "Royal and CIBC revealed numbers last week.

At CIBC, the figure stood at $291 million for the quarter, a 21 per cent increase year over year.\nThe worst part is those credit losses seem to be spreading beyond certain problematic parts of the economy.\n\"It used to be oil and gas but it looks like it has spread ... to some other areas,\" said James Shanahan, a senior equity research analyst\u00a0with Edward Jones.\nThe\u00a0oil and gas sector has been hit hard and has been a black mark on Canada's economy for a while, but there's some evidence that weakness is spreading to businesses in forestry, agriculture, and other industries, he said.\n\"It's not too surprising given the tremendous growth, but this could be a problem for the banks,\" Shanahan said.\nLoans going bad are a bad sign for any business \u2014 never mind the broader economy \u2014 but the two banks did give a surefire indication that they are feeling confident about their prospects: they raised their dividend.\nNo major Canadian bank has missed a dividend payment in more than a century, but with a track record like that, banks are incredibly careful not to promise any more cash than they are confident they'll be able to come up with.\nCompanies that have to snatch back a dividend payment tend to be punished heavily on the stock market, so the banks have been raising their payouts steadily, but cautiously, for decades.\u00a0\nBased on Royal and CIBC\u00a0not increasing\u00a0their dividends during the previous quarter, Mendonca\u00a0was expecting both banks\u00a0to hike this time around. And that's exactly what they did \u2014 another three cents for Royal and four for CIBC.\u00a0\nHe's expecting a bump up at Scotiabank, too, but not for BMO since\u00a0that bank already hiked last quarter.\nBased on how much they are paying out, Shanahan\u00a0says the banks have some capacity to keep the dividend hikes coming, but on the whole he thought the\u00a0numbers at Royal and CIBC showed they are \"in pretty good shape.\"\nAnd as for the rest, \"I think results will continue to come in similarly,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Ian Froese", "title": "No households cut off from Rent Assist this year, but anti-poverty group warns single adults being left behind", "description": "For most groups, income threshold for Rent Assist program, benefits will increase in July, province says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-rent-assist-benefits-frozen-1.5158402", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5031438.1563475078!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/home-rental-prices.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 03, 2019 5:00 AM CT", "2019-06-03T10:00:00.602Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "After two consecutive years of reductions to the number of people eligible for rent assistance, the Manitoba\u00a0government says no households are being cut off from the program this year.\nBut critics say the government is neglecting thousands of\u00a0single, low-income adults by freezing the benefit they\u00a0receive, while\u00a0other recipients receive more money as inflation rises.\nThe latest\u00a0changes to the province's\u00a0Rent Assist program, which helps low-income renters pay for private housing, take effect on July 1.\u00a0\nFor the majority of the thousands of Manitobans who are part of the program,\u00a0monthly benefits will increase.\u00a0A two-person household on social assistance, for example, will be eligible for\u00a0$684 a month, up from $658, as of next month.\nBut for some single people on Rent Assist, the\u00a0benefit will be frozen this year at $576.\nThe government is also raising the program's income earnings threshold, so more households are eligible for\u00a0the subsidy.\u00a0\nIn the last two years, 300 households were cut off\u00a0from Rent Assist, as the\u00a0government twice lowered the income level at which a household is no longer considered eligible for the program.\nA single person with an annual income of $25,584 or less was eligible for the program until July 2017.

And the tax advantage makes it even better.\nFor most Canadians who only own one home, Canadian tax law means that the entire eight-odd per cent increase\u00a0\u2014\u00a0about $40,000\u00a0on CREA's\u00a0average priced home and $80,000\u00a0on the average million-dollar homes of\u00a0Toronto and Vancouver \u2014 is entirely income-tax free.\nNot only that, but the CREA prediction for next year shows prices will rise another, tax free, 6.2 per cent.\u00a0What is not to like about such staggering returns?\nOver the longer term, Canadian property prices are in all likelihood a safe bet. While prices dip periodically, they almost always recover again. But that can take a decade or more.\nIn fact, a closer look at that 8.4 per cent rise in prices, according to CREA economist Gregory Klump, tells us that until just the last few months prices have not been doing so well. Effectively, the big percentage increase is based on comparing a high point in November this year with a low point in November a year ago.\nOverall, comparing all of 2018 to all of 2019 shows prices are only expected to rise 2.3 per cent by the time this year is over. So that is a detail to remind\u00a0you that it depends on exactly when you buy and when you sell. And not only when,\u00a0 but where.\n\"There was an almost even split between the number of local markets where activity rose and those where it declined,\" said the CREA report.\u00a0\"Higher sales across much of British Columbia and in the Greater Toronto Area\u00a0offset a decline in activity in Calgary.\"\nIf you are ever worried that you are feeling a bit too euphoric about the state of the property market and your enthusiasm needs damping down,\u00a0one useful option is to talk to Hilliard MacBeth, or better yet read his\u00a0book When the Bubble Bursts.\nThere aren't a lot of people who say\u00a0the Canadian housing market remains overvalued and is heading for an inevitable fall, but MacBeth is not the only one. Swiss bankers at UBS\u00a0recently put out their latest Global Real Estate Bubble Index, and Toronto had the honour of second place between Munich and Hong Kong. Vancouver came in at No.\u00a06.\n\"The people who are really suffering in the residential side are the new home builders who have built too much product on the outskirts of Edmonton and Calgary,\" said MacBeth,\u00a0on the phone from Edmonton at the end of last week. \"I think the term is 'immediate availability'\u00a0\u2014 code for 'we're desperate.'\"\nHe says there are bargains to be had, so long as you don't think prices\u00a0are going to go down further yet.\nAs MacBeth points out, under priced new-builds are not included in the CREA numbers, nor are mortgage defaults, which are often sold quietly by the foreclosing banks. He said that houses withdrawn from the market because the seller is dissatisfied by offer prices also don't make it into the data.\nIn some ways,\u00a0MacBeth says\u00a0the property market in\u00a0Alberta and Saskatchewan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0currently suffering from a continued downturn in the oil and gas sector\u00a0\u2014\u00a0represents a foretaste of what could happen if the wider Canadian economy were to go into recession.\nIt is something\u00a0Stephen Poloz\u00a0in his Bank of Canada year-end speech and news conference last week said he had taken into account. While the central bank\u00a0sees\u00a0the large pile of mortgage debt accumulated by Canadians as sustainable, it remains the principal vulnerability for Canada and its financial system.\n\"If a nasty shock came along and unemployment\u00a0in Canada rose significantly\u00a0\u2026 the effect of that shock would be magnified,\" Poloz told business reporters. \"So we would have a bigger and more prolonged recession than if that debt was not there.\"\nPoloz was in no way predicting a global or Canadian economy shock this coming year, but he said Bank of Canada modelling shows that even in the worst case, the country's banking system would remain sound.\nHaving studied the central bank's predictive scenarios,\u00a0MacBeth\u00a0is not so sure. But of course\u00a0gloom,\u00a0especially in the property market, is one of his specialities.\nHe is still advising young people to avoid the condo market where he thinks prices have become detached from the land value they represent. He is advising people to rent, and notes that construction companies working on purpose-built rental properties will continue to do well, selling them\u00a0to pension funds\u00a0for the reliable stream of future income they represent.\n\"So will 2020 be the year of recession in Canada? I suspect it will, and if that's the case, then it will be a particularly challenging time for Canadians because we've never gone into recession with\u00a0private-sector debt levels\u00a0\u2014\u00a0both corporate and household\u00a0\u2014\u00a0at such high levels,\" said MacBeth.\nThat may be the minority view, but now you've been inoculated. It's safe to go back and read some\u00a0real estate optimism\u00a0about how property has nowhere to go but up in 2020.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Holly Gordon", "title": "'It's a battlefield': how Canadian music festivals have survived an unstable decade", "description": "2019 has already claimed Roxodus and Woodstock 50.

It's a high-risk, high-reward endeavour that everyone could\u00a0talk about for years if it goes well, but could also drop you into the hands of heavy debt or bankruptcy\u00a0if it doesn't \u2014 and we've seen more and more of Canada's music festivals lean toward the latter lately.\nSouthern Ontario alone saw the disappearance of major festivals like Wayhome, Bestival, TURF and Field Trip in the last two years. Vancouver Island has suffered two festival losses in just the last handful of months (Rifflandia and Rock the Shores). It's all been underscored this year by the on-again, off-again updates from the States as to Woodstock 50's unstable status (final word: it's off).\u00a0\nSo it wasn't overly surprising when news broke in July that Canada had another cancellation to add to the list: the splashy, inaugural Roxodus Music Fest in Clearview Township, Ont., would never happen, cancelled just one week before it was set to take place.\u00a0\nThe lineup was big and pyrotechnic-filled, touting Aerosmith, Kid Rock, Alice Cooper and Nickelback as headliners. The cancellation was originally blamed on wet weather that ruined the venue earlier this year, but it soon came out that MF Live Inc., the company behind Roxodus, had filed for bankruptcy and owed more than $18 million to creditors, according to Global News. Global also reported that Roxodus organizers are under investigation for \"allegedly destroying protected forest, wetlands.\"\u00a0\nIt can take years to prove a music festival sustainable, but we've been losing festivals both new and established over the last half decade at a rate that feels alarming. In addition to the previously mentioned Bestival and Wayhome \u2014 which both started strong in 2015 with headliners like Frank Ocean, Solange and Florence & the Machine, but only lasted two and three years, respectively \u2014 B.C.'s Pemberton Music Festival folded two months before its 2017 (and 10th) year. Field Trip had been operational since 2013, before its 2019 hiatus.\u00a0\nEveryone is operating in\u00a0a volatile climate that includes competing resources, increasingly unpredictable weather, an expensive exchange rate and inflated headliner prices.\nSo how does one stay afloat?\u00a0\nThere's no one answer to that question. But there are festivals across the country that have survived \u2014 and sometimes thrived \u2014 despite the unpredictable music climate. We talked to people working with Festival d'\u00e9t\u00e9\u00a0de\u00a0Qu\u00e9bec, Halifax Pop Explosion, Venus Fest, Elora's Riverfest and Shambhala to find out what challenges they've been facing \u2014 and how they're keeping things going.\nBooking headliners during the heat of the summer is prime time for competition, and with such high population and festival density in Ontario and Quebec \u2014 plus European and American markets competing for many of the same big names \u2014 it can be tough to afford the lineup you want.\n\"During the summer, it's a battlefield,\" says Arnaud Cordier, talent buyer for Quebec City's Festival d'\u00e9t\u00e9 de\u00a0Qu\u00e9bec, a non-profit, 11-day festival whose headliners this year included Imagine Dragons, Mariah Carey, Alt-J and Blink-182.\nCordier points to big-name festivals like the defunct Wayhome and Bestival as one factor in the rapidly rising headliner prices in the mid-2010s, estimating that prices have jumped 20 per cent in the last four years. And he's not alone.\n\"When Bestival showed up and Wayhome\u2026 we had challenges booking our lineup for us, because a lot of bigger festivals were offering \u2014\u00a0their offers were so much higher than what we could afford,\" says Spencer Shewen, artistic director of Elora's Riverfest.\u00a0\nShewen adds that Wayhome radiused out everybody else in southern Ontario \u2014 meaning bands couldn't play any other festival around that time \u2014 and bands were waiting for offers from Wayhome because they knew they'd get paid twice as much as somewhere like Riverfest.\u00a0\nIt was a three-year crunch that seems to have plateaued, though the price effects remain. Halifax Pop Explosion takes place in October every year, but even the festival's fall placement hasn't protected it from festival\u00a0oversaturation\u00a0and a sustained headliner price tag.\u00a0\n\"Anytime you have anything kind of blow up the way [this] does, [it's] almost like a bubble,\" says James Boyle, executive director of Halifax Pop Explosion.\u00a0\"Same thing with housing, you see the rise in housing costs; you see a rise in band costs. I think the biggest thing we've seen is the fact that artists have so many options to play means that their price has gone up. And I think that kind of general rise for the mega festival has forced festival prices to continue to increase for bands, which then has an effect on every festival whether they're a giant outdoor event that runs for three days with million-dollar headliners or a local community kind of festival that has headliners that aren't nearly as big ... I think a rise in [headliner] artist fees is the biggest impact that that's had on the industry.\"\nBoyle estimates he's seen headliner prices rise at least 50 per cent more \u2014 \"if not double\" \u2014 since 2015, with prices evening out recently, though not going down. He's optimistic that the bubble is ending \u2014 or at least no longer expanding.\nAerin Fogel started the not-for-profit Venus Fest in Toronto as a small, one-day festival in September 2017 to focus on women and non-binary artists, and which has now grown to a three-day festival with headliners the Vaselines and Charlotte Cardin. While Venus Fest operates on a completely different model than something like Wayhome or Bestival, instead aiming to improve gender disparity on stages across the country, Fogel feels it's all connected.\n\"I've always had it in mind that festivals that are working at that scale are kind of inherently unsustainable,\" says Fogel. \"I think when something is that big, it's very hard to look at it in a long-term context, because the risk factor is so much higher. And there's also less ability to account for all the individuals that are in the space. So there's less kind of safety in implementation and all those pieces. So part of me wasn't surprised that some of them had started folding around that time.\"\nShe points out that 2017 was also the year that Keychange launched, an international campaign working toward gender balance at music festivals and conferences by 2022. While some things were folding, others were just beginning.\nSo what's a festival to do with rising headliner prices, increased competition for billing and ticket prices that don't rise to match? Sometimes you have to sweeten the deal \u2014 and stick together.\n\"You need to have friends around you, [to be] able to put an offer on the table,\" Cordier says. Ottawa and Milwaukee are two markets where he unofficially partners with festivals to make offers, as well as smaller towns in Quebec.\u00a0\nPutting together a package of offers for a regionally specific circuit is more lucrative than a one-off bid, and it makes Festival d'\u00e9t\u00e9 de\u00a0Qu\u00e9bec more competitive compared to circuits in Europe that can offer festival after festival within such a small radius, resulting in more money for less travel time. It's something he's been doing for the last few years.\n\"I'm a talent buyer, but also an agent sometimes,\" Cordier jokes.\u00a0\nShewen says 2019 is the first year Riverfest has made a concerted effort to bring artists to Elora in tandem with other festivals.\n\"We actually ended up putting in a few joint offers with Up Here festival [in Sudbury],\" he says. \"So we were able to get Hubert Lenoir to come and we were able to get Reykjav\u00edkurd\u00e6tur from Iceland, and that's because both of our festivals offered on them to make it worth [their] while to make the trip.\"\nThere are also more official ways festivals show their friendships: Riverfest and Halifax Pop Explosion host stages at each other's festivals, and Riverfest partners with Guelph's Kazoo! Fest each year for the same reason.\n\"We present a show at their festival, they present a show at ours; we like to show those relationships,\" says Shewen.\nWhile Fogel doesn't officially partner with other festivals to get artists to Venus Fest (though bumping up against Pop Montreal's September dates has helped), she has a unique selling point: a focus\u00a0on women and non-binary artists.\n\"We're working with artists who are on the same page and share the same kind of passion that we do for pushing for change in the music industry,\" she says. \"So in some ways that makes it more challenging for us because it might narrow the scope of how many artists we have to work with, but at the same time it makes some things like booking certain headliners a little bit easier. Because when they get it and when they love what we're doing, they're totally on board.\"\nFogel singles out Scotland band\u00a0the Vaselines as one act the festival may not have gotten were it not for its\u00a0mission.\u00a0\n\"I don't know, necessarily, that they would come for a small one-off festival across the pond ... so it means that, for not a massive-budget festival that might still be OK for them because they're just interested to work with us,\" she says.\nWhen asked if she approaches artists who are out of Venus Fest's budget on the off chance that they'll get them anyway due to their mandate, Fogel laughs.\n\"Oh yeah, all the time,\" she says. (It hasn't really worked out much, though.)\nShambhala Music Festival near Nelson, B.C., began in 1998, eventually making a name for itself as Canada's biggest electronic dance music festival. Jimmy Bundschuh, co-founder of Shambhala, says the key was to take it one year at a time.\u00a0\n\"We had relatively slow growth, you know, maybe 10 or 15 per cent [for] people a year for a lot of those years,\" says Bundschuh. \"So we really took the time, were able to develop the infrastructure, the systems and you know, sometimes [festivals] can also be a victim of their own success. You get too big too fast and fail that way.\"\nBundschuh and the Shambhala team have been developing the festival's property since its inception, which makes for a completely different setup than a festival that only gets access to a venue right before it kicks off.\n\"[Shambhala is] on the family farm,\" he says. \"So we have year-round access, and we can really think long-term and [have] been working on those kind of things since the start, so a cumulative effect.\nHe notes that the festival's first 10 years were tougher \u2014 small budget, remote location, rising DJ rates \u2014 but the base they've built allows them the financial freedom to make decisions that are right for them, like not using corporate sponsors and keeping Shambhala's status as a dry event.\nFestival d'\u00e9t\u00e9\u00a0de\u00a0Qu\u00e9bec celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, and Cordier says the fact that it's a non-profit festival has allowed the board to put money back into it at a rate that makes them competitive in terms of attracting headliners.\nThe festival's board opened up its lineup to international acts in 2004, and now Festival d'\u00e9t\u00e9 de\u00a0Qu\u00e9bec is known for its big-name performers, filling the 90,000-capacity Plains of Abraham on a night that could include Neil Young or Lorde. Six years after that decision, they turned in a banner year with a \"massive, sold-out festival,\" billing Arcade Fire, the Black Eyed Peas, Rammstein and Rush.\n\"It was a bit of a surprise,\" says Cordier. \"And then what are you going to do? Invest more money in the talent budget.\" While he says people assume the festival gets significant public funding, that money realistically makes up between 14 and 16 per cent of the annual budget. The majority still comes from ticket and drink sales.\u00a0\nYou don't have to be giant to make it work, though. The three-day Riverfest can see between 5-6,000 people each day, and Shewen says its picturesque location and community is key to its appeal to artists and fans alike.\n\"We continue to luck out because artists really like playing our festival,\" says Shewen. \"They actually get to go swimming in the quarry and go in the gorge and stuff like that, it's more of a vacation for them as well. So I think that actually kind of buffered us a little bit [during the Wayhome years] as far as that goes ... I think the artists requested that [they] want to play our festival.\"\nRiverfest grew out of a backyard festival a decade ago (a fundraiser to turn an old gas station into a green space in downtown Elora) with what Shewen guesses was 250 people in attendance. Every year they've grown a little bit bigger, and this year their Canadian-heavy lineup included City & Colour, the Sheepdogs, Alice Merton and A Tribe Called Red.\n\"We call ourselves a big-little festival,\" says Shewen, noting that he thinks more and more people are gravitating toward \"that kind of experience.\" More laid back, smaller scale.\n\"There's an ease to coming to our festival, that I think helps,\" he adds.\n\"We've always been a festival of discovery,\" says Halifax Pop Explosion's Boyle. \"And despite the bubbles and changes in the sector, we try not to lose sight of that.

The Poloz advantage is that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won't be hollering at him to cut interest rates or insulting him when he doesn't.\nWith so much fearful talk of a coming\u00a0recession, U.S. President Donald Trump is not the only one who has called for rate cuts to boost the economy.\nBut as the fundamental strength of Canadian growth, employment, income and housing seems an oasis in a world beset by recessionary fears, Poloz and his advisers will do what good central bankers\u00a0like best: follow the data.\nWhatever may be around the corner, it is hard to dispute that right now the fundamentals of the Canadian economy are strong. Annualized gross domestic product numbers on Friday hit nearly four\u00a0per cent,\u00a0well above forecasts, although the year-over-year gain is less than half that.\u00a0\nJobs, wages\u00a0and inflation remain strong. Housing is no longer soaring, which is good, but it is no longer plunging either. Canadian shoppers are still shopping.\nIt is almost certain that the Bank of Canada will leave rates unchanged tomorrow at 1.75 per cent.\nA\u00a0poll of 40 economists by Reuters now shows a majority foresee no rate cuts in 2019. But it's a split decision. Just over 40 per cent say not only will there be a cut, but some suggest it will be half a percentage point, double the usual quarter-point decrement.\n\"With the Fed likely easing in September and then again in October, it looks as if it would be the prudent thing to do for the Bank\u00a0of Canada\u00a0to take up some insurance as well,\" BMO's\u00a0Benjamin Reitzes\u00a0told the news agency.\nU.S. easing is not yet certain. Warnings of price increases by retailers due to the China-U.S. trade war may push inflation higher. A partial resolution of the trade fight may make two cuts unnecessary.\nPoloz may indeed find himself pressured by U.S. and other countries'\u00a0rate cuts if he believes there will be an impact on Canada.\u00a0But the idea that central banks can do much to compensate for an economy smacked by the growing costs of\u00a0trade disputes, especially by cutting interest rates in advance,\u00a0was a subject of debate at the recent central bankers' conference at Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nWith rates already so low, it is not clear even a half-point cut would convince business borrowers to take out additional loans to expand their businesses just when they have been warned\u00a0a recession is about to strike.\u00a0\nAnd rather than boosting business fundamentals,\u00a0rate cuts when an economy is running hot would mostly jack up asset prices like real estate and stocks, which might please speculators, but would only make a bigger noise should a recession bring those asset prices\u00a0crashing down.\nWhile there will be plenty of criticism and suggestions for improvement\u00a0during the\u00a0upcoming election campaign, there are signs that Canada is benefiting from years of relatively good government by Trudeau and Stephen Harper before him.\nImmigration and high levels of education have given Canada a healthy workforce. Recent data shows that while Canada's rich are not as rich as their U.S. counterparts, those earning median salaries and below are significantly better off.\n\"Our income estimates may actually underestimate the economic well-being of Canadians relative to Americans,\" writes Bloomberg's Justin Fox. \"Indeed, Canadians usually receive more in-kind benefits from their governments, including notably in health care.\"\nOf course, that economic advantage Fox reports\u00a0only comes after you look at Canadian purchasing power parity. Canadian dollars buy more goods and services here at home, but as we discovered during a summer visit to Alaska, they don't go so far in the U.S.\nLast week The Atlantic reported that a coming recession was going to doom U.S. young people weighed down by student debt and poor job prospects. But as Bloomberg's Fox observed, the mood really is different in Canada.\nWhile Canadian youth also face the burden of\u00a0high rents and entry-level wages, subsidized education means levels of student debt are not as extreme. And with boomers departing the workforce in droves, young Canadians know there are hundreds of thousands of good jobs going begging if only they can get the right credentials.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Holly Gordon", "title": "'It's a battlefield': how Canadian music festivals have survived an unstable decade", "description": "2019 has already claimed Roxodus and Woodstock 50.

It's a high-risk, high-reward endeavour that everyone could\u00a0talk about for years if it goes well, but could also drop you into the hands of heavy debt or bankruptcy\u00a0if it doesn't \u2014 and we've seen more and more of Canada's music festivals lean toward the latter lately.\nSouthern Ontario alone saw the disappearance of major festivals like Wayhome, Bestival, TURF and Field Trip in the last two years. Vancouver Island has suffered two festival losses in just the last handful of months (Rifflandia and Rock the Shores). It's all been underscored this year by the on-again, off-again updates from the States as to Woodstock 50's unstable status (final word: it's off).\u00a0\nSo it wasn't overly surprising when news broke in July that Canada had another cancellation to add to the list: the splashy, inaugural Roxodus Music Fest in Clearview Township, Ont., would never happen, cancelled just one week before it was set to take place.\u00a0\nThe lineup was big and pyrotechnic-filled, touting Aerosmith, Kid Rock, Alice Cooper and Nickelback as headliners. The cancellation was originally blamed on wet weather that ruined the venue earlier this year, but it soon came out that MF Live Inc., the company behind Roxodus, had filed for bankruptcy and owed more than $18 million to creditors, according to Global News. Global also reported that Roxodus organizers are under investigation for \"allegedly destroying protected forest, wetlands.\"\u00a0\nIt can take years to prove a music festival sustainable, but we've been losing festivals both new and established over the last half decade at a rate that feels alarming. In addition to the previously mentioned Bestival and Wayhome \u2014 which both started strong in 2015 with headliners like Frank Ocean, Solange and Florence & the Machine, but only lasted two and three years, respectively \u2014 B.C.'s Pemberton Music Festival folded two months before its 2017 (and 10th) year. Field Trip had been operational since 2013, before its 2019 hiatus.\u00a0\nEveryone is operating in\u00a0a volatile climate that includes competing resources, increasingly unpredictable weather, an expensive exchange rate and inflated headliner prices.\nSo how does one stay afloat?\u00a0\nThere's no one answer to that question. But there are festivals across the country that have survived \u2014 and sometimes thrived \u2014 despite the unpredictable music climate. We talked to people working with Festival d'\u00e9t\u00e9\u00a0de\u00a0Qu\u00e9bec, Halifax Pop Explosion, Venus Fest, Elora's Riverfest and Shambhala to find out what challenges they've been facing \u2014 and how they're keeping things going.\nBooking headliners during the heat of the summer is prime time for competition, and with such high population and festival density in Ontario and Quebec \u2014 plus European and American markets competing for many of the same big names \u2014 it can be tough to afford the lineup you want.\n\"During the summer, it's a battlefield,\" says Arnaud Cordier, talent buyer for Quebec City's Festival d'\u00e9t\u00e9 de\u00a0Qu\u00e9bec, a non-profit, 11-day festival whose headliners this year included Imagine Dragons, Mariah Carey, Alt-J and Blink-182.\nCordier points to big-name festivals like the defunct Wayhome and Bestival as one factor in the rapidly rising headliner prices in the mid-2010s, estimating that prices have jumped 20 per cent in the last four years. And he's not alone.\n\"When Bestival showed up and Wayhome\u2026 we had challenges booking our lineup for us, because a lot of bigger festivals were offering \u2014\u00a0their offers were so much higher than what we could afford,\" says Spencer Shewen, artistic director of Elora's Riverfest.\u00a0\nShewen adds that Wayhome radiused out everybody else in southern Ontario \u2014 meaning bands couldn't play any other festival around that time \u2014 and bands were waiting for offers from Wayhome because they knew they'd get paid twice as much as somewhere like Riverfest.\u00a0\nIt was a three-year crunch that seems to have plateaued, though the price effects remain. Halifax Pop Explosion takes place in October every year, but even the festival's fall placement hasn't protected it from festival\u00a0oversaturation\u00a0and a sustained headliner price tag.\u00a0\n\"Anytime you have anything kind of blow up the way [this] does, [it's] almost like a bubble,\" says James Boyle, executive director of Halifax Pop Explosion.\u00a0\"Same thing with housing, you see the rise in housing costs; you see a rise in band costs. I think the biggest thing we've seen is the fact that artists have so many options to play means that their price has gone up. And I think that kind of general rise for the mega festival has forced festival prices to continue to increase for bands, which then has an effect on every festival whether they're a giant outdoor event that runs for three days with million-dollar headliners or a local community kind of festival that has headliners that aren't nearly as big ... I think a rise in [headliner] artist fees is the biggest impact that that's had on the industry.\"\nBoyle estimates he's seen headliner prices rise at least 50 per cent more \u2014 \"if not double\" \u2014 since 2015, with prices evening out recently, though not going down. He's optimistic that the bubble is ending \u2014 or at least no longer expanding.\nAerin Fogel started the not-for-profit Venus Fest in Toronto as a small, one-day festival in September 2017 to focus on women and non-binary artists, and which has now grown to a three-day festival with headliners the Vaselines and Charlotte Cardin. While Venus Fest operates on a completely different model than something like Wayhome or Bestival, instead aiming to improve gender disparity on stages across the country, Fogel feels it's all connected.\n\"I've always had it in mind that festivals that are working at that scale are kind of inherently unsustainable,\" says Fogel. \"I think when something is that big, it's very hard to look at it in a long-term context, because the risk factor is so much higher. And there's also less ability to account for all the individuals that are in the space. So there's less kind of safety in implementation and all those pieces. So part of me wasn't surprised that some of them had started folding around that time.\"\nShe points out that 2017 was also the year that Keychange launched, an international campaign working toward gender balance at music festivals and conferences by 2022. While some things were folding, others were just beginning.\nSo what's a festival to do with rising headliner prices, increased competition for billing and ticket prices that don't rise to match? Sometimes you have to sweeten the deal \u2014 and stick together.\n\"You need to have friends around you, [to be] able to put an offer on the table,\" Cordier says. Ottawa and Milwaukee are two markets where he unofficially partners with festivals to make offers, as well as smaller towns in Quebec.\u00a0\nPutting together a package of offers for a regionally specific circuit is more lucrative than a one-off bid, and it makes Festival d'\u00e9t\u00e9 de\u00a0Qu\u00e9bec more competitive compared to circuits in Europe that can offer festival after festival within such a small radius, resulting in more money for less travel time. It's something he's been doing for the last few years.\n\"I'm a talent buyer, but also an agent sometimes,\" Cordier jokes.\u00a0\nShewen says 2019 is the first year Riverfest has made a concerted effort to bring artists to Elora in tandem with other festivals.\n\"We actually ended up putting in a few joint offers with Up Here festival [in Sudbury],\" he says. \"So we were able to get Hubert Lenoir to come and we were able to get Reykjav\u00edkurd\u00e6tur from Iceland, and that's because both of our festivals offered on them to make it worth [their] while to make the trip.\"\nThere are also more official ways festivals show their friendships: Riverfest and Halifax Pop Explosion host stages at each other's festivals, and Riverfest partners with Guelph's Kazoo! Fest each year for the same reason.\n\"We present a show at their festival, they present a show at ours; we like to show those relationships,\" says Shewen.\nWhile Fogel doesn't officially partner with other festivals to get artists to Venus Fest (though bumping up against Pop Montreal's September dates has helped), she has a unique selling point: a focus\u00a0on women and non-binary artists.\n\"We're working with artists who are on the same page and share the same kind of passion that we do for pushing for change in the music industry,\" she says. \"So in some ways that makes it more challenging for us because it might narrow the scope of how many artists we have to work with, but at the same time it makes some things like booking certain headliners a little bit easier. Because when they get it and when they love what we're doing, they're totally on board.\"\nFogel singles out Scotland band\u00a0the Vaselines as one act the festival may not have gotten were it not for its\u00a0mission.\u00a0\n\"I don't know, necessarily, that they would come for a small one-off festival across the pond ... so it means that, for not a massive-budget festival that might still be OK for them because they're just interested to work with us,\" she says.\nWhen asked if she approaches artists who are out of Venus Fest's budget on the off chance that they'll get them anyway due to their mandate, Fogel laughs.\n\"Oh yeah, all the time,\" she says. (It hasn't really worked out much, though.)\nShambhala Music Festival near Nelson, B.C., began in 1998, eventually making a name for itself as Canada's biggest electronic dance music festival.

A few months later, she moved to New York City to launch her biotech startup and needed a place to live.\nShe was struck by the first place she saw: a two-bedroom, tastefully furnished apartment with exposed brick and expensive appliances in a townhouse located in the rapidly gentrifying Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bushwick.\n\"We actually fell in love with it. It was the first apartment we saw\u00a0and we basically just moved in,\" Ali told The Sunday Edition.\nWhile the unit was enough to convince Ali this was the place she wanted to live, she soon discovered this was no ordinary apartment building.\nThe building was owned and managed by a company called Node,\u00a0one of about a dozen companies that, over the past few years,\u00a0have collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to upend the rental market in our largest and priciest cities with an approach called co-living.\nThere are many variations of co-living,\u00a0but it's best to think of a typical co-living building as a combination of apartment, college dorm, hotel\u00a0and high-end rooming house\u00a0\u2014 like a 1970s commune without the communitarian ideology.\nCo-founded by Canadian entrepreneur Anil Khera, Node currently owns\u00a0buildings in New York, Dublin, London\u00a0and Los Angeles.\nThey've also\u00a0purchased a building in the Ontario tech hub of Kitchener-Waterloo, with plans to open their first Canadian co-living building by the end of next year, before expanding across the country.\nAli's building in Bushwick has eight units, with 14 people currently living here.\n\"There's some people who live upstairs who are hairdressers.\u00a0And then we're here. And then\u00a0we have someone who's an artist.\u00a0And the couple next door \u2014 they travel a lot,\" said Ali. \"So it's a lot of different people, with a lot of different backgrounds, and that's really appealing in itself.\"\nOther co-living buildings are much larger, housing hundreds of people. But what they all have in common is density.\nMost co-living apartments are small, even by New York standards. Some are only a few hundred square feet and have shared bathrooms and kitchens. By squeezing more rental units into their buildings, these companies hope to make them more affordable for people who might otherwise be priced out of desirable neighbourhoods like Bushwick.\nThat hasn't really happened yet \u2014 at least not in Brooklyn. Ali's two bedroom rents for $2,800 US a month, which is\u00a0similar to what a traditional\u00a0apartment would cost in Bushwick. But when all the extras are factored in, co-living can become\u00a0a\u00a0more attractive proposition.\nIn exchange for less private space, co-living buildings offer generous common spaces, like lounges, gyms\u00a0and hot tubs, as well as hotel-style amenities, including free Wi-Fi, utilities and housekeeping.\nCo-living companies also often hire a representative \u2014 known as a \"community curator\" in the case of Node \u2014\u00a0who act as a sort of concierge, helping to manage the building, deal with residents' problems and organize community-building activities, from music nights to local bar tours.\nThe current target market for co-living is millennials \u2014 generally defined as people born between 1981 and 1996 \u2014 who are increasingly finding themselves shut out of the rental market in the major global cities where so many want to work and live.\nThanks to social media, they're connected to more people than any previous generation, but they're also feeling lonelier and more isolated. The promise that virtual communities can be as meaningful as genuine communities is starting to fade, according to Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at New York University.\n\"Many people now recognize that being on the screen all the time is unsatisfying,\" he said. \"And many of us really hunger for connections where we live.\u00a0And that can be the neighbourhood, that can be the block\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but it could also be the very building\u00a0you spend time.\"\nKhera\u00a0currently divides his time between London, where Node is based, and Toronto, where he grew up. He said his previous experience working at a private equity real estate investment firm propelled him to find new models for building community through the housing market.\n\"I understood the broken nature of the housing market from a professional standpoint, but also from a human standpoint,\" said Khera.\n\"We're building cities with fractured relationships between residents living all on top of each other. We really haven't addressed housing and the right way for actually thinking about what's good for society. And so all co-living operators believe that there's a better way to connect to people and have community.\"\nFor people like Ali, new to the city and busy running her business, these efforts to build a community among her fellow millennial co-livers was as appealing as the appliances and exposed brick.\n\"I didn't know anyone here in New York\u00a0and it was really nice to come into a community that you could connect with people who are on the same level,\" she said. \"New York is built for a certain type of fast-paced individual, anybody with an entrepreneurial type of spirit, anybody that wants to be their own person\u00a0\u2014 and I think I fit right in.\"\nThe appeal of co-living for young professionals is pretty clear.

A few months later, she moved to New York City to launch her biotech startup and needed a place to live.\nShe was struck by the first place she saw: a two-bedroom, tastefully furnished apartment with exposed brick and expensive appliances in a townhouse located in the rapidly gentrifying Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bushwick.\n\"We actually fell in love with it. It was the first apartment we saw\u00a0and we basically just moved in,\" Ali told The Sunday Edition.\nWhile the unit was enough to convince Ali this was the place she wanted to live, she soon discovered this was no ordinary apartment building.\nThe building was owned and managed by a company called Node,\u00a0one of about a dozen companies that, over the past few years,\u00a0have collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to upend the rental market in our largest and priciest cities with an approach called co-living.\nThere are many variations of co-living,\u00a0but it's best to think of a typical co-living building as a combination of apartment, college dorm, hotel\u00a0and high-end rooming house\u00a0\u2014 like a 1970s commune without the communitarian ideology.\nCo-founded by Canadian entrepreneur Anil Khera, Node currently owns\u00a0buildings in New York, Dublin, London\u00a0and Los Angeles.\nThey've also\u00a0purchased a building in the Ontario tech hub of Kitchener-Waterloo, with plans to open their first Canadian co-living building by the end of next year, before expanding across the country.\nAli's building in Bushwick has eight units, with 14 people currently living here.\n\"There's some people who live upstairs who are hairdressers.\u00a0And then we're here. And then\u00a0we have someone who's an artist.\u00a0And the couple next door \u2014 they travel a lot,\" said Ali. \"So it's a lot of different people, with a lot of different backgrounds, and that's really appealing in itself.\"\nOther co-living buildings are much larger, housing hundreds of people. But what they all have in common is density.\nMost co-living apartments are small, even by New York standards. Some are only a few hundred square feet and have shared bathrooms and kitchens. By squeezing more rental units into their buildings, these companies hope to make them more affordable for people who might otherwise be priced out of desirable neighbourhoods like Bushwick.\nThat hasn't really happened yet \u2014 at least not in Brooklyn. Ali's two bedroom rents for $2,800 US a month, which is\u00a0similar to what a traditional\u00a0apartment would cost in Bushwick. But when all the extras are factored in, co-living can become\u00a0a\u00a0more attractive proposition.\nIn exchange for less private space, co-living buildings offer generous common spaces, like lounges, gyms\u00a0and hot tubs, as well as hotel-style amenities, including free Wi-Fi, utilities and housekeeping.\nCo-living companies also often hire a representative \u2014 known as a \"community curator\" in the case of Node \u2014\u00a0who act as a sort of concierge, helping to manage the building, deal with residents' problems and organize community-building activities, from music nights to local bar tours.\nThe current target market for co-living is millennials \u2014 generally defined as people born between 1981 and 1996 \u2014 who are increasingly finding themselves shut out of the rental market in the major global cities where so many want to work and live.\nThanks to social media, they're connected to more people than any previous generation, but they're also feeling lonelier and more isolated. The promise that virtual communities can be as meaningful as genuine communities is starting to fade, according to Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at New York University.\n\"Many people now recognize that being on the screen all the time is unsatisfying,\" he said. \"And many of us really hunger for connections where we live.\u00a0And that can be the neighbourhood, that can be the block\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but it could also be the very building\u00a0you spend time.\"\nKhera\u00a0currently divides his time between London, where Node is based, and Toronto, where he grew up. He said his previous experience working at a private equity real estate investment firm propelled him to find new models for building community through the housing market.\n\"I understood the broken nature of the housing market from a professional standpoint, but also from a human standpoint,\" said Khera.\n\"We're building cities with fractured relationships between residents living all on top of each other. We really haven't addressed housing and the right way for actually thinking about what's good for society. And so all co-living operators believe that there's a better way to connect to people and have community.\"\nFor people like Ali, new to the city and busy running her business, these efforts to build a community among her fellow millennial co-livers was as appealing as the appliances and exposed brick.\n\"I didn't know anyone here in New York\u00a0and it was really nice to come into a community that you could connect with people who are on the same level,\" she said. \"New York is built for a certain type of fast-paced individual, anybody with an entrepreneurial type of spirit, anybody that wants to be their own person\u00a0\u2014 and I think I fit right in.\"\nThe appeal of co-living for young professionals is pretty clear. Selling the idea to investors has been a harder slog. Executives at one co-living company, Ollie, approached 400 New York building owners before one agreed to allow them to convert a conventional apartment building into co-living units.\nBut that reluctance has now largely dissipated.

Assessment show the typical value of a single-family home in Vancouver has dropped 11 per cent, from $1.76 million to $1.57 million, as of July 1, 2019.\nHere are\u00a0a few answers to questions you might have about property values across the province.\u00a0\nWhile property values dropped by four\u00a0to 15 per cent across Metro Vancouver, it was a different story in the rest of the province.\nThe median value of a detached home in other major population centres was relatively stable over the last year: a two per cent drop in Victoria and Kelowna, a three per cent increase in Nanaimo, a five per cent hike in Prince George and a seven per cent increase in Kamloops.\u00a0\nAnd the biggest increases came in some of the communities farthest from Vancouver\u00a0\u2014 led by Kitimat, which saw a 41 per cent increase in the median value of a detached home, as the community ramps up for the construction of a $40 billion LNG plant.\u00a0\nBelow is a chart showing the change in the assessed value for a median detached home across B.C. last year.\u00a0\nIt's important to remember that your property tax bill for 2020 has very little to do with how much your home's value has gone up or down and more to do with\u00a0a municipality's individual budget \u2014 and what's happened to the home next door to you.\u00a0\n\"What's most important to a homeowner is how their assessment changes relative to others in their community, because that's what's going to determine whether or not there's an impact on their property taxes,\" said\u00a0Tina Ireland with B.C. Assessment.\u00a0\n\"If your assessment goes down 10 percent and your neighbour's assessment goes down 5 per cent, there's likely a good chance that you're going to see a reduction in your property taxes.\"\nIn the short term, very little\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the maximum rental increase for 2020 was 2.6 per cent,\u00a0and it will be months before the province sets its figure for 2021.\u00a0\n\"The rental market specifically is a more complicated market,\" said\u00a0Robert Patterson, a staff member with the\u00a0Vancouver-based Tenant Resource & Advisory Centre.\nWhile Patterson said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" lower home prices would help tenants, he said it\u00a0wouldn't ensure that new market rentals coming on board are affordable\u00a0and advocated for governments to prioritize the creation of more non-market and co-op housing units.\u00a0\nFor many years, one of the more eyebrow-raising property assessments has been a decades-old White Spot in Vancouver's downtown Coal Harbour neighbourhood.\u00a0\nOnce valued at $16 million, it exploded upward\u00a0to $156 million in 2018\u00a0before decreasing to $138 million in its most recent valuation.\nThe reason?\nB.C. Assessment values properties based on their \"highest and best use,\"\u00a0and the land under the White Spot\u00a0\u2014 which was sold to a Hong Kong-based development company in 2017\u00a0\u2014 now allows towers, as part of the West End Community Plan approved by council in 2013.\u00a0\nIt's unknown whether Metro Vancouver properties will see a similar decline in value next year.\n\"Overall, it's kind of a market that's still figuring itself out and correcting itself,\" said\u00a0real estate agent and industry blogger\u00a0Steve Saretsky.\nProperty valuations are based on market conditions on July 1 of the previous year, and Saretsky noted that home sales picked up in the second half of the year.\nBut he thinks that whether things go up or down, it won't have the same huge fluctuations as the past.\n\"We've had these large gyrations, huge movements up, huge movement down,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"[In] 2020, I think we're entering more into ... sort of like a more normal market.\"\nWith files from The Canadian Press, Estefania Duran and Yvette Brend\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Moncton developer turns around condemned Saint John apartments", "description": "Mitchell Apartments reopening with complete remodelling, fewer units and higher-than-average rent", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/mitchell-apartments-reopen-saintjohn-1.5305915", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306213.1570041120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mathieu-vautour.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 02, 2019 3:17 PM AT", "2019-10-02T18:17:00.836Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Three years after it was\u00a0condemned and shut down, an apartment complex in Saint John's north end is reopening.\nThe Mitchell Apartments on Mitchell Street used to have 72 units in six different buildings.\u00a0\nThirty units are now ready to be rented again, according to Mathieu Vautour of Viva Developments.\n\"It's a complete change,\" Vautour said. \"The first time we walked into these buildings, I mean, there was broken glass everywhere.

Some of the former units\u00a0have been reconfigured into larger living spaces.\u00a0\nIn the summer of 2016, the City of Saint John said the Mitchell Apartments needed about $3 million in upgrades to pass inspection.\nThe company that owned them said it couldn't afford the work and went bankrupt.\nThe buildings were\u00a0vacant and badly vandalized over the next couple of years until Viva bought them about a year ago.\nPrior to this project, most of Viva's experience was in new construction in the Moncton area, said Vautour.\nBut Viva\u00a0saw the Mitchell Apartments as a good investment opportunity.\u00a0\n\"We kind of went through the buildings, we looked at the structure itself, and the structure was still really really good. So we decided basically to gut it out. And once we did, we saw that everything was still very much intact.\"\nVautour said Viva has spent about $4 million on renovations.\nThe redevelopment has been going well, he said, giving credit to the whole team of people who have been involved in the work.\nLeading Edge Property Solutions is managing the new Mitchell Apartments. They are offering one-, two- and three-bedroom units of about 1,000 square feet for $900 to $1,500 a month.\nThose rents are above average for Saint\u00a0John.\u00a0\nAccording to Economic Development Greater Saint John, a standard, unfurnished, two-bedroom apartment costs about $747 a month.\n\"You've got to\u00a0compare apples to apples,\" said John MacKenzie, a councillor for Ward 2.\n\"I think right now in Saint John we have a lot more apartments that are not brand new.\"\nCompared to other new units in the city, the Mitchell prices are relatively inexpensive, he suggested.\nMacKenzie is \"excited\" to see the older building transformed into something new.\nVautour said the new apartments do have some features that lower the cost of living.\nMini-split heating and cooling systems in every unit will mean lower power bills, he said.\nAnd the apartments are on a bus route and within walking distance of the uptown.\nThe city is facing what some have called an affordable housing crisis.\nLast year, 1,796 people were on the waiting list for affordable housing.\nAs of early September, 135 people were known to be experiencing homelessness in Saint John, according to the Human Development Council.\nThe basic social assistance rate is $537.\nVautour said his company is working on a couple of other projects in Saint John, one on the west side and one on Boars Head Road in Millidgeville. He expects both\u00a0will be done next spring.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Tom Ayers", "title": "Cape Breton University buys old Tartan Downs harness racing track", "description": "University says property will be used for future development", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cape-breton-university-buys-old-tartan-downs-1.5326799", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5326859.1571426769!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tartan-downs-trainer.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 18, 2019 5:05 PM AT", "2019-10-18T20:05:28.248Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Cape Breton University has purchased the old Tartan Downs harness racing track in Sydney, N.S.\nThe university,\u00a0which has seen a massive increase in international student enrolment, says the property will be used for future development, but no details are available because the deal won't be finalized until early November.\nThe facility closed in 2006, but horse owners still board some animals in the barns and use the track for training. There's no word on when they might have to be out of the barns and off the track.\nThe owner of Tartan Downs, Jack MacNeil, declined to comment until the sale is finalized.\nThe track opened in 1899 on what was then the outskirts of the city, but housing has long since grown in around the property.\nGreg Sparling, a longtime harness racer, said the track used to be a busy spot.\n\"Aw, it was the best place,\" he said. \"We used to race Monday, Thursday and Saturday, earlier on, and it was an all-season surface. We could race both winter and summer.\"\nIn its heyday, the track was popular with horse owners, drivers and spectators.\n\"The steel plant was going strong, the fishery, the mines, and there was no lotto machines,\" said Sparling.\n\"Well, we had bingo was our only competition, put it that way. No local casino at the time. It was very popular with the miners, fishermen, and generally the local people had a place to go. Fun place to be.\"\nSparling said competition from casinos, video lottery terminals and televised racing helped put the track out of business.\n\"People found other places to put their money,\" he said.\nIn addition, the closure of Cape Breton's steel plant and coal mines hurt the economy and reduced people's disposable income, Sparling said.\nSparling said the track itself was built using slag material from the steel plant, which made it excellent for horses and drivers. The infield, he said, is literally a burial ground for horses that died or had to be put down.\nThe track had a series of owners over the decades. MacNeil\u00a0purchased it out of receivership in 1995.\nCape Breton University has been bursting at the seams over the last year or so with a huge increase in\u00a0international student enrolment.\nAccording to Viewpoint Realty, the Tartan Downs property includes four parcels of land and covers nearly 10 hectares just off Upper Prince Street.\nIt is zoned for multiple uses, including some manufacturing, retail, recreation and residential housing.\nA decade ago, just after racing was shut down for good, the property's assessed value for taxation was $266,300.\nThis year, it's assessed at $88,900 and the listed sale price was $259,500.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1544110147749", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1544110147749", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605807683571", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605764163695", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605548099627", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605148739589", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605548099627", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605148739589", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Hadani Ditmars", "title": "Social distancing is important.

In a high-density city like Vancouver, this feels like too little, too late.\u00a0\nHow do residents of the 58 per cent of dwellings in Vancouver that are apartments \"self-isolate\" when they have shared spaces such as\u00a0laundry rooms, elevators, stairwells and lobbies to contend with?\nFor those living in detached houses, self-isolation is much easier than for those in towers, and yet according to the\u00a02016 census, 33.5 per cent of Canadians live in multi-family dwellings. In Toronto's census metropolitan area,\u00a0nearly three\u00a0in\u00a010\u00a0dwellings are in highrise apartment buildings, and\u00a0in Vancouver towers make up 16.7 percent of housing.\nIn my own rental apartment tower in Kitsilano, a neighbour in her 60s informed me by email that she was returning from two months\u00a0in California and would self-isolate across the hall from me.\nWhile I was grateful for my neighbour's disclosure, I was alarmed at the lack of protocols on multi-family residences from my landlord, the Residential Tenancy Board\u00a0or Vancouver Coastal Health. I live in an old building with shared facilities, such as heating and ventilation, and\u00a0many aging and vulnerable tenants.\nThe only reason I know my neighbour is returning from the U.S. is because she informed me, but I have no idea how many other tenants in my building are also returning from abroad and if they are voluntarily self-isolating. I have no idea if anyone in my building has tested positive or what the protocol would be if they did.\nOur landlord has only very recently put up posters in common areas with some basic advice, suggesting social distancing and \"limited time spent in the laundry room.\"\nNo additional cleaning protocols are in evidence and visitors \u2014 overnight and otherwise \u2014 are allowed, as are visits by maintenance staff who work in dozens of other buildings, and couriers and postal workers who deliver to individual suites.\nIn many places battling COVID-19, apartment towers can become potential breeding grounds for community spread if proper protocols are not followed.\nIn Hong Kong last month, for instance,\u00a0officials quarantined dozens of residents living in an apartment tower where a woman who lived 10 floors below a resident with the virus also tested positive and was found to have an unsealed ventilation pipe in her apartment.\u00a0\u00a0\nWant to write an opinion for CBC British Columbia? Please email bcvoices@cbc.ca.\nI'm 22, chronically ill \u2014 and feel dismissed in the COVID-19 dialogue\nJoseph G. Allen, director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, wrote in the New York Times that\u00a0buildings of all kinds \"are highly efficient at spreading disease,\"\u00a0but proper ventilation, filtration, diligent cleaning of common areas and adequate levels of humidity can help mitigate community spread.\u00a0\nIn New York City,\u00a0the health department is developing more extensive guidance for property owners and managers, and advising them to clean more often and use disinfectant products.\nIn Canada, this doesn't seem to be a priority.\nWhen I rang my landlord for more information after the province's announcement, he said they were waiting on a directive from the Residential Tenancy Branch, but told me that they could not reveal if there were any tenants in buildings who had COVID-19 or who had recently returned from abroad or\u00a0whether they were\u00a0self-quarantining, because of privacy concerns.\u00a0\nMoreover, in cities like Vancouver and Toronto with sky-high real estate prices and low vacancy rates, many people are forced into \"co-housing\" situations that make self-isolation virtually impossible.\nOn a popular Facebook group called COVID-19 Coming Together (Vancouver), a young woman sharing a condo with eight others\u00a0asked\u00a0whether it was still OK\u00a0to have friends and lovers stay overnight\u00a0during the pandemic.\nAnother plea came from a\u00a0woman whose roommate was returning from a band tour in the U.S. and refused to practise basic self-isolation protocol. The two share a bathroom and kitchen in a small basement apartment in a complex.\nThe issue also affects condo owners who rub elbows, as it were, in lobbies, elevators and even gyms (an alarming number remain open, even as public ones close.)\nCurrent public health guidelines around COVID-19 would seem out of step with Canada's new urban, high-density reality.\u00a0\nIf all levels of government continue to make protocols to mitigate community spread in multi-family residences a low priority, leave it in the hands of landlords\u00a0or simply pass the buck, they do so at our increasing peril.\nWant to write an opinion or point of view piece for CBC British Columbia?

Preliminary estimates for the 2018\u00a0Commonwealth Games\u00a0in Australia indicate a price tag of over $1.8 billion.\nThe cost to hold the 2022 games in Birmingham, England is\u00a0expected to hit about $1.5 billion.\nBrian MacPherson, CEO of Commonwealth Games Canada\u00a0previously told Hamilton city\u00a0councillors that the total cost can run around $1.5 billion.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1604510275822", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1604510275822", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1604504643536", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Liberals will work with cities on climate change even when provinces won't: Trudeau", "description": "PM says Ontario premier is playing politics with communities, blocking federal funding for local projects", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/trudeau-cities-provinces-1.5157402", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5157425.1559316948!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trudeau-municipalities-20190531.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 31, 2019 11:47 AM ET", "2019-05-31T15:47:46.160Z"], "source": null, "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his federal Liberal government will work closely with municipalities to deal with the effects of extreme weather and climate change \u2014 even if Ottawa and the provinces in question aren't getting along.\nIn a speech in Quebec City\u00a0today to members of the Canadian Federation of Municipalities, Trudeau specifically cited Doug Ford, accusing his Ontario Conservative government of blocking federal funding for local projects.\nTrudeau says the Ontario premier is playing politics with communities, with citizens paying the price.\nThe prime minister says his preferred option is the type of co-operative federalism that Canadians expect: three levels of government working together whatever their political stripes.\nBut if provinces don't want to play ball, Trudeau says his government will find a way to get funding to municipalities.\nHe says extreme weather events like flooding, forest fires and droughts are rapidly becoming the norm, exacerbating a housing crisis that's being felt across the country.\nHe says his government has a plan to deal with climate change and that politicians of all stripes mustn't close their eyes to what is happening around them.\n"}, {"author": "Michelle Ghoussoub", "title": "Influx of 4,500 workers raises fears of violence against women in B.C.'s northwest", "description": "Women's shelters in Kitimat, Terrace already operate above capacity while concerns about 'man camps' persist  ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/violence-against-women-bc-1.5486095", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5486164.1583361944!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jessica-mccallum-miller.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 06, 2020 2:00 AM PT", "2020-03-06T17:25:21.109Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of Stopping Domestic Violence, a CBC News series looking at the crisis of intimate partner violence in Canada and what can be done to end it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nKitimat, B.C., feels like a town of men.\nIn fast food joints and corporate buses shuttling workers around the North Coast town, employees of the LNG Canada project stand out with their uniformity. Most sport\u00a0the obligatory\u00a0heavy duty boots and coats worn by\u00a0workers throughout\u00a0B.C.'s\u00a0north as they cope with a waning winter.\nThe $40-billion liquefied\u00a0natural gas project\u00a0will employ about\u00a07,000 workers\u00a0at the peak of construction,\u00a0flying 4,500 people into town for rotating two-week shifts. Around 80 per cent of workers are men, swelling the size of Kitimat, whose population is normally just over 8,000.\nThe influx of people into town has\u00a0mixed consequences, providing a boon to local businesses\u00a0and raising environmental questions. But there's\u00a0another, more worrying, trend. Over the past two years, Kitimat and nearby Terrace's shelters for women fleeing violence have frequently been overwhelmed while concerns about harassment from incoming workers grows.\n\"We have been at or over capacity most nights of the year for the past two or three years,\" said Michelle Martin, who works at the Tamitik Status of Women.\nJessica McCallum-Miller, Terrace's 26-year-old, first Indigenous city councillor, says she's worried the influx of people into town is also\u00a0increasing instances of violence outside of intimate relationships.\nShe says she's felt threatened by\u00a0men who are strangers.\n\"As a young Indigenous woman, I'm actually facing some stalking, violence in my community, I've been harassed by unknown men, not from this community,\" she said, adding she and others have\u00a0been followed by men in cars.\n\"I don't know if they work for industry, I don't know who they are,\" she said, her shock of blue hair in contrast to Terrace city council's stark chambers.\u00a0\nLNG Canada has brought prosperity to the town which has already experienced several cycles of boom and bust that accompany natural resource projects. Martin says the project has also \"unintentionally affected\" women fleeing violence by driving up the price of housing. Other community\u00a0members say the project has sparked fears that \"man camps\" \u2014\u00a0temporary housing for predominantly male workers \u2014\u00a0will make the area dangerous for women.\nLNG Canada says it\u00a0knows major natural resource projects can put a strain on small towns, and that it takes the safety of women and Indigenous people seriously.\u00a0Susannah Pierce, LNG Canada's director of corporate affairs, says it's not true that workers pose a threat to women.\n\"The view that these are just cauldrons of testosterone and these men are out to get the women is wrong,\" she said.\nKitimat is a hilly cluster of faded pastel homes and newer, low-rise apartments tucked at the head of B.C.'s Douglas Channel, in the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation. In late February, the snow banks are several feet high and covered in a layer of winter grime.\nA public work road snakes out of town toward the project site, past a dozen orange hydraulic cranes known as cherry pickers, and a collection\u00a0of blue and white temporary housing units where workers will live come April.\u00a0\nSomewhere in town, at a secret location, is Kitimat's women's shelter. It's funded for eight beds but squeezes in a ninth, and is officially over capacity when that last bed is full. The shelter has had to turn\u00a0away dozens of women and their children over the past two years.\nIts director Martin says that's an alarming number, considering many women facing\u00a0abuse from a partner can't or don't leave, immediately or ever.\n\"There's this assumption that when violence occurs people want the relationship to stop or want to leave when in fact, more often than not, women want the relationship to continue \u2014\u00a0they want the violence, the behaviour, the abuse to end,\" she said, adding it's even less likely women will leave in a town as small as Kitimat, where it's near impossible to stay anonymous.\nLeah Levac, an associate professor at\u00a0the University of Guelph who studies the experiences of women in towns hosting natural resource projects, says research shows domestic violence rates in the north are \"related to resource\u00a0extraction.\"\nShe said locals who can't work in industry\u00a0come under pressure when workers with higher incomes flood the town, driving up the cost of housing. While nationally the average median total income for women is about 68 per cent of that earned by men, in Kitimat it's 49 per cent, making it difficult for women to strike out on their own.\nMartin said natural resource project work is inherently precarious, and those who do land jobs suffer mentally when projects wrap up.\n\"For somebody who has low coping mechanisms or emotional regulation, if they feel bad about themselves and see others prospering, certainly that can translate to violence,\" she said.\nDomestic violence is one, but not the only, concern. The National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women's report released in June 2019 explicitly warned \"increased crime levels, including drug- and alcohol-related offences, sexual offences, and domestic and 'gang' violence, have been linked to 'boom town' and other resource development contexts,\" and urged companies to consider the safety of Indigenous women in all stages of project planning.\nLNG Canada said it's working to mitigate impacts on Kitimat by housing workers at a camp \u2014\u00a0referred to as the lodge\u00a0\u2014\u00a0near its work site outside of town. It was also the first company to undergo, as part of its environmental assessment, another process examining social impacts on the community.\nCompany spokesperson Pierce says there's a zero-tolerance policy for violence, harassment, and bullying both \"inside and outside the fence,\" in reference to behaviour both on and off the work site.\n\"The view that you have all these men sort of coming in to huddle together and [do] bad things, I think that's a misconception. The kinds of folks that come in to work on these jobs, they have families too, and daughters too,\" she said.\nStill, in a small town where the ratio of women to men is warped, it can be difficult to dispel a sense of unease.\n\"When we speak with both Haisla and settler women in this community, they will flag that their perception of increased instances of feeling unsafe [...] are connected to this influx of people,\" said Levac, who has travelled to Kitimat several times to interview women.\nBefore running for city councillor, McCallum-Miller worked in the donation room of Terrace's shelter for women. Still in her early 20s and not formally trained as a social worker, she'd often find herself counselling women fleeing violence, as the shelter struggled to keep up with the demand for services.\u00a0\nIt's a memory she's carried with her as she ran for office, and as she\u00a0reads about how projects have put pressure on other towns.\n\"I know that there's domestic violence, I know that there's sexual violence and I know that we're being extremely impacted by this, especially Indigenous women. And a lot of time it's swept under the rug,\" she said.\nDespite her reservations, McCallum-Miller says she's still undecided about how the project will affect her community. Kitimat and Terrace have already been through multiple cycles of boom or bust, and longtime residents know other hardships come when well-paying jobs dry up.\nPierce's voice swells over the phone as\u00a0she emphasizes that she wants Kitimat's experience with LNG Canada to be different.\n\"We want people to be safe. We want women to be safe. And Indigenous people to be safe,\" she said.\nIf you need help and are in immediate danger, call 911.

Federal funding will offset some of those expenses, but 70 per cent of the money is coming directly from NB Power, which is hoping to use the houses as a living laboratory.\n\"Customers will experience the insertion of these technologies and will provide feedback on functionality and benefits,\" according to the contract between NB Power and Siemens.\nUnclear so far is who is building the houses, what they will cost buyers and where in the Halls Creek area, which is close to the University of Moncton, the neighbourhood will be located.\nIn 2014, an attempt to develop what was called Halls Creek Village \u2014 an ecologically friendly 600-unit housing community in the same part of Moncton \u2014 went bankrupt after only a few houses were constructed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSome of the land from that failed effort remains vacant, but the Ontario company that owns it says it has not been approached about NB Power's project.\n\"I am not aware of this development,\" said Larry Dunn, CEO of HarbourEdge Capital Corporation in an email to CBC News.\nA second major landowner in the area, Century II Holdings Ltd., recently submitted a subdivision plan to the city close to Halls Creek, but President Wayne Girvan said it is not connected to the NB Power project, which he too had not heard about.\n\"It's unrelated, although I'm interested in hearing about it,\" said Girvan.\nAlthough formal applications have not yet been made to Moncton about the development, NB Power officials told the EUB during the rate hearing that it expects to have the first houses built this year and included $3.1 million in its budget for that purpose.\n\"The current plan is to have a package with the builder to start with construction in the 2020\u00a0 construction season,\" said NB Power's Stephanie Langlais, a financial controller with NB Power's \"Energy Smart\" group.\n\"We are currently working on the package with the homebuilder to determine exactly what these houses would look like.\n\"We expect that the package that we would offer for the homebuilder would be ready for the 2020 construction season, and that folks would be interested in purchasing these homes and have them be built.\"\nLanglais was answering questions from J.D. Irving Ltd. lawyer Christopher Stewart about Hall's Creek and two other community-based projects NB Power is pursuing separately in Shediac and Tobique First Nation.\nThose two have much higher levels of federal funding than the Halls Creek development, up to 70 per cent, but Stewart questioned whether the utility is in a financial position to support any of them.\n\"Perhaps these projects will be of great value to ratepayers of NB Power in the future. Candidly, I have my doubts,\" said Stewart in his closing argument.\n\"My real purpose in raising them is in response to what seems to be the utility's position that 'much of our costs are out of our control, we are doing everything we can.'

He worried\u00a0it is less about a cultural shift, and more about a lack of decent affordable housing in mature neighbourhoods.\n\"There gets to be a question around the quality of life as you chew this stuff up into smaller and smaller shoeboxes and try to fit people in there,\" he said.\n\"We're trying to chop up these pieces of property and intensify their use to improve the financials on the piece of property \u2014 it's the reasons why the suburbs exist, is because people could afford those products.\"\u00a0\nTo build multiple tiny homes on a single lot, the lot would have to be rezoned under the Row Housing Zone, which was approved by city council last week.\nThe homes would require a minimum of 2.4 metres of spacing and one parking spot per unit.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/655695939610", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/757254723778", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/653402691923", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/660477507969", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/655416899918", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2686548987", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2684614910", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2682224513", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/695651907618", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/760889923622", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2673582983", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2671775379", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "What a Liberal minority government means to Vancouver real estate", "description": "Provincial, municipal policy will have a more direct effect", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/liberal-minority-vanre-mark-ting-1.5336596", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5171810.1560308067!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancouver.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 27, 2019 6:00 AM PT", "2019-10-27T13:00:00.163Z"], "source": null, "content": "Now that the election is over, many people are wondering what a Liberal minority government means for the Lower Mainland real estate market.\nUnder the First Time Home Buyers Incentive (FTHBI), the Liberals will be increasing the upper limit for eligible homes from $480,000 to $789,000.\u00a0 With the FTHBI, home buyers receive between five and 10 per cent of the purchase price as an \"incentive.\"\u00a0This is not a \"gift\" as it isn't free money \u2014 the government will have an equity stake in the buyer's home.\nThis program will appeal to many, but if I were a first-time home buyer I would avoid it if possible.\nThe other major election announcement is a one-per-cent\u00a0vacant home tax applied to non-Canadians, not living in Canada.\u00a0There are few details on how this tax will administered, so we will have to wait and see how it plays out.\nOverall, I don't think these initiatives will have a meaningful impact on our real estate market.\u00a0The FTHBI will allow more people to enter the market and increase demand for homes around the $800,000 price point which would be a positive in the short term, but won't do much to help with affordability.\nCompared to the federal government, the provincial and municipal government real estate policies are more impactful.

"source": "CBC News", "content": "The City of Edmonton is ready to turn over the keys to tiny homes to some Edmonton yards.\nThis week council's urban planning committee tabled a motion that would\u00a0update zoning bylaws making way for tiny home additions in Edmonton communities.\u00a0\nGarden suites up to 1400 square\u00a0feet are already allowed in the city and Ashley Salvador with YEG Garden Suites said the city's plans to lift minimum size requirements will clear the way for tiny homes too.\u00a0\n\"Previously you'd have to have at least 30 square metres,\" Salvador said. \"That has since been removed \u2026 some of the other changes were around allowing mobile home type garden suites to be dropped down in a backyard as a tiny home.\"\nProposed bylaw changes look to boost Edmonton tiny home development\nIn a report to council, city administration recommended allowing tiny homes on foundations for now but delay zoning amendments for tiny homes on wheels until the province updates building codes to accommodate the unique structures.\nTiny homes, usually under 400 square feet, can already be built as single-detached homes or garden suites in the city as\u00a0long as they're constructed onsite and meet building standards.\nSalvador said the number of garden suites in the city has\u00a0more than doubled over the last two years, jumping from 150 suites to around 350. She expects there will be high demand for\u00a0tiny homes.\n\"I think that there is absolutely demand, it's just that our regulations haven't quite caught up to that demand to really allow that market to flourish,\" Salvador said.\nThe living spaces might be small but the investment is anything but \u2014\u00a0according to Salvador garden suites start at around $150,000.\n\"There are conceptions that 'Oh, it's a smaller space' or 'It's just a backyard suite,\u00a0it can't cost that much,\" she said. \"You have to remember that you still need utilities. You still need electrical, plumbing \u2026 it literally is a house, so those costs do factor in.\"\nGerman Antonio Gomez Decuir\u00a0has designed and built a 600-square-foot\u00a0garden suite just off the back alley of his Roslyn area home.\nThere were\u00a0tenants interested in the space immediately, he said, but his neighbours weren't sold at first.\n\"They were a little bit afraid of it,\" Decuir said. \"But once they saw it built they were like, 'Yeah, you did the right thing.' At the end of the day this is going to increase [their] property value as well.\"\nDecuir said one of their neighbours who was not a fan of the build\u00a0has become such a fan of the idea he asked Decuir to help him design a suite for his yard.\nDecuir said tiny homes and garden suites are a way to provide quality rental spaces at a reasonable price. He and his partner rent their suite for about $1500 a month. He also thinks the suites\u00a0help upgrade the spaces where they are located.\n\"In old neighbourhoods when you don't see [a lot] of aesthetics, especially in the lane way, they can bring something like a shine in the dark,\" Decuir said. \"If you envision it this way and you picture a whole bunch of those in one lane way \u2026 I think that would be pretty cool. [It] would bring life to an area that is usually not utilized.\"\nCoun. Mike Nickel previously raised concerns about the increased interest in tiny homes. He worried\u00a0it is less about a cultural shift, and more about a lack of decent affordable housing in mature neighbourhoods.\n\"There gets to be a question around the quality of life as you chew this stuff up into smaller and smaller shoeboxes and try to fit people in there,\" he said.\n\"We're trying to chop up these pieces of property and intensify their use to improve the financials on the piece of property \u2014 it's the reasons why the suburbs exist, is because people could afford those products.\"\u00a0\nTo build multiple tiny homes on a single lot, the lot would have to be rezoned under the Row Housing Zone, which was approved by city council last week.\nThe homes would require a minimum of 2.4 metres of spacing and one parking spot per unit.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2683789293", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/728229443974", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2681862171", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2684997167", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/729026115975", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2681437212", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/731980867538", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2683206269", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2681506925", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2682222996", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/753489987764", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Millennium Library critics don't want recommended security changes lost in 'disappointing' city budget", "description": "Expenditure targets will hold community services to 0.5% increase, won't meet cost of inflation", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/millennium-library-critics-winnipeg-budget-targets-disappointing-1.5353831", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5162102.1568041820!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winnipeg-millennium-library-security.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 09, 2019 6:00 AM CT", "2019-11-09T12:00:00.767Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A group of people who have publicly criticized the airport-like security measures at Winnipeg's Millennium Library are hoping to hold the city to recommendations its community services committee made in September.\nSarah Broad, a spokesperson for Millennium for All, said the group is worried the expenditure targets for the next four years released by the City of Winnipeg\u00a0last month don't include funds to cover recommended additions at the library.\nAt its September meeting, the community services\u00a0committee recommended measures including non-violent crisis intervention training, a cultural provider, a new community connections space and two more crisis workers to enhance safety at the library.\n\"We'd really like to see some strong leadership out of city hall, since it's been two months since that\u00a0meeting,\" Broad said this week.\nThe city unveiled the broad strokes of its first four-year budget planning process on Oct. 18.\nThe city's planned expenditure targets for 2020-23 would hold community services to a slim 0.5 per cent increase per year \u2014 which Broad said won't bring the department anywhere near the almost $570,000 needed in next year's budget to meet the committee's library safety recommendations.\n\"It's really disappointing at this point. We're really concerned that a 0.5 per cent increase doesn't even cover the cost of inflation \u2014 never mind trying to also cover extra staffing and training for staff at the library, and an exit plan for these [existing] security measures,\" said Broad.\nThe new\u00a0measures, which the library said were\u00a0implemented earlier this year to address\u00a0an increase in the number and severity of security incidents, include\u00a0bag checks and hand-held metal detection screening.\nA spokesperson for the City of Winnipeg said in an email that the city's multi-year budget process is underway, but did not say whether the library recommendations are on the table for next year's budget.\nThe community service committee's budget presentation is scheduled for Nov. 16 at 9:30 a.m., the city's website says.\nBroad said it's important to protect\u00a0libraries, especially as\u00a0barrier-free community spaces seem to be in short supply.\n\"There are people for whom the library is a place of safety,\" she said. \"And that is a really, really important thing. We're running out of those places. We're running out of places where you can just go and simply exist.\"\nOn Saturday, the group will take its concerns to a community engagement event hosted by Fort Rouge-East Fort Garry Coun. Sherri Rollins to discuss housing and community services.\n\"We're hoping to see some movement and some action,\" said Broad.\u00a0\n\"We really care about community safety for everyone, and that includes the people who, right now, are not able to get into the library, or at least don't feel like they are able to go to the library.\"\nThe town hall will be held at 12:30 p.m.\u00a0Saturday at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Fed stands pat, keeps benchmark U.S. interest rate steady", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/federal-reserve-interest-rate-1.5444744", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5341289.1572457524!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/federal-reserve.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 29, 2020 2:14 PM ET", "2020-01-29T19:31:11.450Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a low level Wednesday amid an economy that looks solid but faces potential global threats.\nThe Fed sketched a mostly positive picture of the U.S. economy in the statement it released after its latest policy meeting. It also repeated its pledge to \"monitor\" the world economy, which may be held back in the coming months by China's viral outbreak. Stock and bond markets have gyrated in the past week over fears about the virus.\nThe central bank said it would hold short-term rates in a range of 1.5\u00a0to 1.75 per cent, far below levels that have been typical during previous expansions. Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have indicated that they see that range as low enough to support faster growth and hiring.\nStock prices rose modestly after the Fed issued its statement at 2 p.m. Eastern time.\u00a0\nThe Fed's statement was nearly identical to the one it issued after its December meeting, though it described consumer spending as rising at only a \"moderate\" rather than at a \"strong\" pace. That change likely reflects relatively modest spending by Americans over the winter holidays.\nLast year, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate three times after having raised it four times in 2018. Powell and other Fed officials credit those rate cuts with revitalizing the housing market, which had stumbled early last year, and offsetting some of the drag from President Donald Trump's trade war with China.\nMany economists and investors had hoped that U.S. and global growth would pick up this year, now that the U.S. and China have signed a preliminary trade deal that removed some tariffs on Chinese goods. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund said last week that low interest rates and reduced trade tensions would likely buoy the global economy over the next two years and help nurture steady if modest growth.\nBut China's viral outbreak has injected fresh doubts into that outlook. The coronavirus has in effect shut down much of that nation and seems sure to slow the Chinese economy \u2014 the world's second-largest \u2014 which had already been decelerating. The virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.\nMajor companies across the world have responded by suspending some operations in China. Starbucks said it plans to close half its stores in China, its second-largest market. British Airways has halted all flights to China, and American Airlines suspended Los Angeles flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing.\nHotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators are among the industries that have suffered the most immediate repercussions, especially in countries close to China. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's suppliers in China have been forced to delay the re-opening of factories that have closed for the Chinese New Year holiday until Feb. 10.\nInvestors seem increasingly to believe that the Fed will feel compelled to cut rates again later this year. The chances of a cut by September's Fed meeting have risen to about 56 per cent, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch tool, up from 37 per cent\u00a0just a month ago.\nStill, the Fed will likely wait to see how last year's rate cuts play out. Among other benefits, the cuts have helped drive down mortgage rates and led home buyers to bid up prices on a dwindling number of available properties. Home sales jumped in December and were nearly 11% higher than a year earlier.\nSince they last met in December, Fed officials have presented a nearly unified front in support of keeping rates unchanged, possibly for the rest of this year. That contrasts with last year, when both \"hawks,\" who tend to favour higher rates, and \"doves,\" who typically lean toward lower rates, occasionally dissented from the Fed's rate decisions.\nThe Fed's decision came a day after President Donald Trump urged Fed chair Jerome Powell to cut rates in a tweet, arguing it would make U.S. interest rates \"competitive with other Countries.\" Yet the Fed hopes to avoid the ultra-low and negative interest rates that exist in much of Europe and Japan, which they \u2014 and most analysts \u2014 see as evidence of weak economies.\nMost analysts think the Fed would be more willing to cut rates if there were clear signs of a sharp economic slowdown. Still, some Fed watchers say they foresee a rate cut by the summer or after November's elections.\nOne reason for a potential future cut is that inflation remains chronically low. According to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, prices rose just 1.5 per cent\u00a0in November from a year earlier, below the central bank's 2 per cent annual target. Since the Fed adopted that target in 2012, inflation has failed to consistently reach that high, to the surprise of the Fed and most economists.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2670598941", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2669331263", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2670766367", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Laura Sciarpelletti", "title": "Pre-sale contracts abruptly terminated at Richmond, B.C., apartment building", "description": "Developer sued for $4.6\u00a0million by project's construction company, say ousted home buyers", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/richmond-presale-buyers-property-lawsuit-developer-alfa-1.5219363", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5219391.1563668548!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pre-sale-contracts-cancelled.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 20, 2019 7:43 PM PT", "2019-07-21T03:48:55.280Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A Richmond, B.C., developer has cancelled pre-sale contracts for a 15-storey residential building in the city centre.\nAnderson Square Holdings, directed by\u00a0Sunny Ho \u2014 president of the Business Association of Richmond \u2014 will provide pre-sale buyers of the Alfa building with full deposit refunds plus\u00a0interest.\n\"I'm ready to retire.

Inspt. Martin Graham conducted with Voss in April\u00a02017. The interview was the second one Voss did with Graham, who was heading up the extortion investigation.\nPreviously, Graham had\u00a0suggested that Keith and Marisa Hobbs were having financial difficulties at the time, and wanted the victim to buy Voss a house so money could be obtained by borrowing against the house, which would be obtained by the Hobbs'.\u00a0\nDuring the interview, Voss was questioned why she didn't just leave the alleged victim, whose name is subject to a publication ban. Voss, who both worked for and was romantically involved with the victim at different points, said the victim was ill, and she couldn't \"just leave [them] there to drink [their] head off\" after the victim was discharged from the hospital.\nVoss also said she didn't have anywhere to go, as she had earlier sold her house when she moved in with the alleged victim. When Graham asked Voss if she knew what she was entitled to after leaving a common-law relationship, Voss said no, nobody had told her anything about that.\nHowever, Voss continued to assert that she was being pushed by Marisa Hobbs to allow the victim to buy her a house. Marisa Hobbs told Voss, for example, a house was owed to her because of the ending of the relationship between Voss and the victim, and that Marisa Hobbs did the negotiation with the victim in terms of which house to buy.\nMarisa Hobbs and Voss\u00a0were looking at the house with a value in the range of $450,000 at this point. They viewed a home on Gemstone Drive, but it was turned down\u00a0(earlier in the trial, court heard that Voss also expressed disappointment because the house didn't have granite countertops).\nVoss also told Graham she wanted to go see the house the victim wanted to purchase, but Marisa Hobbs suggested they look at others.\nVoss was looking at other homes, as well, online; they were described to Graham as \"cheaper.\"\nThe deal was repeatedly on, then off again, as expressed by a number of texts between the parties which Graham read to Voss in the interview.\n\"If [the victim] buys me a house, it's fine,\" Voss told Graham. \"If not, it's fine.

The Hobbs' said to the OPP they would go to the police with criminal allegations if a house was purchased, or not.\nVoss, in fact, would tell Graham that she was confused as to why Keith Hobbs would draw that contract up, as he would know what extortion is given his long career as a police officer (he was with the Thunder Bay Police Service for more than 30 years).\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to make everybody else believe...\u201d Graham says to Voss.

He told court it took four searches of the BlackBerry phone owned by Keith Hobbs to get all the data the OPP needed.\nDuring cross-examination, Voss's lawyer George Joseph asked Graham about the alleged victim's status in the community.\nGraham agreed that the victim had wealth and privilege. In the relatioship between Voss and the victim, the victim held the balance of power, Graham said.\nGraham also said in his decades of policing, he had never been involved in an extortion case, nor had laid an extortion charge.\nSome scheduling matters were also discussed Tuesday, with the Crown telling the court it will close its case on Wednesday, when the defence will then be able to present its case.\nThe case itself will proceed for the remainder of the week, and closing arguments will take place Feb. 5 and 7, 2020.

There are various theories about why, going back to our evolutionary past when knowing details about a dangerous tiger contributed more to our ancestors' survival than bland reassurances.\nClearly, if bad economic times are around the corner, we want to know. The problem, of course, is that it's not that simple. As I have mentioned, whatever the fundamental causes of a weakening economy, a growing feeling of gloom can itself contribute to or even create economic weakness.\nDespite all the confidently spoken and written forecasts, no one really knows what is going to happen next. The well-known\u00a0U.S. economist Paul Samuelson once famously wrote that \"Wall Street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions,\" and it has been widely observed that economists have an even worse record.\nIn fact, a detailed reading of the Bloomberg\u00a0copy beneath the dismal headline\u00a0offers the\u00a0surprise that the majority of those at the conference being covered, unlike\u00a0the often-gloomy Rosenberg,\u00a0saw no Canadian recession in the coming year.\nAfter my own contribution to the gloomy mood last week, I thought it only fair to tally a few of the reasons why Canada may well not see the worst of any global recession.\nAfter a slow patch Canadian houses are selling again. And while they may have reconsidered for a while, there are signs that the condo builders who have filled skylines with cranes are making too much money to stop. Some have pointed to the recent slump in New York condo prices as a warning, but there are reasons why Canadian cities are different.\nOne of the differences between\u00a0Canada and many other places is that the country's welcome mat means the population, housing demand and economy continue\u00a0to grow. Many of those people come with money in their pockets, feeling Canada is a safe place to keep it. A report last week showed that one in five homes in Canada is bought by someone who arrived in the last 10 years.\nDespite some hints of a slowdown in parts of the economy, Canada keeps making jobs, and wages are rising. Trouble in the energy\u00a0sector may have bottomed out. Overall unemployment keeps hitting record lows and wages keep\u00a0rising. While a slowdown could reverse the trend, the low jobless rate\u00a0and the worker shortage in many sectors may help to bridge a weak patch.\nWhile in other countries prices are stagnant even as central banks cut rates, Canadian inflation remains well within the Bank of Canada target range. Core inflation, the rate the bank's Stephen Poloz uses as a best indicator, averaged more than two per cent. Research has shown one of the reasons inflation remains healthy is that poorer Canadians, who get a fairer share here than in other places, spend it all and stimulate the economy rather that tucking it away as savings.\nDespite the attention we often pay to the debt Canadians carry, there is another group, many with paid-off houses, deep pockets and pensions who will keep doling out that money into retirement.\nA large and growing group of well-heeled retirees who have been helped to save with government retirement programs such as RSPs and tax-free savings accounts will act as a safety net for the wider economy.\nPartly because of the taxes paid by well-employed middle-class Canadians, younger Canadians are among the best educated on the globe. That human capital is a pool of stored wealth that cannot be easily destroyed, even by company failures.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile government spending has been a background issue in the campaign for today's federal election, so far the country has a fiscal pad to help boost the economy should the global slump worsen. Compared to our southern neighbour, Canada's books are sound, and due to several revamps,\u00a0the Canada Pension Plan, while meagre, is adequately funded, most actuaries say.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Kimberley Molina", "title": "Tribunal begins hearing Vanier shelter appeal", "description": "Salvation Army facility on Montreal Road given council approval in 2017", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/salvation-army-local-planning-appeal-tribunal-1.5425270", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5187870.1561399259!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/salvation-army-vanier-shelter.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 13, 2020 4:36 PM ET", "2020-01-13T21:40:19.696Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Opponents of a\u00a0homeless shelter in Vanier are holding out hope a provincial tribunal will axe the controversial project more than two years after it received the go-ahead from Ottawa city council.\nThe city\u00a0approved the Salvation Army's proposal for a 350-bed facility at 333 Montreal Rd. in November 2017.\nOn Monday, community members packed a room at Ottawa city hall where the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT) began hearing the case. Lawyers for the Salvation Army, the City of Ottawa\u00a0and opponents presented their opening arguments.\u00a0\nMichael Polowin, the lawyer representing concerned residents and business owners, said his clients aren't opposed to the Salvation Army or the notion of a new shelter, but believe Montreal Road is the wrong place for it because\u00a0the area already struggles with crime, poverty\u00a0and mental health issues.\n\"My clients are not NIMBYs,\" Polowin told the tribunal, adding later that he plans to show the city's decision to approve the shelter flies in the face of its own policies.\n\"City policy says 'not on traditional main streets.' [This shelter]\u00a0fronts on a traditional main street. City policy says 'not in residential areas.'\u00a0Three sides of it are in a residential area. Why is this to be allowed?\" he asked.\nIn their opening arguments, lawyers for the city and Salvation Army said they'll attempt to explain\u00a0why the site was selected, and demonstrate that, despite negative publicity about the shelter, housing prices in the neighbourhood remained unaffected\u00a0and investment continues to flow into the area.\nBut Drew Dobson, who owns Finnigan's Pub, steps away from the shelter site on Montreal Road, disagreed.\n\"If you looked out your back door ... and they bulldozed your neighbours' houses and they put a shelter in, do you think that would help your property value? Or if you had a business on Montreal Road by a shelter and you wanted your customers to walk down the street and feel comfortable coming into your shop to buy your goods, do you think it would help your business?\" asked Dobson, who also\u00a0heads SOS Vanier, the group opposed to the shelter.\nThe facility was initially intended to\u00a0include a\u00a0140-bed emergency shelter, an emergency medical clinic and space for other programming aimed at vulnerable clients.\nBut last June, the Salvation Army said it was open to reconsidering the scope of the project, potentially reducing the number of emergency beds to as few as 70. The charity would also add supportive housing, but keep\u00a0its addictions treatment centre in the ByWard Market.\nThe Salvation Army said it has been listening to residents' concerns.\n\"Certainly, it is important to continue working with people, to listen to the concerns, which we are and will continue to,\" said Marc Provost, executive director of the Salvation Army Ottawa Booth Centre on George Street.\n\"It will be an ongoing dialogue, and that's the focus, is really\u00a0to listen to each other, and I think each time we meet and talk there's more understanding on both sides, and I think that's very positive.\"\nProvost said he remains \"cautiously optimistic\" and trusts the process.\u00a0\nThe hearings are expected to last three weeks, but a decision may not come\u00a0for several months.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Mary Voss 'used' by Keith and Marisa Hobbs in extortion scheme: OPP investigator", "description": "Extortion trial for former Thunder Bay mayor Keith Hobbs, wife Marisa Hobbs, and Voss continues Tuesday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/hobbs-trial-day-11-1.5382172", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4804701.1573843696!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mayor-keith-hobbs-marissa-voss-outside-court.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 03, 2019 1:18 PM ET", "2019-12-03T21:29:02.778Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Former Thunder Bay mayor Keith Hobbs and his wife Marisa Hobbs \"used\" Mary Voss in their scheme to extort another person to buy Voss a house, the OPP investigator in charge of the case said.\nVoss, along with former Thunder Bay mayor Keith Hobbs and his wife Marisa Hobbs, are each facing a charge of extortion over their alleged attempts to force another person to purchase a house for Voss.\nThe trial, which is now in its third week, continued Tuesday with court seeing the remainder of a lengthy interview OPP Det.

He told court it took four searches of the BlackBerry phone owned by Keith Hobbs to get all the data the OPP needed.\nDuring cross-examination, Voss's lawyer George Joseph asked Graham about the alleged victim's status in the community.\nGraham agreed that the victim had wealth and privilege. In the relatioship between Voss and the victim, the victim held the balance of power, Graham said.\nGraham also said in his decades of policing, he had never been involved in an extortion case, nor had laid an extortion charge.\nSome scheduling matters were also discussed Tuesday, with the Crown telling the court it will close its case on Wednesday, when the defence will then be able to present its case.\nThe case itself will proceed for the remainder of the week, and closing arguments will take place Feb. 5 and 7, 2020. A decision may take two months after that due to scheduling issues with the judge.\nCourt will resume Wednesday morning at 9:30 a.m.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1580164163707", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Paul Tukker", "title": "Extra!

He says it's been tough,\u00a0so he's proposing to give it away to someone who's prepared to live in the small, remote\u00a0town of about 1,000 people.\u00a0\nHe got the idea when the paper's Skagway-based editor recently gave notice.\u00a0\n\"I thought, well, I've got to hire a new editor but maybe the best solution is to go find someone who is going to be the owner, the editor, part of the community, and live happily ever after,\" said Persily.\u00a0\nWriting on the paper's website, Persily, 68, reflected on his own start in journalism, when he and his late wife bought the weekly\u00a0newspaper in Wrangell, Alaska, in 1976.\n\"We were young, eager to learn, settle in a community and do good work. We did not have a lot of money, but the newspaper owner and the town gave us a chance. I want to give that same opportunity to someone with The Skagway News,\" he wrote.\n\"Quality and longevity of the newspaper is the most important issue.\"\nPersily\u00a0warns, though \u2014 it's not a money-maker, by any stretch. The entire newspaper business in North America is \"financially sketchy,\" he says.\u00a0\n\"It's just hard, as people go to social media and don't want to pay for real news,\" he said.\n\"Yes, readership is declining as people of my generation die off and younger people seem to think a phone is a newspaper.\"\nThe paper traces its roots to the Klondike Gold Rush, when Skagway was a boomtown\u00a0overrun by stampeders\u00a0headed for the Yukon. Readers may have included Donald Trump's grandfather.\nThe original \"Skaguay News,\" established in 1897, chronicled\u00a0tales of desperate characters and frontier drama\u00a0\u2014 most famously, the shooting death of notorious gangster Soapy Smith, in 1898.\n\"Soapy Smith's Last Bluff Called by Frank Reid,\" reads the front page of July 15, 1898. \"Armed With a Winchester He Endeavors to Intimidate a Large Meeting of Indignant Citizens on the Third Wharf.\"\nThe paper shut down in 1904 as the Gold Rush receded into history, and\u00a0was revived in 1978. It's been\u00a0published regularly\u00a0since then.\n\"Serving the Gateway to the Klondike,\" proclaims the paper's masthead. It publishes twice monthly and a typical issue runs about a dozen or so pages.\u00a0\nThere aren't many gangsters in the headlines these days, but there is drama, and real news.\nA recent issue had\u00a0stories about a Chilkoot Trail hiker surviving a bear attack, state cuts to the town's ferry service, and the local rental housing\u00a0shortage.\u00a0\nThe business's real bread-and-butter, though, is the annual visitors guide published each summer for the hordes of\u00a0tourists disgorged daily by visiting cruise ships. Persily says 110,000 copies of the visitors guides were given away last summer.\u00a0\nTo Persily, running the paper takes passion \u2014 and a lot more.\n\"Work, skills, lack of sleep, commitment, and driving to Whitehorse every other week to pick up the paper from the printer,\"\u00a0he said.\n\"It's a lot of work running a small-town newspaper and reporting on your friends and your neighbours, and doing it fairly and honestly. But I think it can be done.\"\nHe's welcoming emails from anybody who's seriously interested in taking the paper off of his hands. There's\u00a0no deadline for applicants, but he'd like to have somebody in place by January, if possible \u2014 \"before the summer crush comes,\" he said.\nPersily can be reached at paper@alaskan.com.\n"}, {"author": "Terry Roberts", "title": "N.L. home construction at 50-year low, but sales on the rise following disastrous year", "description": "Real estate leaders hoping industry has bottomed out, and better days ahead", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/home-sales-newfoundland-1.5357548", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5357812.1573659581!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/home-for-sale-st-john-s.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 14, 2019 6:00 AM NT", "2019-11-14T09:30:00.009Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "With new home construction at a 50-year low\u00a0and residential sales on the rise after a disastrous 2018, it's not easy to figure out the Newfoundland and Labrador real estate sector these days.\nBut one thing is for certain: after years of runaway prices and a super-heated construction boom, things have seriously cooled off and\u00a0it's now a buyers' market.\nAccording to figures provided by the N.L.

rail, stronger wholesale and manufacturing shipments and a jump in small business confidence, says a report from TD Economics released Tuesday.\nIt also cites an improvement in the jobless rate and positive population growth, along with more upbeat trends in Alberta's stalled retail sales and housing sectors.\n\"All in all, recent encouraging data have added credence to the view that economic growth in Alberta is gaining some traction,\" the TD report says.\n\"While a continuation in this momentum would set the stage for a forecast upgrade, we remain cautious for now.\"\nIn its quarterly provincial forecast in June, the bank suggested the province's economy would grow by a \"paltry\" 0.5 per cent this year and a slightly better 2.1 per cent next year.\nIt said the province's mandated oil production curtailments that started in January had succeeded in strengthening heavy oil prices in early 2019 but business and household spending remained hampered by concerns around medium-term energy investment.\nSimilarly, ATB Financial cut its 2019 growth expectations to 0.7 per cent in March from an earlier forecast of about 1.4 per cent, said Rob Roach, director of insight for the Alberta government-owned lender.\n\"It's a bit of a mixed bag,\" he said on Tuesday, citing statistics including Alberta's recovery to a 6.6 per cent jobless rate in June from 7.3 per cent in

It sits at 1.75 per cent.\n\"Canada's economy is operating close to potential and inflation is on target,\" the bank said. \"However, escalating trade conflicts and related uncertainty are taking a toll on the global and Canadian economies.\"\nIn short, the bank\u00a0will adjust if necessary,\u00a0cutting its rate if it feels it needs to to stimulate the economy\u00a0and\u00a0raising it in order to tame inflation.\nEconomists and other market watchers are split on whether a rate cut is coming this fall.\nThe last time there was a rate change was in October 2018, when it was increased by 0.25 per cent.\nAccording to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the housing market is actually doing a little better today than it had been for the past two years or so.\nThe CMHC says there's little evidence of widespread overheating, price acceleration\u00a0or overbuilding. But there's enough overvaluation to warrant a yellow flag, indicating a \"moderate\" level of vulnerability.\nAs usual, there are a few regions that raise some concern. Regina was given a red warning for overbuilding, while Victoria, Hamilton and Toronto's markets were given a\u00a0red \u2014\u00a0or \"high\"\u00a0\u2014 overall.\nAccording to a study released in July,\u00a0the answer is overwhelmingly no. The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) used data from Statistics Canada and the CMHC\u00a0to evaluate\u00a0almost 800 neighbourhoods across Canada's three dozen largest cities.\nIt concluded that a minimum wage earner could afford a one- or two-bedroom apartment in just 24 neighbourhoods across the country, out of 795 analyzed.\nIt will come as no surprise to hear that it is most expensive to rent in the biggest cities:\u00a0Toronto and Vancouver.\u00a0\nThe CCPA study found only three cities where the local minimum wage would be enough to comfortably afford a one- or two-bedroom apartment and have enough left over for other expenses (about two-thirds of earnings), if working 40 hours a week.\nAll are in Quebec: Sherbrooke, Saguenay and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.\nThis recent episode from Marketplace looks into the vast discrepancy in food prices in Iqaluit versus in Winnipeg to try to discern why it costs so much more to buy groceries in the North.\nBut it's just not only Canadians living in the North who are feeling the pinch.\nAfter the release of the new Canada Food Guide earlier this year, Angus Reid polled Canadians about whether they would be able to eat the way the guide recommended. Four in 10\u00a0respondents called the recommendations \"unrealistic.\"\n"}, {"author": "Steve Silva", "title": "Yellowknife Women's Society renovating part of office into daycare", "description": "One of the organization's daycares is temporarily being operated out of a church", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-womens-society-daycare-1.5156795", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5156803.1559261096!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/yellowknife-women-s-society-office.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 31, 2019 5:00 AM CT", "2019-05-31T11:00:00.023Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A Yellowknife charitable organization is renovating part of its office to accommodate a daycare space.\n\"This is us expanding our programming to fill a gap,\" explained Yellowknife Women's Society (YWS) board member Shauna Morgan on Thursday.\nThe gap opened last November, when Kids Corner Childcare shut down.\nIn response, the women's society\u00a0opened a daycare in a church to provide care to the kids impacted.

More than\u00a08,900 tenant households require improvement to meet one or more of\u00a0affordability, adequacy, or suitability standards.\nAffordable housing is a real problem in our city, and this is only exacerbated when one is\u00a0a new immigrant. A lack of understanding of the real estate market,\u00a0whether renting or buying,\u00a0the loss of a social network, language barriers and employment challenges make the search for\u00a0affordable housing akin to running on a never-stopping treadmill.\nRegardless of the economic\u00a0status, the path to affordable housing is fraught with obstacles for a new immigrant in their first\u00a0year in Canada.\n\"The main concerns are that they are required to establish Canadian credit which often is\u00a0not an instant item to secure,\" said mortgage professional, Cheryl Stoyles-Sellars of Verico Premiere Mortgage Centre.\n\"This is typically arranged with the financial institution that they\u00a0initially open a Canadian bank account with. There is often a need to do a secured credit product\u00a0to establish the credit item.\"\nFor some immigrants this is an easy task, but for others who may lack the financial\u00a0means, a secured credit product\u00a0can't be acquired easily.\nIn the\u00a0first year, for example, new immigrants don't have room to contribute to an RRSP, as there\u00a0typically is not\u00a0any Canadian source of income to report from the previous year. These\u00a0impediments make\u00a0renting seem like the only viable option for housing \u2014\u00a0propelling new immigrants toward tenancy,\u00a0at least when they first arrive.\nEchoing these thoughts, Realtor Amanda Arsenault of Hanlon Realty said, \"Financing\u00a0has to be the biggest barrier [for new immigrants]. The Canadian government and the provincial\u00a0government need to realize this because immigrants are a huge part of Canada's today, tomorrow\u00a0and future.\"\nStephenville's Brook Street \u00a0is now home to a\u00a0new subdivision of 600-square-feet homes that are complete with appliances, a solid foundation,\u00a0a backyard and sodded lawn \u2014\u00a0and all only for $90,000 \u2014\u00a0busting the stereotypical\u00a0image of a\u00a0house on wheels.\nSome might assume that these homes are simply a fad, but,\u00a0with an average\u00a0home costing over a quarter of million dollars, they may be a sustainable solution to the lack of\u00a0affordable housing for several demographics, including first-time immigrant renters, like\u00a0international students, who often end up living in dark and dank basements to conserve their finances.\nChris Janes, senior market analyst with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, says\u00a0tiny homes work.\n\"For anybody looking for space that is economical, innovative\u00a0and comfortable\u00a0[and] relatively close to urban amenities. I think it can be successful for particularly\u00a0first-time buyers, immigrants, millennials and retirees,\" said Janes.\u00a0\nHe indicated that owing to the changing\u00a0household composition, tiny homes were an emerging lifestyle.\nNot only a solution for affordable housing, Winnie Lei, a ReMax realty specialist with\u00a0St. John's Life, said tiny homes could be the answer to downtown\u00a0parking woes.\n\"It might be a good fit for torn-down properties downtown where the\u00a0extra square footages can be used for off-street parking,\" said Lei.\nRecent developments in the City of St. John's regulation now include tiny homes as an\u00a0in-fill in certain\u00a0residential zones, as well as a new zone for pocket neighbourhoods of tiny\u00a0homes.  But not everyone is sold on the idea of a tiny home. The size, lack of information around\u00a0appropriate city bylaws regarding this housing model and finding appropriate financing are\u00a0some reasons why tiny homes haven't taken off (yet) in St. John's.\n\"It has proven very difficult for clients to obtain mortgage financing on tiny homes. The\u00a0lenders would consider them to be in the same category as mobile homes or mini homes,\" said\u00a0Stoyles-Sellars.\nDespite this, its economical, low-carbon footprint qualities, the low energy and\u00a0maintenance costs, and its price\u00a0make this model attractive to many \u2014 including developers, first-time home\u00a0buyers and, subsequently, renters.\nFor new immigrants who are limited financially in their ability\u00a0to buy or rent when they first arrive and, sadly, end up in inadequate and unsuitable homes (such\u00a0as dark and dank basement apartments), this provides a new housing option.\nA home is more than four walls and a roof. It is a fundamental human right.\u00a0And tiny homes are a potential\u00a0solution to the affordable housing predicament not only for first-time home buyers but also renters.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Colin Butler", "title": "Tenant blamed, threatened over landlord's inability to rent vacant illegal bedroom", "description": "Centurion Property Associates owns apartments in Ontario, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan and Alberta", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-apartment-rental-centurion-properties-1.5309384", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309623.1570227438!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jeremy-roberts.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 07, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-07T09:00:00.829Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A tenant\u00a0of a troubled downtown\u00a0London highrise said\u00a0he and others were blamed and threatened by their\u00a0landlord after\u00a0no one wanted to rent a vacant\u00a0illegal bedroom inside their apartment unit.\u00a0\nJeremy Roberts said he was told he would have to\u00a0pay for the landlord's lost income even though the bedroom in question was considered unfit for human habitation under provincial law.\u00a0\nRoberts is a Western University student who rents a one-bedroom apartment at 75 Ann Street, a downtown London highrise known as The Marq.\nThe retrofitted apartment building is\u00a0marketed toward post-secondary students\u00a0by Centurion Property Associates, a multi-million dollar company that owns dozens of rental buildings across\u00a0Ontario, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan and Alberta.\u00a0\nThe company is currently the subject of a property standards investigation by the City of London after complaints surfaced it was renting illegal windowless apartments for hundreds of dollars a month inside its\u00a075 Ann Street highrise.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLondon landlord under investigation for renting 'windowless, closetless box' to student\nWindowless bedrooms are illegal in Ontario and are not considered fit for human habitation due to a lack of proper ventilation and natural light.\nThe units\u00a0at 75 Ann Street appear to be a retrofitted to allow\u00a0up to four tenants to share a\u00a0living room, kitchen, two bathrooms and a storage space in what was once a larger unit with only two bedrooms.\u00a0\nTenants open their individual bedrooms\u00a0with their respective fob keys, which also give them access to the main door of the building and the unit's shared spaces.\u00a0\nRoberts said he pays $635 a month for a bedroom with a window and that his landlord has been trying to rent a vacant, windowless bedroom inside his unit since August.\u00a0\nHe said after a number of unsuccessful showings by the landlord, he and the other tenants were blamed for no-one wanting to rent the windowless bedroom and were threatened with having to pay for the landlord's lost income.\u00a0\n\"They're frustrated they can't rent it out,\" Roberts said, noting at least three prospective tenants have tried living in the unventilated space since he moved there in May of 2018.\nAccording to an August 29 email obtained by CBC News, Christopher Maclean, the property administrator at 75 Ann Street, complained that prospective tenants had\u00a0\"expressed concerns about the condition of the unit.\"\u00a0\n\"Please make the necessary efforts to ensure your unit remains in a habitable condition.

They're basically selling water in a desert.\"\nHale said successive Ontario governments have done little keep\u00a0builders,\u00a0developers and landlords in check, allowing them far too much leeway and\u00a0power when it comes to determining the price and availability of housing in Ontario.\u00a0\n\"We let the private market dictate what housing is going to be built and what it's going to cost,\" he said.\u00a0\"We have a shortage of housing because of the kind of housing policy we've pursued.\"\nHale called Roberts' treatment by Centurion a form of harassment and said people who rent\u00a0deserve to live in accommodations that meet minimum provincial standards, such as windows in bedrooms.\u00a0\n\"They also deserve a little bit of\u00a0respect\u00a0and proper treatment from the people who are running it and I think the higher up corporate types need to take some responsibility.\"\nHale said student\u00a0tenants can seek free legal advice from Community Legal Services at Western University. They can also file an official complaint about a landlord with the\u00a0Ontario Ministry of Housing.\nStill, Hale concedes that it is a David and Goliath battle for students to take on a multi-million dollar corporation such as Centurion Property Associates.\u00a0\n\"I would hope that having some of these practices exposed in public would have some pressure to have the companies change their behaviour, but I'm not really confident that's enough to do it.\"\nHale said what's needed is the Ontario government stepping in and creating policy that favours tenants instead large corporate landlords.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Kamila Hinkson", "title": "Big spending increases and a modest residential property tax hike in Montreal's 2020 budget", "description": "Opposition accuses mayor of driving up debt, leaving city vulnerable if interest rates go up", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-valerie-plante-budget-main-2020-1.5369502", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5372607.1574709823!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/valerie-plante-and-benoit-dorais.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 25, 2019 7:00 AM ET", "2019-11-26T00:22:54.167Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante's administration will balance city spending next year between\u00a0its own priorities \u2014 such as housing, green initiatives and\u00a0mobility\u00a0\u2014 and the perennial need for\u00a0repairs to Montreal's water and road network.\nThe city unveiled Monday\u00a0its proposed operating and capital works budgets for 2020, and there are plans to spend big.\nThe operating budget will be $6.17 billion, an 8.1 per cent increase ($462.9 million) compared to last year and the biggest spending increase in the three years Plante has been in office.\nThe city says the spending hike is partly explained by an effort to pay for infrastructure projects up front, instead of borrowing.\nAbout $150 million of the $190 million earmarked for those projects came from the Quebec government.\nWithout that money, and another $63.2 million from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'habitation du Qu\u00e9bec and the Communaut\u00e9 m\u00e9tropolitaine de Montr\u00e9al\u00a0to help pay for social housing, the city said the spending increase would only be about $210 million, or\u00a03.7 per cent.\nThe city is highlighting its investments in\u00a0mobility, housing, the ecological transition, green space and parks and economic development.\n\"Together, they show a clear vision, with a sound and responsible and management of the city's financial resources,\" Plante said.\nThose investments include:\nLike last year, the biggest chunks of money from the operating budget will be spent on public security and servicing the debt, with\u00a0about $1 billion going toward each expense.\nAlmost half a billion dollars ($497 million) will be spent on water infrastructure in 2020 alone, which includes a program to help accelerate the replacement of lead service entry pipes.\nThe budget is designed to improve people's lives, Plante said, pointing to measures such as the addition of 30 new jobs at 311, the city's public information service.\nThere will also be increased funding for the city's mobility squad, tasked with quickly intervening to solve traffic problems in a city beset by construction.\nThe orange cones aren't going anywhere any time soon.

But it's well worth it,\" Neufeld said.\nA crowd cheered\u00a0as volunteers lined up along the edge of a wooden frame\u00a0worked together to heave\u00a0up the first standing wall\u00a0of the\u00a0new house under construction for a Syrian family who requested to live in the North End.\nSandy Hopkins, the chief executive officer\u00a0of Habitat for Humanity\u00a0in Manitoba, said the cycling trip has contributed to building a house or more ever year since 1994. Dozens of volunteers work together\u00a0under red seal carpenters and trades partners who will install plumbing and electrical.\n\"We're deeply indebted to those people for volunteering so much of their time, energy and effort to help a family to a better life,\" Hopkins said about the cyclists, support crew and volunteer construction workers it will take to\u00a0eventually put a roof up on the soon-to-be home.\nIn order to be eligible for the program, Habitat\u00a0requires families who need housing to have a child under 10-years- old and one\u00a0adult in the family who\u00a0works full-time in the community.\nThe family must also meet\u00a0provincial requirements for housing subsidies. Once approved, a professional\u00a0appraiser will put\u00a0a price on the home before the family\u00a0effectively buys it.\nWhat makes it affordable is that there's no down payment or interest on the mortgage for the first 15 years, and\u00a0payments are geared to what the family can afford to pay as opposed to being based on the value of the house.\nThe home funded by this year's cycle series is expected to be ready for the family to move in in about four months.\nMore from CBC Manitoba:\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "Thinking of buying a condo in 2020?

He has $120,000 for a down payment and is pre-approved for a $390,000 mortgage.\nBut just because a lender pre-approved Eric for a $390,000 mortgage doesn't mean he can afford it.\nWhen determining a budget, I work backwards. I use a spreadsheet to calculate all my expenses (housing and otherwise), include a buffer \u2014 as I know certain costs will rise faster than my income \u2014 and then let the spreadsheet tell me know much I can afford.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen Eric used my spreadsheet, it validated his housing budget of $500,000 so I told him to start house hunting.\u00a0As he is a serious buyer, there's no harm in looking at what is currently available but, at the same time, he shouldn't feel pressured to rush out and buy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nUnfortunately for him, one-bedroom condos are in high demand. It is a seller's market and there isn't much inventory.\u00a0 This could change in the spring as prices are trending higher and these higher price points should entice more sellers to list their properties.\u00a0\nWhether Eric should buy now or wait depends on what he finds.\u00a0If he finds a condo he likes, and the spreadsheet\u00a0confirms he can afford it, he should make an aggressive offer.\u00a0\nAn area that condo buyers need to pay close attention to is the building's strata insurance.\nFor most strata buildings,\u00a0insurance premiums and deductibles have jumped significantly over the past year.\u00a0Many strata councils have had to increase strata fees by 20 to 30 per cent to offset the hike in premiums.\u00a0\nCondo homeowner insurance, which is a separate insurance used to cover your personal property or to pay for the strata's deductible, is also going up.\nHomeowner insurance would kick in, for example, if your bathtub overflowed\u00a0and the water\u00a0damaged the 10 units below you. If this were to happen and the condo owner didn't have extra insurance, he/she would have to pay the strata's deductible personally.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere is a building in Yaletown\u00a0that\u00a0has a deductible of $600,000. If a bathtub overflowed in this building and caused $550,000 worth of damage, the strata wouldn't make an insurance claim to fix the damage. They would instead expect the condo owner to foot the $550,000 bill.\u00a0While a $600,000 deductible\u00a0is extreme, the new normal for condo towers is\u00a0a deductible between $80 and\u00a0$130,000.\nMy strata unit's deductible went from $5,000 to $25,000, but I consider myself lucky.\u00a0I own a townhouse where no one lives above or below me so if my bathtub overflows, it only affects my unit.\u00a0\nPremiums are risk-based, which is why my strata's insurance premium increases weren't nearly as severe as those of a 50-floor downtown apartment building.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMore than ever, buyers need to consider the insurance premiums and deductibles when choosing their new home.\u00a0\nMost buyers know it's wise to complete a building inspection and read the strata council minutes when performing due diligence.\u00a0However, before moving forward with a purchase, I would also insist on seeing the strata insurance certificate, check the renewal date and speak to an insurance broker about qualifying for adequate condo insurance.\u00a0\nWhen Eric was going through his affordability spreadsheet, I recommended that he increase his strata allotment by 50 per cent and double his allotment for homeowner insurance.\u00a0\nI also suggested that if there were two buildings that he liked, and one had a significantly higher deductible attached to it,\u00a0I would favour the building with the lower deductible, even if it was slightly more expensive. \u00a0\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

But the escalation of the trade war between the U.S. and China presents new risks.\n\"The U.S.-China trade war can only be beneficial to Canada if it doesn't escalate beyond a certain point,\" said Rangasamy in a note.\n\"Such a large exposure to one trade partner (i.e. the U.S.) makes Canadian exporters more vulnerable to U.S. economic cycles \u2026The resulting hit to commodity prices and negative spillovers on the U.S. economy, won't be good for Canada.\"\nCanada's economy grew at annualized pace of\u00a00.4 per cent in the first three months\u00a0of this year \u2014\u00a0falling below expectations, and just slightly above the 0.3 per cent growth in the previous quarter. They were the country's weakest back-to-back quarters of growth since 2015.\nExport volumes dropped one per cent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0marking for their first quarterly decrease since 2017.\nMeanwhile, other Canadian banks are also keeping a close eye on developments on the global trade front as they review their forecasts.\nDoug\u00a0Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the bank's growth forecast for Canada is already at the lower end of market consensus at 1.4 per cent, but if U.S. tariffs on Mexico are imposed next week, they are set to \"retool\" the entire forecast.\nBrian DePratto, senior economist at TD Economics, said the bank was in the middle of reviewing its growth forecasts, and will publish the outlook next week.\n\"While I can't say too much about specific numbers this early in the process, certainly developments of late suggest the risks tilt towards less growth than might have otherwise been the case,\" said DePratto.\nMeanwhile, Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, also\u00a0said the bank was reviewing its North American forecasts as global risks like the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit moved closer to materializing in May.\n\"For a small open economy like Canada, these situations could be significant either via direct trading links, or indirectly through financial markets and confidence,\" said Mendes.\u00a0\"The increased uncertainty regarding these global risks likely more than offsets any positives from the removal of U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.\"\nHowever, he added that the latest economic data doesn't look \"particularly weak\" with growth likely to rebound in the second quarter from the weak start to the year.\n\"At this point, central bankers are satisfied staying on the sidelines.

She pointed out that the Northwest Territories Association of Communities recently\u00a0passed a motion in favour of an alcohol strategy.\n\"It feels like the next step in the progression toward addressing the root cause of many expensive and troubling issues that face the N.W.T.,\" she said.\nGreen said doing the work jointly might also help establish a sense of the nuances in communities with and without alcohol bans.\n\"What's it like in a community that doesn't have liquor stores as well as what's it like in Yellowknife where we have two liquor stores?\" she said,\u00a0adding she doesn't think there should be a \"one size fits all approach.\"\n\"I think we need to come up with this engagement where people will tell us what they think and to be open to the idea that we may need different approaches in different places.\"\nThe results of the preliminary research paper will be presented in a\u00a0full-day workshop Thursday in Dettah.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/labradormorning/2010/10/one-man-dead-in-nain-house-fire.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Christine Rankin", "title": "Hamilton 100 proposes new sports complexes and big upgrades in bid for 2030 Commonwealth Games", "description": "Hamilton hosted the first version of the games in 1930", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/commonwealth-games-proposal-hamilton-1.5347274", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2726728.1407104383!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/commonwealth-games-closing-ceremony.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 04, 2019 5:33 PM ET", "2019-11-04T22:33:02.860Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The community group\u00a0hoping to bring the 2030 Commonwealth Games to Hamilton\u00a0is proposing the construction of three new multi-sport complexes, affordable housing, and upgrades to facilities across the city\u00a0as part of its\u00a0pitch to get the games.\nThe proposal by Hamilton 100, a group advocating for the city to play host,\u00a0will go before city council's general issues committee on Wednesday.

The loft-style units would feature rooms about the size of two standard parking spaces, as well as electric cars to be shared among occupants.\n\"There's now an option to be in a more central location at a fraction of the cost and not have that burden of running a vehicle and starting at 40 below,\" said Guy. \"They sound on the small side, but like boat design, there's not a cubic inch that's wasted.\"\nThe proposal marks the arrival in Yellowknife of a type of housing that is popular in big cities like Toronto and Vancouver with millennials who value affordability, proximity to amenities\u00a0and environmentally-friendly lifestyles.\nThe 320-square-foot, loft-style condos will be fully-furnished and will include kitchenettes, granite countertops, laundry facilities and an open concept living-dining area.\u00a0\nGuy submitted a development application to the city in early June and hopes to begin construction before the end of the summer.\u00a0\nHe said the price of one unit will be around $200,000.\nGuy said he based the plans for the development on the principles of \"new urbanism,\" an urban design philosophy that promotes denser neighbourhoods, building housing close to shopping, repurposing abandoned areas, and strong public transportation systems.\nThe building will be the first to take advantage of the so-called \"car-share\" provisions of the city's zoning bylaw, which allows developers to reduce the required number of parking spaces per unit if they provide at least one shared car for every eight units.\u00a0\nWithout providing the two electric vehicles, Guy would be required to build a total of 12 parking spaces and wouldn't be able to fit both the building and the parking spaces without buying an adjacent lot.\u00a0\nInstead, the condo corporation will own the two vehicles and occupants will determine the process for sharing them.\nHousing options like this will help to revitalize the city's downtown core by attracting people to affordable, eco-friendly housing, according to Guy.\u00a0\n\"What we're really looking at is making and giving downtown back to people rather than cars,\" said Guy. \"People are good for business and if you can have affordable housing you will have more people and I think it's a win-win for the whole community.\"\nLen Catling, a spokesperson for the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), said tiny homes like the ones proposed by Guy have popped up in cities across Canada as housing markets heat up and people search for more affordable options.\u00a0\n\"It's been very prevalent in urban centres across Canada, and Yellowknife is no different,\" Catling said. \"Developers are looking to build denser, more affordable options and demand is showing that those units are accessible to young people moving into the housing market.\"\nCatling said a\u00a02018 CMHC report on the northern housing market found demand for condos across the region is growing stronger, driven by their affordability and\u00a0shorter construction time.\nMarie Coe, a Yellowknife real estate agent with Coldwell Banker, said one of the keys to selling a unit like this would be keeping the condo fees down.\u00a0\n\"[Fees are]\u00a0a sore spot but people still like to have those apartments-style condos where they're what we call, 'worry free,'\" said Coe.\n\"You don't have to worry about snow removal, you don't have to worry about how the heating works, or anything, you just go into the place and open your door and that's it.\"\nGuy, the developer, said he hopes relying on the city's electrical grid for utilities including heating and the low maintenance cost for electric vehicles will keep condo fees low.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url":

I'm not talking about Ottawa-obsessed political wonks and media types who are required to pore over the fine print, but real Canadians who aren't obliged to watch Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau twirl around in a canoe, or Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer blandly state his indignation.\nBoth camps, at various stages over the past couple of weeks, have lamented that there hasn't been enough focus on policy so far this campaign. This is a complaint typically hauled out when your guy isn't looking too great for whatever reason \u2014 like when Scheer\u00a0appeared\u00a0with an anti-abortion-activist-turned-candidate right at the start of the campaign, or when Trudeau told Canadians he couldn't recall exactly how many times in the past he wore blackface.\nWhy isn't anyone talking about the issues?\u00a0they whine\u00a0to an electorate that now can't get the\u00a0Banana Boat Song\u00a0out of their heads.\u00a0Let's talk about things that matter.\nIn reality, neither party genuinely wants to talk about policy, because policy isn't going to win this election. How can it? Both parties are essentially offering the same things, with a few small differences largely imperceptible to the casual observer who probably has far better things to do than obsess over the details.\nFor example, both the Conservatives and Liberals have interpreted \"affordable housing\" to essentially mean \"accessible home-buying,\" and thus, have offered incentives to help Canadians get into the housing market. (The NDP's\u00a0plan, to its credit, is actually about helping families find affordable places to live, not buy, though the party hasn't said\u00a0precisely how it will pay for it.)\nThe Liberals' plan is to offer buyers money up front in exchange for a chunk of the equity; the Conservatives' is to loosen stress test requirements and extend the maximum length of a mortgage. Yet neither plan\u00a0is actually geared toward relieving the pressure in hot housing markets like Toronto and Vancouver, and both, by further incentivizing buying, could very well make it more expensive to find a place to live.\u00a0\nSo both parties are promising more money in our pockets through tax cuts: the Conservatives by cutting the rate on taxable income under $47,630 from 15 to 13.75 per cent, and the Liberals, by raising the basic personal income tax deduction\u00a0from $12,069\u00a0to $15,000 for those earning less than $147,000. The Liberal plan will do more to lift low-income Canadians out of poverty, according to analysis by B.C. economist Kevin Milligan, but for median-income households, the\u00a0impact\u00a0will be roughly the same.\nBoth Scheer and Trudeau have announced\u00a0incentives\u00a0to retrofit your home through either an interest-free loan (Liberals) or refundable tax credits (Conservatives). On climate, the Liberals will keep a carbon tax that is\u00a0too low\u00a0to change consumer behaviour, and the Conservatives will implement what is essentially a carbon price on heavy emitters, without setting clear reduction targets.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nBoth promise to tackle gun violence. Neither will balance the budget in the next four years. Both have promised to make maternity and paternity leave\u00a0tax-free. Neither will touch supply management or government bailouts of big business.\u00a0\nAnd on the one major policy difference that could actually drive a policy wedge between voters \u2014 pharmacare \u2014 the Liberals, who\u00a0came out guns blazing on the file before the campaign (notably, during the\u00a0height\u00a0of the SNC-Lavalin saga), have been\u00a0conspicuously reserved.\u00a0\nBeyond that, the Liberal and Conservative platforms are virtually interchangeable; they hardly lay out the framework for dramatically different Canadas. Your choice is between tax cuts or tax cuts, a weak or weaker climate plan, interest-free loans or tax credits, and maybe drug coverage, depending on the details, if this promise doesn't go the way of\u00a0electoral reform.\u00a0\nThat's why so much of the war room-generated focus is on the leaders themselves: Justin Trudeau as two-faced and unethical, and Andrew Scheer as the right-wing lovechild of Doug Ford and Stephen Harper.\nIndeed,\u00a0success for the Liberals will mean convincing voters that Scheer will implement harsh austerity measures, new abortion regulations and that Canada is one bad prime minister away from a U.S.-style\u00a0gun crisis.\nFor the Conservatives, it will mean persuading voters that Trudeau is lawless and privileged, and that he will bankrupt Canada with his excessive spending. It has nothing to do with policy, and everything to do with personality.\nIt's a crummy way to decide an election, but perhaps the only way when the biggest difference between the platforms is their colours.\u00a0\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Well I'm for Barack. I think Obamacare worked,\" Biden said, asking Warren and Sanders to explain how they would pay for their plans. \"This is about candour, honesty, big ideas.\"\nWarren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts who has moved into second behind Biden in many opinion polls of the Democratic race, praised Obama's health-care efforts but said more was needed.\n\"Now the question is how best can we improve on it,\" she said, adding that under Medicare for All, those at the top in terms of wealth would pay more but the middle class would pay less.\nSanders, who sponsored the Medicare for All plan in the U.S. Senate, said the program based on the existing government-run Medicare program for Americans 65 and older was the most cost-effective approach. Some analysts have estimated his plan would cost $32 trillion US over a decade.\nBiden said his plan would give Americans more options, including staying with their plans if they like them.\n\"I've\u00a0never actually met anybody who likes their health insurance company,\" Warren fired back.\nFormer U.S. Housing Secretary Julian Castro accused Biden of flip-flopping in his description of his own plan.\n\"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\" Castro, 44, asked Biden, 76, who is known for being prone to gaffes and has faced questions about his age.\nWhen Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., noted the exchange was what people did not like about politicians, Castro shot back: \"That's called an election.\"\nU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also tried to calm things down, noting: \"A house divided cannot stand,\" quoting from a famous speech by Abraham Lincoln.\nThe candidates made an effort to praise the legacy of Obama, after facing criticism from some Democrats after the last debate for attacking his policies on health care and immigration.\nBut Castro, who has lagged badly in opinion polls, accused Biden of being quick to tie himself to Obama when it suited him and walk away when it did not.\n\"He wants to take credit for Obama's work but not have to answer any questions,\" said Castro, who served in Obama's administration.\nThe debate was narrowed to one night and 10 candidates after the party toughened the requirements for qualifying. The previous two Democratic debates in June and July were split over two nights.\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang, who has spent much of the campaign touting a plan for a universal basic income,\u00a0opened the debate by promising to\u00a0give $1,000 a month to 10 Americans for the next year, calling\u00a0it a \"freedom dividend.\" The offer drew laughs from a few other\u00a0contenders.\u00a0\n\"It's original, I'll give you that,\" Buttigieg said.\nThe first two rounds of debates also were contentious, as Biden came under repeated attacks for his record on race and criminal justice reform and his views on health care.\nBut this time, the candidates tried to emphasize their areas of agreement. Biden praised former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke for his work after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas,\u00a0drawing a sustained ovation from the debate crowd.\nThe sharp bickering during the first two rounds of the debates dismayed some Democrats, who have urged the candidates to rein in their attacks and focus on laying out their own affirmative agendas.\nO'Rourke, who has called for gun licensing and a mandatory gun buyback for assault weapons, was asked if he was going to take away people's guns.\n\"I am if it was a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield,\" he said. \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\"\n"}, {"author": "Laura Kane", "title": "B.C. posts $1.5B operating surplus as tax revenue increases and real estate market cools", "description": "Province eliminates operating debt for 1st time in 4 decades", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-finances-operating-surplus-1.5217333", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5023999.1550534192!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/carole-james.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 18, 2019 4:32 PM PT", "2019-07-19T00:41:42.480Z"], "source": null, "content": "The British Columbia government ended its fiscal year with an operating surplus of $1.5 billion\u00a0as the province collected more revenue from taxation and less money from a softening real estate market.\nThe 2018-19 public accounts released Thursday by Finance Minister Carole James show that the surplus was some $1.3 billion higher than anticipated, driven by $2.9 billion in increased revenue primarily from personal and corporate income taxes.\nJames said she was not concerned about a $315-million reduction in property transfer tax revenue.

The\u00a0upper floors house a penthouse rental suite\u00a0and additional office space.\u00a0\n\"It's a very iconic building for downtown Lacombe,\" said Jennifer Kirchner, president of the historical society.\n\"It's the type of building that wasn't built very frequently and there aren't a lot of them left. It's really a gem.\"\u00a0\nLacombe has one of the best preserved Edwardian-style streetscapes in Canada, Kirchner said. Several buildings constructed in the early 1900s have manged to survive.\nThe Flatiron Building and the city's historic downtown\u00a0have made appearances in\u00a0films, television shows and photo shoots over the years.\n\"It really dominates 50th Avenue,\" Kirchner said of the building. \"It's such a unique architectural shape that just stands out in Lacombe, but also on a larger scale.\"\u00a0\nSociety volunteers fear they will be evicted from the building once the property comes under new ownership, Kirchner said. There is no guarantee the new owners will be interested in housing the non-profit, she said.\u00a0\n\"It's been a really great space for the public to be able to access and I think it would be a little sad if it changed into a use that was more private,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"We're sad that the history of the current owner is coming to an end but hopefully whoever buys the building next has the same love for it.\"\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "West Fraser Timber sawmills cutting production by up to 25% in B.C.", "description": "Schedules at 5 mills in B.C. will vary depending on market conditions, company says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/west-fraser-timber-sawmills-bc-cuts-1.5277406", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3756220.1473462053!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/west-fraser-20100426.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 10, 2019 8:10 AM PT", "2019-09-10T15:10:12.972Z"], "source": null, "content": "West\u00a0Fraser\u00a0Timber Co.

Here are some of their\u00a0stories:\nFor six months, Frenchie (he says that's what his friends call him) has slept in a tent under a bridge in Toronto \u2014\u00a0a few blocks from some of the most expensive houses in the country.\u00a0\u00a0\nFrenchie says he lost his restaurant job and had some bad luck, and after that things went downhill.\u00a0\n\"It's a difficult life, but we survive. Every day we survive,\" he says.\nThere are about 15 other people living in the makeshift camp under the bridge, a small community where he says he's treated well. Above ground, on the street, he says people judge him.\n\"I just want to say to people, we are not that bad,\" he says. \"We have a different life, but we are still human \u2014 we are not alien, we are still people.\"\nIt's hard to know exactly how many Canadians sleep outside on a given night, but the best estimate is around 35,000 individuals.\nFrenchie says he doesn't worry that much about winter \u2014 he has plenty of tarps and blankets, and sometimes he lights a small fire in his tent to keep warm.\u00a0\nHear more from Frenchie:\nAt 43, Paul has been homeless for six years \u2014\u00a0ever since he lost his job framing houses in Toronto.\n\"I had a work injury and I also suffer from depression,\" he explains.\u00a0\nWhat's remarkable about Paul is that if you passed him on the street, you probably wouldn't realize he's homeless. He doesn't fit the stereotypical image of an entrenched homeless person many people imagine when they read statistics about the problem in Canada.\u00a0\nLike the one that says 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness in any given year.\n\"It's not just the bums you see on the streets \u2014\u00a0we're everywhere now,\" Paul says.\u00a0\n\"The vast majority don't look like they're homeless. It's people who have fallen on hard times, got divorced, lost their jobs, got a work injury,\" he says.\u00a0\nPaul says he's lucky to have a bed at one of the city's shelters\u00a0while he's on a waiting list for subsidized housing.\u00a0\nA list that is 11 years long.\n\"We're a rich country, there's no reason for this to be happening,\" he says.\nPaul says not having a place to call his own takes a tremendous toll on his mind.\u00a0\n\"You have no hopes and dreams left anymore. You have no nothing,\" he says. \"People think you are nothing, and so you end up thinking you are nothing.\n\"You just eventually end up fading, fading away slowly.\"\u00a0\nHear more from Paul:\nKevin Durance has become an unlikely activist.\u00a0\nHe fidgets on stage as he addresses a protest in front of Toronto city hall.\u00a0\n\"I know how hard I have to work just to survive,\" he tells the crowd.\u00a0\nDurance has lived in a Toronto homeless shelter for the past six years. He knows how bad the situation is on the street, and he wants the city to declare a state of emergency and open more beds to the homeless.\u00a0\n\"It boils down to real humanity,\" he says. \"We've got to start caring about people.\"\nActivists insist high rent prices in Toronto make it hard for people who earn minimum wage or collect social assistance to afford a place to live.\u00a0\nThe number of people sleeping in shelters in Toronto has doubled in the past five years and now hovers somewhere around 8,000.\nStill, Kevin's wish is a small one \u2014\u00a0for people to see him and not look away when they pass him on the street.\u00a0\n\"They don't see me, they see that stigma.

We've changed how we talk about gender, global politics, drugs and what it means to be a Canadian.\nHere's how the discourse has evolved around several topics that define this country and the people who live here:\nIn 2011 a Toronto couple sparked a frenzy when they decided not to reveal the sex of their baby, Storm.\n\"The level of vitriol was outstanding,\" said May Friedman, a professor specializing in gender identity at Ryerson University, noting people lashed out in person and online at the couple.\nOver the last five years, that concept slowly started becoming more acceptable.\n\"I still wouldn't say it's a common move, but in downtown urban centres it's not completely outlandish like it was perceived as being in 2011, which was really not a long time ago.\"\nFriedman said there was a clear tipping point in the middle of the decade where trans and gender fluid people were visible enough in media and where being trans, and lessening the importance of gender norms to your children, stopped being considered a radical idea.\nToday, people put their pronouns in their email signatures, and many bathrooms make a point of welcoming anyone who identifies as a man or woman to use them. Some places drop gendered washrooms altogether.\nBut Friedman said there's still progress to be made, especially when it comes to transgender people of colour, who may not always be as visible or represented in the media as white LGBTQ people.\nThe addiction epidemic started with the over-prescribing of opioids near the start of the decade and worsened with a supply of synthetic street drugs like carfentanil and fentanyl, which only need tiny amounts to trigger a deadly overdose.\n\"The opioid crisis is without a doubt the single biggest public health crisis of our generation,\" said Benjamin Perrin, the author of Overdose: Heartbreak and Hope in Canada's Opioid Crisis,\u00a0a book set to be released next year about the epidemic.\nRecent figures from the Public Health Agency of Canada show nearly 14,000 people have been killed by opioids since 2016, and Perrin said approximately one person dies from an overdose every two hours.\nIn an interview with The Canadian Press earlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to do more to combat the crisis, including creating more supervised consumption sites and giving doctors more authority to prescribe alternatives to street drugs.\nHowever, he said that decriminalizing all drugs isn't the \"panacea\"\u00a0to the crisis.\nWhen \"Thank Me Later\" came out in 2010, few could have known that the Canadian artist \u2014\u00a0described at the time on review site Pitchfork as \"emo-y\" \u2014\u00a0could have become one of the world's most dominant artists. He was the most-streamed artist of the decade on\u00a0Spotify, and his music helped put Toronto on the map as a city with a hip-hop identity.\n\"Perhaps above all, however, is his ability to appeal to a wide variety of fans who might identify with various aspects of his multi-faceted persona,\" said Ken McLeod, an associate professor of musicology at University of Toronto.\n\"Over the past decade where streaming services have broadened musical tastes, and where ethnic and musical diversity are increasingly valorized, he metaphorically sits in the middle of a cultural and stylistic Venn diagram.\"\nHome prices have more than doubled since the start of the decade, outpacing income by a large margin and putting home ownership out of reach for many young people in two of Canada's biggest cities, says John Pasalis, president of real estate site Realosophy.\nBack in 2010, Pasalis estimates housing prices in Toronto were about five times more than average yearly income, whereas now they're roughly eight times more. He said the situation is similar in Vancouver.\n\"Today's generation of first-time buyers is battling with sky-high rents and a market that is a lot harder to get into than ten years ago,\" said Pasalis. \"It's harder to save and it's harder to get into the market.\"\nMarket control measures from governments have had mixed impact. Pasalis said in Toronto, a mortgage stress test led more people to buy condos and vastly inflated their pricing. In Vancouver, a foreign buyer's tax has softened the market, but prices there are still sky-high.\nMadness appeared to spread across Canada over the Raptors' 2019 playoff run. When the Raptors started their finals series against the Golden State Warriors, thousands of people across the country crowded into dozens of outdoor screenings.\nBut it took much of the decade to build such fanfare \u2014\u00a0after all, in 2011 the Raptors finished with the second-worst season record in the Eastern Conference.\nGeneral Manager Masai Ujiri made gutsy moves towards building the team,\u00a0firing head coach Dwane Casey and sending DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio in a trade that landed the team Kawhi Leonard.\nThe Raptors' feverish playoff following indicates that basketball is beginning to rival hockey as the nation's most popular sport, said Laurel Walzak, a sport media assistant professor at Ryerson University.\nBut the lasting memory will be of the Raptors' playoff run, and more than a million fans celebrating their championship in Toronto in June.\n\"I don't think this can ever be repeated in any sport moving forward.

There's good and bad in all these angles,\" he said, pointing to the report's\u00a0tallying of the number of residents who live in poverty, which sits at\u00a013 per cent of the population.\nAnd looking at the snapshot of provincial government finances doesn't give much to cheer about, as the report notes public sector debt has ballooned in the last five years, from $12 billion in 2015 to $23 billion in 2019.\nThat debt comes from a number of sources within the government, including its Crown corporations and agencies\u00a0\u2014 like Nalcor, which is in charge of the\u00a0overbudget beast of a hydroelectric project that is Muskrat Falls.\nAnother dubious point of distinction is the net provincial\u00a0debt, projected to come in for the 2019/20 year at $15.4 billion, well above the $10.3-billion net debt in 2014/15.\nWhile those numbers are as enormous as they are alarming, Greenwood said assembling the statistics can\u00a0help propel change.\nA fantastic metaphor for understanding demographics; if NL were a village of 100 people... <a href=\"https://t.co/mfdXkgQHH2\">pic.twitter.com/mfdXkgQHH2</a>\n\"As they say, what's measured is managed,\" he said.\n\"Vital Signs doesn't pretend to have all the answers, but it's forcing us to think about these issues in more detail.\"\n2019 is the sixth year for the report, which\u00a0can be accessed online.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "With real estate market booming, Montreal property assessments climb 13.7%", "description": "Beaconsfield, Hampstead,\u00a0Mount Royal, Kirkland and Westmount among those with biggest jumps", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-property-assessments-2020-1.5278986", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5279351.1568220053!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/real-estate-montreal.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Sep 11, 2019 10:24 AM ET", "2019-09-11T18:28:21.056Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Montreal homeowners will see a major\u00a0increase in their property assessment, propelled by the city's booming real estate market.\nOn average, residential and non-residential property values\u00a0are going up 13.7 per cent, the city announced Wednesday.\nThe new assessments will take effect Jan. 1, 2020 and cover the next three years.

Thousands of demonstrators were expected to take to the streets to protest against the result.\nThe authorities, including the powerful army, argue the only way to move the country forward after demonstrators brought an end to Bouteflika's 20-year rule in April is to elect a successor.\nWeekly protests that toppled Bouteflika have not stopped, with demonstrators demanding the entire ruling elite cede power to a new generation, despite no obvious leader emerging to represent them. The protesters refer to themselves simply as Hirak, or the movement.\nTebboune's rivals included another former premier, two former ministers and a former member of the ruling party's central committee.\nProtesters marched in cities and towns across Algeria throughout Thursday's election, in some places clashing with police, who tried to disperse them with baton charges.\nLate on Thursday, the election body said some nine\u00a0million Algerians took part in the election.\n\"The turnout is satisfying and it will give the new president enough backing to implement his reforms,\" said Ahmed Mizab, a commentator on state television, saying it showed the decision to hold the elections was \"propitious and right.\"\nBut Riad Mekersi, 24, who has participated in all the Hirak protests since Feb. 22 in Algiers, said the movement will continue no matter who wins.\n\"We have toppled Bouteflika, and we will topple all the system's men.

That has some advocates calling on government to afford renters affected by the COVID-19 outbreak extra protection and support, while others are looking to apartment owners for compassion and compromise.\nFor Willy Scholten, president of the New Brunswick Apartment Owners' Association, the expectation is that tenants will pay.\n\"We still have the same obligations that we've had in the past. We have to pay our expenses and continue to employ our people, pay maintenance, pay the operating costs, pay our mortgage payments,\" Scholten said.\n\"Our expectation is that rent will be paid when it's due.\"\nThat aligns with comments from Premier Blaine Higgs shortly after declaring the state of emergency March 19. As part of the measures, the province suspended the right of landlords to evict tenants for non-payment of rent until May 31.\n\"We are not saying tenants don't have to pay rent,\" Higgs said at the time. \"They absolutely do. We're simply asking for flexibility that may be required as people and businesses lose income.\"\nThe \"flexibility\" will have to be negotiated by tenants and landlords on a case-by-case basis. Scholten said the association does not control its members, who set their own policies.\nAsked what could happen if tenants do not pay, Scholten said: \"Everything is completely uncertain at this point. We don't know what's going to happen.\"\nHe said owners expect tenants eligible for government financial aid to use those supports.\u00a0\nIn New Brunswick, the government will provide a one-time income supplement of $900 for workers or small business owners who lost their income on March 15 or after. The first payments could be delivered later this week.\nThe federal Canada Emergency Response Benefit offers income support for up to 16 weeks \u2014 about $2,000 a month \u2014 to those who lose pay because of the pandemic. The application process is set to open in early April, with support to come about 10 days later.\nThose aid packages won't be available in time for Wednesday and they fail to help some low-income workers and people living on social assistance beyond a bump in the GST rebate,\u00a0 according to Jean-Claude Basque, provincial co-ordinator for the New Brunswick Common Front for Social Justice.\nHis organization is proposing government waive rent payments during the crisis for anyone living in New Brunswick Housing or non-profit social housing. They're also calling for the Department of Social Development to reinstate 75 rent subsidies that were cut in December.\u00a0\n\"They have a lot of difficulty in the best of times to have a decent life and now with the crisis certainly they're being impacted a lot,\" Basque said.\nOn a broader scale, the group wants apartment owners to reduce rent payments by 25 per cent per month during the crisis.\u00a0\nBasque said owners were given a boost in the latest provincial budget with news the non-owner-occupied residential property tax will be cut in half over a four-year period, and now, he said, is a time to give back.\n\"Government and everybody is saying we're all in this together, which is true, but then we're asking the province and the federal [government] to do their part to help our tax system, to help people,\" Basque said.\u00a0\n\"But the private sector also has to do their part. They're going to receive all kinds of money to help either their business or help their employees. But they have to do their part also.\"\nEligible businesses and non-profit organizations will receive wage subsidies up to 75 per cent, retroactive March 15, Ottawa announced. Interest-free loans of up to $40,000 will also be available to\u00a0small businesses and not-for-profits in order to to help cover operating costs.\nBasque advises anyone concerned about paying rent to speak to their MLA.\nOpposition MLAs say the provincial government should consider doing more for tenants and landlords.\u00a0\nLiberal MLA Lisa Harris, Opposition critic for Social Development, said New Brunswick could look to other provinces.\n\"Nova Scotia is also helping landlords with a rent deferral program where they agree to defer rent for businesses that have had to shut down and the province will cover rent that can't be recovered,\" Harris said in a statement to CBC News.\n\"In BC, there's a program that offers $500 to cover the cost of rent. We think more can be done in New Brunswick.\"\nGreen Leader David Coon said provincial and federal officials should work with banks on a mortgage-deferral program, which would release some of the pressure on apartment owners.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe province must suspend rent increases, he added.\nCoon hopes tenants can manage to make rent with government aid they receive, but he said the province will have to deal with the question of what happens once the crisis is over, the no-eviction order is lifted and tenants have accumulated debt to their landlords \u2014 a debt that can't be paid all at once.\nIt's a concern for Basque, who wonders how tenants can be protected from retaliation once the pandemic and lockdown has passed.\n\"We don't have a tenants' association like other provinces, so we rely on government action or on owners of apartments to do the right thing and we hope they won't kick people out, for sure,\" he said.\nThe co-founders of Damage Deposit Refunds, a Saint John business that assists tenants in getting money entitled to them from their landlord, are pitching a compromise to address the issue.\nElizabeth Vickers and Loai Jaouni say illegal pet fees collected by some apartment owners for years that are now owed to tenants could be deducted from rent payments.\u00a0\n\"That would reduce the amount of money they would owe the tenant and it would acknowledge that they owe the tenant that money,\" said Vickers.\n\"It would allow the tenant to still pay some of their rent. It would be a reduced amount, but then the landlord would receive hopefully enough to cover his mortgage and electric or whatever their arrangement was.\"\nJaouni said that could be a workable solution, but he hopes to see compassion from owners for affected tenants already shown in places like Prince Edward Island, where one landlord waived rent entirely, and in Wisconsin, where the landlord lowered rent to $100.\n\"I don't think they should bring the price down because of the illegal fees, if landlords want to be nice enough, like the landlord in Wisconsin,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"That should be a separate thing because of the situation we're in with COVID-19.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Cambridge candidates on cost of living, environment and what you need to know about them", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/cambridge-candidates-federal-election-survey-1.5313623", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302818.1569860500!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cambridge-candidates.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-14T13:04:00.890Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Voters will head to the polls on Oct. 21 and in Cambridge people will have a choice between seven candidates.\nThe candidates in Cambridge are:\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has asked the candidates to answer a survey.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue Cambridge is facing right now is the housing crisis. There are not enough units available for the demand on the market, and not enough affordable housing units for those on wait lists in Waterloo region.\nAffordable housing is a solution to the issues that so many people face. It's a big part of the puzzle when it comes to helping people end drug abuse, to finding a job, for keeping a family together, and for reducing poverty overall. A re-elected Liberal government would continue to address the housing gap by building affordable housing and renovating existing stock.\nAlready in Cambridge, $6 million has been spent on new and renovated affordable housing, and under the $55 billion National Housing Strategy, that building of new units will continue.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nAs your Member of Parliament, I will continue to fight for investment in Cambridge, and keep a close eye on the policies that affect families here. Our government has been addressing affordability directly \u2014\u00a0every year, through our government's Canada Child Benefit, Cambridge parents receive over $80 million dollars. This supports more than 23,000 children in our community. We will continue to invest in the services and programs that families depend on.\nOur government has a plan to reduce cell phone bills, make housing more affordable for families, and support seniors who don't have the finances to retire securely. I will continue to fight for policies like this that put money directly into the pockets of middle-class families, and make life significantly more affordable for families.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur track record on the environment speaks for itself, and I want our government to keep making progress.\u00a0Our government put a price on pollution, polluting is no longer free in Canada. We will continue to take action on reducing emissions, supporting clean growth, and protecting and preserving our wildlife.\nOur government has been working to transition away from a carbon-based economy, and we must continue this progress, because the economy and the environment go hand-in-hand, and we cannot have one without the other. I will continue to fight for greater investment in renewable energy, programs to grow green solutions like our electric vehicle rebate, preservation of Canadian wildlife and our plan to plant two\u00a0billion trees.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI love Cambridge. I've lived here for two decades, and it's where I've chosen to raise my two children. Nothing is more important to me than helping families in this community succeed and access the help they need when they're facing challenges.\nEven before being your Member of Parliament, I spent my career serving our community in non-profit organizations like the YMCA,the Boys & Girls Club, and the University of Waterloo. I will always fight for our community, and the people that live here.\nWebsite\nResponses not yet received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI've knocked on over 10,000 doors now, and what I hear most about is the opioid and addictions crisis. We've seen the harm caused by addiction, homelessness, and mental health issues in Cambridge. As your MP, my first task would be to declare a public health emergency on the opioid crisis, and commit to working with all levels of government, experts, and Canadians, to develop a national strategy on opioids.\nI would work to end the criminalization and stigma of addiction while getting tough on the real criminals - those who traffic in and profit from illegal drugs. I'll also work to pursue financial compensation from the drug companies responsible for this crisis. In parallel, I'll pursue an effective Affordable Housing strategy for\u00a0Cambridge, that will tackle homelessness, poverty, and housing shortages.\nThe opioid crisis stems from previous cuts to affordable housing, education, social services, and the unexpected impact of oxycontin and oxycodeiene being produced and pushed by pharmaceutical companies in the 1990s. To start fixing the crisis in Cambridge and beyond, we need to take these roots into consideration and deal with them today. There's no magic bullet, but we can heal our riding.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an\u00a0MP?\nFirst: Wages have stagnated while the cost of living, mortgages, tuition, etc., has skyrocketed. This means families are stuck paying for essentials like food, and services like childcare and medicine, on their credit cards. So, the first thing we can do is recoup the billions of dollars that are lost to corporate tax evaders, and implement a 1 per cent tax on those with more than $20 million in wealth. This will raise over $10 billion-plus per year, helping us pay for the services our families need, allowing us to pay off debts and make lives more affordable.\nSecond: The climate crisis demands immediate and rapid action. We must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions quickly. The silver lining is that we are presented with an unprecedented economic opportunity, because the world is at the frontier of a green energy revolution. My vision is that, Cambridge, as an industrial town with our infrastructure and skilled workforce, is at the leading edge of this low-carbon energy transformation, building the electric cars and public-transit fleets and infrastructure of tomorrow. This will create hundreds of thousands of new, well-paying jobs. Either we build the future we want to see, or someone else will.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThis is an important question for me, since my PhD centered on Climate Politics.\nWe need less talk, and real action, immediately. We have less than 10 years to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by half to meet the IPCC's targets.\u00a0\nWe need a Green New Deal. This will require nothing less than a mass mobilization and transformation of the way our society understands and consumes energy. First and foremost, we cannot continue to increase emissions, which the TMX pipeline would do. So: no new pipelines; cut all fossil-fuel subsidies; and use the $3.3 billion previously given to the biggest polluters, to be directly invested into the low-carbon technologies of the future.\u00a0\nWe need this to science-based targets in line with keeping warming to 1.5 degrees.\nTo finance new projects, New Democrats will launch a Canada Climate Bank to make the big, meaningful investments in the innovative clean energy projects we need.\nRetrofitting homes to be energy efficient and electrifying public transit by 2030 will create over 300,000 good jobs all over Canada, rebuilding local economies while lowering emissions. This is crucial: fighting climate change in Cambridge BY building the low-carbon future we want to see.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI listen to everyone and I never cast judgment on anyone.\nI used to work as a landscaper, in minimum-wage retail, and then as a recruiter in human resources. I went back to school as a 'mature student' to study politics, because I was concerned about where the world was headed environmentally, economically, and politically. I studied hard, was accepted to do a Masters degree at Oxford University and a PhD in International Politics at the LSE (UK), and then I taught International and Environmental Security at Wilfrid Laurier University and the Balsillie School in Waterloo. I'm also on the Board of Directors of the Cambridge Self-Help Food Bank.\nI decided to run for the NDP after the birth of my baby boy at Cambridge Memorial Hospital last year. I started thinking more about the future, and it scared me. So, I'm working now to make a better future for him, and for all of us. Cambridge is my home, it's where my wife and I want to raise our young family, and despite its issues, it's still an amazing place to live and it has much more potential.\nCambridge: Let's be good to one another.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue is the climate crisis.\u00a0We have a small window to respond before damage becomes irreversible.\u00a0We are already seeing negative impacts\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe gap is getting larger between the rich and poor and many Canadians are getting lost in the system.\u00a0The Green Party advocates a universal living income and universal pharmacare.\u00a0\nAlso, we need to start focusing on health and well-being rather than always measuring how we are doing in terms of economic activity. I am already a supporter of the Well-Being Waterloo project and would like to see this focus on well-being scaled up\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe Green Party has put forward a detailed action plan:\u00a0Mission Possible which\u00a0includes ending subsidies to fossil fuel immediately,\u00a0no new pipelines,\u00a0banning fracking\u00a0and scaling up the green economy.\u00a0\nWe need to make this transition for the planet and to participate in the global green economy and to do so in a way that supports workers and their families.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am an entrepreneur, social innovator, community activist, artist and a grandmother.\u00a0In my business as a graphic recorder, I have worked with non-profits, municipal government and community leaders to facilitate creative solutions to some of the most wicked social problems facing\u00a0Cambridge,\u00a0Waterloo region and Brant County.\u00a0\nMy decision to run as Green Party candidate in Cambridge is motivated by my passion for a sustainable economy and a caring community.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nWhen I'm talking with Cambridge residents, I most often hear two concerns,\u00a0one with a very local focus and the other with a national focus.\nRelated to the former, residents are concerned about drug use, especially opioids, in the downtown core. For the PPC, addressing the drug issue will involve putting the safety and well-being of law-abiding citizens first. Research proves that safe injection sites encourage riskier drug use leading to more deaths but do almost nothing to get people clean. So I don't support a SIS (supervised injection site). A compassionate approach will focus on getting addicts off drugs and that's what the PPC is for.\nThe other concern that is mentioned is the issue the corruption of national government leaders. [Liberal Leader Justin] Trudeau's broken promises and [Conservative Leader] Andrew Scheer's willingness to pander to get votes \u2014 whether it's caving in to the dairy cartel or giving Quebec, but no other province, the ability to set immigration rates \u2014 people are frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow does one address this problem of corruption? One needs to vote in politicians who tell the truth and refuse to pander even if it means it will cost them votes. Only Maxime Bernier and the People's Party is willing to follow that path.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nA People's Party government will let citizens keep more of the money from their pay cheques through lower income taxes. If you make less than $15,000 per year, you will pay no tax. If you make between $15,000 and $100,000 your income tax rate is just 15 per cent.\u00a0 And that will give middle-class Canadians thousands more every year. Those making over $100,000 pay 25 per cent.\nThe PPC is also the only party to end supply management \u2014 or producer price fixing \u2014 on milk, eggs and poultry. Ending supply management will lower the price on these food staples and lower people's grocery bill by about $600 a year.\nThe PPC is going to open up cellphones, internet and cable industries to full competition. With more businesses competing for your business, prices will go down. We'll also open airlines and other near-monopolies to competition to increase competition and get prices lower.\nFinally, we'll also lower immigration and that will lead to increased wages for lower skill and entry level position (see work of Harvard economist, George Borjas); it will also lead to lower housing prices (see work of Dr. Daniel Hiebert, UBC).\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe PPC is skeptical of the alarmist claims being made because they just don't stand up to the science. We agree that the temperature is getting gradually warmer \u2014 now up 1 degree Celsius since 1800. Science also shows that CO2 in the atmosphere can increase warming.\nHowever, the science is also very clear that levels of C02 in the atmosphere didn't reach concentrations great enough to effect warming until the 1960s. The warming we see now started in the 1800s. For something to be a cause, it cannot come after the effect.\nBased on the evidence, the People's Party is going to focus on the most pressing environmental needs for Canadians. Health Canada's says that currently over 14,000 people in North America die annually from air pollution from human sources. Pollution in our lakes, rivers and oceans causes hundreds of cases of illness every year.\nMany indigenous communities have no clean water to drink.\nWe're making safe drinking water for remote indigenous communities our first priority and it's part of a larger, firm commitment to combat air and water pollution.\nThis video is my response to climate alarmism.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nMy family \u2014 my wife Maggie and our five children \u2014 and I have made their home in Cambridge for almost 20 years. Our ties to the community have been made strong though volunteer involvement like running summer camps for kids.\nI'm a tenured professor at Wilfrid Laurier University and I've been a leading proponent for freedom of conscience and expression on academic campuses and in Canadian society more generally. My decision to enter politics is rooted in my concern that:\nThe people of Cambridge need to know that I will tell the truth even if the truth is uncomfortable to hear. I will not pander for votes. I think that every human being must be treated with respect but every idea must be open to debate.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing the riding and how would you address it?\nThe most pressing issue facing the people of Cambridge and all of Canada is the need for political renewal.\nWe need to change the political and electoral process so people can participate in making the decisions that affect their lives and the society.\nIn the present situation the major parties act as a cartel to keep their monopoly on power and control of the political process and the peoples' participation is merely to vote every four years. The interests served by this cartel of parties are not those of the working people, they are the interests of the monopolies and the oligopolies which they serve. The most people can hope for\u00a0is to \"influence an MP.\"\nWe can reject this system where the political parties come to power. By speaking in our own name about our concerns, about what should be the priorities in the economy, health care, education and other matters of national interest, working people can embark on a new path to serve their own interests. We can exercise direct control over the decisions we ourselves take and speak in our own name. Importantly, this includes what to do in the 2019 election itself.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP.\nWe need a new direction for the economy. Workers are the producers. We and our families are those most affected by upheavals in the economy, as the basis of our livelihoods is destroyed and public services and social programs come under attack. The austerity agenda which has been unleashed is playing havoc with our lives.\nWorkers are the producers of all the social wealth necessary for the economy and the society to function. It is our rights that must be at the centre of setting a new direction for the economy, one that recognizes the rights of all people. In the current situation, it is monopoly right that is held sacred. Multinationals move in or out of the area, according to their own private interests. Governments at all levels entice them to move in with various pay-the-rich schemes, and then protect them when they move out.\nSpeaking with our peers in own voice about the problems that face us, presenting our own experience with the ruling class and its pay-the-rich schemes, working out our own proposals to humanize the natural and social environment and taking our own decisions are important in breaking with the status quo.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address these concerns.\nA very significant step the government should take, is to withdraw from NATO, NORAD, and the U.S. war machine, which is the world's biggest\u00a0polluter, and the major source of war and aggression internationally.\nThe problems in the environment are crying out for the working people to empower themselves to set a direction for the economy that serves to humanize the social and the natural environment\nA government whose aim is to address the concerns of the people and to build a bright future for the people and the coming generations will restrict the monopolies and oligopolies from their destructive activities.\nAround the world, it is the people speaking out in their own name on these issues that is depriving the monopolies and oligopolies, and governments in their service, of their ability to pollute, destroy, super-exploit, trample on the sovereign rights of Indigenous peoples, and wage war for self-serving aims.\nThe government should stop blaming individual behaviour for destroying the environment. Here and internationally, governments must take measures to end\u00a0 destructive practices of the monopolies and oligopolies, such as fracking, clear cutting, detrimental mining methods, contamination of lakes and oceans, the privatization of water and fraudulent environmental assessments.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm running because it is the right of working people, as the producers of all of the social wealth, to have a say in how the society is organized. It is our right to participate in making those decisions which affect our lives.\nThe cartel parties deprive us of this right with their monopoly on power and cordon sanitaire around all areas of decision-making. The interests they serve are those of the monopolies and oligopolies. They decide all matters pertaining to the election \u2014 including who the candidates will be and what the \"issues\" are.\nThe Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada is calling on people to discuss with their peers how make their vote count.\nA vote for the candidates of the Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada and its program for democratic renewal is an affirmation of working peoples' right to have a say in how society and the economy is organized \u2014 that it's not the exclusive preserve of the cartel parties.\nIn ridings where MLPC candidates are not running, this statement can be made by voting for other small party candidates or independents.\nParty website\nResponses not yet received.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2675328702", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Cambridge candidates on cost of living, environment and what you need to know about them", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/cambridge-candidates-federal-election-survey-1.5313623", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302818.1569860500!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cambridge-candidates.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-14T13:04:00.890Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Voters will head to the polls on Oct. 21 and in Cambridge people will have a choice between seven candidates.\nThe candidates in Cambridge are:\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has asked the candidates to answer a survey.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue Cambridge is facing right now is the housing crisis. There are not enough units available for the demand on the market, and not enough affordable housing units for those on wait lists in Waterloo region.\nAffordable housing is a solution to the issues that so many people face. It's a big part of the puzzle when it comes to helping people end drug abuse, to finding a job, for keeping a family together, and for reducing poverty overall. A re-elected Liberal government would continue to address the housing gap by building affordable housing and renovating existing stock.\nAlready in Cambridge, $6 million has been spent on new and renovated affordable housing, and under the $55 billion National Housing Strategy, that building of new units will continue.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nAs your Member of Parliament, I will continue to fight for investment in Cambridge, and keep a close eye on the policies that affect families here. Our government has been addressing affordability directly \u2014\u00a0every year, through our government's Canada Child Benefit, Cambridge parents receive over $80 million dollars. This supports more than 23,000 children in our community. We will continue to invest in the services and programs that families depend on.\nOur government has a plan to reduce cell phone bills, make housing more affordable for families, and support seniors who don't have the finances to retire securely. I will continue to fight for policies like this that put money directly into the pockets of middle-class families, and make life significantly more affordable for families.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur track record on the environment speaks for itself, and I want our government to keep making progress.\u00a0Our government put a price on pollution, polluting is no longer free in Canada. We will continue to take action on reducing emissions, supporting clean growth, and protecting and preserving our wildlife.\nOur government has been working to transition away from a carbon-based economy, and we must continue this progress, because the economy and the environment go hand-in-hand, and we cannot have one without the other. I will continue to fight for greater investment in renewable energy, programs to grow green solutions like our electric vehicle rebate, preservation of Canadian wildlife and our plan to plant two\u00a0billion trees.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI love Cambridge. I've lived here for two decades, and it's where I've chosen to raise my two children. Nothing is more important to me than helping families in this community succeed and access the help they need when they're facing challenges.\nEven before being your Member of Parliament, I spent my career serving our community in non-profit organizations like the YMCA,the Boys & Girls Club, and the University of Waterloo. I will always fight for our community, and the people that live here.\nWebsite\nResponses not yet received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI've knocked on over 10,000 doors now, and what I hear most about is the opioid and addictions crisis. We've seen the harm caused by addiction, homelessness, and mental health issues in Cambridge. As your MP, my first task would be to declare a public health emergency on the opioid crisis, and commit to working with all levels of government, experts, and Canadians, to develop a national strategy on opioids.\nI would work to end the criminalization and stigma of addiction while getting tough on the real criminals - those who traffic in and profit from illegal drugs.

Governments at all levels entice them to move in with various pay-the-rich schemes, and then protect them when they move out.\nSpeaking with our peers in own voice about the problems that face us, presenting our own experience with the ruling class and its pay-the-rich schemes, working out our own proposals to humanize the natural and social environment and taking our own decisions are important in breaking with the status quo.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address these concerns.\nA very significant step the government should take, is to withdraw from NATO, NORAD, and the U.S. war machine, which is the world's biggest\u00a0polluter, and the major source of war and aggression internationally.\nThe problems in the environment are crying out for the working people to empower themselves to set a direction for the economy that serves to humanize the social and the natural environment\nA government whose aim is to address the concerns of the people and to build a bright future for the people and the coming generations will restrict the monopolies and oligopolies from their destructive activities.\nAround the world, it is the people speaking out in their own name on these issues that is depriving the monopolies and oligopolies, and governments in their service, of their ability to pollute, destroy, super-exploit, trample on the sovereign rights of Indigenous peoples, and wage war for self-serving aims.\nThe government should stop blaming individual behaviour for destroying the environment. Here and internationally, governments must take measures to end\u00a0 destructive practices of the monopolies and oligopolies, such as fracking, clear cutting, detrimental mining methods, contamination of lakes and oceans, the privatization of water and fraudulent environmental assessments.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm running because it is the right of working people, as the producers of all of the social wealth, to have a say in how the society is organized. It is our right to participate in making those decisions which affect our lives.\nThe cartel parties deprive us of this right with their monopoly on power and cordon sanitaire around all areas of decision-making. The interests they serve are those of the monopolies and oligopolies. They decide all matters pertaining to the election \u2014 including who the candidates will be and what the \"issues\" are.\nThe Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada is calling on people to discuss with their peers how make their vote count.\nA vote for the candidates of the Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada and its program for democratic renewal is an affirmation of working peoples' right to have a say in how society and the economy is organized \u2014 that it's not the exclusive preserve of the cartel parties.\nIn ridings where MLPC candidates are not running, this statement can be made by voting for other small party candidates or independents.\nParty website\nResponses not yet received.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/666331715520", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/666331715520", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Cody MacKay", "title": "'All I did was start crying': 2 women say they lost thousands in P.E.I. rental scam", "description": "'I just looked up telltale signs of someone trying to scam you and he fit every single one'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-rental-scam-1.5166842", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3163689.1523130883!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/computer-image-for-child-porn-story.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 12, 2019 6:00 AM AT", "2019-06-12T09:00:00.145Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Two separate apartment hunters say they're out thousands of dollars after being scammed while looking for a place to rent in Charlottetown.\nKayla Westhaver-Covin, of Nova Scotia, was accepted to a summer internship on P.E.I. and, in February,\u00a0began looking for an apartment on Kijiji.\nAfter searching unsuccessfully, she posted a wanted ad and was messaged almost immediately by someone, she said, who\u00a0claimed to have an apartment available on Belvedere Avenue in Charlottetown, and that it would be ready for her on June 1.\n\"We started talking via email and he had sent me pictures of it.\u00a0It wasn't anything crazy fancy, but it was nice. So it didn't ring any bells there,\" she said.\n\"Then he sent me a lease that was apparently contracted by his lawyer. The lease was very thorough.\u00a0It was 10 pages\u00a0and I didn't think anything of it.\"\nWesthaver-Covin said they chatted over email for three months and said\u00a0he told her\u00a0he'd transferred to New York for work, so money transfers had to be sent to his lawyer.\nShe said she wired over $600 for the damage deposit, and later another\u00a0payment over $600 for her first month's rent.\nAs the move-in date approached, Westhaver-Covin\u00a0said she emailed him repeatedly that she was moving to the Island soon and needed\u00a0the keys for the apartment.\nEventually she said he told her the keys were sent, and\u00a0she asked for a tracking number.\n\"When I didn't get a response for the tracking number, I had a gut feeling,\" she said. \"I just looked up telltale signs of someone trying to scam you and he fit every single one of the criteria.\"\nShe\u00a0filed a report with the police and has since found a place to stay. Although, she said she's \"devastated\" by the experience\u00a0\u2014 and out nearly $1,300 as a result.\nWesthaver-Covin\u00a0said she was so desperate to find whatever place she could \u2014\u00a0in a city where the vacancy rate has hovered\u00a0near zero per cent \u2014\u00a0the thought of being scammed wasn't top of mind.\n\"I like to think of myself as a trusting person\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I definitely should have asked for more information, I should have tried out the phone number on the lease, I should have spoken to him on the phone at the very least, but that never happened,\" she said.\n\"I was just so excited that I kind of missed all those important steps.\"\nPatricia Manguiob\u00a0made the\u00a0payments, drove across the country from Edmonton to Charlottetown, just to experience\u00a0the same thing.\nLike Westhaver-Covin, she was moving to P.E.I.\u00a0for the summer and had no luck apartment hunting \u2014 so she posted a wanted ad on Kijiji.\nAnd, like Westhaver-Covin, was contacted right after posting the ad.\n\"This person reached out to me\u00a0\u2026\u00a0he said that he had a fully-furnished apartment,\" she said. \"The pictures were great, he said it was $800 for rent for one month, everything included, it sounded like the perfect deal.\"\nManguiob's boyfriend lives on the Island and she asked if he could\u00a0check\u00a0out the place for her. She said the request was met with excuses and no apartment visit was arranged.\u00a0\nDesperate\u00a0and worried she wouldn't have a place to live, she said she hastily made the wire payments to lock down the spot, sending roughly $1,100.\nWhen she got to the Island and wanted to pick up the keys, she learned after more research\u00a0that the apartment\u00a0\u2014 the same one promised to Westhaver-Covin \u2014 was owned by Capreit, a real estate company, and not the person she'd been emailing.\n\"I couldn't even think, all I did was start crying. Just the feeling of getting scammed and people playing you in that way, it just sucks,\" she said. \"I drove all the way here expecting to have this place.\"\nShe, too, reported what happened\u00a0to the police.\u00a0\nIn an emailed statement to CBC News,\u00a0Trish MacPherson, the executive vice-president of operations at Capreit, said this is an issue that happens across the country from time to time and encouraged renters to report all the details\u00a0to the police.\n\"We sincerely hope that this customer gets resolution to the incident, and if we can help find an available apartment, we would be happy to do so,\" she said.\nWesthaver-Covin and\u00a0Manguiob\u00a0eventually found each other through Facebook \u2014\u00a0after Westhaver-Covin posted what happened to her.\n\"Same story, same contract, same lawyer, everything was the same,\"\u00a0Manguiob\u00a0said.\n\"It already sucked that I had to go through it, and then now knowing that a lot more people are getting victimized by this, it was so shocking to me.

Chris Watts.\nMost of which, he said, stem\u00a0from ads with scammers patrolling sites seeking people out deliberately.\nWatts said ads and respondents\u00a0can present themselves as legitimate, especially to people who \"are really in dire straits as far as\u00a0finding accommodations.\"\u00a0\n\"It's very difficult to discern what is accurate and what is a fraud,\" he said. \"Basically it's the ad in reverse \u2026 the fraudster would seek out the individuals and use the fraudulent address, which is actually a legitimate address but not something they would have [ownership rights]\u00a0to.\"\nIn an emailed response to CBC News, Kijiji\u00a0pointed to the\u00a0Avoiding Real Estate Scams section of its\u00a0website\u00a0where it suggests \"a few things to keep in mind in order to avoid falling prey to a real estate scam.\"\u00a0\nThey include:\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/651118147931", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2685892912", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/651118147931", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2685892912", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1569493571876", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1569490499929", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1569488963636", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1569488963636", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1569483843976", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1569488963560", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1568874563631", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1568826947826", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Trevor Pritchard", "title": "Highway 17 widening ignites hope in Renfrew", "description": "Work to make highway 4 lanes from Arnprior to Renfrew could start in next 2 to 3 years", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/province-widens-highway-17-arnprior-renfrew-1.5208401", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3795553.1475856932!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/highway-17-fatal-6-vehicle-crash-opp-thick-fog-oct-7-2016.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 11, 2019 2:35 PM ET", "2019-07-12T10:24:33.409Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The province has announced plans to convert the remaining two-lane\u00a0stretch\u00a0of Highway 17 between Renfrew, Ont., and Arnprior, Ont., to four lanes.\nThe 22.5-kilometre stretch to be widened\u00a0runs from Scheel Drive in\u00a0the Township of McNab/Braeside to three kilometres west of Bruce Street in Renfrew, according to a news release from Renfrew\u2013Nipissing\u2013Pembroke MPP John Yakabuski\u00a0on Thursday.\nThe project will also include the construction of four new interchanges.\u00a0\n\"The economic opportunities, the development, the growth, and the tremendous enhancement to highway safety is something that we consider a top priority,\" said Yakabuski in a video posted to Twitter on Thursday.\nWidening Highway 17 in eastern Ontario was a promise that Premier Doug Ford made in the run-up to the 2018 provincial election.\nOnce completed, the entire highway between Arnprior and Renfrew would be four lanes.

It's been a safety concern for many years up in this area,\" Eady said.\nHe said he expects it to increase house prices since the housing market in Arnprior has been stronger due to highway access.

Or ask my high-school girlfriend \u2014\u00a0during a dinner in the late 1980s, her mom could not quite grasp the subtleties of me dancing around the fact that our house had been repossessed by the bank after a downturn. Or ask the hundreds of oil and gas workers who have participated in research I've undertaken.\nGrowing up an oilpatch brat, working in the industry, conducting long-term social science research on its impacts \u2014 I am confident saying the energy sector is not all it's cracked up to be.\nImportantly, this is not commentary on the workers, families and communities that support the industry. To them, I tip my hard hat.\nBut after\u00a0a convoy of oilpatch workers recently headed to Edmonton to counter the public environmentalism of Greta Thunberg, I felt compelled to remind people what they were defending.\nWhen my father, who worked in oil and gas most of his life, was in his forties, I could imagine him firing up his Chevy half-ton and driving to Edmonton from southern Alberta to protest some teenage foreigner trying to derail the primacy of oil and gas in the province.\nBut in the latter years of his life, I doubt he'd have been up for it. He'd come to know the oil and gas industry much like I came to understand it.\nIn short, it's pretty brutal, pretty unforgiving. Chews you up, spits you out.\nAnd I'm talking about people who have devoted their entire lives to it.\nIt's not a surprise. The power at the top is global, immense and hell-bent on squeezing every penny out of the labour that goes into producing oil and gas. The industry has long been one based on inequality, bootstrap individualism and high-octane opportunism.\nI was born into oil and gas. It put our family through the wringer more than once, but especially during the '80s when the bottom fell out, and my dad lost everything but his shirt to plummeting oil prices.\nLater, during one of the rather short-lived booms, I worked as a roughneck on both service rigs and drilling rigs. But I never planned to make it my career, in no small part because the experience gave me a first-hand look at what I would later learn through long-term anthropological research about the harsh impacts of oil and gas on individuals, families and communities.\nImportantly, the industry does have its benefits, including relatively good wages. But it's only a good living if you're foresighted and fortunate enough to prepare for the bust, which always comes.\nAnd even during the booms, workers and their families face challenges. Drilling for oil is often done in remote locations, and energy companies want rigs running 24 hours a day.\nJobs in this sector include shift work in places far from home, which means workers spend weeks if not months away from loved ones. Interview after interview (and personal experience) revealed families struggling with these arrangements. Shift work is hard on the body, and the long-term separation comes with all kinds of problems for families.\nOilpatch communities are always trying to keep up, and it seems like they never really can. Boom and bust cycles are unpredictable; community leaders are often just wrapping their minds around how to handle the impacts of a boom when the bust hits. Major labour and housing shortages can turn, basically overnight, into high unemployment and housing market crashes.\nNot all booms and busts look the same, so even knowing this history does not always prepare communities.\nAnd let's not forget just how opportunistic and contradictory\u00a0the powerful people in the industry are. When times are good, they argue that government needs to get out of the way, that progress should not be impeded by labour or environmental regulations.\nConsider, however, the fact that oil and gas are extracted on land secured from Indigenous people with the help of the government.\nAnd what about the government subsidies from which the industry benefits?\u00a0When the boom ends, industry enthusiasts are quick to fault the government for not prioritizing the sector's recovery.\nThere are a lot of good reasons to transition away from this industry.\nIt will be critical to consider the workers and families in the industry as we do so. The next economic arrangement should put workers, families and the environment first \u2014 and investors and corporate bigwigs last.\nIn short, we'd be better off without oil and gas, and I'd bet there are plenty of workers and families who'd love an economy based on more stable, just and environmentally friendly industries.\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "City urged to show 'spine' on climate change", "description": "Environment committee approves strategy to reduce GHG emissions", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/climate-change-master-plan-committee-delegations-1.5399099", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5109417.1556132778!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/climate-change-rally-april-24.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 17, 2019 3:10 PM ET", "2019-12-17T20:10:19.284Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Environmental advocates\u00a0are urging city councillors to show some \"spine\" as they usher Ottawa toward a cleaner, greener future.\nAt its meeting Tuesday, the city's committee on environmental protection, water and waste management endorsed tough new targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a new climate change master plan.\n\"The work laid out in this plan is enormous, but is in keeping with the enormous scale of work to be done,\" Sharon Coward, executive director\u00a0of EnviroCentre, told councillors.\nThe staff report sets out a climate road map to 2050.

He and two others from the community founded their organization in 2018 with a focus on encouraging the community to \"play an active role in how the neighbourhood develops.\n\"Unless the city is intentional in reaching certain demographics, that level of engagement doesn't happen,\" he said.\u00a0\nSo far, they have held consultation sessions with the local business owners to brainstorm ways to support each other as the construction continues.\nThe LRT project is also expected to raise prices in the neighbourhood once it's finished. But McDonald is worried he may not stay open to see it.\u00a0\n\"We don't know if we're going to be here \u2026 The way they've gentrified the area, they're really forcing us out.\"\nBlack Futures on Eglinton, another not-for-profit organization responding to the impact of the construction, is focusing on making affordable housing a priority for the neighbourhood.\u00a0\nThey have been holding cultural events in the community, including a reggae night.\n\"There was a big message from the community,\" said Cheryll Case, founder of Black Futures on Eglinton.\n\"Availability of affordable housing and keeping businesses open is key to preserving the culture.\"\u00a0\nBoth organizations have been in talks with the city and hope to see more support to the community.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1586646595679", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1529869379901", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "Halfway through term, B.C.

CBC was given an early look at the platform.\nThe party promises to reform Canada's health-care system to fund a whole new suite of services, just as the Liberals are looking at creating a national drug plan. On Wednesday, a Liberal government-appointed advisory council called for a $15-billion single-payer pharmacare plan and the federal health minister says Ottawa is considering next steps.\nThe NDP plan, titled \"A New Deal for People,\" will be launched at a campaign-style rally Sunday at the Hamilton Convention Centre during the Ontario NDP's weekend-long convention.\nIt will be a homecoming for Singh, who left the provincial party and was elected federal party leader less than two years ago. The party's hope is that the platform launch will provide a much-needed boost for Singh and other candidates who will soon head back to their ridings for a summer of campaigning. Lately, national polls have been showing the centre-left party losing ground to the Green Party.\nOne question Singh undoubtedly will face is the obvious one: How do you pay for\u00a0biggest new federal health care investment\u00a0in generations?\nThe NDP platform says it would phase in the expansion of health coverage, starting with\u00a0universal pharmacare in 2020. The platform doesn't offer a complete timeline, nor does it outline the full cost of the program, saying the party would need to study the issue and work with provinces to implement it.\u00a0\nThe party outlines measures to boost government revenues to help pay for the multi-billion dollar reform. The party would raise taxes on the wealthiest Canadians \u2014 those with wealth over $20 million annually. It also would raise corporate taxes, end fossil fuel subsidies, close tax loopholes and levy a foreign home buyers tax.\nThe party says it expects that some of these fiscal measures won't just boost government revenues, but also fight money laundering and cool down overheated housing markets in Vancouver and Ontario.\nThe Parliamentary Budget Officer, an independent officer of parliament, will review the plan, the\u00a0NDP\u00a0says.

But it won't come cheap, with land costing more than $3 million \u2014 nearly twice as much as a second construction site the board considered in Mount Pearl.\nAccording to documents prepared in October, purchasing a seven-acre property in the Galway development \u2014 referred to in the documents as \"sexy, fancy, modern\" \u2014 would cost the province $3.15 million. Another property of the same size in Mount Pearl, a location deemed \"less nice,\" would cost $1.67 million.\nThose documents were prepared\u00a0by Kim Christianson, the Conseil scolaire francophone provincial de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador's director of education.\nDespite the difference in price, the board's directors unanimously voted in 2018 to recommend the province acquire the Galway site.\nChristianson said the new K-12 school's location is of \"fundamental\" importance, and the Galway site would help attract future students from the west end of St. John's, as well as nearby Paradise and Conception Bay South.\n\"I think, given our justifications, if there is a difference in costs, the board of directors of the school board is prepared to accept this difference,\" Christianson said.\nBut the analysis Christianson prepared in 2018 states both the Galway and Mount Pearl locations are in the right geographic area\u00a0and could increase the board's enrolment. In an interview with CBC Radio-Canada, Christianson added that no matter where the new school is built, most students will need to be bused to the facility.\nThe school board argued\u00a0the property it considered in Mount Pearl is hillier than the Galway location and less accessible to school buses. It also said the Galway site on Beaumont Hamel Way is closer to services such as shopping centres and coffee shops, even though the massive housing and commercial development remains \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 largely void of such amenities.\n\"By the time the school is built, there will be more services around the school,\" said Christianson. \"We are seeing several businesses currently setting up and we can see things are expanding. We think that with a new\u00a0school, this development will continue.\"\nChristianson also said the Mount Pearl property, located on Masonic Drive, could not be expanded in the event the board required more space.\nBut the $46.3-million school and community centre proposed by the board would already have space for 500 students \u2014 more than the French school board's entire provincewide enrolment for 2018-19.\nEmail exchanges obtained by Radio-Canada show that DewCor, the company owned by former premier Danny Williams that is behind the Galway development, offered the school board a 10 per cent discount if the province purchased the property by June 30. That deal offers the land at $450,000 per acre before tax.\nThe school board still needs the provincial government's approval before it can proceed with purchasing land and beginning construction on a second permanent school for the St. John's area.\nBoard officials had hoped to receive that go-ahead and funding in the most recent budget. Instead, they received $2.8 million to continue planning the new structure.\nEducation Minister Brian Warr\u00a0would not comment\u00a0on the board's decision to choose the land in Galway.\n\"I'm sure that locations have their strengths and their weaknesses, and I give them credit for making their choice and we will see where it goes,\" he said Monday, adding that the Department of Transportation and Works will analyze the project.\u00a0\u00a0\nWarr\u00a0refused to comment on the feasibility of the $46.3 million project either.\n''Again, that is a decision that is not left to me or my department, it's a decision that will be left to a cabinet and treasury board as we see it going forward,'' he said.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0school board hopes the new\u00a0facility will be open in time for the 2022-23 school year.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1581305923926", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Martha Dillman", "title": "Greater Sudbury refutes report that suggests property taxes in the city amongst the highest in Ontario", "description": "New data by Zoocasa states Sudbury ranks 5th in the province for high tax rates", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/tax-rate-rankings-1.5233410", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4115726.1494868969!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/city-of-greater-sudbury-logo.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Aug 02, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-08-02T09:00:00.066Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The City of Greater Sudbury says a new report on municipal tax rates in Ontario doesn't tell the whole story.\nReal estate website Zoocasa has released data on the muncipalities with the highest and lowest property tax rates in the province.\nSudbury's in the top five out of 35, beat out only by Windsor, Thunder Bay, Sault Ste.

The Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.\nGross domestic product increased at a 2.1 per cent annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of third-quarter GDP. That was up from the 1.9 per cent pace estimated last month. The economy grew at a 2.0 per cent pace in the April-June period.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast third-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at 1.9 per cent.\nThe upward revision to GDP reflected more inventory accumulation than initially thought, as well as a less steep pace of contraction in business investment. Inventories increased at a $79.8 billion US pace instead of the $69.0 billion rate reported last month.\nWhen measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.4 per cent rate in the last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a rate of 0.9 per cent in the second quarter. The income side of the growth ledger accelerated despite a drop in profits.\nSecond-quarter GDI growth was revised down by 0.9 percentage point, with growth in wages and sales during that period slashed by $46.7 billion to $62.1 billion.\nAfter-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, decreased $11.3 billion, or at a rate of 0.6 per cent, as they were held down by legal settlements with Facebook and Google. Profits increased at a 3.3 per cent rate in the second quarter.\nThe average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.3 per cent rate in the July-September period, quickening from a 1.4 per cent growth pace in the second quarter.\nU.S. stock index futures briefly extended gains and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose after the release of the data. The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies.\nGrowth has slowed from the 3.1 per cent rate notched in the first three months of the year. The slowdown is largely blamed on the Trump administration's trade war with China, which has eroded business confidence, contributing to the second straight quarterly decline in business investment.\nThe fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also sapping momentum from the expansion, now in its 11th year. But there are some hopeful signs for business investment.\nThe Commerce Department said on Wednesday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3 per cent last month as households spent more on electricity and gas, offsetting a drop in new motor vehicle purchases.\nWith consumer spending rising moderately, inflation remained benign in October. Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% last month, lifted by food, energy goods and services prices. The PCE price index was unchanged in August and September.\nWages increased 0.4 per cent in October after climbing 0.1 per cent in September. Wages were boosted by a $7.2 billion adjustment to account for General Motors strike pay and payments associated with a new contract for members of the United Automobile Workers union.\nWith spending outpacing income growth, savings fell to $1.29 trillion from $1.34 trillion in September.\nOrders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 1.2 per cent last month, the largest gain since January, after falling 0.5 per cent in September. These so-called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery, computers and electronic products and fabricated metals.\nEconomists had forecast core capital goods orders would drop 0.3 per cent in October. Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.8 per cent last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.\nCore capital goods shipments fell 0.8 per cent in September.\nBusiness investment dropped at a 2.7 per cent rate in the third quarter, rather than contracting at a 3.0 per cent pace as previously reported. The declines in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells, were not as steep as previously estimated.\nA report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Nov. 23. Claims had been stuck at a five-month high over the previous two weeks, pointing to some easing in the labor market.\nStill, the labour market remains on solid footing, helping to underpin consumer spending. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was unrevised at a 2.9 per cent rate in the third quarter.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "COVID-19 on P.E.I.: What's happening on Friday, March 20", "description": "P.E.I.'s second confirmed case of COVID-19 was on Air Canada flight 7564 on March 11", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-covid-19-friday-march-20-1.5504088", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5504566.1584723084!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/charlottetown-playground-closed-for-covid-19-pandemic.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 20, 2020 7:02 AM AT", "2020-03-20T22:12:51.599Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "P.E.I. chief public health officer Dr. Heather Morrison asked passengers on a flight from Toronto to Charlottetown March 11 to self-isolate until March 25.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nMy goal as your MP will be to continue to listen and engage with our community to ensure our economy is strong, life is affordable, and we are protecting our environment for future generations.\nA Liberal government will continue to work to make life more affordable for Canadians. We lowered taxes on middle class Canadians and have a plan to give a hand-up to the most vulnerable in our society by making the first $15,000 of earned income tax-free, saving the average family nearly $600 a year and lifting 40,000 more people out of poverty.\u00a0\nBy working with communities, we created the National Housing Strategy and the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive to respond to concerns about affordable housing.\nI meet with students regularly and know one of Waterloo's greatest strengths is our post-secondary institutions. A Liberal government will make university or college education more affordable, providing $1,200 more each year in Canada Student Grants. Additionally, to ensure the fiscal situation of students, we will assist with interest relief until graduates are earning $35,000/year.\nWe have a plan that looks out for middle-class Canadians and the most vulnerable, not one that gives tax cuts to millionaires.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nOur plan to invest in the middle class and build an economy that works for everyone has had remarkable results. Since our government was elected in 2015, Canadians have created over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014 about 75 per cent of them full-time \u2014 pushing unemployment to historic lows.\u00a0\nThanks to the tax-free Canadian Child Benefit and the middle-class tax cut, the typical middle-class family has more than $2,000 extra in their pockets every year. Our debt-to-GDP ratio continues on a downward trend and Canada's fiscal position is among the best in G7.\u00a0\nThere's no place like Waterloo to start a business, and that's why we've supported small businesses by lowering their tax rate from 11% in 2015 to 9% in 2019. Canada now has the lowest small business tax rate in the G7.\u00a0\nWe've also enhanced support for research and development which is especially important in a tech community like ours. If we are re-elected, we will create the Canada entrepreneur account to provide up to 2,000 entrepreneurs with as much as $50,000 each to launch their new businesses. Small businesses are our job creators and we are committed to working with them.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nToday in Canada, if you pollute, you pay. We've taken the bold step of putting a price on pollution with 90% of the money returning to the pockets of individuals and families to make greener, cleaner choices more affordable.\u00a0\nWe acknowledge that we need to do even more. If re-elected, we have committed to legally-binding, five-year milestones, based on the advice of the experts and consultations with Canadians, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. When it comes to fighting climate change, one thing is clear: doing less costs people more. We are committed to transitioning to greener energy sources. To support this in a responsible way, we will ensure energy workers and communities shape their own futures by introducing a Just Transition Act, giving workers access to the training, support, and new opportunities needed to succeed in the clean economy.\nThe best way through the climate emergency is action, not inaction. We are committed to planting an additional 2 billion trees within the next 10 years and we will increase land and ocean protections by 25% by 2025. We must take climate change seriously to keep the world our children and grandchildren grow up in safe and liveable.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nUpon election four years ago, I chose to move the MP's office to Waterloo City Hall. Waterloo is the only riding that I know of in Canada where the MP, the MPP, and the mayor are all located in the same building. I believe that all levels of government should work better together for the good people of Waterloo.\nI've called Waterloo Region home all my life. I'm proud to be the child of immigrants and to have been educated right here in Waterloo. I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Science and have been employed since.\nOur government brought back the long-form census and we have returned to making decisions based on evidence, not ideology.\nWe have an incredible community. Over the past four years, I have connected our community's expertise in the work we have done as a country because as I always say, Canada needs more Waterloo. Over the past four years, we have worked together to bring investments to our community and showcased Waterloo and Canada to the world. I ask for your support and commit to continue working hard for you to represent our riding's interests in Ottawa as your MP.\nWebsite\nResponse not yet received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI've spoken to people across Waterloo over the last several months and the vast majority of them are nervous about the future and ongoing threats related to the climate crisis.\u00a0\nThe Trudeau Liberal government hasn't done enough to fight the climate crisis and their purchasing of a pipeline was frankly irresponsible. And the Conservatives have no plan to do anything meaningful to address climate change and its consequences.\nWhen I speak to people, they're hopeful about the NDP's plan to address the climate crisis without leaving anyone behind. We will set our emissions target based on what scientists say is required to meet our Paris Agreement targets to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and invest in the jobs of the future.\nOur plan involves continuing to put a price on carbon, immediately ending fossil fuel subsidies, retrofitting homes and buildings across the country, transitioning to fully-electric transit and incentivizing the building and buying of electric vehicles.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nHere in Waterloo, people are feeling the pressure of the increasing cost of living, in part because of stagnant wages and rapidly increasing housing costs.\u00a0\nThe NDP has a comprehensive plan to address affordability. We would focus on reinvesting in public services like universal pharmacare and education. With universal pharmacare, families can save up to $500 per year. And by removing the interest on federal student loans, we will ease the transition of students from post-secondary education to the workforce.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the NDP has put forward a plan to invest in affordable housing, building 500,000 new units in the next 10 years. As MP, I would make sure that Waterloo gets its fair share.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe federal government needs to be doing so much more to tackle the climate crisis. Our collective future relies on it.\u00a0\nFirst, we need to get serious about meeting our Paris Agreement targets. We need to use scientifically based targets so that we have the highest chance of avoiding the catastrophic effects of climate change.\u00a0\nSecond, we need to start thinking about how we are going to transition our society to become net-zero. The federal government can be a leader here, starting with retrofitting all federal government buildings, electrifying government vehicles, and being a partner with municipalities to electrify and expand public transit fleets across the country.\u00a0\nThird, and most importantly, this transition needs to be just. Indigenous people need a seat at the table and the economic opportunities need to be spread fairly across society so that no one is left behind.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm Cree-Metis, with family roots in Montreal Lake First Nation in Treaty 6 Territory.\nI have years of experience fighting for meaningful change by advocating for social, economic, and environmental justice issues. Every day, I refine my advocacy skills by taking every opportunity to listen to and learn from those around me.\nI have a strong work ethic and I work hard to amplify community voices. If elected, my main priority as MP would be to listen to constituents, amplify their voices in Ottawa, and work in a non-partisan way to get good things done for Waterloo.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address\u00a0it?\nWe are one of Canada's technology champions. We need to attract and hold talent to build our lead. To do\u00a0this, we need to promote a system-level strategy that improves transportation the regional transportation network and helps control housing costs at the same time.\nWe need to support the universities that are actually driving regional growth and continue to build an arts and culture sector around our high-tech lead to attract more talent and more jobs.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe cost of living problem is primarily in the housing/transportation nexus.\nThe key is to continue our forward-looking urban and regional planning and to win federal and provincial support for our infrastructure needed. More broadly, we in the region need to support a high speed rail system for the entires Quebec-Windsor corridor.\nWe also need to implement a national housing policy focused a massive expansion of social\u00a0 housing. I will work to strengthen our links with he relevant Federal agencies and decision makers.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe have to be clear \u2014 the climate emergency is the big threat\u00a0for the world and for K-W.\nAll our other great initiative will be undermined if we don't pick up our game in Canada and Ontario. My immediate task is to help people understand that we already have all the tools and technology we need, and that we can and must set much more ambitions targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a young mother and a systems design engineer. The first makes me very committed to improving the world and the other teaches me to look for and find solutions that really work.\u00a0\nSerious problems take serious thinking and serious commitment.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI thought long about the top issue facing our riding and my thoughts kept going back to it depends who you ask. I've addressed the tax burden and our landfill crisis below.\nFor the commuters the biggest issue is our transportation infrastructure. It is mind-boggling why K-W does not have high speed transport to the Pearson International Airport, and throughout the Toronto to Montreal corridor. We must stop expecting our big government to provide what for decades it has failed to do and look at handing the challenges over to the private sector to deliver.\u00a0By doing so, we eliminate the need for tax increases and only those who choose to use it will pay.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe PPC has a plan to balance the budget in two years, a plan for bold tax reform and policy to reduce prices of dairy, poultry, eggs and all goods produced in Canada and sold to neighbouring provinces. The PPC will also eliminate all capital gains taxes allowing investors big and small to make money while stimulating the economy.\nThe PPC will balance the budget by eliminating the billions of dollars spent on corporate cronyism, bail-outs, subsidies and all forms of corporate welfare; and by eliminating the billions of Canadian taxpayer dollars that are sent to other countries for unaccountable social causes. This foreign aid rarely ends up in the hands of those in need.\nThe PPC will increase the personal exemption to $15,000 and have a flat tax of 15% on income up to $100,000 and a flat rate of 25% on income over $100,000.\nThe PPC will eliminate supply management, the dairy cartel, which makes Canadians pay 400% more for milk, eggs, dairy and poultry.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe PPC will end inter-provincial trade barriers so we can buy product made in Canada without the punitive costs and barriers to trading among provinces.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur region is facing a trash and landfill crisis. As a community our biggest issue is what is going to happen in a few short years when the Erb Street landfill permanently closes. There is no rational back-up plan.\u00a0\nOur federal government doesn't know what to do with our trash other than to drive it to our port cities, put it in shipping containers and send it to third world nations who either send it back (the Philippines), burn it producing toxic fumes, or dump it in the ocean (which is why our Canadian recycle products are floating in the south Pacific).\u00a0\nThe green energy proponents have no plan for the end of life disposal of highly toxic electric car batteries, solar panels and windmills.\nThe PPC will focus on local solutions to local environmental issues. Accountability only works when power is decentralized. The PPC policy prioritizes clean and safe drinking water for all, and clean and safe air for all. On these issues we have seen that our federal government tends to stand in the way of innovation, stuck in old infrastructure and old way to do things, and simply not doing anything.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nIn 2018, the average Canadian family paid a whopping $40,000 in taxes while it paid only $32,000 toward food, shelter and clothing. We also know that\u00a0the average Canadian household is within $200 per month of bankruptcy. Household and government debt are at an all-time high.\u00a0Many families are struggling to make ends meet with no income left to pay for emergencies, job loss, prescription drugs, never mind a vacation. It is wrong that so much is paid for taxes with little access to social services and healthcare.\nI would like to get busy implementing the People's Party platform, policy and principles.\u00a0I would like to come back in four\u00a0years as your MP with a record of having accomplished what the People's Party's set out to do. We need bold reforms and to get back to our basic values as Canadians.\nI would be honoured to serve as your Member of Parliament for the riding of Waterloo.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Waterloo candidates surveyed on climate change, cost of living", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/waterloo-federal-election-candidate-surveys-1.5313149", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309020.1570203951!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/waterloo-candidates-federal-election.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-13T09:00:00.011Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Voters will head to the polls on Oct. 21 and in Waterloo, people will have a choice between five candidates.\nThe candidates in Waterloo are:\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has asked the candidates to answer a survey.

The candidates were told they had a 200-word limit for answers.\nCandidates who did not provide surveys by the deadline are invited to still do so and their responses\u00a0will be added to this story when they are received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nMy goal as your MP will be to continue to listen and engage with our community to ensure our economy is strong, life is affordable, and we are protecting our environment for future generations.\nA Liberal government will continue to work to make life more affordable for Canadians. We lowered taxes on middle class Canadians and have a plan to give a hand-up to the most vulnerable in our society by making the first $15,000 of earned income tax-free, saving the average family nearly $600 a year and lifting 40,000 more people out of poverty.\u00a0\nBy working with communities, we created the National Housing Strategy and the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive to respond to concerns about affordable housing.\nI meet with students regularly and know one of Waterloo's greatest strengths is our post-secondary institutions. A Liberal government will make university or college education more affordable, providing $1,200 more each year in Canada Student Grants. Additionally, to ensure the fiscal situation of students, we will assist with interest relief until graduates are earning $35,000/year.\nWe have a plan that looks out for middle-class Canadians and the most vulnerable, not one that gives tax cuts to millionaires.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nOur plan to invest in the middle class and build an economy that works for everyone has had remarkable results. Since our government was elected in 2015, Canadians have created over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014 about 75 per cent of them full-time \u2014 pushing unemployment to historic lows.\u00a0\nThanks to the tax-free Canadian Child Benefit and the middle-class tax cut, the typical middle-class family has more than $2,000 extra in their pockets every year. Our debt-to-GDP ratio continues on a downward trend and Canada's fiscal position is among the best in G7.\u00a0\nThere's no place like Waterloo to start a business, and that's why we've supported small businesses by lowering their tax rate from 11% in 2015 to 9% in 2019. Canada now has the lowest small business tax rate in the G7.\u00a0\nWe've also enhanced support for research and development which is especially important in a tech community like ours. If we are re-elected, we will create the Canada entrepreneur account to provide up to 2,000 entrepreneurs with as much as $50,000 each to launch their new businesses. Small businesses are our job creators and we are committed to working with them.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nToday in Canada, if you pollute, you pay. We've taken the bold step of putting a price on pollution with 90% of the money returning to the pockets of individuals and families to make greener, cleaner choices more affordable.\u00a0\nWe acknowledge that we need to do even more. If re-elected, we have committed to legally-binding, five-year milestones, based on the advice of the experts and consultations with Canadians, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. When it comes to fighting climate change, one thing is clear: doing less costs people more. We are committed to transitioning to greener energy sources. To support this in a responsible way, we will ensure energy workers and communities shape their own futures by introducing a Just Transition Act, giving workers access to the training, support, and new opportunities needed to succeed in the clean economy.\nThe best way through the climate emergency is action, not inaction. We are committed to planting an additional 2 billion trees within the next 10 years and we will increase land and ocean protections by 25% by 2025. We must take climate change seriously to keep the world our children and grandchildren grow up in safe and liveable.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nUpon election four years ago, I chose to move the MP's office to Waterloo City Hall. Waterloo is the only riding that I know of in Canada where the MP, the MPP, and the mayor are all located in the same building. I believe that all levels of government should work better together for the good people of Waterloo.\nI've called Waterloo Region home all my life.

What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nHere in Waterloo, people are feeling the pressure of the increasing cost of living, in part because of stagnant wages and rapidly increasing housing costs.\u00a0\nThe NDP has a comprehensive plan to address affordability. We would focus on reinvesting in public services like universal pharmacare and education. With universal pharmacare, families can save up to $500 per year. And by removing the interest on federal student loans, we will ease the transition of students from post-secondary education to the workforce.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the NDP has put forward a plan to invest in affordable housing, building 500,000 new units in the next 10 years. As MP, I would make sure that Waterloo gets its fair share.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe federal government needs to be doing so much more to tackle the climate crisis. Our collective future relies on it.\u00a0\nFirst, we need to get serious about meeting our Paris Agreement targets. We need to use scientifically based targets so that we have the highest chance of avoiding the catastrophic effects of climate change.\u00a0\nSecond, we need to start thinking about how we are going to transition our society to become net-zero. The federal government can be a leader here, starting with retrofitting all federal government buildings, electrifying government vehicles, and being a partner with municipalities to electrify and expand public transit fleets across the country.\u00a0\nThird, and most importantly, this transition needs to be just. Indigenous people need a seat at the table and the economic opportunities need to be spread fairly across society so that no one is left behind.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm Cree-Metis, with family roots in Montreal Lake First Nation in Treaty 6 Territory.\nI have years of experience fighting for meaningful change by advocating for social, economic, and environmental justice issues. Every day, I refine my advocacy skills by taking every opportunity to listen to and learn from those around me.\nI have a strong work ethic and I work hard to amplify community voices. If elected, my main priority as MP would be to listen to constituents, amplify their voices in Ottawa, and work in a non-partisan way to get good things done for Waterloo.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address\u00a0it?\nWe are one of Canada's technology champions. We need to attract and hold talent to build our lead. To do\u00a0this, we need to promote a system-level strategy that improves transportation the regional transportation network and helps control housing costs at the same time.\nWe need to support the universities that are actually driving regional growth and continue to build an arts and culture sector around our high-tech lead to attract more talent and more jobs.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe cost of living problem is primarily in the housing/transportation nexus.\nThe key is to continue our forward-looking urban and regional planning and to win federal and provincial support for our infrastructure needed. More broadly, we in the region need to support a high speed rail system for the entires Quebec-Windsor corridor.\nWe also need to implement a national housing policy focused a massive expansion of social\u00a0 housing. I will work to strengthen our links with he relevant Federal agencies and decision makers.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe have to be clear \u2014 the climate emergency is the big threat\u00a0for the world and for K-W.\nAll our other great initiative will be undermined if we don't pick up our game in Canada and Ontario. My immediate task is to help people understand that we already have all the tools and technology we need, and that we can and must set much more ambitions targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a young mother and a systems design engineer. The first makes me very committed to improving the world and the other teaches me to look for and find solutions that really work.\u00a0\nSerious problems take serious thinking and serious commitment.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI thought long about the top issue facing our riding and my thoughts kept going back to it depends who you ask. I've addressed the tax burden and our landfill crisis below.\nFor the commuters the biggest issue is our transportation infrastructure. It is mind-boggling why K-W does not have high speed transport to the Pearson International Airport, and throughout the Toronto to Montreal corridor. We must stop expecting our big government to provide what for decades it has failed to do and look at handing the challenges over to the private sector to deliver.\u00a0By doing so, we eliminate the need for tax increases and only those who choose to use it will pay.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe PPC has a plan to balance the budget in two years, a plan for bold tax reform and policy to reduce prices of dairy, poultry, eggs and all goods produced in Canada and sold to neighbouring provinces. The PPC will also eliminate all capital gains taxes allowing investors big and small to make money while stimulating the economy.\nThe PPC will balance the budget by eliminating the billions of dollars spent on corporate cronyism, bail-outs, subsidies and all forms of corporate welfare; and by eliminating the billions of Canadian taxpayer dollars that are sent to other countries for unaccountable social causes. This foreign aid rarely ends up in the hands of those in need.\nThe PPC will increase the personal exemption to $15,000 and have a flat tax of 15% on income up to $100,000 and a flat rate of 25% on income over $100,000.\nThe PPC will eliminate supply management, the dairy cartel, which makes Canadians pay 400% more for milk, eggs, dairy and poultry.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe PPC will end inter-provincial trade barriers so we can buy product made in Canada without the punitive costs and barriers to trading among provinces.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur region is facing a trash and landfill crisis. As a community our biggest issue is what is going to happen in a few short years when the Erb Street landfill permanently closes. There is no rational back-up plan.\u00a0\nOur federal government doesn't know what to do with our trash other than to drive it to our port cities, put it in shipping containers and send it to third world nations who either send it back (the Philippines), burn it producing toxic fumes, or dump it in the ocean (which is why our Canadian recycle products are floating in the south Pacific).\u00a0\nThe green energy proponents have no plan for the end of life disposal of highly toxic electric car batteries, solar panels and windmills.\nThe PPC will focus on local solutions to local environmental issues. Accountability only works when power is decentralized. The PPC policy prioritizes clean and safe drinking water for all, and clean and safe air for all. On these issues we have seen that our federal government tends to stand in the way of innovation, stuck in old infrastructure and old way to do things, and simply not doing anything.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nIn 2018, the average Canadian family paid a whopping $40,000 in taxes while it paid only $32,000 toward food, shelter and clothing. We also know that\u00a0the average Canadian household is within $200 per month of bankruptcy. Household and government debt are at an all-time high.\u00a0Many families are struggling to make ends meet with no income left to pay for emergencies, job loss, prescription drugs, never mind a vacation. It is wrong that so much is paid for taxes with little access to social services and healthcare.\nI would like to get busy implementing the People's Party platform, policy and principles.\u00a0I would like to come back in four\u00a0years as your MP with a record of having accomplished what the People's Party's set out to do. We need bold reforms and to get back to our basic values as Canadians.\nI would be honoured to serve as your Member of Parliament for the riding of Waterloo.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Militia withdraw from U.S. Embassy in Iraq as Trump deploys more troops", "description": "Move comes after 2 days of protests against deadly airstrikes that targeted Iran-backed fighters", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/baghdad-embassy-iraq-iran-protests-jan1-1.5412257", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5412314.1577892316!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/iraq-us-embassy-attack-protests.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 01, 2020 5:24 AM ET", "2020-01-01T18:02:04.410Z"], "source": null, "content": "Iran-backed militia withdrew from the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Wednesday after two days of clashes with American security forces, but U.S.-Iran tensions remain high and could spill over into further violence.\nThe withdrawal followed calls from the government and senior militia leaders,\u00a0ending\u00a0a high-stakes two-day crisis and practical siege of the largest and one of the most heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic missions in the world.\nThe attack also prompted the Pentagon to send hundreds of additional troops to the Middle East.\nIn an orchestrated assault, hundreds of militiamen and their supporters broke into the embassy compound, destroying a reception area, smashing windows and spraying graffiti on walls to protest U.S. airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia over the weekend that killed 25 fighters.\nThe U.S. blamed the militia for a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base in the northern city of Kirkuk last week that killed an American contractor.\nThe protesters set up a tent camp overnight, and on Wednesday set fire to the reception area and hurled stones at U.S. marines guarding the compound who responded with tear gas. There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound.\nThe Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of state-allied militias \u2014 many backed by Iran \u2014 called on its supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government, saying \"your message has been received.\"\nBy late afternoon, the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River, outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies. U.S. Apache helicopters circled overhead.\n\"After achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly,\" said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. \"We rubbed America's nose in the dirt.\"\nKataib Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia targeted by the\u00a0airstrikes, initially refused to leave, but later bowed to demands to disperse. The militia is separate from the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, though both are backed by Iran.\n\"We don't care about these planes that are flying over the heads of the picketers. Neither do we care about the news that America will bring marines,\" said Mohammed Mohy, a spokesperson\u00a0for Kataib Hezbollah.\n\"On the contrary, this shows a psychological defeat and a big mental breakdown that the American administration is suffering from,\" he said, before withdrawing from the area.\nThe violence came as Iran and its allies across the region have faced unprecedented mass protests in recent months and heavy U.S. sanctions have cratered Iran's economy.\nIraq has been gripped by anti-government protests since October fuelled by anger at widespread corruption and economic mismanagement, as well as Iran's heavy influence over the country's affairs. Those protesters were not involved in the embassy attack.\nU.S. President Donald Trump blamed Iran for the attack on the embassy and the Pentagon dispatched an infantry battalion of about 750 soldiers to the Middle East. A U.S. official familiar with the decision said they would go to Kuwait.\nIran denied involvement in the attack on the embassy. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted by media as saying \"if the Islamic Republic makes a decision to confront any country, it will do it directly.\"\nIran later summoned the Swiss charge d'affaires, who represents American interests in Tehran, to protest what it said was war-mongering by U.S. officials.\nTensions have steadily risen since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and embarked on a campaign of maximum pressure through economic sanctions. Iran has responded by abandoning some of its commitments under the deal.\nU.S. officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices. But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action, apparently fearing a wider conflict.\nThe U.S. has sent more than 14,000 additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression. At the time of the attack, the U.S. had about 5,200 troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.\nThe U.S. and Iran have vied for influence over Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran has close ties to Iraq's Shia\u00a0majority and major political factions, and its influence has steadily grown since then.\nIran helped to mobilize tens of thousands of mostly Shia militia\u00a0to battle ISIS when it stormed across northern and western Iraq in 2014 as the armed forces collapsed. The U.S. and Iran both provided vital aid to Iraqi forces, who eventually declared victory over the extremists in December 2017.\nThe political influence of the PMF has risen in recent years, and their allies dominate parliament and the government. That has made them the target of the anti-government protesters, who have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq.\nThey have also set up a sprawling protest camp in central Baghdad, and for weeks have been trying to enter the Green Zone. Iraqi security forces have beaten them back with tear gas and live ammunition, killing hundreds.\nThe militia\u00a0and their supporters, however, were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy, with little if any resistance from authorities.\nIraq's government vehemently condemned the airstrikes on the militia, saying it violated national sovereignty. But Iran and its allies might have also seen the attack as a way of diverting attention from the anti-government protests.\n\"Iran has been trying to provoke the U.S. into helping it solve its Iraq problem,\" the Crisis Group, an international think-tank, said in a briefing on the crisis. \"The Trump administration, by responding to the attacks in Kirkuk and elsewhere with airstrikes, has obliged.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Warm weather creating 'crisis' for First Nations that rely on ice roads", "description": "Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug is flying in fuel and pondering how to ship materials for a new school", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/northwestern-ontario-winter-roads-1.5450315", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5123904.1557087784!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/melting-ice-road.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 04, 2020 6:00 AM ET", "2020-02-04T11:00:00.853Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Warm weather is playing havoc with the winter road network that connects remote First Nations in northwestern\u00a0Ontario to the provincial highway system, according to the Nishnawbe Aski Nation.\nOnly one\u00a0community's winter road was fully operational as of Jan. 31, according to NAN's\u00a0winter road report.\u00a0 Fifteen communities have roads that are open to light traffic and three to partial traffic.

Tuesday's budget and subsequent spending bills will show how it will spend the money to make that vision a reality.\u00a0\nBut Wawzonek and the government don't\u00a0have much room to manoeuvre and public accounts from 2019 explain why.\u00a0\nIf the budget lays out what a government plans to do, the public accounts spell out what's actually happened. It's year-end analysis uses three measures to determine how healthy the government's finances are: sustainability, flexibility and vulnerability.\u00a0\nIn all three measures the government is failing.\u00a0\nThe government is running out of room to take on debt and doesn't have many options to bring in new sources of money, according to the accounts.\u00a0\nNearly 75 per cent of the government's money comes from the federal government. Taxes, which make up the rest, aren't reliable since the biggest corporate taxpayers are the territory's diamond mines.\u00a0\nTheir taxes fluctuate every year based on production and global prices and demand. Last year corporate tax from non-renewable resources dropped by $42.8 million compared to what was brought in during 2018.\u00a0\nContrast that with government expenses, which came in just over $2 billion last year, mostly split between the operations and management budget and compensation and benefits for employees.\u00a0\nRead more about the territorial debt cap and how it affects spending decisions\u00a0\n\"The economic math is the same from the kitchen table right to the cabinet table,\" explained Michael Miltenberger,\u00a0former territorial finance minister from 2007-2015.\u00a0\n\"You have that discussion about what we can afford? How much debt can we take on?

Tuesday's budget and subsequent spending bills will show how it will spend the money to make that vision a reality.\u00a0\nBut Wawzonek and the government don't\u00a0have much room to manoeuvre and public accounts from 2019 explain why.\u00a0\nIf the budget lays out what a government plans to do, the public accounts spell out what's actually happened. It's year-end analysis uses three measures to determine how healthy the government's finances are: sustainability, flexibility and vulnerability.\u00a0\nIn all three measures the government is failing.\u00a0\nThe government is running out of room to take on debt and doesn't have many options to bring in new sources of money, according to the accounts.\u00a0\nNearly 75 per cent of the government's money comes from the federal government. Taxes, which make up the rest, aren't reliable since the biggest corporate taxpayers are the territory's diamond mines.\u00a0\nTheir taxes fluctuate every year based on production and global prices and demand. Last year corporate tax from non-renewable resources dropped by $42.8 million compared to what was brought in during 2018.\u00a0\nContrast that with government expenses, which came in just over $2 billion last year, mostly split between the operations and management budget and compensation and benefits for employees.\u00a0\nRead more about the territorial debt cap and how it affects spending decisions\u00a0\n\"The economic math is the same from the kitchen table right to the cabinet table,\" explained Michael Miltenberger,\u00a0former territorial finance minister from 2007-2015.\u00a0\n\"You have that discussion about what we can afford?

They said they would, so the projects went forward.\"\nThe city and LRT supporters saw the project not as just\u00a0a transit initiative, but as an economic growth strategy. It was based on\u00a0research that showed\u00a0LRT\u00a0projects spurred development along their corridors. Initial projections from Metrolinx showed while the $1 billion plan was costly, it was the transit investment that would lead to the largest economic benefit.\nKitchener-Waterloo is reaping the benefits of its ION LRT, which recently began service.\nEconomic and housing reports there show\u00a0more\u00a0homes selling near stations and\u00a0at least $2.1\u00a0billion\u00a0in private investments along the corridor in the six years leading up to its opening.\nWord of the Ford government scrapping the city's plans to establish light-rail transit surprised\u00a0many, but the announcement also came as doubts surfaced near\u00a0the start of 2019.\nSome whoops and hollers greeted the announcement\u00a0and critics\u00a0like Ward 14 city councillor Terry Whitehead said the costs far outweighed the benefits, but\u00a0most call the news disappointing.\nKris Jacobsen, director of the LRT\u00a0project office for the City of Hamilton, said the province had\u00a0spent between $80 and $100 million to acquire\u00a0some 70 full properties in anticipation for the build, with others in, now stalled, negotiations.\n\"What I'm more concerned with are the people who actually live and work on the corridor,\" he said in an interview on Monday. \"Many\u00a0people have put their lives on hold trying to figure out whether they should stay, go, invest, buy and this is just another delay to them.\"\nWith fixed stations across Hamilton,\u00a0the LRT would have\u00a0provided a permanent boost to\u00a0areas along\u00a0the King Street corridor.\nA list of some 36 developments provided by the city's LRT office in February shows projects that include 40 and 30-storey towers on Jackson Street West\u00a0and a residential subdivision near Roxborough Park\u00a0were slated to emerge because of the transit line.\u00a0Whether any of those builders\u00a0will scrap their\u00a0plans or continue is unknown.\n\"I'm very happy I don't have projects on King Street right now like many, many other people in Hamilton that have invested dollars, bought properties, torn things down to start and develop big buildings,\" said Tim Potocic, the co-owner of the local development company Upholdings, in a phone interview Tuesday.\n\"I know there are several large, large properties being built. LIUNA is building a couple of very large towers downtown, Vrancor is building some towers as well, in the core on King Street... it's concerning for anyone invested.\"\nOther infrastructure investments that were part of the project, such as\u00a0the Longwood\u00a0Road bridge, the Frid Street expansion,\u00a0extended water mains and\u00a0sidewalks, are also in limbo.\n\"You add all those numbers up and we're talking about an investment in our infrastructure, city assets, of probably around $200 million,\" Jacobsen said.\nWith uncertainty looming over\u00a0the future of proposed projects along the LRT path,\u00a0Bob\u00a0Van De Vrande, president of the Realtors Association of Hamilton-Burlington (RAHB), is hopeful\u00a0the loss of the LRT\u00a0doesn't ruin the city's momentum as it draws more people and developers in.\n\"The city is very resilient and is very much in an upswing,\" he said in a phone interview, adding that Hamilton will still see $1 billion invested in the city.\u00a0\nWard 12 city councillor Lloyd Ferguson said the lower city of Hamilton has seen a \"significant increase in appraised value of properties\" after years of sinking property price and also thinks the momentum will keep rolling.\nBut Jacobsen said losing the extra money the city would have gained\u00a0is still a stinging blow.\n\"Whether you liked\u00a0LRT or didn't like LRT, the fact the city was having its assets updated as a result of the project is a significant loss to the city overall, and the taxpayers,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1555640899939", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "John Last", "title": "Cabinet's mandate, if fulfilled, could offer a lot for northerners", "description": "Long-held territorial concerns acknowledged in new mandate letters issued Friday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cabinet-mandate-north-1.5396325", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5366173.1574263522!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trudeau-montreal-20190617.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 14, 2019 7:00 AM CT", "2019-12-14T16:32:53.674Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Expect to cross paths with a few federal cabinet ministers at the airport in Iqaluit this year.\nMandate letters issued Friday by Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau to ministers of Northern Affairs, Indigenous Services and Crown-Indigenous Relations spelled out a number of specific commitments to Nunavut.\nThey include the construction of a treatment centre, the full implementation of land claims, and the development of an \"Inuit Nunangat policy\" \u2014 a broad framework for policy-making in Nunavut and other areas of the Inuit homeland, like Nunavik\u00a0in northern Quebec, Nunatsiavut in Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region in the N.W.T.\nBut Nunavut won't be the only territory to benefit if this cabinet's mandate is fulfilled. Residents across the North can find encouragement in Trudeau's acknowledgement of long-standing concerns \u2014 and his repeated commitment to find \"predictable and sufficient funding\" to address them.\nIn the details of the mandate and in a uniform introduction, the letters repeatedly emphasize a desire for closer relationships with Indigenous governments.\n\"There remains no more important relationship to me and to Canada than the one with Indigenous peoples,\" reads Trudeau's uniform introduction.\n\"I am directing every single minister to determine what they can do in their specific portfolio to accelerate and build on the progress we have made with First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis.\"\nEarly headlines on the mandate letters singled out a commitment made in the letter to Minister of Northern Affairs Dan Vandal to increase the Northern Residents Deduction for travel costs to at least $1,200.\nLarry Bagnell, the Liberal MP for Yukon, said the program would also expand eligibility to include northern residents, like self-employed people, who do not receive a travel benefit from their employer.\n\"Why should one person get it in the North, just because their employer puts it on their T4 slip, and another one doesn't?\" said Bagnell.\n\"This way, everyone will be eligible.\"\nA bigger tax break will be nice for northerners struggling with airfares that regularly run into the thousands.\nBut many of the letters' other commitments are much wider-reaching.\nOutside of Nunavut, northern premiers are likely to be encouraged by a mandate to support infrastructure projects in the North.\nThe letter to Vandal asks him to expand the scope of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency's work to include funding \"foundational economic infrastructure such as roads and visitor centres.\"\nThat opens up a new pot of funding for tourism development in the N.W.T., and for investment in the $700-million Mackenzie Valley Highway.\nThe letter also asks the minister to \"support territorial planning for hydroelectricity projects,\" which presumably includes the N.W.T.'s Taltson Hydroelectricity Expansion Project, with its estimated price tag of $1.2 billion.\nThe N.W.T. and Yukon will both benefit from commitments to finalize the Northern Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program,\u00a0which provides funding \u2014 and creates jobs \u2014 to clean up toxic abandoned mines.\nRemote communities in all three territories are also likely to benefit from an instruction to Marc Miller, minister of Indigenous Services, to help communities transition from diesel-fuelled power to clean energy alternatives by 2030.\nAnd Indigenous leadership across the North will be curious about the mandate to establish \"a new national benefits-sharing framework for major resource projects on Indigenous territory.\"\u00a0\nTerritorial governments will likely want a say in developing that framework, but it could be an opportunity to address widely-perceived shortcomings in existing impact benefit agreements.\nNorthern Affairs Minister Vandal will also have to support the development of new universities in the Yukon and N.W.T.\nBoth territories are in the process of transforming colleges into accredited polytechnic universities, and Trudeau's mandate letter commits the minister to ensuring \"a robust system of post-secondary education\" exists in the North at the end of it.\nResearchers in the North could benefit from Vandal's mandate also.\nThe minister is asked to accommodate growing demand at the Polar Continental Shelf Program, which helps manage research in the Arctic, and modernize the Eureka Weather Station some 400 kilometres north of Grise Fiord, Nunavut.\nSome more general items in the mandate letters will be of interest to territorial governments looking to devolve services to Indigenous governments.\nTrudeau instructed Miller to implement Bill C-92, which would hand over control of child and family services to First Nations. Crucially, it also specifies ensuring \"long-term predictable and sufficient funding\" to fund those services, so First Nations are not left with an unpayable tab.\nThe letter also briefly mentions working with Indigenous communities on the development of local housing policies, something that has been a point of conflict between Indigenous communities\u00a0and the territorial government in the N.W.T.\nThe mandate for Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett reaffirms the government's commitment to implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples \u2014 a move the N.W.T. government listed among its priorities.\nBennett will also oversee the creation of a new National Treaty Commissioner's Office that will help direct \"the ongoing review, maintenance and enforcement of Canada's treaty obligations.\"\nLakeshore and coastal communities in Nunavut and the N.W.T. may also benefit from the mandate given to Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard Bernadette Jordan.\nIt instructs Jordan to work with local and Indigenous partners on developing a \"blue economy\" strategy, including specific planning for \"small craft\" harbours.\nThat could be music to the ears of residents in Hay River, N.W.T. They have been waiting for years for federal funding to begin a $10 million dredging and revitalization project.\nLast but not least, the mandate for Minister of Canadian Heritage Steven Guilbeault asks him to find \"long-term predictable and sufficient funding to support\" the Indigenous Languages Act.\nThat act came under fire for failing to protect Inuktut language rights in Nunavut.\n"}, {"author": "Garrett Hinchey", "title": "Kam Lake candidates trade cost of living solutions in community debate", "description": "6 candidates in crowded field find common ground on most issues", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/kam-lake-debate-nwt-votes-1.5287848", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287852.1568786451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/kam-lake-debate.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Sep 18, 2019 7:55 AM CT", "2019-09-18T13:55:46.202Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Six candidates running for MLA in Yellowknife's Kam Lake riding struggled to differentiate themselves from one another in a Tuesday evening debate, though they did offer some innovative ideas to decrease the N.W.T.'s cost of living.\nHosted at N.J. Macpherson school, the candidates spoke to a packed house, with late arriving viewers grabbing chairs from a stack at the back of the gym to add to those already set\u00a0out by organizers.\nCandidates found common ground on many issues: all agreed that the territory should establish an arms-length advocate for children and families in the territory, work to close the municipal funding gap, and ease paths to resource development by investing\u00a0in infrastructure and cutting red tape.\nHowever, a question on lowering cost of living, framed through a look at private power utility Northland Utilities' role in the N.W.T.'s power distribution model, allowed voters to see differences in how each of their potential representatives could tackle the issue in the legislature.\nIncumbent candidate Kieron Testart began by suggesting that the territory implement a new tax incentive he called a \"northern living benefit\"\u00a0\u2014 a credit paid to each resident. He coupled that by suggesting that the N.W.T. create a\u00a0universal basic income\u00a0program.\n\"That's my fundamental philosophy to this,\" he said. \"If you put money into people's pockets, you'll grow the economy. That spending will be local spending. It's going to stay in the North, and benefit northerners.\"\nBusiness owner Abdullah Al-Mahamud said that his plan centres around three planks: lowering energy costs by investing in renewable energy, drastically decreasing the cost of child care through government subsidies, and\u00a0creating a public insurance option in the territory, an idea that he says will both increase revenue to the government and lower costs for residents.\n\"Electricity costs a lot of money, but those are the monies that my insurance support program can provide. Auto and home insurance can generate government $80 to $100 million regularly. So that revenue, we can implement to ourselves: our daycare program, affordable housing, renewable energy.\"\nFormer MLA Robert Hawkins was the only candidate to take aim at Northland Utilities, saying that the company's\u00a0\"power is too expansive.\"\n\"I'm not against Northland Utilities ... they have a monopoly. That's the issue. Nothing else. And what happens with a monopoly? The prices go up and up.\"\nHawkins said that Yellowknife needs to open up power franchise agreements to competition, a move that recently led to the territory's public power corporation taking over Hay River's power franchise.\n\"Power bills are outrageous,\" he said. \"This is not crazy thinking. This is about opening up competition. This is how we survive.\"\nResponding next, Yellowknife city councillor Rommel Silverio said that the decision on the power franchise would come when the contract expires in 2020, but \"we don't want to be like Hay River right now,\" referring to\u00a0ongoing court battles\u00a0in that community.\u00a0\nInstead, Silverio's ideas on reducing the cost of living centre\u00a0around growing the population\u00a0\u2014 an idea that he says would lead to more federal formula funding and increase the tax base.\n\"I firmly believe that if we are able to grow our population, then we will get some relief,\" he said.\nSilverio touted growth through supporting immigration to Yellowknife, and attracting new small businesses to grow the economy.\nYWCA president Cherish Winsor, responding next, said the two most important points were \"keeping our economy strong, and keeping our population up.\"\n\"We need to focus on keeping families here and having the infrastructure for families to stay. That means increasing infrastructure. That means affordable housing,\" she said.\nWinsor called social supports, such as\u00a0government housing, \"band-aid solutions that do nothing for the cost of living,\" instead saying she wants to look at increasing entry-level housing units for singles and seniors.\u00a0\n\"The biggest need in Yellowknife is for bachelor units, or single bedroom units ... we don't have that.\"\nWinsor also iterated her support for universal childcare and a guaranteed income program.\nCaitlin Cleveland, a policy analyst and entrepreneur, was the last to respond to the question. She too focused on growing and maintaining population, expanding\u00a0on Silverio's comments on immigration by saying the government could focus on reconnecting immigrant families, and working to provide them meaningful employment once they arrive.\u00a0\nCleveland also suggested that the government look at its student financial assistance program.\n\"When we first put the program together, we wanted our students to go to university,\" she said. \"Now we want them to go to university, and we want them to come home. So how can we change the program so that we can attract our students to come home and work for us here?\"\nThe debate, live streamed on OpenNWT's Facebook page, was one of two on the night, as candidates in the Yellowknife North riding took part in an event at St. Patrick high school\u00a0gymnasium. That debate was also streamed live.\u00a0\nThe territorial election is Oct. 1.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605516355567", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Downtown Kitchener loses another parking lot", "description": "Community members would rather see more retail and housing, city officials say", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/closing-parking-lots-kitchener-new-developments-1.5176325", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5176455.1560541872!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/lot-closed.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 17, 2019 6:45 AM ET", "2019-06-17T19:08:41.388Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The parking lot at Young Street and King Street West in Kitchener closed indefinitely on Sunday.\nThe closure will make way for a new mixed-use condo building.\nIt's the latest in a series of parking lot closures in downtown Kitchener.\u00a0\nBut that's what residents want, according to Cory Bluhm,\u00a0director of economic development for the City of Kitchener.\n\"As we continue to grow into a big urban centre, you see less and less service parking lots and more buildings, which leads to more vibrancy and excitement on King Street,\" said Bluhm.\nBluhm said when residents were consulted, they wanted more retail space and housing.\nHe said eliminating parking is also part of a municipal strategy to make community members less reliant on vehicles as a means of getting around.\n\"We really want people walking, taking transit and biking,\" said Bluhm.\nBluhm said despite closures, there should be no shortage of parking.\u00a0Kitchener operates about 3,000 parking spaces, in addition to 5,000 privately-owned spaces\u00a0across the city.\u00a0\nThe city has recently raised parking prices at many of those spots.\nBluhm said that's because it's expensive for the city to offer the parking.\u00a0\n\"In fact, it costs us much more to operate a parking space than what we charge,\" he said. \"One of our main objectives, and this is really a community objective, is shifting away from sole reliance on the automobile as the way to get around.\"\nHe said walking and cycling are more affordable, and that all city lots are free for use after 5 p.m.\nClarence Woudsma is the director of the school of planning at the University of Waterloo.\u00a0He says the city shedding parking spots is no surprise, and the city is trying to encourage more mixed development.\n\"I mean, you imagine how much that land is worth\u00a0\u2014 surface parking lots on King Street in downtown Kitchener?

Its goals are laudable, and the province is taking steps to achieve them. Yet, when it comes to the regulations that govern our offshore that are decided in Ottawa, we have a long way to go.\nOffshore oil and gas has brought tremendous benefits to our province. It has significantly benefited the provincial government and provided tens of thousands of well-paying jobs to residents here.\u00a0\nThink back just a few years ago to the peak of the oil and gas industry in this\u00a0province.\nEmployment was up, royalties and taxes to the provincial coffers were up, and in turn, taxes paid by you and me were down. During this period, higher incomes and lower taxation generally led to more discretionary spending. Car dealerships were extremely busy. Folks were calling dealerships and ordering trucks over the phone.\nHousing starts and home sales were up. If you were involved in building houses you probably had more work than you could keep up with. If you had a company, you hired people.\nAnd\u00a0it was not just major purchases such as housing and vehicle sales that were peaking.\nNew restaurants opened and people went to them \u2014 and it wasn't\u00a0just Friday and Saturday nights. It was every night of the week.\nPeople had more disposable income. When you have increased discretionary spending, it allows you to outfit your home with high-end electronics, have a quad at your cabin, or a new RV in a park where your kids can swim and play with their friends all weekend.\nThe benefits were\u00a0seen not just in St. John's and the surrounding area. People from across the province worked in the offshore oil and gas industry and brought those good wages back to their communities. A recent study conducted for Noia demonstrated the benefits were felt in all our communities.\nSchools and health-care facilities were being built, along with improvements to our road infrastructure. When the offshore oil and gas industry is thriving, there's\u00a0money in the provincial coffers for these important public services.\nWhen the price of oil took a downturn there is no doubt the entire province took a hit \u2014\u00a0as did the global economy.\nThe global industry has learned many lessons in the last number of years. In order to be successful, everyone involved in the oil and gas industry has had to change the way they operate.\n\u00a0\nNewfoundland and Labrador companies involved in the supply and service industry are no different. We are industry leaders and we've\u00a0adapted.\nWe have survived and are ready for the next challenge.\u00a0We hope that challenge is a new offshore development, one that showcases our expertise and allows us to grow and expand our unique capabilities.\nWe want to work on the next project offshore and employ our residents.\nWe want our industry to reach its potential and we want to be economic contributors to our province and our country.\nWe want to see a return to the peak of our industry and sustain that level of economic activity for decades, as everyone benefits when our industry is thriving.\nWe've\u00a0weathered the low price of oil and found our place in the global industry \u2014\u00a0and have emerged stronger, wiser, and prepared to succeed. And\u00a0we are only at the early stages of our industry with these lessons already learned.\nNow\u00a0we must ensure it's\u00a0not a regulatory obstacle that curtails our ability to be successful. We need processes related to the offshore that allow us to be competitive and\u00a0encourage international investment.\nWe know we're\u00a0blessed with natural resources beneath our ocean floor and those resources are needed.

Its goals are laudable, and the province is taking steps to achieve them. Yet, when it comes to the regulations that govern our offshore that are decided in Ottawa, we have a long way to go.\nOffshore oil and gas has brought tremendous benefits to our province. It has significantly benefited the provincial government and provided tens of thousands of well-paying jobs to residents here.\u00a0\nThink back just a few years ago to the peak of the oil and gas industry in this\u00a0province.\nEmployment was up, royalties and taxes to the provincial coffers were up, and in turn, taxes paid by you and me were down. During this period, higher incomes and lower taxation generally led to more discretionary spending. Car dealerships were extremely busy. Folks were calling dealerships and ordering trucks over the phone.\nHousing starts and home sales were up. If you were involved in building houses you probably had more work than you could keep up with. If you had a company, you hired people.\nAnd\u00a0it was not just major purchases such as housing and vehicle sales that were peaking.\nNew restaurants opened and people went to them \u2014 and it wasn't\u00a0just Friday and Saturday nights. It was every night of the week.\nPeople had more disposable income. When you have increased discretionary spending, it allows you to outfit your home with high-end electronics, have a quad at your cabin, or a new RV in a park where your kids can swim and play with their friends all weekend.\nThe benefits were\u00a0seen not just in St. John's and the surrounding area. People from across the province worked in the offshore oil and gas industry and brought those good wages back to their communities. A recent study conducted for Noia demonstrated the benefits were felt in all our communities.\nSchools and health-care facilities were being built, along with improvements to our road infrastructure. When the offshore oil and gas industry is thriving, there's\u00a0money in the provincial coffers for these important public services.\nWhen the price of oil took a downturn there is no doubt the entire province took a hit \u2014\u00a0as did the global economy.\nThe global industry has learned many lessons in the last number of years. In order to be successful, everyone involved in the oil and gas industry has had to change the way they operate.\n\u00a0\nNewfoundland and Labrador companies involved in the supply and service industry are no different. We are industry leaders and we've\u00a0adapted.\nWe have survived and are ready for the next challenge.\u00a0We hope that challenge is a new offshore development, one that showcases our expertise and allows us to grow and expand our unique capabilities.\nWe want to work on the next project offshore and employ our residents.\nWe want our industry to reach its potential and we want to be economic contributors to our province and our country.\nWe want to see a return to the peak of our industry and sustain that level of economic activity for decades, as everyone benefits when our industry is thriving.\nWe've\u00a0weathered the low price of oil and found our place in the global industry \u2014\u00a0and have emerged stronger, wiser, and prepared to succeed. And\u00a0we are only at the early stages of our industry with these lessons already learned.\nNow\u00a0we must ensure it's\u00a0not a regulatory obstacle that curtails our ability to be successful. We need processes related to the offshore that allow us to be competitive and\u00a0encourage international investment.\nWe know we're\u00a0blessed with natural resources beneath our ocean floor and those resources are needed. We also know they are wanted. Oil companies will only supply what we, as consumers demand.\nInternational companies marvel at our offshore potential. They recognize the global impact it can have, and they recognize the ability of the Newfoundland and Labrador supply and service industry to support safe and responsible development.\nSimply stated, our industry needs processes that support international investment and global competitiveness. If we have that, our industry can do the rest and every resident of this province will benefit from a thriving offshore oil and gas industry.\nThat is our goal and hopefully we we can accomplish it together.\nWe welcome\u00a0pitch ideas for Point of View columns for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador.

History tells us that.\nBut Trudeau has not made it easier for himself. And the partisan terrain Trudeau is contending with in 2019 is arguably trickier to traverse than anything his predecessors faced.\nBeyond the electoral math, there are the stakes \u2014 the hard things that weigh on the present and our sense of the future. It just so happens that Trudeau's personal struggle is playing out at what feels like a particularly telling moment for Canada and the rest of the Western world.\nAll of this will come to a crescendo on Monday with an election that is still difficult to predict.\nIt's currently fashionable to invoke the example of 1972, when Justin Trudeau's father very nearly became a one-term prime minister. In 1968, in the midst\u00a0of Trudeaumania, Pierre Trudeau's Liberals won 154 seats and 45\u00a0per cent of the popular vote. Four years later, the Liberals won 109 seats and 38\u00a0per cent and just barely held on to power.\nThat example has haunted Justin Trudeau since 2015. Trudeau himself has acknowledged it, joking with a group of his father's former aides at a lunch this past spring that the Liberal re-election slogan this year would be, \"The Land is Strong\" \u2014 the famously ponderous catchphrase the Liberals used in 1972.\nBut Pierre Trudeau's slide was not an anomaly. Nearly every prime minister's first majority has been followed by a fall.\nFrom 1984 to 1988, Brian Mulroney went from 211 seats and 50 per cent of the vote to 169 seats and 43 per cent.\nJohn Diefenbaker won\u00a0208 seats and 54 per cent of the vote in 1958. Four years later, the Progressive Conservatives settled for\u00a0116 seats and 37 per cent.\nJean Chr\u00e9tien\u00a0and Louis St. Laurent each lost 22 seats. Mackenzie King lost 18 seats.\nAnd those are the ones who managed to stay in government. R.B. Bennett was run out of office entirely\u00a0\u2014 making him the last prime minister to arrive with a majority and then be drummed out after a single term.\nNot since 1900 has a prime minister (Wilfrid Laurier)\u00a0followed a first majority with an even better result.\nTrudeau has at least had the benefit of a relatively steady economy. His father was faced with rising unemployment. Bennett had to deal with the Great Depression. Mulroney had to sell free trade.\nAll of which might have been expected to put Trudeau in a better place going into the campaign. But maybe a growing economy matters less when \"affordability\" is the new concern and insecurity seems the dominant mood.\nThere is something\u00a0challenging\u00a0as well\u00a0about the current pace of world events. It wasn't that long ago that Trudeau's fate seemed to hinge on his ability\u00a0to avoid disaster while renegotiating\u00a0NAFTA with Donald Trump.\u00a0A year later, that whole ordeal is\u00a0hardly ever mentioned.\u00a0  Of course,\u00a0it is also true that\u00a0none of those other prime ministers had to pause, mid-campaign, to explain why they had once worn blackface.\nJustin Trudeau was always going to have to contend with the promises he made in 2015 and the inevitable gulf between the highest hopes and reality.\nTo that was added the\u00a0weight of the SNC-Lavalin affair. The ethics commissioner's report in August didn't seem to dent public support for the Liberals\u00a0\u2014 only because the damage had been done already. But it shrank Trudeau's margin for error. And then Time magazine published those photos.\nOnce again, Liberal support in public polling didn't seem to suffer. But it's hard not to wonder whether the Liberals might be three or four points higher now if not for those images.\nMaybe few voters, if any,\u00a0came away believing that Trudeau was a fundamentally racist person. But the pictures added to a narrative\u00a0\u2014 driven hard by Trudeau's political opponents\u00a0\u2014 that Trudeau is not what he purports to be, that he is less than he promises. Even if it did nothing more than\u00a0dampen enthusiasm for Trudeau, that could be enough to matter in an election this close.\nIn the disruptive wake\u00a0of that revelation, the campaign of Jagmeet Singh seemed to find new energy.\nThe NDP campaign was already narrowly exceeding very low expectations.\u00a0But because of who he is and what he said, Singh's responses to Trudeau's mistakes were uniquely compelling.\nThen came a series of debate performances in which Singh seemed relaxed and good-natured\u00a0\u2014\u00a0qualities that were not otherwise abundant on those stages.\u00a0Between Oct. 9 and Oct. 18, the NDP shot up five percentage points in opinion polls.\nFor all that, the NDP\u00a0still entered this weekend polling at 18.8 per cent.\u00a0In 2015, Tom Mulcair's NDP won 19.7 per cent of the vote.\nConservative support is also effectively flat. In 2015, Stephen Harper's Conservatives won 31.9 per cent of the vote. Four years later, Scheer's Conservatives\u00a0were\u00a0polling at 31.7 per cent.\nScheer's\u00a0party might try to blame Maxime Bernier's People's Party for shaving a few points off their total. But if the Conservatives were feeling better about things, they might not be spending the final days worrying loudly about coalition governments and phantom tax hikes.\nSo what has\u00a0changed?\nThe Greens are polling nearly five points higher, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is up more than two points and the Liberals are down almost eight.\nIf those numbers are accurate, and if they hold (and it's impossible to know what late mood swings and actual turnout will mean to the final result), Trudeau's drop would be in line with what Mulroney suffered in 1988 and what happened to his father in 1972. But\u00a02015 left Trudeau with less room to work with.\nWith slightly higher support (and some polls have the Liberals at 34 per cent)\u00a0Trudeau could come close to matching the relatively small drop that Chr\u00e9tien\u00a0experienced between 1993 and 1997\u00a0\u2014 from 41.2 per cent to 38.5 per cent. That amounted to a comfortable majority for the Chr\u00e9tien\u00a0government.\nBut the divide in Canadian politics was then on the right\u00a0\u2014 the old Progressive Conservative party had split, with the space it once occupied\u00a0consumed by the Reform Party and the Bloc. On the left, the NDP was a minor player. The Green party barely existed. Together, the NDP and Greens took less than 12 per cent of the popular vote in 1997.\nTwenty two years later, opinion polls suggest those two parties\u00a0could finish with\u00a0the combined support of more than a quarter of the electorate. And some number of other voters with progressive values are currently siding with the Bloc\u00a0-- the NDP's rise nationally is mirrored by a similar boost for the BQ in Quebec.\nWhile his party is polling in the 30s, Trudeau does not seem to be\u00a0wildly out of step with public opinion.\nThirty-seven per cent of respondents to a recent Angus Reid survey identified climate change\u00a0\u2014 one of the key points of distinction between the Liberals and Conservatives\u00a0\u2014 as one of their top two issues, a higher share of those polled than for any other issue. A combined 55 per cent would like to see the federal carbon price either maintained or increased.\nFifty-seven per cent prefer running a deficit to focusing on balancing the budget. A majority of respondents preferred the Liberal approach to housing affordability and opioid treatment to the Conservative positions. And a plurality preferred the Liberal proposal to gradually expand pharmacare.\nBut on almost all issues \u2014 climate change, in particular \u2014 the Liberals are competing with both the NDP and the Greens.\u00a0In a simple match-up, voters might prefer a Trudeau government to a Scheer government. But those aren't the only options on the ballot. And voters have seemed willing to look beyond Trudeau to see where they might invest either their hopes or their frustrations.\nAlso not on the ballot, but buried within the choices that millions of Canadians have made and will make, are the seismic issues of this moment: climate change, of course, but also\u00a0economic security, inclusion, reconciliation, populism, nationalism, the future shape of liberal democracy and the international order. Trudeau himself once spoke of this election in terms of what it might mean for climate policy in Canada\u00a0\u2014 a frame that put added responsibility on him.\nTrudeau has perhaps struggled in this campaign in a way he didn't struggle in 2015 \u2014 to capture a feeling, or to rise above it all. Some of that could be put down to the difference between running as a challenger and running as an incumbent. Some of that is simply a reflection of a general election campaign that has been more of a grind (though we've definitely had worse\u00a0outings).\u00a0\nHe has tried to put himself and his government front and centre on the major issues of the day, but he has been unable to move as fast or as far as some would like. He was a massive personality when he arrived, but that may have left him vulnerable. He\u00a0can talk about what he's done over the last four years to address the public's concerns, and what he would do with the next four \u2014 but he also has simply had a harder time getting a hearing\u00a0in 2019.\nWhat the Liberals sought was a direct fight with Scheer's Conservatives. For a while, it seemed like they might get that. And they have tried to bring it back to that choice in the final two weeks. But things ended up more complicated.\u00a0\nIf, in the end result, Trudeau falls too far there will be ample second-guessing: about whether he could have done more to seize the moment or whether he should have done something differently on the trail or at the debates or even whether there is something about the social-media age that has made it harder to govern.\nBut the crowds the Liberals have been able to draw in the final days suggests a number people are still interested in what he has to say. In the waning hours, the Liberals might be finally showing some momentum \u2014 aided by the fact that Scheer is struggling to fend off questions about a covert operation to attack Maxime Bernier.\nIf Trudeau is lucky, he'll get more time to continue wrestling with it all.\nBut, barring an unforeseen majority, the next Parliament will be harder still\u00a0\u2014 for whoever governs.\nIf potential Liberal supporters turn out in sufficient numbers \u2014 particularly in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia \u2014 and the party ends up closer to 35 per cent overall, the Liberals may return with the largest number of seats, but still in need of other parties' support.\nIf Liberal support slips closer to 30, Trudeau may find himself with the second-largest number of\u00a0seats and decisions to make about whether he can pull together a government for these uncertain times.\nAt some point in the first four years in office, Trudeau and his team adopted the phrase, \"Hard things are hard\"\u00a0\u2014 a credo picked up from Barack Obama's White House.\nThe Liberal leader has not always done enough to avoid making things harder for himself. Things seems unlikely to get much easier for him anytime soon.\n"}, {"author": "Aaron Wherry", "title": "In 2019, Justin Trudeau has baggage - and faces a very different political landscape", "description": "The Liberals aren't just coping with a leader who's lost his halo.

Things seems unlikely to get much easier for him anytime soon.\n"}, {"author": "Angela Gemmill", "title": "Sudbury's budget committee approves 22 projects \u2014 including security for downtown", "description": "Proposed tax increase currently at 3.4 per cent, but 2020 budget still not finalized", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/sudbury-budget-day4-1.5390390", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5386517.1575607199!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sudbury-s-finance-committee.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 10, 2019 7:02 AM ET", "2019-12-13T20:57:09.524Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Sudbury city councillors firmed up plans Monday night to spend money on 22 different projects \u2014 all part of the 2020 budget deliberations.\nAfter four budget sessions, the financial plan for next year in Greater Sudbury still hasn't been finalized, but it's close.

They bought a house and had two children, now seven and two years old, and she started a part-time photography business.\nIn July, owner Canfor Corp. announced the mill where she worked as a weigh-scale operator would close again. Because it's an \"indefinite curtailment,\" Dumoulin said, there was no severance paid.\nMeanwhile, her husband, a contract log truck driver, lost his job delivering to the nearby Conifex Timber Inc. sawmill during a five-week curtailment blamed on high log costs and difficult market conditions.\nThe good news is the Conifex shutdown ended, she said.\n\"There's that saying, 'You do me wrong once, shame on you; do me wrong twice, shame on me,\"' Dumoulin said in an interview.\n\"I'm not letting that happen a third time. I need to get out of this industry.\"\nThis year's mill closures and production curtailments in British Columbia have\u00a0affected more than 5,900 workers at 25 mills in 22 communities, according to provincial estimates.\nObservers say the frustrating part is that little can be done to fix the problem.\nDestruction caused by wildfires and a severe mountain pine beetle infestation \u2014 both linked to global warming \u2014 have created acute shortages of wood fibre in B.C. that will take decades to replace.\nMeanwhile, a slowdown in U.S. housing markets means prices are depressed but the province says stumpage fees for Crown timber \u2014 adjusted quarterly \u2014 can't be reduced arbitrarily for fear of weakening Canada's legal fight against softwood lumber duties imposed by the U.S.\nMarty Gibbons, president of the United Steelworkers union local in Kamloops, B.C., estimates more than 400 of his members have lost jobs thanks to the closures of sawmills in Clearwater and Clinton, B.C.\nBut the longtime forestry worker says there's no comparison with previous industry slowdowns in 2008 and 2015.\n\"This isn't a slowdown, this is a capacity reduction,\" he said. \"These are not temporary layoffs, this is a correction in the industry ... we just don't have enough timber to supply the mills.\"\nAnalysts expect the industry will see a lot more bad news before there's much good news.\nResearchers at FEA Canada estimate there will be 53 to 55 sawmills left in the B.C. Interior by 2028, down from about 95 mills in 2007, in a report based mainly on provincial timber supply estimates.\n\"It takes 80 years to grow a tree. So, looking out 50 to 60 years, it looks pretty good,\" said Russ Taylor, managing director of FEA Canada.\n\"But in the interim it's going to stay relatively flat, for the next two or three, maybe four decades.\"\nThe lack of wood fibre is expected to spill over into closures in the oriented strandboard panel sector, where two mills were closed this year, and will eventually hit the pulp and paper industry as well, said Kevin Mason, managing director of ERA Forest Products Research.\nClosures through the end of the year are expected to cumulatively remove about two billion board feet per year of capacity, from recent annual output of between 10 billion and 11 billion board feet, he said.\n\"These are difficult transitions and not a day goes by that I am not thinking about the workers and communities who are being affected by these closures and curtailments,\" said B.C. Forests Minister Doug Donaldson in an emailed statement.\nHe said he is working to ensure support systems are in place for forestry workers, including job fairs, skills training and career counselling, support for families and economic diversification strategies.\nHe offered a similar message in Mackenzie in mid-August, speaking at a rally organized by a new organization founded by three local women called Mackenzie Matters.\nKim Guthrie, a 57-year-old notary public who chairs the group, said she fears for the future of the community she and her husband moved to about 30 years ago.\n\"We don't want to leave.

Economists suggest Canada's unemployment rate right now is likely around 20 per cent. Earlier this week, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney unveiled projections for the province's unemployment rate to reach 25 per cent. Those are shocking figures for a country accustomed to single-digit unemployment, but that's what happens in a pandemic when a nation deliberately shuts down its economy.\u00a0Read more about the unemployment situation.  A second important figure to be released today will be COVID-19 projections from the federal government.\u00a0CBC's \u00c9ric Grenier writes that the projections that governments across the country are relying on now are imperfect but still important, because they allow governments to assess their capacity to handle the spread of the virus, explain the reasons behind restrictive preventative measures and prepare for the future.\u00a0Read more about what the federal government's coronavirus modelling can tell us, and what it can't.  Over the past week, laboratory backlogs for coronavirus testing have cleared, but restrictions on who will be tested still remain in most parts of Canada. As CBC's Kelly Crowe writes, the hard truth is that testing will continue to be limited, even in Ontario, which has just announced it will soon be able to test 19,000 people a day. So why is testing such a big problem?

For the six million people who live with a disability in Canada, measures surrounding COVID-19 have posed challenges, from increasing isolation to families not being able to get respite support to broader fears around contracting the disease. The federal government has been rolling out financial support for Canadians, but is hasn't addressed the specific issues encountered by people with disabilities and their families and caregivers. \"We really need to hear some statements about people with disabilities and their families, coming directly from the prime minister,\" said Krista Carr, executive vice-president of the Canadian Association for Community Living.\u00a0Read more about how the pandemic is affecting those with disabilities.  Since the pandemic began, California hospitals have been preparing for an influx of COVID-19 patients \u2014 the dreaded surge.\u00a0It has yet to arrive.

Howe Institute, a Canadian economic think-tank, was co-author of a report last month examining why Canadian inflation was out of sync with the wider economy.\nOne factor, the research concluded, was\u00a0that economic improvements for those with lower income\u00a0tended to spur higher inflation, because people strapped for cash\u00a0are more likely to spend everything. That spending helps to bid up prices.\nWhen the economy instead is rewarding\u00a0people at the high end, they are more likely to invest than spend, and inflation stays lower.\nAnd while the latest employment\u00a0numbers showed Canada lost jobs, employers are still crying out for workers to fill some 400,000\u00a0empty\u00a0positions\u00a0if only they could find the right people.\n\"Employment is still strong and wage growth actually went up really well,\" said Omran. \"It was the strongest increase in wages since 2009.\"\nBut as Omran\u00a0said, in a complicated world, no single cause shapes the inflation figure.\nIn general, higher inflation is a sign of a strong economy, showing that consumers and businesses are using up spare capacity, including labour.\nBut when food prices fall because the Canadian harvest comes in, that makes people better off while recirculating money in the domestic economy. Energy costs, which have been falling in spite of fear mongering over carbon pricing, have a dual effect, making consumers better off but starving the oil-producing regions\u00a0of income and jobs.\nOn Friday a poll of bank economists by the business wire service Bloomberg\u00a0showed a consensus that inflation would fall from two\u00a0per cent\u00a0to 1.6 per cent, with\u00a0retail sales declining by 0.3\u00a0per cent, as falling auto sales weighed on dealers.\nHowever, gloomy prognostications south of the border did not pan out. Last week U.S. core inflation, a figure that leaves out volatile food and energy prices, rose sharply for the second month running. On Thursday, sharply higher retail sales surprised U.S. markets, seemingly indicating that consumers have not been put off by global signs of distress.\nAs to the wider machinations of the global economy, Omran says they will have an effect in Canada. New economic stimulus abroad in the form of low or negative interest rates will make Canadian imports cheaper, pushing inflation lower. But by pumping up the economy they may also stimulate foreign demand, including for Canadian products.\nA general\u00a0weakening in global\u00a0manufacturing, notably in Germany and China,\u00a0damaged\u00a0by the U.S.-China trade battle, may hit Canadian exports of raw materials, though there will still likely be demand for products such as food and gold.\u00a0\nA general fall in demand for oil is likely to hit expensive producers first, one possible reason why the Koch brothers sold out of Canadian\u00a0oilsands investments earlier this month.\nSo far the Canadian and the North American economy, based on services and on trade within the NAFTA area and most of all dependent on consumer spending,\u00a0has\u00a0been relatively\u00a0isolated from oddities such as\u00a0negative mortgage\u00a0rates.\nBut with consumers so crucial to the economy, negative headlines and global gloom may already be having an effect.\nNew data from the U.S. released on Friday showed that consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in seven months, partly motivated by interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, said Richard Curtin, the economist in charge of the survey conducted by the University of Michigan.\u00a0\n\"Consumers concluded, following the Fed's lead, that they may need to reduce spending in anticipation of a potential recession,\" said Curtin.\nIronically, the rate cuts that U.S. President Donald Trump championed as a means of stimulating\u00a0the economy may actually be having the opposite effect.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1555456067808", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Cities urge federal leaders to wade into wastewater debate", "description": "Billions of litres of untreated wastewater pouring into Canadian waterways: Environment Canada", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/wastewater-sewage-lakes-rivers-canada-election-1.5267326", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5267331.1567348629!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-environment-wastewater-20190830.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 01, 2019 10:43 AM ET", "2019-09-01T14:43:33.422Z"], "source": null, "content": "In Canada's largest city, raw sewage flows into Lake Ontario so often, Toronto tells people they should never swim off the city's beaches for least two days after it rains.\nAcross the country in Mission, B.C., a three-decade-old pipe that carries sewage under the Fraser River to a treatment plant in Abbotsford is so loaded operators can't even slip a camera inside it to look for damage.

Poor market conditions and log shortages due to outside forces such as\u00a0the mountain pine beetle and wildfires\u00a0are causing mills to shutter, leaving towns that are dependent on the lumber industry scrambling to adapt\u00a0and search\u00a0for new ways to diversify their economies.\nTolko employee Jennifer Johnson said she was in shock when she learned last month the sawmill she works at in Quesnel will close this summer.\n\"It's definitely going to be a struggle because there's not a great deal of jobs that have around the same pay or benefits,\" she said.\nJohnson\u00a0and her family had been planning to buy a house, but that's now on hold.\u00a0\nThe last day of work will be tough for her and the rest of the staff. \"There's probably going to be some tears shed I'm sure,\" she said.\nJohnson's story is common across B.C.\nDoug Donaldson, B.C.'s minister of forests, lands, natural resource operations and rural development, said he isn't surprised by the closures and drastic reductions in operations.\u00a0\n\"These curtailments and shutdowns were the result of natural and global forces,\u00a0and they didn't happen overnight,\u00a0and that's what's so frustrating,\" Donaldson told\u00a0Daybreak North\u00a0host Carolina de Ryk.\u00a0\nA weak U.S. housing market and low harvest levels because of\u00a0mountain pine beetles, as well as wildfires and\u00a0land used for caribou protection, are some of the primary factors affecting the industry, said\u00a0Harry Nelson, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia's\u00a0faculty of forestry.\u00a0\n\"Our main market is the U.S.,\" said Nelson. \"Essentially, we've had pretty good U.S. housing markets improving over the last few years,\u00a0and they've just become much weaker this past spring.\n\"And as demand has come off [for timber], prices have as well too.\"\nAdd that\u00a0to\u00a0a low supply of timber, and the industry is struggling to get by.\nTolko's\u00a0upcoming mill closure in Quesnel\u00a0is a big\u00a0hit to the Cariboo city with a population of 12,000.\nMayor Bob Simpson said the city was\u00a0expecting it.\u00a0The\u00a0annual allowable cut for timber was\u00a0decreased about two years ago,\u00a0and Tolko had been struggling, he said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"That sense of surprise still settles in because you don't want to believe it's going to happen, but\u00a0as a [city] council,\u00a0we said it's going to happen,\" said Simpson, former forestry critic for the B.C.

It will be around a $400,000 loss to the city when they fully decommission the mill.\"\nThe city is trying to diversify its economy by growing its agriculture and tourism sectors, but the mayor still considers Quesnel a forestry town.\nWith West Fraser's large sawmill, two pulp mills, and medium density fibreboard operation, as well as the C and C Wood Products\u00a0operations, Simpson believes there is enough variety in forest manufacturing for it to remain a foundation of the city's economy.\u00a0\n\"We have the luxury \u2014 and it's the fundamental difference between ourselves and say the Clearwaters, or even 100 Mile Houses \u2014 we have the most concentrated diverse manufacturing in the forest sector all in our community,\" said Simpson.\nIn May, the province passed a bill to amend the\u00a0Forest Act, which gives it\u00a0the right to review forest tenure transfers between companies.\nTenure swaps now have to pass the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations's\u00a0public interest test. It also creates the opportunity for more tenure to go to First Nations and communities, said Donaldson.\nIn the short term, the province is trying to help workers who have lost their jobs by connecting them with Service\u00a0Canada, Work B.C.\u00a0and retraining opportunities, he said.\n\"But we also want to see the mills get up and running again.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Antique items from historic St. George house up for sale", "description": "Candelabras, bookcases, china sets and silverware among the possessions go on sale", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/antique-items-historic-mansion-sale-1.5228619", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5012504.1564411028!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/gillmor-house.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 29, 2019 4:35 PM AT", "2019-07-29T20:59:17.313Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A historic, two-storey house is up for sale in St. George, along with its collection of antique items.\u00a0\nGillmor House was built in 1846 by Arthur Hill Gillmor, a businessman, politician and opponent of Confederation who became a Canadian senator.\nNow, after housing six generations of the family, the estate is up for sale for the first time.\nSara Sparks, a descendent of Gillmor, is organizing the sale.\u00a0\n\"When you have a house of this size with the amount of stuff that's in it, should someone buy it, you cannot clear it at the drop of a hat,\" Sparks said in an interview with Information Morning Saint John.\n\"And there are so many collectibles, curios, beautiful old furniture beds.

The organizations houses as many as 90 people per day and more than 300 people per year.\nOf most urgent need on Adsum House's Christmas wish list this year are new women's pyjamas in all sizes, extra small through to 3X.\nAlso, grocery gift cards in any denomination would also be appreciated.\n\"But there's something on that list basically in every price range, you know, from shampoo, toothpaste, through to things like pyjamas and housecoats,\" said\u00a0McNab.\nNew items can be dropped off at the Christmas collection location at 3671B Dutch Village Rd., Monday to Friday. McNab said\u00a0it's best to call her ahead of time at 902-266-2650 to make sure someone is there to receive the items.\nFeed Nova Scotia supports dozens of charities across the province.\nThe organization has a number of programs this Christmas, including Hearts for Christmas, where people can sponsor a family with children to ensure there's something under the tree and food on the table.\nFeed Nova Scotia also sells A Case\u00a0of Compassion,\u00a0where people can buy a case of wine and 25 per cent of the funds raised go to the organization.\nAs well, the annual turkey drive last year bought 4,311 turkeys for Nova Scotians in need. A $25 gift buys one turkey.\nTheriault\u00a0said\u00a0food insecurity and poverty are year-round problems for many Nova Scotians. Donations are always welcome. If people can't afford to donate, Feed Nova Scotia is always looking for volunteers.\nShelter Nova Scotia operates six facilities in the Halifax Regional Municipality, providing a warm place to sleep for about 134 people each night.\nAmong the items most needed on the organization's holiday wish list are new pyjamas in all sizes for both men and women, various gift cards, underwear and socks.\nA full list of items can be found here.\nDonated items can be dropped off at Metro Turning Point Shelter on Barrington Street, seven days a week between noon and 8 p.m.\u00a0Barry House on Gottingen Street will also accept items seven days a week from noon until 8 p.m.\nIf you'd like to donate on behalf of a loved one this Christmas, you can do so here and receive an\u00a0e-card for printing.\nMonetary donations can be made online.\nPhoenix is a non-profit organization that supports youth between the ages of 11 and 24.\nFor its Christmas wish list, the organization is looking for:\nAll items can be dropped off\u00a0at the Phoenix Centre for Youth, located at 6035 Coburg Rd.

The organization also runs programs with youth to help them find employment and does anti-human trafficking work in the community as well, said\u00a0Stacey Dlamini, the group's executive director.\nThe home helps about 30 youth every year end their homelessness, who stay an average of 10 weeks. She said the drop-in events cater to about 65 people.\nDlamini said\u00a0of particular need are toiletries and winter\u00a0clothing. But this time of year, it's nice to have small gifts for clients, such as gift cards for groceries of local coffee shops, earbuds and phone chargers.\nDonated grocery gift cards\u00a0allow the organization to buy fresh produce to serve those staying at the home. Also, gift cards to local coffee shops are appreciated.\nDlamini said\u00a0the organization also operates the \"12 days of Christmas,\" where they plan 12 activities throughout December.\n\"It's a sad time of year for a lot of people. And for young people who are not with their families,\u00a0I think it's particularly a difficult time, so we try and fill our activities with, like, cheerful things,\" she said.\nDonations are accepted pretty much anytime at 603 East River Rd. in New Glasgow. Online donations are also accepted through Canada Helps.\nViola's Place is an eight-bed emergency shelter in New Glasgow that helps people find a hot meal, clothing and a warm place to sleep.\nLisa Deyoung, shelter manager, said\u00a0gift cards go a long way in helping clients find a warm place to wait during the day. The shelter is closed\u00a0daily from 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Gift cards to places that serve coffee in small denominations are welcome.\nDonations of grocery gift cards also help the shelter purchase much-needed items like laundry detergent and other day-to-day items.\nPeople can also donate online through their website.\nIf monetary donations are not possible, Deyoung said\u00a0the shelter is always looking for volunteers.\n\"That would be a huge help for us because we're strictly volunteer-based,\" she said. \"That's the the main thing that helps us keep our doors open every day.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "'Outrageous': Owners of 514 Wellington will sue after city committee denies appeal to demolish mansion", "description": "Demolition of 110-year-old home stalled in June after neighbourhood nominated for heritage status", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-514-wellington-appeal-denied-1.5281989", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280267.1571917930!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/514-wellington.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 12, 2019 10:18 PM CT", "2019-09-13T03:18:14.511Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The lawyer for the owners of a sprawling 110-year-old mansion in one of Winnipeg's most exclusive neighbourhoods says they'll sue the city, after a city committee halted plans to demolish the property to make way for a new development.\n\"This is outrageous,\" said Jamie Kagan, the lawyer representing a group that bought the mansion at 514 Wellington Crescent in April 2016.\n\"You have a multi-million dollar development being held up \u2014 after you've issued a building permit, after we've been seven weeks in demolition, and then you say stop.\"\nKagan spoke to media Thursday after a nearly seven-hour meeting on the 8,000-square-foot mansion, originally scheduled to be demolished in June.\nThat plan was stopped when the Crescentwood neighbourhood \u2014 where the mansion is located \u2014 was nominated as a heritage district on June 6, suspending the new owners'\u00a0demolition and building permit hours before demolition was to begin.\nThe destruction of the home has been\u00a0vocally opposed by the Crescentwood heritage district conservation committee and a community group called\u00a0Save 514 Wellington.\nOn Thursday, the city's\u00a0property and planning committee rejected Kagan's appeal of the decision, after being split in a 2-2 vote.\nKagan\u00a0said afterward owners \"absolutely\" plan to sue, and he expects to have the lawsuit ready within the month.\nChristine Skene, a member Save 514 Wellington, said she's happy with the result.\n\"It's the outcome we wanted,\" she said. \"However, there's some bittersweet part to it, because the owner has pretty much demolished the interior of the house.\"\nJeff Thompson, the principal of the group that purchased the home, told CBC News Wednesday he and others in the group had planned to build multi-family dwellings, and each intended\u00a0take a suite of their own for themselves and\u00a0their families.\n\"[City planners] loved what we were doing \u2026 they wanted an elegant modern building that fit in with the neighbourhood,\" he said Wednesday.\nKagan argued in the meeting Thursday orders to stop the tear-down were motivated by political pressure from area residents. He said\u00a0the property sat on the market for a year before his clients bought it, adding\u00a0the group has spent over $2 million to develop the land, including the purchase price.\nSt. Vital Coun.

This places us in the bottom half of OECD member countries, behind Ireland, Slovenia and the United States, where Americans are predicted to save more than triple that amount.\n\"Canadians are currently spending more of their income to service their debts than Americans, which partly explains the lower savings rate,\" says Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. But our money isn't just going toward our debt.\n\"Savings is taking a hit because the cost of living is going up,\" says certified financial planner Shannon Lee Simmons.\nIn the more than ten years that Simmons has been advising clients on their finances, she's seen the amount of money Canadians are able to put away every month decrease for a number of reasons including stagnating wages and the rising price of necessities like gas, groceries, daycare and housing.\nSimmons says housing used to account for around 30 to 35 per cent of people's take-home pay and even less for renters. Now, because wages aren't keeping pace with housing costs, that amount has grown to 45 or 50 per cent for some households.\nKeeping up with the @Joneses\n\"We also have this really intense pressure to spend that I just didn't see five-plus years ago,\" Simmons adds. \"And then we don't tend to say no to those things that we can't afford.\"\nSimmons says this is partially driven by changing expectations of what daily life is supposed to cost and what we're supposed to provide for our families. For example, she cites the increasing popularity of home renovations and the plethora of children's extracurricular activities available today.\n\"Social media has a lot to do with it. We look at how other people are living that are in our same peer group, and we think, 'Well, maybe I should be doing that, too, because I don't want to fall behind.'\"\nThe result of this spending is visible in Canada's household debt to income ratio which, according to Finder.com, has been rising since the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe majority of Canadians aged 20 and over admit to making money mistakes, whether it's overspending on lifestyle or making a bad investment. But Simmons says that not being able to save the benchmark 10 per cent of your pre-tax income doesn't mean you're a financial failure.\nSomething is still better than nothing\nSimmons doesn't promote a set amount her clients should be saving because it implies that anything less is not worth striving for. \"I would rather someone save a little bit than just give up altogether because they feel like the goal is too unrealistic.\"\nInstead, she says, you should use that benchmark as a catalyst to examine why you're not reaching your savings goals and make changes accordingly.\nSimmons says the first thing to do is to figure out what you can and can't afford to save by mapping out your money.\nOne tool that can help people who are struggling to figure out how much they can afford to save is Thrive Savings, a Canadian app that connects to your bank account and uses artificial intelligence to evaluate your bills and spending habits, determine what you're able to save, and automatically put that money toward pre-set goals like a vacation or emergency fund.\nAccording to Thrive founder and CEO Jordan Wimmer, 65 per cent of Thrive's users identify as working part-time, freelance or on demand \u2014 a community that's not always able to take advantage of typical automatic savings plans.\nWimmer says that \"even at small amounts, Thrive shows users that, yes, they can actually save money, which in turn further empowers the user to save even more.\" She says 50 per cent of Thrive users ask to increase their savings rates after one month of using the service and save $80 per month on average.\nHoning your financial focus\nOnce you've figured out what you are able to save, Simmons encourages prioritizing based on where you'll get the biggest bang for your buck. For example, if you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that down first. Then you can start to look at building an emergency savings account, saving for a house or putting some money away for retirement.\nOther apps that can help you save with minimal effort include Money Box, which, like Thrive, allows you to set savings goals, make contributions and track your progress. If you want to invest the money you're saving, Mylo and Wealthsimple have apps that connect to your debit and credit cards to round up your purchases and put that money into an investment account.\nSimmons recommends having two chequing accounts: one for fixed expenses like rent, phone and car payments, and a second for discretionary spending. If you only spend money from your discretionary account, you don't have to worry about budgeting, she says. She suggests using a banking app to check in on your balance regularly to stay aware of where you're at. Experts also agree that comparison shopping when opening a bank account or getting a credit card can help you save on fees and interest rates.\nLastly, Simmons recommends seeking unbiased and individualized financial advice from someone who isn't trying to sell you insurance or investment products. This can help you sort out your financial goals and priorities, and provide you with strategies that fit your specific needs.\n\"Life is long, and there are periods of time where you're able to save and there are periods of time where sometimes just breaking even is the goal,\" says Simmons. Whether it's starting a business or paying for daycare, its normal to experience ebbs and flows in savings patterns. \"The problem is when you're never in one of the upticks.\"\nEva Voinigescu is a freelance journalist and producer.

Expect the pace to pick up again\u00a0now that the federal election campaign is over, eliminating the risk of causing controversies that could hurt their Conservative cousins.\nSince the PCs adjourned in the legislature in early June,\u00a0Ford has altered the face of his government. He made a significant cabinet shuffle, and his controversial chief of staff Dean French resigned amid accusations of nepotism.\nHere's what the Ford government is expected to do in the coming weeks and months:\u00a0\nThe biggest challenge facing the Ford government this fall will be getting contract deals with the three big teachers'\u00a0unions without a strike. The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) are in\u00a0the midst of taking strike votes and their contract talks have bogged down. The Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) is also preparing to take a strike vote that would conclude by mid-November.\nThe biggest sticking point in negotiations so far involves high school class sizes. While the government had set out a four-year plan to increase the average class size to 28 (from 22 last year), Education Minister Stephen\u00a0Lecce\u00a0revealed last week that he's now proposing an average class size of 25. OSSTF president Harvey Bischof\u00a0says the move would still result in the elimination of some 5,000 teaching jobs.

Expect the pace to pick up again\u00a0now that the federal election campaign is over, eliminating the risk of causing controversies that could hurt their Conservative cousins.\nSince the PCs adjourned in the legislature in early June,\u00a0Ford has altered the face of his government. He made a significant cabinet shuffle, and his controversial chief of staff Dean French resigned amid accusations of nepotism.\nHere's what the Ford government is expected to do in the coming weeks and months:\u00a0\nThe biggest challenge facing the Ford government this fall will be getting contract deals with the three big teachers'\u00a0unions without a strike. The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) are in\u00a0the midst of taking strike votes and their contract talks have bogged down. The Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) is also preparing to take a strike vote that would conclude by mid-November.\nThe biggest sticking point in negotiations so far involves high school class sizes. While the government had set out a four-year plan to increase the average class size to 28 (from 22 last year), Education Minister Stephen\u00a0Lecce\u00a0revealed last week that he's now proposing an average class size of 25. OSSTF president Harvey Bischof\u00a0says the move would still result in the elimination of some 5,000 teaching jobs.

Our population is at an all-time high, unemployment is at a record low and our economy is growing, in large part thanks to immigration.\"\nThe mayor of Hamilton\u00a0also spoke out against the sign, saying his family\u00a0moved to Canada from the Netherlands\u00a0for \"a better future.\"\n\"Immigrants have and will continue to make our country better,\" Fred Eisenberger said on Twitter.\nOn Sunday, Pattison Outdoor Advertising, which owns the billboards, said the ads would come down in response to the criticism.\n\"It was never my or Pattison Outdoor's intention to offend, alienate or in any way insult the public by allowing this ad to run,\" president Randy Otto wrote, adding the company would review its advocacy guidelines.\nEarlier that day, the company had said that if anyone took issue with the content, they should contact the third-party group running them.\nBut now Smeenk is saying he also takes issue with the content, and that his company was meant to just be the messenger.\n\"The True North Strong & Free Advertising Corp was created as a vehicle to help third-party activists promote their views prior to the upcoming election with the intention that this would be welcomed as an innovative way to participate in our democratic process,\" wrote Smeenk.\nElections Canada requires all third-party partisan advertising to include a clearly visible tagline identifying the group behind it and indicating that group has authorized the ad.

There is some flexibility, usually\u00a0a couple weeks, but only nine beds for adults in the province are dedicated to residential treatment of 90 days.\nThe province says\u00a0long-term treatment is available by accessing a patchwork of different services\u00a0\u2014\u00a0detox, inpatient treatment, transitional beds, outpatient counselling \u2014 but often with gaps in between.\u00a0\n\"We're setting them up for failure,\" said Dr. Peter Butt, a leading addictions specialist in Saskatchewan.\u00a0\nThe 28-day model that has become standard in Canada was a misguided replica of the U.S.\u00a0system, says Butt.\n\"Twenty-eight\u00a0days is what American\u00a0\u2026 health insurance companies would pay for recovery services down in the States. That's it,\" he said. \"And so the programs were modelled based upon the funding structure. It had nothing to do with efficacy, nothing to do with evidence, nothing to do with outcome.\"\nAs\u00a0epidemics involving opioids and\u00a0methamphetamine\u00a0have spiked in recent years, shining a spotlight on the reach of substance abuse, there have been calls to have addiction talked about as a chronic disease, similar to diabetes or cancer\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and treatment reflect as much.\nButt is\u00a0blunt that there is no one-size-fits-all, cookie-cutter solution for drug treatment.\u00a0But\u00a0he says it should include a minimum of three months of continuous\u00a0treatment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0although not restricted to residential facilities\u00a0\u2014\u00a0followed by transitional support that lasts at least one\u00a0year.\n\"It's absolutely a national issue. Every province struggles with this. You might have projects or programs or places where there's an oasis of good practice\u00a0\u2026 but in terms of a provincial-wide, sustained system of care, we have yet to see it in the country,\" Butt said.\nKathy Willerth, director of mental health and addictions with Saskatchewan's Ministry of Health, says her goal is to close any gaps in the province's system and guarantee \"90 days of engagement\" with\u00a0\"a warm handoff\" when people\u00a0move between treatment services. A recent budget increase will add 50 transitional beds, she said.\nCBC News spoke to multiple women in Saskatchewan who described the heartbreaking and financially crippling impact of having a child fall through the cracks.\nAndrew Nordal admits he would lie, steal and bully his mother,\u00a0Ronni, in a bid to get money to buy drugs.\n\"I knew how to push my mom's button and get what I wanted,\" said the 30-year-old. He became addicted to cocaine in high school\u00a0and later, crystal meth.\n\"I would steal.\u00a0I would manipulate my family for money.\u2026\u00a0I was dealing drugs. I was breaking in drug dealer's houses to get drugs.\"\nRonni\u00a0Nordal repeatedly arranged for her son to get counselling and drug treatment in Saskatchewan's public health system. He completed\u00a0a 28-day program\u00a0in Saskatoon three separate times. On the last stint, he was allowed to stay a couple of extra weeks.\nEach time, he relapsed.\u00a0\nHis parents were at their breaking point.\n\"I was exhausted,\" Ronni\u00a0Nordal said. \"And I couldn't fight it, and I didn't know what to do.\n\"We both loved him with all our hearts. But\u00a0at some point, we were going to have to not have him in our lives. And we came to the conclusion\u00a0that for us to be OK\u00a0with ourselves, we were going to try one more thing.\"\nThat one more thing was private, long-term residential treatment in B.C. Nordal was quoted between $7,000 and\u00a0$12,000 a month. Nordal, a lawyer, did as much research as she could online, but was leery of unregulated private facilities.\n\"As someone phoning, you don't know if it's a gimmick.\u2026 You don't know if it's a hotel that's fancy.\"\nAndrew's story so far is one of success. In October 2016, he began five\u00a0months of intensive residential rehab at the Last Door Recovery Centre in New Westminster, B.C., followed by several more months of counselling and after-care in the facility's transitional housing program. He's been clean for 2\u00bd\u00a0years.\nIt cost $40,000.\nStacey Bereza's son, Kaden, 24, experimented with painkillers from a medicine cabinet in high school, then moved on to heroin and fentanyl.\u00a0\nAs a 911 dispatcher for the Saskatoon Police Service, Bereza had handled plenty of overdose calls at work. She was determined to get her son help \u2014 and fast.\nAn addictions counsellor in Saskatoon urged Bereza to skip the waiting lists and 28-day programs, she said, and immediately book her son into a private facility in B.C. She convinced Kaden to give it a try.\u00a0\n\"I said,\u00a0'Don't do this for me. That's a waste of your time. Don't do it for me. Do it for you. If you don't want this. I'm done. I've done all I can do for you.'\"\nShe flew with her son to Nanaimo, B.C., where he received medically supervised detox and intensive inpatient treatment at Edgewood Treatment Centre, which also has facilities in Toronto and Montreal.\nAs is common, Kaden's\u00a0recovery has included three relapses. But he's been clean for nearly three years\u00a0and still receives regular counselling at the facility\u00a0\u2014\u00a0paid for by Bereza.\nIn total, his treatment\u00a0has cost $82,000.\n\"Credit cards, line of credit\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it's a monthly financial crunch. I feel it monthly. But I look at my son's smile today\u00a0and it was worth it,\" Bereza said.\nCheryl Deschene's rough-around-the-edges\u00a0son, Jordan, first experimented with crack cocaine when he was 13.\nShe spent his teenage years visiting him in juvenile detention centres\u00a0or hunting him down on Regina's streets. She wasn't afraid to beat down a drug dealer's door, holding a baseball bat, demanding to see her son.\n\"No one wants mama rat-a-tat-tat at their door, especially when she's mad,\" Deschene said.\nMore often, though, she felt frustrated and helpless.\nWhile her son was frequently incarcerated, she said there were windows of opportunity when he wanted help.\u00a0She tried to get it for him\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and failed.\n\"He'd be sobbing \u2026 and saying, 'I can't do this anymore. I hate it. I'm sad. I don't like it. I'm scared. Mom, what do I do?'\"\u00a0\nDeschene was able to get her son into detox, but when he finished,\u00a0there would always be a waiting list of four to six weeks for followup treatment programs.\n\"And when they want help, when they're reaching out for help,\u00a0it's like now or never,\" Deschene said. \"It's such a disjointed system. So, as a mom, on the phone, I spent a lot of time swearing, like, 'Are you kidding me?'\"\nPaying for private treatment wasn't a viable option for Deschene.\n\"I was a single mom. I could not afford to spend upward\u00a0of $10,000, usually much more, to send my kid out of province. Would I have done it? In a heartbeat.\"\nIn her bedroom, Deschene points to Jordan's picture on the nightstand\u00a0and an urn in the corner.\n\"Typically\u00a0I say 'Good night.' Sometimes\u00a0I call him a jerk for leaving me.\"\nJordan died of an overdose four years ago, at 27, a day after he was released from the Regina Provincial Correctional Centre.\nWhile Deschene\u00a0acknowledges\u00a0many factors contributed to Jordan's death, she feels the public system failed her son.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1541095491906", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/2.9538/christine-rankin-1.5104276", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["March 17", "2020-03-17T23:13:51.258Z"], "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1531959875940", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "John Last", "title": "Yellowknife's election ridings, by the numbers", "description": "Data reveals divides between electoral districts", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-ridings-by-the-numbers-1.5282492", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5283031.1568400587!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/composite-image-of-yellowknife-ridings.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 22, 2019 4:00 AM CT", "2019-09-22T10:00:00.363Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Who are your fellow constituents?\nCensus data collected by Statistics Canada and matched to Yellowknife's seven territorial ridings by the N.W.T. Bureau of Statistics reveals some interesting divergences between the city's neighbourhoods.\nCBC News examined the data to profile each of the city's ridings. Here are the most interesting things we found.\nYellowknife's largest riding by population is Yellowknife North, which encompasses the neighbourhoods of Old Town and Niven Lake, part of downtown, and houses along the Ingraham Trail.\nDespite boasting many of the city's oldest structures, the district has actually seen the most new building of any area. Almost half of the houses built in the last 10 years have been built in Yellowknife North \u2014 more than 260 of them.\nParadoxically, Yellowknife North also has the most long-term residents of any district. More than 87 per cent have lived in Yellowknife more than five years. Those residents also tend to be high-earning. One in four of the city's top earners \u2014 people who take home more than $100,000 per year \u2014 live in the district.\nAlmost a third of the city's entrepreneurs call Yellowknife North home, but the district's single biggest voting bloc by employment is public employees, who\u00a0also account for a third of the population. It's also the city's brainiest district \u2014 three quarters of residents over 25 have some form of post-secondary degree.\nIt may not be a surprise, then, that Yellowknife North is also the city's most bilingual district, where 22 per cent of residents reported speaking both of Canada's official languages.\nIt shares its Frenchiness with Yellowknife South, with the two districts dividing most of the 55 people who reported French as their only language between them.\nLike Yellowknife North, Yellowknife South is home to high earners. There aren't many households reporting an income near or below Alternative North's estimated living wage of around $45,000 per year \u2014 census data says only nine houses earn $49,000 or less.\nThe district is also home to the city's biggest houses, where 44 per cent have eight or more rooms. That extra room is needed \u2014 41 per cent of households have four or more people in them.\nWeirdly, though, the district also has the city's highest unemployment rate, at 7.3 per cent.\nPerhaps that's why the city's richest riding is neither Yellowknife North nor South \u2014 it's Range Lake, which is home to the most mining and oil and gas workers of any district.\nIn Range Lake, four in 10\u00a0households report an annual income of $200,000 or more \u2014 not exactly Scrooge McDuck status with Yellowknife's cost of living, but the highest income bracket Statistics Canada includes on its forms. That would feel good to check off.\nThe district is also one of the city's most diverse. While in Yellowknife North and South, fewer than 20 per cent of residents identify as Aboriginal, in Range Lake, it's one in four.\nIt's also home to one\u00a0in five of the city's non-Canadian citizens, and it's become a popular spot for immigration in recent years \u2014 a third of immigrants who arrived between 2011 and 2016 live in the district.\nThe city's two urban ridings are similarly diverse, but their incomes are much lower.\nYellowknife Centre and Great Slave\u00a0are home to most of the city's highrises and apartment buildings, so it makes sense that they're also home to most of the city's renters.\nBut the data also shows almost half of those ridings' residents live around or below the Alternative North minimum living wage of $45,000 per year, and Yellowknife Centre ties Yellowknife South for its high unemployment rate.\nYellowknife Centre is also the city's least affordable district, where almost one in four rent- or mortgage-paying residents spend more than 30 per cent of their income on shelter costs. That's despite the fact that the district is home to the city's oldest housing stock \u2014 more than 60 per cent of houses are nearing 50 years old.\nMaybe those high prices are putting stress on people's marriages. Almost one-quarter of Yellowknife's divorcees live in Yellowknife Centre, and it's also home to more than a third of the city's widows. Together, they make up almost 13 per cent of the district's population.\nThere are some silver linings. Great Slave\u00a0is home to the second-most residents with post-secondary degrees, and the most new residents \u2014 people who moved to Yellowknife in the past year\u00a0account for 13 per cent of the population.\nOutside of the urban ridings, Kam Lake is home to the most renters \u2014 almost 40 per cent of residents rent there.\nIt's also where immigrants form the largest voting bloc. Almost one in five residents of the district immigrated to Canada.\nIn tiny Frame Lake, the city's smallest district, there's the opposite story \u2014 96.8 per cent of residents are Canadian citizens, more than any other district besides Yellowknife South. It's the city's whitest district, where more than 87 per cent of residents don't identify as a member of a visible minority.\nFrame Lake is also the city's least educated district \u2014 almost one in five of the city's residents over 25 without any certificate, diploma or degree call the district home.\nAnd this is a tricky one for politicians \u2014 almost a quarter of the district's population can't vote at all. That's because they're aged 14 or under. That's a lot of kids!\nThe data comes from the Canadian census, meaning most of these numbers are from 2016.\nIn some cases \u2014 for example, data about citizenship, visible minority status, education, or employment \u2014 a 25 per cent sample is taken and used to estimate total numbers. In other cases, like for income, the census includes 100 per cent of residents \u2014 as of 2016.\nStatistics Canada separates data by \"dissemination area,\" not by electoral district, so the N.W.T. Bureau of Statistics had to estimate in some cases in building the dataset we used.\nAll to say, these numbers may not be perfect \u2014 but they sure are interesting!\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1531959875940", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Joel Dryden", "title": "The day after the deal: How do Calgarians feel about funding a new arena?", "description": "Some are angry, others are optimistic \u2014 but there's no shortage of opinion", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-flames-arena-jeff-davison-evan-woolley-nhl-1.5387375", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5221162.1579028161!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/calgary-events-centre.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 06, 2019 6:09 PM MT", "2019-12-07T01:09:46.216Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The negotiations are over, the agreements are signed, the next steps are planned. The city's new arena is happening, whether Calgarians are happy about it or not.\u00a0\nThe $565-million project\u00a0\u2014 $290 million of which will be funded by taxpayers\u00a0\u2014 has sparked months of contentious debate, and even had some calling for the cancellation of the deal in favour of funding projects like the Green Line LRT.\nNow that definitive agreements have been signed, how are Calgarians feeling about their investment? That was the question posed to Friday listeners of\u00a0CBC Calgary's\u00a0Alberta@Noon.\nMike Vine, a caller from Calgary, said he thought it was irresponsible to use taxpayer money for anything but basic needs.\n\"I think if we're meeting the needs of our citizens, which is fire, police and transportation, then fine. But if we have to be cutting those things in order to maintain a balanced budget and increasing our taxes, then I don't see this as being something that's a need,\" Vine said.\u00a0\"I think it's a luxury. I think it's irresponsible.\"\nCoun. Jeff Davison, who led city negotiations on the deal, said the arena was part of a larger strategy to revitalize Calgary's downtown in order to compete to\u00a0bring big business to the city.\n\"What we are trying to achieve is\u00a0looking at how do you successfully build an events centre within an entertainment and cultural district,\" Davison said on the show. \"To my knowledge, we don't have any studies out there that tell us these districts can be or can't be successful. That's really where the execution and city-building comes in to leverage onto the facility you're trying to create.\"\nCoun. Evan Woolley, who spearheaded a move to\u00a0divert funds from the arena to the Green Line,\u00a0affordable housing and policing, told Alberta@Noon\u00a0that he didn't think the arena would serve Calgarians.\n\"I think council has made the decision, but I think everybody really needs to be honest with themselves about how much of a catalyst this will be and how much revenue we'll actually get back off of this,\" he said.\nIsaac Dumaine, who lives in the Exshaw area, said he takes the CTrain frequently. He thinks the money used for the arena could have gone toward improving local transit.\n\"I can't afford a Flames ticket. None of my friends can. We watch it at the bar,\" Dumaine said. \"I think there's more things downtown worth seeing than a Flames game.\"\nWoolley said that though there's \"no doubt\" Calgary needs a new arena,\u00a0he still has questions.\n\"How much are you willing to spend and what is the value in that return that you get? I think those are the tough questions that I think I've been asking and I think that Calgarians are right to ask,\" he said.\u00a0\"You're layering that against all of the other priorities that we have.\"\nOf course, visualizing the future events centre based on a few renderings can be difficult. For that reason, there's value in taking a look north, to Edmonton's Ice District.\nRogers Place was approved in 2013, priced at\u00a0$613 million. The\u00a0Katz Group of Companies\u00a0\u2014 the ownership group behind the Edmonton Oilers \u2014\u00a0contributed 27 per cent of that project.\nArif Khan, an Edmonton resident, said residents \"got taken\" in the\u00a0arena deal.\n\"These are billionaires. They have the money, they have the resources,\" Khan said. \"They take advantage of poor taxpayers.\"\nIan Thomson, who lives in Leduc, also called the Rogers Place arena \"a bad deal,\" saying downtown costs have gone through the roof.\n\"I think it was a massive mistake,\" Thomson said. \"It's driven the costs downtown sky-high. Somebody is saying, 'Well, look at the downtown coming alive.'\n\"But you can barely afford to park your car down there.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nSome say\u00a0the arena has helped spur growth in Edmonton's downtown. The amount of \"underdeveloped\" land in downtown shrunk to 40 per cent in 2016 \u2014 down from 52 per cent before the arena deal was signed \u2014 according to Edmonton's\u00a0Downtown Business Association.\nDavid Low, executive director of the Victoria Park BRZ, said what wasn't being discussed was the opportunity for the new Calgary\u00a0arena to serve as an \"economic engine\" for other areas of the district.\n\"It's all the support services and industries that go along with this,\" Low said. \"Let's forget about the entertainment centre for a minute. It's everything that is going to be around it \u2014 that has not been captured in many of the analysis\u00a0that has gone forward to date \u2014 that is very, very significant.\"\nThough plenty of Calgarians might feel frustrated with the deal today, Davison likened the situation to the initial conversation surrounding the new Central Library, which cost approximately $245 million for the building and related features.\n\"Day 1 that the (new arena) opens, yes, you may (convince more Calgarians),\" he said. \"You go back to the anger that a lot of people had investing money into the new Central Library\u00a0\u2014 'What a waste of money this was, how could you invest when libraries are going digital, we don't need this'\u00a0\u2014 but that library is on a\u00a0New York Times [top places to visit list].\n\"Today, when people walk into that building, they say, 'Wow, we built something spectacular.'\"\nCalgary resident Anthony Langlois said he was in favour of the deal, saying too much was made about the price tag and too little about how it would help to build a better city.\n\"We build a lot of different things that you do or do not use,\" he said. \"You're building a whole cultural landscape. The\u00a0fact is, this is going to be a city-owned asset that enhances the city's cultural landscape.\"\nCalgary resident Jesse\u00a0Vanneste also supports the arena deal.\n\"I understand where people are coming from, but I think the arena is a huge economic benefit to the city,\" Vanneste said.\u00a0\"I think people could come to our city from outside of town, all the surrounding communities, and I do think it brings an economic benefit to our city.\"\nThough the page has been turned on Calgary's new events centre, some think a whole new conversation could soon be started.\nMoshe Lander, a professor at\u00a0Concordia University, said he expected what had played out around the Flames arena would soon be replicated for Calgary's McMahon Stadium.\n\"You know, the CFL commissioner comes through town and says, 'You know, I don't know if we're going to have any more Grey Cups here until McMahon is replaced,'\" Lander said. \"The thing is, the Stamps are (also)\u00a0owned by Calgary Sports and Entertainment. So guess what, they now know the playbook on how to beat the city into putting public funds into a rebuilt stadium.\n\"So I think what we're going to see now is a slow-motion replay of what's been playing out over the last three years with the Saddledome.\"\nDavison called McMahon a \"much different ballpark,\" adding that the city was a long way\u00a0away from figuring out next steps at that site.\n\"We only have 40 acres there. The province owns the other 68 acres \u2026 the university is involved in that conversation,\" he said. \"But at the same time, you say, collectively, there's 100 acres there.\u00a0\n\"Could you potentially look at building a field house and a covered stadium and develop a district there\u00a0that could then offset that build and recoup our cost through the generation of new property tax? I don't know. Those are the conversations we're having now.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1530473539813", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1530471491827", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1581885507812", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1579821123733", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Joanne Chianello", "title": "We're officially a big city.

This is our best guess, based on statistics. When Mayor Jim Watson makes the pronouncement of our seven-figure population milestone in front of City Hall Friday afternoon, he won't be able to name our one-millionth resident.\nBut he is right to mark this as a\u00a0turning point, if only symbolically.\nOttawa's population blooms to 1M\nFor too long now, we've debated whether we're a small big city or a big small one. Too often, innovative ideas from elsewhere have been met with the response: \"That'll never work in Ottawa.\" And for goodness sakes, we\u00a0are not the city that fun forgot.\nBut what does it actually mean to be a city of one million?\nWell, for starters, it doesn't make us all that big, not in the global scheme of things. Heck, it only makes us the sixth-largest city in Canada, and way down the list of North America's largest urban centres. California alone boasts three cities larger than Ottawa.\nThese things are relative, though.\nIn the past 20 years, Ottawa's population has jumped by one-third. Just by dint of that rapid growth, we can now support a new mass transit system \u2014 assuming it eventually works\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a new central\u00a0library, more restaurants, local farmers markets across the city, renewed inner-city neighbourhoods and booming suburbs.\nOur city is diverse\u00a0\u2014 about one-quarter of Ottawa's residents were born outside Canada \u2014\u00a0a fact our\u00a0festival scene reflects gloriously.\nThis month alone, you can drop by\u00a0Preston Street's annual Italian festival or\u00a0the Festival Franco-Ontarien at Major's Hill Park, and cheer on the paddlers competing in\u00a0the Ottawa Dragon Boat Festival.\nThe Summer Solstice Indigenous Festival and International Competition Pow Wow remind\u00a0us who was here first.\nBut diversity doesn't just mean variety in our roots. It's also about contemporary cultural range.\u00a0So, catch some short plays at The Fringe, party at Centretown's GlowFair, rock out at Escapade or\u00a0find your\u00a0groove at the Ottawa Jazz Festival.\nMore of us means we can support more professional sports teams, too, although population alone is no guarantee of a franchise's success, as evidenced by the dismal attendance at Ottawa Senators\u00a0games last season.\nSurpassing this\u00a0population milestone needn't\u00a0necessarily alter the essence of our city \u2014 the approachable livability we long to preserve.\nOur proximity to nature, our bike path network, our transit system, the national museums and monuments \u2014 all these make Ottawa an ideal place to live for so many. And while housing prices have been on the rise, they haven't quite hit the socially disruptive\u00a0levels seen in Toronto or Vancouver.\nNone of this is to suggest we should be content with the status quo. Indeed, if we don't keep pushing for improvements, our envied livability will fall rapidly away.\nAs we continue to grow, we need a mass transit system that can reliably whisk us around this geographically\u00a0giant city of ours. We need more affordable housing. We lack a large central park in the core, and that's a big gap if we want more people to live there in more compact personal spaces. Our bike network is failing riders and urgently needs fixing.\nTall buildings? Yes, they're here to stay, and more are coming. We need to get over that. But we also need to demand that neck-craning\u00a0development is done right, and done honestly. It's not OK for a community to help develop a plan for 30-storey buildings, only to see\u00a0that plan arbitrarily changed to allow 50-plus storey towers.\nAnd it's certainly not acceptable for a hotel owner to fasten\u00a0a publicly loathed addition onto a beloved heritage building that will mar some of the most iconic views in the capital\u00a0and, for that matter, the country.\nDevelopers aren't doing the city a favour by building here. They make money. We're allowed, therefore, to make certain demands.\nWe must strive for the best version of whatever project we're undertaking, not concede to settle. The old argument that\u00a0the Lansdowne\u00a0Park redevelopment is better than the asphalt parking lot it replaced is far too low a bar.\nAs a city, what we need, in the words of former mayor Larry O'Brien, is a bit of swagger.\nAnd the willingness to try something new. The spirit to take a chance.\nSure, we secretly prize the security of being a government town, but that can make us a bit risk-averse. We need to get over that, too.\nBack when Canada celebrated its centenary, the famous Morrison-Lamothe bakery didn't just build\u00a0a nine-metre\u00a0styrofoam birthday cake for Parliament Hill; it\u00a0also served real cake to the tens of thousands of people who came to the Canada Day festivities, and all with just a month's notice.\nFifty years later, tens of thousands waited in security lines on Parliament Hill. Among the other disappointments that day, there was no cake.\nWhy not? In 1967, a single bakery was able to feed 40,000 people, but in 2017 we didn't have the imagination to showcase our culinary talent by commissioning the city's dozens of excellent bakeries\u00a0to provide treats for the hungry throngs.\nWe just need a bit of imagination, and we are capable of it.\nOne of the happiest surprises of the 150th celebrations was La Machine, whose massive mechanical creatures \u2014\u00a0a fire-breathing dragon-horse and a giant spider \u2014\u00a0stalked\u00a0the streets of downtown Ottawa. More than 750,000 people came out to see the $4.5-million spectacle.\nJust the bureaucratic effort needed to close city streets for the spectacle made it seem so un-Ottawa. But that's exactly the sort of what-the-heck, let's-do-it-anyway\u00a0attitude we need to bring to all sorts of collective projects, from the frivolous to the fundamental.\nIf it had failed, we would have all complained. But if we're too afraid to fail, then we will do nothing of significance.\u00a0\nThat's what it will take for a million of us to feel like we don't just happen to live in the same place, but that we've chosen to share the same spirit.\nA little more risk-taking, a tad more swagger and an insistence on excellence.\nNo, we're not on the cusp of becoming the next New York or Paris. But we are a big city and it's time we owned it, in our own way.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian and U.S. economies are converging but danger lurks: Don Pittis", "description": "Poloz and Wilkins warn that markets overestimate the power of a rate-cut quick fix", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/poloz-powell-rates-economy-1.5204132", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5207418.1562794054!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bank-of-canada-20190710.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 11, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-07-11T16:01:07.313Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "On the face of it, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz and his deputy Carolyn Wilkins had some excellent news about the Canadian economy in yesterday's Monetary Policy Report.\nThe happy story included falling mortgage\u00a0rates, continued employment strength and growing business investment that have pushed Canadian economic growth rates higher in the first half of the year than almost anyone expected.\nBut as global trade threats linger, Canada's top central bankers warn that many people who should know better, including stock market investors, seem to think cuts to interest rates can solve all problems.\nIn a complex world riven by trade disputes, they say, there are simply limits to the power of central bankers to patch things up.

The bank's strategy for trying to address something it cannot control is to draw up two divergent scenarios.\nFor those interested, the two extreme outlooks are described in Box 2 on Page 21 of the Monetary Policy Report. And of course the gloomier\u00a0one, an all-out trade war, is the more\u00a0interesting.\nIn describing this bleaker scenario Poloz\u00a0foresees that central banks, with their single superpower of making money cheap, simply may not be equipped to deal with the repercussions. And he says it is here that stock market investors, blithely assuming lower rates will always make stocks go higher, may be mistaken.\n\"The markets are not really onto the complexity of it,\" said Poloz, describing an event where trade barriers raised the cost of imports while a falling loonie added to the effect.\u00a0\n\"In that moment you have a trade-off between a slowing economy and rising unemployment and rising inflation at the same time,\" said Poloz. \"And obviously monetary policy would not be able to buffer both of those.\"\nAll the more reason for Canadians to hope the Bank of Canada's good news scenario where \"the global economy broadly returns to pre-2017 trade arrangements, and uncertainty about future trade policy dissipates\" is the one that comes true.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Jennie Russell", "title": "Unions told thousands more job cuts coming to Alberta public service", "description": "Letters to unions from Alberta government released late Friday in advance of collective bargaining", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-public-service-cuts-1.5379582", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5352973.1578713511!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/alberta-legislature-building-edmonton-snow.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 29, 2019 7:12 PM MT", "2019-11-30T03:40:26.886Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Nearly 6,000 Alberta public-sector jobs could be eliminated as the UCP government tries to cut costs and find efficiencies,\u00a0the provincial government signalled to Alberta's largest union in letters released late Friday afternoon.  The union received the letters in advance of bargaining for 2020 collective agreements. The letters are not formal notices of layoffs, but as required under the collective bargaining process, outline cuts the provincial government might make.  The potential cuts would impact 2,500 Government of Alberta positions across several ministries, as well as the following positions at Alberta Health Services:\n\"The [Government of Alberta]\u00a0will continue to guarantee employment security until March 30, 2020, for permanent bargaining unit employees using attrition, vacancy management and redeployment to meet employer needs,\" states a Thursday letter to the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees from Alberta Public Service Commissioner Tim Grant.\nBut the letter continues\u00a0that as of April 1 of next year, the government \"will use all options available under the collective agreement to ensure government is on track to implement key priorities and support the government's path to balance by 2020-23.\"\nGrant said several government cost-cutting initiatives could impact \"approximately 2,500 positions\" through to the end of the 2022-23 fiscal year.\nAlberta Justice to lay off 90 civil lawyers, outsource more legal work to meet budget cuts\nThe letter does not go into much detail about what those initiatives are, but several government ministries are specifically mentioned: Health, Service Alberta, Community and Social Services, Agriculture and Forestry, Seniors and Housing, and Transportation.\nOpposition NDP Leader Rachel Notley called the potential cuts \"cruel and heartless,\" and said they represent a betrayal of what Premier Jason Kenney promised during his election campaign this spring.\n\"Jason Kenney repeatedly claimed that he was going to protect front-line services,\" Notley said. \"He does not have a mandate for this because this is the exact opposite of what he told Albertans he would do.\"  AUPE president Guy Smith was not available for an interview Friday evening.  In a statement earlier Friday about the collective bargaining process, Finance Minister Travis Toews\u00a0said the status quo \"is not a sustainable option\" and said Alberta spends more per capita on services than other large provinces, with often worse results.\n\"We were also clear about the need for an ongoing review of government programs to ensure they are efficient and effective, and that this could result in changes to the public service,\" he said.\nA Friday letter to the union from Dennis Holliday, the head of negotiations and labour relations for Alberta Health Services (AHS), details thousands of positions at the health authority\u00a0that could be at risk.\nOur running tracker of the impact of the Alberta budget\nIn October's provincial budget, the UCP increased health-care spending by $201 million to a total of $20.6 billion, a smaller increase than in previous years under the former NDP government. At the time, Toews told reporters, \"It's hard to talk about fiscal responsibility without talking about health care.\"  Holliday's letter to AUPE said that, while the AHS budget has remained stable, \"Alberta's growing and aging population means we need to be more efficient and focused in terms of healthcare spending.\n\"This places increased demand on our healthcare services and it means we have to do things differently in order to provide safe, effective, and high-quality care for Albertans.\"  Holliday said contracting out AHS housekeeper positions would affect between 1,000 and 2,000 full-time equivalent positions. Doing the same to remaining laundry and linen operations and retail food services would affect 235 and 165 positions, respectively.\n\"If further contracting out initiatives are to be considered in future, we will advise as required,\" the letter states.  \"AHS will continue to consider all options available to meet our organizational needs including changes to staff mix, service redesign, including changes and repurposing of sites, relocating services, reducing or ceasing the provision of services,\" it says.\nNotley said it is clear the UCP government intends to further privatize public services.  \"Albertans will pay the price for this. And again, it's entirely unnecessary. This has gone from prudent fiscal management to an extreme ideological vendetta.\"\u00a0\nOn Friday, the United Nurses of Alberta\u00a0learned that a further 750 front-line nurses could lose their jobs under a \"massive downsizing\" at AHS.\nThe nurses' union said it learned of the planned cuts Friday morning after the lead negotiator for AHS, Raelene Fitz, called a meeting unexpectedly to inform the union that it plans to eliminate 500 full-time-equivalent (FTE) nursing positions over a three-year period beginning April 1, 2020.  Cutting 500 full-time-equivalent positions would mean layoffs for more than 750 front-line registered nurses because many nurses work part-time hours, the union said.  The plans were disclosed \"in advance of bargaining for UNA's 2020 provincial collective agreement so that the union would have time to absorb the information and respond accordingly,\" the union said in a news release.  Decisions are still being made, but AHS was required to disclose the measures as part of the collective bargaining process, the health authority said in a statement.  Kenney was at a business conference in Lake Louise on Friday. When reporters asked him about the potential nursing cuts, he said this is in line with the UCP government's agenda.  \"We've always been clear that getting our province's finances back in order will require some reduction in the size of the overall public service, and that we hope to achieve that primarily through attrition,\" Kenney said. \"My understanding is that's the goal of AHS management.\"  Notley, however,\u00a0said she is \"very, very worried for Albertans of all walks of life because this is going to seriously destabilize the quality of health care that Albertans across this province need to rely on.\"\n"}, {"author": "Scott Dippel ", "title": "Secret Olympic reports show how ill-fated bid evolved over time", "description": "Release of confidential reports reveal gems like 'hosting the Games is inherently high risk'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/city-council-olympics-2026-bid-documents-1.5180766", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180896.1560909157!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/confidential-olympic-documents-released.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 19, 2019 5:30 AM MT", "2019-06-19T11:30:00.192Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Now that Calgary's scuttled 2026 Winter Olympics bid has been legally and officially laid to rest by city council, some of the hidden details have been released by the city.\nSome 398 documents and reports were prepared for city council, but 39 of those documents were withheld from the public under the terms of Alberta's Freedom of Information legislation.\nFollowing a city council vote Monday, the city has now released 27 of those reports.

Later in the report, it notes that when it comes to investment (either a new build or upgrades), the curling venue was going to be used \"as is.\"\nCalgary 2026 officials never did reveal what venue was being considered. \u00a0 At that time, the report shows Lake Louise was still deemed to be the site of downhill ski events if the 2026 Games came to southern Alberta.\nThat plan was later altered by the bid corporation to have the downhill events held at Nakiska.\nThe June 2018 document also shows a rendering of the proposed athletes village which would have been located on the site of the Victoria Park bus barn.\nThat plan changed by Calgary 2026 after\u00a0cost considerations forced it to revise its budget downwards.\nSecret report shows bus barns will drive Olympic costs higher if bid succeeds\nThe documents show the plebiscite question which ultimately was used by Calgarians to reject the bid was approved by city council on July 17, 2018.\nIn one of the newest documents, there are some lines in a confidential report to council from October 2, 2018, on risks.\nThe plebiscite was just a month away.\nThe report noted:\u00a0\"Hosting the 2026 OPWG is a complex and unique undertaking\" and \"Hosting the Games is inherently high risk.\"\nIt was Calgarians who decided that those risks weren't worth it when they voted in the plebiscite to halt the bid in its tracks.\n"}, {"author": "Stephanie Levitz", "title": "After outcry, company to remove pro-Bernier billboards that criticize 'mass immigration'", "description": "Bernier says he agrees with ad's message, notes they were placed by outside group", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/company-removing-mass-immigration-billboard-maxime-bernier-1.5259538", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5258184.1566594173!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mass-immigration-billboard-halifax.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 25, 2019 7:34 PM AT", "2019-08-25T22:34:55.660Z"], "source": null, "content": "The owner of billboards currently showcasing ads that seek to promote the People's Party of Canada's controversial stance on immigration reversed course on Sunday, saying the company would take the material down in response to \"overwhelming\" criticism.\nThe ads, featuring a photo of party leader Maxime Bernier, the slogan \"Say NO to mass immigration\" and a call to vote for his party, started popping up across the country late last week.

The people have voiced to me that they want a person who will listen to them and take their issues forward and advocate for the people.\nI have spent my whole life in the service of the people. As an MLA, I bring this same philosophy to this position. I concluded my first term with a number of projects I was actively working on.\u00a0I would like to see these projects completed in the next four years.\nFor me, it is and always will be about representing the people and their voices.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nI bring to the table a vast array of experience and knowledge. First and foremost, I have been the MLA for Nahendeh for the past four years.\u00a0I have also been elected by my peers to be the Chair of the Standing Committee of Social Development, which is responsible for over 60 per cent\u00a0of the government's operation and maintenance budget.\u00a0\nI also attended 98 other Standing Committee meetings to ensure the concerns of the people of Nahendeh were brought forth.\nMy previous experience includes\u00a0serving two terms on the Fort Simpson District Education Authority, four years as chair. Over the past thirty years I have served on various community and territorial boards.\nI have and still continue to be engaged with youth projects and initiatives on a volunteer basis. A few examples of my service to my community and the Northwest Territories are serving on the Sport North Federation Board and the NWTRPA\u00a0(NWT Parks and Recreation Association).\nI am an active volunteer with Northern Youth Abroad, Competency Based Education Training and High Five.\nI have served as a Justice of the Peace for over 25 years which afforded me the skills to listen to all the facts and make an informed decision.\u00a0This experience was an invaluable asset to my position as MLA.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nTo begin with, as the Chair of the Standing Committee of Social Development, we passed 23 bills, including the Corrections Act, Cannabis Act and the Post Secondary Act. This involved reaching out and meeting Northerners to get their viewpoint and bringing these viewpoints together to enhance these bills.\nIn the past four years, I have dealt with over 780 constituent issues. Many of these issues involved numerous communication\u00a0back\u00a0and forths with Ministers to provide answers to the issues,\u00a0In this way, we were able to identify workable solutions.\nI would like to discuss a number of highlights in the various communities within\u00a0Nahendeh. In Fort Liard, I worked toward a solution to the taxation issue and worked with the N.W.T. and B.C. governments to provide specialized medical services to the community.\u00a0\nIn Jean Marie River, I secured improvements on the access road, an additional teacher position, and a 20 kilometre chipseal on Highway 1, by the community turnoff. In Sambaa K'e, I advocated for enhancing the winter road, a renovation and addition to the school, and the construction of a new health cabin.\nHighlights in Wrigley over my term include working with the education minister on the school issue, addressing band land and housing issues with the GNWT\u00a0(Government of the Northwest Territories)\u00a0and federal government\u00a0\u2014 and issue that's been ongoing since 1965.\nNahanni Butte saw an additional teacher position in the community, enhancements to the access road, and the addressing of buffalo at the airport.\nFor Fort Simpson, I worked with the department of health and social services on planning a 48-bed long-term care facility project, and working with the Liidli Kue First Nation and Fort Simpson M\u00e9tis Nation on the business plan. I was also involved in developing plans for an LNG\u00a0plant in the community.\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nWith our debt being $1.1 billion and\u00a0getting closer to our debt ceilings, we have a number of issues which are interwoven:\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nHousing.\u00a0Public housing units have\u00a0a long waiting list and no new infrastructure is planned.\nEmployment is another major issue. We need to develop strategic spending which will stimulate employment opportunities, such as homecare.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nIf I could choose one thing to accomplish, it would be the housing issue. It has a ripple effect on the foundational family ecosystem, along with the economy as a whole.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nI would like to see the GNWT develop more green projects, such as geothermal, LNG, solar and other creative ways to reduce the demand on diesel. We need to work with communities to come up with a plan that meets their needs and use\u00a0modern technology to enhance existing systems.\nWe have a perfect example in the community of Fort Providence where SSi Energy has developed a system to reduce the use of diesel fuel and utilize\u00a0waste heat for their business.\nWe need to develop a plan where\u00a0there is a fuel rebate at the pumps for residents, so they can continue a traditional lifestyle.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nWhen speaking about change, the biggest challenge I have witnessed is the willingness to implement it. Our government has become comfortable with the status quo.\nThe first thing I would do is have the Finance Minister reach out to Northerners to hear their concerns and ideas on how to improve the GNWT's budget.\nDepartments need to do zero-based budgeting to eliminate redundancy and duplication of services in the system.\u00a0\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nIndigenous government processes need to be completed, which creates certainty for industry and investment.\nContracts need to be awarded to northern contractors for the economy to grow and flourish.\u00a0These contractors are invested not only in the local economy but in our communities as a whole. We also need creative ways to enhance tourism outside of the larger centres.\nI believe the utilization of green energy products would enhance the local economy. If you look at geothermal, not only does it operate the power plant, but the heat can be used to heat buildings and greenhouses we build that will allow us to grow our own food.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nI am very fortunate to be working with and along side a number of Indigenous governments and people in my riding. To me, it is about building positive relationships. I make it a point to sit down and listen to what the people have to say and share.\nBuilding relationships is the cornerstone to serving; which fosters respectful, trusting relationships, which then builds healthier, more productive communities.\nI do my utmost to be honest and forthright in working through solutions to constituent issues, and authentic and transparent in the progress I am making. Delivery of authentic service to people is not delivered in lip service or a box that can be checked off. Service to people is not a cookie cutter approach.\u00a0Personal and professional integrity need\u00a0to be the guidepost.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\nGetting elected by the residents of the Nahendeh is my priority, but if I am fortunate enough to be elected, I would be interested in putting my name forward for the ministerial portfolios.\nI feel my experience over the last four years would be an asset for a cabinet position. I believe in consensus government and feel we need to implement a process\u00a0where\u00a0regular MLAs have more of a say in what we are trying to achieve.\nWould you like to be premier?\nThis decision would be\u00a0dependent upon who puts their name forward in the 19th\u00a0Assembly. I would like to see a Premier who engages with the residents of the Northwest Territories, challenges the status quo and actively works with regular MLAs on various issues and challenges.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nThe main reason would be to help the region move forward. It has been many years since the region has had any major infrastructure projects. I also believe it's time Nahendeh had a seat on the cabinet (none in 15 years) and I believe I have the necessary credentials to be successful.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nWhile I am not fluent, I have an ever-increasing ability to speak some South Slavey.\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nThe fiscal situation is not great. The next group of MLAs and cabinet are going to have a tough time balancing competing interests.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nBasic infrastructure needing immediate repair. Our highways in the region desperately need some chipseal or better,\u00a0and that means more GNWT spending in\u00a0Nahendeh. There are many more pressing concerns as well.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nWell, I don't like to limit my potential accomplishments to only one, there are so many things I would like to help remedy.\nThere is, of course, the Dehcho Land Claim Process that has been stalled for some time. If I am able to provide any assistance I certainly would. I think the best way I could assist in this area would be to gain a cabinet seat and move the claim agenda forward.\u00a0\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nLobby the federal government for the funding needed to address the issue. Community governments are already at their limits financially and this is a cost that's really hard to absorb into their regular budgets. The GNWT may find it difficult to come up with necessary funding as well.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nIf there was an area needing to be changed, I feel the GNWT could do a better job consulting or advising the public. Some departments do a much better job with public consultation than others and I believe consistency would be helpful.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy ?\nA multi-faceted approach is required.\u00a0This must include partnering with others, like the feds, and of course industry.\u00a0\nWe need to create an environment that not only improves the economy but protects the natural environment at the same time.\nOne of the biggest road blocks to improving the economy in Nahendeh\u00a0is our\u00a0infrastructure deficiencies, specifically our highways.\u00a0There are also major concerns when looking at acquiring any land for any economic\u00a0development, particularly in\u00a0Nahendeh.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nFirst and foremost, I will provide equal MLA representation to all Nahendeh constituents.\nThere have been many improvements to this relationship over the last 10 years or so, things like the implementation of government services officers in many smaller communities has assisted considerably in\u00a0communication\u00a0to the Indigenous communities in our region. We should continue this type of community-based program and enhance the program even further.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\nYes.\nWould you like to be premier? \nOf course.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nThe people in our district,\u00a0Nahendeh, which in our Dene language means \"our land,\" have many questions and the territorial government is not hearing them. I\u00a0decided this was the only forum where, when elected, I would speak for them, plus for those who share our land with us.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nMy elders, grandfathers are from this land. My parents were trappers, and with great sadness they sent\u00a0me to the residential school at Lapointe Hall when I was six years old,\u00a0but they saw that their way of life was changing and this was the only way to survive for the future.\nThe price I had to pay was to be separated from my family and community and lose part of my language. As a young Dene person after finishing my education, I was lost for a long time. I\u00a0got into alcohol, and did not care until\u00a0my auntie started taking me to the Indian Brotherhood \u2014 now Dene Nation \u2014 meetings and I listened to the elders from different Dene regions.\nThey kept saying, \"we are Dene, and this is our land, and we have been here since time immemorial. We come from strong and proud people.\"\u00a0From that moment, I knew who I was and knew what I wanted to do with my life: to work for our people.\nI've worked for the GNWT in economic development and justice, trapped\u00a0for a few years on my parents' trapping area, helped the band in Simpson to set up a company \u2014 Nogha\u00a0Enterprises \u2014 to do a highway maintenance contract, fire fighting contract, and pipeline work, among other things.\nI've done every job out there in my lifetime, and the Dene values that my mother and elders instilled me is prevalent respect. Care, listen, and help people.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nBeing Dene and sober for 31 years.\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nGetting an identity. A proper name, instead of N.W.T. A\u00a0name from the people of this land.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nNahendeh has five smaller\u00a0communities plus Fort Simpson.\u00a0It is not like Yellowknife, where MLAs\u00a0represent\u00a0three\u00a0blocks each. Each of the six\u00a0communities has dreams and visions for their people for the future, and for their children, so\u00a0they have a good life.\nThe problem is that there is limited funding from the territorial government and federal government to carry them out.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nFor the GNWT to step away or quit being involved in the negotiations that the First Nations are having with the federal government.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nVoice our concern,\u00a0practice what we preach, and start educating our people right from kindergarten.\u00a0They are our future.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nI have nothing against the system. It is doing its best to deliver quality services with the budget they have, but the people working within the territorial government system have to remember they are dealing with proud and humble people, that\u00a0it takes a lot of energy to ask for help, and they would like to be respected instead of being treated like a statistic.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy ?\nConsultation with the First Nations of this land.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nTo respect and consult and take direction from each First Nation on this land.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\u00a0\nNo.\nWould you like to be premier?\u00a0\nNo. As with the last question, I think that the people are more important than being in a higher position.\n"}, {"author": "Kyle Bakx", "title": "'We're anxious to get it in the ground': Pipe yards fill ahead of federal decision on Trans Mountain expansion", "description": "Trains, trucks deliver pipes to Alberta and B.C. for delayed pipeline project", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tmx-pipe-yards-hope-kamloops-1.5178183", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5178214.1560781899!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pipes-arrive-by-train.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 17, 2019 12:38 PM ET", "2019-06-17T16:38:34.005Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Over the last few months, anyone driving on the Trans-Canada Highway near the town of Hope, B.C., has noticed hundreds of large green pipes being stockpiled at a yard adjacent to the freeway.\nTrees were cleared\u00a0before the pipes started to arrive.\nAll the activity has been hard to miss for those who live and work in the community, like Lloyd Ferman,\u00a0owner of Ferman's Transportation.\nWith the federal government expected to decide the fate of the Trans Mountain expansion project Tuesday,\u00a0Ferman assumes Ottawa will give the project the green light.\n\"When the federal government bought it, I thought, 'They've decided,' because why would they take all that taxpayers money for something that's not going to be. So I assume myself it's going ahead.\"\nOttawa purchased the project for $4.5 billion after Kinder Morgan grew impatient with a series of political, legal and regulatory challenges. Construction began to slowly ramp up in 2018\u00a0before the Federal Court of Appeal halted work. The federal government was ordered to redo a portion of its consultation with Indigenous groups, and the further examination of marine life impacts was required.\u00a0\nThe project is the twinning of an existing pipeline constructed in the 1950s to transport oil, gasoline, diesel and other products along the 1,150-kilometre route from Edmonton to Burnaby, B.C. The pipeline's capacity would increase from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000.\nTrains and trucks hauling pipes for the proposed project have been visible for several weeks in Alberta and B.C., although the timing of the delivery and the federal government's pending decision seem to be a coincidence.\nTrans Mountain said some material that was ordered and in transit prior to the court decision is now arriving at locations in B.C. and Alberta. So far, about 30 per cent of the pipe required for the project has been delivered.\nSome communities along the pipeline's route are tired of the constant delays to the project, which was first approved by the federal government in 2016.\nHope's mayor, Peter Robb, points to the economic boost of having a camp housing 575 workers near the community as one of the reasons he wants construction to begin. He's also worried about the rapid rise of oil shipments from Alberta to the West Coast.\n\"We've noticed a huge increase in the rail traffic through our community and we definitely\u00a0would\u00a0prefer pipeline twinning on existing properties rather than the potential of a rail car disaster in our community,\" Robb\u00a0said.\nThose concerns are shared by Kamloops\u00a0Mayor Ken Christian, who also said his city has to delay several of its own projects because construction of the pipeline would impact a significant portion of his community.\n\"It's been a long time,\" he said about the delays to the Trans Mountain expansion project.\u00a0\"We're just ready to get this thing built.\"\nThe project has faced opposition by environmentalists and some Indigenous groups with concerns about the impacts to waterways and the potential of an oil spill, among other issues.\nOpponents also question why the federal government would want to build an oil pipeline when the country and world are already suffering the consequences of climate change as natural disasters such as forest fires and floods are becoming more severe.\nSome Indigenous groups have wanted to make changes to the project such as proposing alternative\u00a0routes through their land or moving construction sites to different locations. If the government decides to move ahead with the project, additional conditions could be placed on the project to appease some of the concerns.\nThousands of people have attended events to urge the government to scrap the project.\u00a0\nThe pipeline is needed by Alberta's energy sector as a backlog of oil in the province has lowered oil prices significantly and scared away investment. The pipeline would result in increased tax revenue and royalties for various levels of government.\n\"Because we don't have enough pipe capacity, we've suffered these\u00a0huge discounts, and that's really cost the economy revenue and government revenues,\" said Richard Masson,\u00a0an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy and former head of\u00a0the Alberta Petroleum Marketing\u00a0Commission.\n\"But more than that, the investment climate has really soured, and so companies aren't investing in new projects because they can't be sure that they're actually going to get their oil to market.\"\nThe poor economic conditions in Alberta since oil prices began to collapse in 2014, and the squabbling between the Alberta and B.C. governments are two\u00a0reasons for such a large spotlight on this project.\nThere's even been talk in Alberta about separating from the country.\n\"It's become iconic,\" said Donna Kennedy-Glans, a former oilpatch executive and Alberta politician, about the Trans Mountain expansion.\u00a0\n\"It's become representative of so much more than simply building a pipeline.\"\nWhile she hopes the federal government makes a definitive decision on the project, she expects it won't get a full green light to proceed.\n\"I think we're going to see a qualified answer on Tuesday which will kick it down the road past the election,\" Kennedy-Glans said.\u00a0\"It's kind of like being half pregnant. You know, are we going to do this or aren't we going to do this?\"\nIf the government proceeds with the project, it may provide details about a process to involve Indigenous ownership of the pipeline.\nThe government has said it does not want to be a long-term owner of the project. Meanwhile, several Indigenous groups in Western Canada have openly expressed interest in purchasing an equity stake in the project.\nIan Anderson,\u00a0president of Trans Mountain, has also said he sees Indigenous ownership as part of the fabric of how the project moves forward.\nLast month, however, the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs wrote\u00a0in an open letter\u00a0to First Nations warning about the risks of investing in the project, including the likelihood of further legal challenges from Indigenous groups.\u00a0\nIf approved, the Trans Mountain expansion project would take up to three years to construct.\n"}, {"author": "Bartley Kives", "title": "What we still don't know about Winnipeg's police HQ", "description": "Mayor Brian Bowman says questions remain unanswered; here are some of them", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-police-headquarters-questions-1.5402630", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778451.1554838087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/new-police-headquarters-winnipeg.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 22, 2019 6:00 AM CT", "2019-12-22T12:00:00.409Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "After a five-year criminal investigation into the construction of Winnipeg's police headquarters, Manitoba's Crown prosecution service decided not to proceed with charges.\nNonetheless, questions about the police HQ remain, including why the city embarked on the project in the first place.\nThe RCMP spent 2\u00bd years looking into allegations of fraud, forgery, the payment of a secret commission and breach of trust in relation to the project. Earlier this month, the Crown determined there was little likelihood of securing a conviction.\nThe end of the RCMP investigation led Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman to renew a 2017 council call for a public inquiry, not just into the police-headquarters construction but into other events at city hall before his election.\nPremier Brian Pallister\u00a0quickly rejected this idea, saying that there are bigger financial fish to fry in the province than examining what he described as an overbudget municipal project.\u00a0\nOn one hand, the police headquarters was indeed\u00a0over budget.\nIn 2009, when city council approved the purchase of Canada Post's old downtown Winnipeg office-and-warehouse complex and its conversion into a new police headquarters, the total project cost was pegged at $135 million.\nThe total cost wound up closer to $214 million by the time the Winnipeg Police Service completed its move into its new digs early in the summer of\u00a02016.\nYet concerns about the project at city hall went beyond the ballooning cost, criminal allegations or poor project-management oversight identified in a 2014 city-commissioned audit conducted by consulting firm KPMG.\nTen years after city council approved the police HQ, it's still unclear why the city pursued a\u00a0project that continues to cause the city unanticipated expenses\u00a0and logistical headaches.\nThe police headquarters was completed $79-million over budget, three years behind schedule and with alleged construction deficiencies that remain the subject of legal action between the City of Winnipeg and police HQ contractor Caspian Projects.\nIt required the city to borrow $155 million and service that debt, take possession of a Canada Post office tower it is unable to fill with tenants, and demolish a Public Safety Building once regarded as a key component of an ensemble of modernist buildings around city hall.\nOn the day the Crown announced the end of the criminal investigation, Mayor Bowman and\u00a0former Canadian Taxpayers Federation Prairie director Colin Craig\u00a0\u2014 who brought whistleblower complaints about the police HQ to Manitoba Justice in 2014\u00a0\u2014 said unanswered questions about the police HQ remain.\nHere are some of those questions, for posterity's sake.\nThe police HQ project was set into motion in December 2007, when the\u00a0city put the brakes on a plan to repair the crumbling Tyndall-stone facade of the Public Safety Building\u00a0and house police in temporary, high-security offices elsewhere while construction proceeded on\u00a0Princess Street.\nThe price tag for recladding the PSB and housing police elsewhere\u00a0rose to $22\u00a0million, prompting officials to consider whether it would make more sense for the city to build\u00a0a new headquarters with room for more police units.\nIn February 2008, the city began considering the purchase of the soon-to-be-decommissioned Canada Post tower and warehouse on Graham Avenue. Council approved the $29.25-million purchase of the complex and a $105-million redevelopment in 2009, based on a recommendation from city officials.\nWhat those officials did not disclose to council\u00a0is that there was no clear financial advantage to pursuing this scheme.\nA city-commissioned report by the consulting firm Hanscomb concluded in 2009 that it would cost roughly the same amount of money to demolish and renovate the existing Public Safety Building, demolish the Civic Centre Parkade and expand the PSB over the old parkade's footprint to the north as it would to buy and renovate the Canada Post complex.\nThe recommendation to city council made no mention of the Hanscomb findings.\nThe report to council listed benefits of amalgamating police operations in the new headquarters, but made no mention of\u00a0structural and mechanical issues consultants had identified at the Canada Post complex.\nWhen consulting firm EY conducted a review of\u00a0major Winnipeg real estate transactions in 2014,\u00a0it found the city made no effort to consider any site other than the Canada Post complex for its new police HQ.\n\"While an analysis was performed to assess whether 266 Graham could accommodate the police headquarters, EY did not observe file documentation evidencing that other properties other than 266 Graham were considered as potential locations for the new police headquarters,\" the auditors wrote.\nThe city also\u00a0\"did not advertise the need for such property\" in order to identify other available options, the report said.\nThe review also found the city\u00a0didn't get an independent appraisal of the property to ensure what the vendor wanted was equivalent to market value.\nChronology of the former Canada Post building sale\n\"A comprehensive procurement process was not undertaken and, for a facility of this size and magnitude,\u00a0should have been considered. As such, it is uncertain if value for money was achieved,\" the authors of the review wrote.\nThe review also said former Winnipeg chief administrative officer Phil Sheegl, serving at the time as the city's deputy CAO, had asked Canada Post for the exclusive right to buy the complex.\nThe city sent Canada Post an unsolicited offer to purchase the complex in November 2008, the review said \u2014 one full year before city council authorized the purchase.\nThe construction contract for the Winnipeg police headquarters was split into two pieces. The first was a request for proposals for $50,000 worth of pre-construction services.\nSix days before the response period closed, the city made a final addendum to the guidelines.\nThe change involved a reduction in the threshold for what's known in the construction industry as a performance bond \u2014 the amount of money a construction company has to put up to guarantee it can finish the job.\nThis bond acts as insurance for a construction company's client. If a firm cannot complete the work, the client may cash in the bond.\nThe original request for proposals for the project, issued in November\u00a02010, called for construction companies to put up a cheque for 50 per cent of the total bid price, or $51 million of what was then a $102-million project.\nOn Jan. 12, 2011, the city reduced this guarantee to a cheque for $25 million, less than one-quarter of the value of the work.\nThe Surety Association of Canada, the national body for companies that issue construction bonds, told the Winnipeg Free Press\u00a0in 2013 that a 25 per cent bond is uncommon and the industry standard calls for either 50 per cent or 100 per cent of the total value of the job.\nThe city, however, said in a\u00a02013 report to council\u00a0that it reduced the threshold at the Surety Association's behest. The association told the Free Press it did not issue this direction.\nCity officials told the Free Press\u00a0the higher bond threshold would have prevented smaller players from bidding.\nEmails\u00a0the RCMP presented to a judge in order to obtain police HQ investigation\u00a0search warrants\u00a0revealed Caspian owner Armik Babakhanians, deputy CAO Sheegl and other officials discussed the change to the bonding requirement and the award of the contract before it was awarded.\nA total of four entities responded to the request for proposals:\u00a0three national firms\u00a0\u2014\u00a0PCL Construction, Graham Construction and\u00a0Stuart Olson Dominion Construction\u00a0\u2014 and a joint venture between two Winnipeg firms, Caspian Projects and Akman\u00a0Construction.\nOn Feb. 10, 2011, the first phase of the contract was awarded to the Caspian-Akman joint venture.\nThe joint venture between Caspian Projects and\u00a0Akman Construction dissolved in June 2011, when Akman left the venture.\u00a0At\u00a0Caspian's request, the city reassigned the $50,000 pre-construction contract to Caspian alone.\nIn November 2011, Sheegl awarded the main construction work\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a $137.1-million \"guaranteed maximum price\" contract \u2014 to Caspian alone. That contract was amended to $156.4 million in 2013.\nThe 2014 KPMG audit suggested the city awarded work\u00a0to an entity that\u00a0submitted no bid.\nArizona land deal involving Sam Katz doesn't make sense: real estate experts\n\"We note that Caspian did not submit a proposal, and that Caspian was awarded the construction contract,\" KPMG said in its audit.\nPallister has made it clear: There will be no inquiry.\nHe said the City of Winnipeg is free to continue its legal action against Caspian and engineering firm Adjeleian Allen Rubeli\u00a0for alleged deficiencies at the police headquarters.\nThe premier also suggested this week that the city could explore other remedies\u00a0but did not specify what those would be.\n"}, {"author": "Bartley Kives", "title": "What we still don't know about Winnipeg's police HQ", "description": "Mayor Brian Bowman says questions remain unanswered; here are some of them", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-police-headquarters-questions-1.5402630", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778451.1554838087!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/new-police-headquarters-winnipeg.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 22, 2019 6:00 AM CT", "2019-12-22T12:00:00.409Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "After a five-year criminal investigation into the construction of Winnipeg's police headquarters, Manitoba's Crown prosecution service decided not to proceed with charges.\nNonetheless, questions about the police HQ remain, including why the city embarked on the project in the first place.\nThe RCMP spent 2\u00bd years looking into allegations of fraud, forgery, the payment of a secret commission and breach of trust in relation to the project.

As such, it is uncertain if value for money was achieved,\" the authors of the review wrote.\nThe review also said former Winnipeg chief administrative officer Phil Sheegl, serving at the time as the city's deputy CAO, had asked Canada Post for the exclusive right to buy the complex.\nThe city sent Canada Post an unsolicited offer to purchase the complex in November 2008, the review said \u2014 one full year before city council authorized the purchase.\nThe construction contract for the Winnipeg police headquarters was split into two pieces. The first was a request for proposals for $50,000 worth of pre-construction services.\nSix days before the response period closed, the city made a final addendum to the guidelines.\nThe change involved a reduction in the threshold for what's known in the construction industry as a performance bond \u2014 the amount of money a construction company has to put up to guarantee it can finish the job.\nThis bond acts as insurance for a construction company's client. If a firm cannot complete the work, the client may cash in the bond.\nThe original request for proposals for the project, issued in November\u00a02010, called for construction companies to put up a cheque for 50 per cent of the total bid price, or $51 million of what was then a $102-million project.\nOn Jan. 12, 2011, the city reduced this guarantee to a cheque for $25 million, less than one-quarter of the value of the work.\nThe Surety Association of Canada, the national body for companies that issue construction bonds, told the Winnipeg Free Press\u00a0in 2013 that a 25 per cent bond is uncommon and the industry standard calls for either 50 per cent or 100 per cent of the total value of the job.\nThe city, however, said in a\u00a02013 report to council\u00a0that it reduced the threshold at the Surety Association's behest. The association told the Free Press it did not issue this direction.\nCity officials told the Free Press\u00a0the higher bond threshold would have prevented smaller players from bidding.\nEmails\u00a0the RCMP presented to a judge in order to obtain police HQ investigation\u00a0search warrants\u00a0revealed Caspian owner Armik Babakhanians, deputy CAO Sheegl and other officials discussed the change to the bonding requirement and the award of the contract before it was awarded.\nA total of four entities responded to the request for proposals:\u00a0three national firms\u00a0\u2014\u00a0PCL Construction, Graham Construction and\u00a0Stuart Olson Dominion Construction\u00a0\u2014 and a joint venture between two Winnipeg firms, Caspian Projects and Akman\u00a0Construction.\nOn Feb. 10, 2011, the first phase of the contract was awarded to the Caspian-Akman joint venture.\nThe joint venture between Caspian Projects and\u00a0Akman Construction dissolved in June 2011, when Akman left the venture.\u00a0At\u00a0Caspian's request, the city reassigned the $50,000 pre-construction contract to Caspian alone.\nIn November 2011, Sheegl awarded the main construction work\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a $137.1-million \"guaranteed maximum price\" contract \u2014 to Caspian alone. That contract was amended to $156.4 million in 2013.\nThe 2014 KPMG audit suggested the city awarded work\u00a0to an entity that\u00a0submitted no bid.\nArizona land deal involving Sam Katz doesn't make sense: real estate experts\n\"We note that Caspian did not submit a proposal, and that Caspian was awarded the construction contract,\" KPMG said in its audit.\nPallister has made it clear: There will be no inquiry.\nHe said the City of Winnipeg is free to continue its legal action against Caspian and engineering firm Adjeleian Allen Rubeli\u00a0for alleged deficiencies at the police headquarters.\nThe premier also suggested this week that the city could explore other remedies\u00a0but did not specify what those would be.\n"}, {"author": "John Paul Tasker", "title": "Conservatives enter 40-day federal campaign flush with cash, focused on Quebec", "description": "Party should have enough money on hand to spend $28.1 million, the maximum allowed under federal law", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-campaign-launch-story-1.5278260", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5279512.1568224096!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-conservatives-20190911.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 11, 2019 11:00 AM ET", "2019-09-11T21:04:01.568Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Conservatives are determined to make Justin Trudeau a one-term prime minister as they\u00a0look to send their leader, Andrew Scheer, from the opposition benches to the seat of government.\nThe party, which has outstripped its rivals' fundraising efforts by millions of dollars, already has begun blanketing the airwaves with TV ads trying to familiarize Canadians with Scheer.\nIn the last quarter, the Conservative Party of Canada raised more than the Liberal, New Democrat and Green parties combined. It should have enough cash on hand to spend the maximum allowable by law: $28.1 million for the national campaign.\nThe party also has vetted and nominated a full slate of 338 candidates ahead of the other parties.\nThe Conservatives have\u00a0secured a campaign plane that's ready to take off today to bring Scheer to every part\u00a0of the country considered to be\u00a0in play in this election\u00a0\u2014 notably New Brunswick, rural Quebec\u00a0and parts of suburban Toronto and Vancouver.\n\"In politics, money talks,\" Andrew Brander, a strategist at Crestview and a former chief of staff to Conservative deputy leader Lisa Raitt, told CBC News. \"Honestly, from an organizational standpoint, (Conservatives) are certainly the best-positioned at this time. And they have a ballot box question \u2014 affordability \u2014 that will motivate their base to show up.\"\n\"You and your family are at the heart of the October 21 election. Who can you trust to help you and your family to get ahead? And the answer is not Justin Trudeau, who will only take more money from your pockets. He doesn't know what it's like to raise a family in difficult conditions,\" Scheer said at a campaign launch event.\nBrander said the party already has started sending out teams of canvassers to target key ridings \u2014 areas where they hope they can capitalize on Liberal weakness.\nThe party also has used some of its sizeable war chest to\u00a0bolster its digital approach to campaigning, Brander said.\nHe said the party has deployed a\u00a0new smartphone app that allows volunteers to access reams of voter data \u2014\u00a0information that can help party volunteers maximize their time at the doors of supporters and swing voters leaning Conservative.\nThe two cities that Scheer will visit Wednesday for the official campaign launch reveal a lot\u00a0about the kind of seats the Tories will be targeting over the next 40 days.\nScheer will start the day in Trois-Rivieres, Que., a predominantly francophone seat in the Quebec heartland between Montreal and Quebec City. He'll\u00a0finish the day with a rally in Woodbridge, Ont., a suburb of Toronto.\n\"The first week is very indicative of where the leaders believe the election can be won or lost. You'll see\u00a0Scheer\u00a0spend time in areas where he can pick up seats, but also in areas where can stave off some of the potential upsets. He's clearly targeting suburban families,\" Brander said.\nBrander said voters can expect to see Scheer\u00a0spend a lot of time along the Highway 401 corridor\u00a0as he looks to cobble together the same coalition that last year delivered conservative governments in Ontario and Quebec.\nConservatives also hope to steal away more seats like Chicoutimi-Le Fjord (Conservative candidate Richard Martel bested his Liberal opponent there in a 2018 byelection),\u00a0peel away Liberal ridings in vote-rich Mississauga and Brampton, Ont., and capitalize on NDP weakness in places like Saskatchewan and rural B.C., among others, to help them put together a majority government.\nBrander, a veteran of both federal and provincial conservative campaigns,\u00a0said the party has recruited some respected candidates in Quebec and is poised to gain from the\u00a0NDP's slump. \"The party has spent a lot resources rebuilding the party infrastructure in that province. I would expect Scheer to double down during the\u00a0campaign to make sure those results come through for him on election day,\" he said.\nScheer\u00a0reminded voters in Quebec Wednesday that it was the last Conservative government that officially recognized Quebec as a \"nation within a united Canada\" and gave the province a semi-formal presence at the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO).\nScheer said he'd need the support of the\u00a0\"Quebec nation\" in particular to \"restore integrity and accountability to government\" in Ottawa.\nScheer has narrowed what was once a significant polling advantage for Trudeau and the Liberals.\nAlmost a year ago to the day, the CBC's Poll Tracker put the Liberals in front by a healthy seven points among leaning and decided voters. Today, the two parties\u00a0are locked in a dead heat.\nWhile Scheer's Conservatives have lost some of the momentum they had in the spring during the peak of the SNC-Lavalin affair \u2014 a scandal that resulted in the departure of the prime minister's top adviser and two senior cabinet ministers\u00a0\u2014 they are still polling higher than the share of the vote Scheer's predecessor Stephen Harper won on election day in 2015, if only slightly.\u00a0The Conservatives took 31.9 per cent of the vote on election day 2015; they were polling at 33.8 per cent as of Sept. 10.\nThe Liberals, meanwhile, have dropped about five points in the polls since 2015\u00a0\u2014 from 39.5 per cent on election day to 33.8 per cent as of Sept. 10.\nThe Conservative Party has launched a series of television ads highlighting some of the prime minister's broken promises and warning voters that Trudeau \"isn't as advertised.\"\nAnother, more recent ad campaign\u00a0features the party's election slogan: \"It's time for you to get ahead.\"\nScheer, like his provincial conservative counterparts, has railed against the Liberal government's carbon tax, claiming it will make everyday life more expensive and vowing to scrap it, if elected. The Liberals maintain the initiative will lower greenhouse gas emissions and will be rebated to most families at tax time.\nThe party is expected to unveil a series of campaign commitments in the same vein. Already, the Conservatives have promised a non-refundable tax credit on maternity and parental leave\u00a0Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. They've also vowed to take the federal GST off sales of home heating fuels.\nScheer has said he will make his pitch to younger voters through a housing policy directed at millennials, many of whom are struggling to buy homes in an era of sky-high housing prices in most of Canada's big cities.\nThe Conservatives believe affordability will be the ballot box question of this election, and they're hoping to attract the support of would-be Liberal defectors.\n"}, {"author": "Alicia Elliott", "title": "The rise of Indigenous horror: How a fiction genre is confronting a monstrous reality", "description": "Indigenous writers know what it's like to live in a world where the horror never stops", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/arts/the-rise-of-indigenous-horror-how-a-fiction-genre-is-confronting-a-monstrous-reality-1.5323428", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323468.1571692354!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/moon-of-the-crusted-snow.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 17, 2019 5:15 PM ET", "2019-10-17T21:15:30.709Z"], "source": "CBC Arts", "content": "Shelfies is a monthly column by writer Alicia Elliott that looks at arts and culture through the prism of the books on her shelf.\nWhen I was a young girl, the most terrifying movie I had ever seen was The Exorcist. There was something about another young girl \u2014 also on the cusp of puberty, but speaking with the voice and vocabulary of a demon, housing supernatural evil within her slight frame \u2014 that haunted me for years after I watched it. Fear of female sexuality and agency have long created social anxieties, but that wasn't the fear that drove me. What really got me about Regan's demonic possession was her lack of control. She could watch as this demon moved with her arms and legs and listen as it spoke with her tongue, but she couldn't do anything herself. She was totally and utterly helpless.\nWatching the state of the world unfurl across my Twitter timeline every day, it's hard not to feel the tendrils of that old fear. I feel helpless to stop the tide of white supremacy rising within Canada; to stop the attitudes that contribute to Black and brown folks being targeted for police violence and incarceration; to stop immigrants and refugees from being treated like societal poison to be sucked out of the body politic; to stop my Indigenous sisters, cousins, aunties and friends from wondering if they're going to end up missing or murdered with the country's news editors downplaying their plight; to stop the ever-increasing rate of environmental degradation that will no doubt one day kill us all.\nConsidering all of these fears, it might come as a surprise that the only genre I really want to engage with these days is horror. But there's comfort in witnessing a world where the horror eventually stops \u2014 even if that world is fictional. In a horror book or movie, there's usually some sort of reason for terror to infiltrate and obliterate characters' lives: a character played with a Ouija board, or a family moved into a haunted hotel, or a housing development was built on an Indian burial ground (more on this later). There's usually some internal logic to be followed in this world until the terror is eventually overcome \u2014 the kind of logic that isn't offered by the horrors of reality.\nIn \"Glossary of a Haunting,\" Eve Tuck and C. Ree explain that American horror is \"preoccupied with the hero, who is perfectly innocent, but who is assaulted by monstering or haunting just the same.\" With this in mind, it's particularly interesting to follow modern Indigenous horror. If the creators of Western horror believe Indigenous genocide only belongs in the national consciousness as a horror trope \u2014 the infamous \"Indian burial ground,\" which for the record should be all of this continent \u2014 and that the people (often white) haunted by our ancestors' ghosts are innocent victims, what do the descendants of those ghosts fear? What more is there to fear when you've already faced governments who have tried for centuries to wipe you out, who have used biological warfare and forced starvation to create apocalypse for your people?\nIt's remarkable to consider that many non-Indigenous horror writers depict situations that Indigenous people have already weathered \u2014 such as apocalyptic viral outbreaks that decimate whole populations \u2014 or use the history of genocidal violence against us to explain why innocent white folks are being haunted today, such as in Stephen King's It or the 1982 film Poltergeist. In fact, I'm not sure what scares non-Indigenous horror writers and readers more: experiencing variations of what Indigenous folks have already endured for centuries, or the reality that they have built their entire country on literal Indian burial grounds.\nIndigenous writers, on the other hand, acknowledge the mundane horror of living in a country that dehumanizes you, weaving the reality of Indigenous life with fiction to scare audiences. In Waubgeshig Rice's Moon of the Crusted Snow, for example, the apocalyptic event that ends life as we know it \u2014 taking out power, internet, phones, satellites, etc. \u2014 isn't even really noticed as an apocalyptic event at first; it's just another day on a northern rez, where power can go out at any time and internet and phone signals aren't always available. As Nick, a young Anishinaabe man, points out, \"We thought it was kinda funny...The blackout was only two days, but it seemed like some people were already freaking out a little bit. I was just like, 'Come to the rez, this shit happens all the time!'\" Once it becomes apparent that things have changed forever, the protagonist Evan observes that \"the milestones he [now] used to mark time were the deaths in the community\u2026as people perished through sickness, mishap, violence or by their own hands.\" He notes that northern reserves like his are \"familiar with tragedy,\" the result of generations of intergenerational trauma and genocide \u2014 only now this tragedy is magnified.\nSimilarly, Jeff Barnaby's new movie Blood Quantum takes the real-life horror of Indigenous history and plugs it into a zombie horror film. In Barnaby's film, a zombie virus ravages a non-Indigenous community that borders a reserve; the only thing that saves the Indigenous community from the same fate is their apparent immunity to that virus. The community's decision to take in non-Native survivors, who may turn into zombies and kill their people, is a fraught one for the film's characters. Considering the devastation viruses carried by white settlers have historically wrought on Indigenous communities \u2014 the 1862 smallpox epidemic is estimated to have cut the First Nations population in what's now known as British Columbia in half \u2014 it's not hard to understand why.\nIn her bestselling book The Marrow Thieves, Cherie Dimaline used the real history of residential schools to create a terrifying post-apocalyptic world where Indigenous children are hunted and harvested for their bone marrow. Her latest novel, Empire of Wild, similarly uses the M\u00e9tis tale of the Rogarou to tell a story of religion and resource extraction. The Rogarou was originally a story told to young Indigenous children, particularly girls, to keep them from the roads near the edge of their communities, where white men would pick them up and they'd end up missing or murdered. They scared their children in an attempt to keep them alive.\nUnlike in a book or movie, these horrors haven't stopped, either. I recently heard M\u00e9tis-Cree author and scholar Jesse Thistle read from his bestselling book From the Ashes: My Story of Being Metis, Homeless and Finding My Way. Thistle introduced his reading from by bringing up the Rogarou, which he originally heard about from Dimaline. \"This passage,\" he said, \"describes my encounter with the Rogarou.\" He went on to describe being violently and randomly attacked by white strangers \u2014a scenario that countless white women have suffered in countless horror movies. The difference, of course, is that fictitious white women in horror movies are almost always considered innocent by viewers; Indigenous men are not, no matter the circumstances.\nIn Billy-Ray Belcourt's newest poetry collection, NDN Coping Mechanisms: Notes from the Field, there is a poem titled \"Canadian Horror Story.\" In it, Belcourt grapples with the deaths of Tina Fontaine and Colten Boushie \u2014 as well as the injustice of their accused murderer's trials. \"It feels unethical to age,\" Belcourt writes, summoning the survivor's guilt all Indigenous people carry when they outlive friends, relatives, even complete strangers. Then he turns his attention to non-Indigenous Canada: \"An entire citizenry is implicated...How does it feel to live in an asylum you built bone by sooty bone?\"\nPerhaps there will come a time when white Canada will meaningfully grapple with this question, when I won't have to look to horror to find a world where the monsters eventually stop. Until then, Tuck and Ree have put it best: \"Haunting is the cost of subjugation. It is the price paid for violence, for genocide...I don't want to haunt you, but I will.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coming home: Vianne Timmons named as new MUN president", "description": "She has served as the president of University of Regina for the past 11 years", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/mun-president-announced-1.5393802", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5394533.1581015917!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vianne-timmons-mun-president.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 12, 2019 2:06 PM NT", "2019-12-12T22:05:35.354Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Memorial University has announced that Vianne Timmons will be taking over as president and vice-chancellor of the university.\u00a0\nTimmons\u00a0will replace longtime president\u00a0Gary Kachanoski, who ended his term about six months early and plans to teach at MUN.\nVianne Timmons, who grew up in Labrador City,\u00a0previously was the president and vice-chancellor of the University of Regina.

Yes, I think a discussion is warranted,\" she said.\nTimmons is looking forward to the time when giving a university president job to a woman is not newsworthy.\n\"I'm thrilled that Memorial decided to go with a woman. It's important to recognize that there are women and men who are leaders in our country,\" she said.\n\"But I'm also a bit sad about being named first. I was the first dean of education at the university of Prince Edward Island.

Suddenly the clouds burst,\u00a0and the party is moved\u00a0to a women's\u00a0centre across the street.\u00a0\n\"We're gathering, I guess, to feel like we have a form of resistance,\" says Alice Bernard, who splits the $800 monthly rent for one of the second-floor apartments with a friend.\nThe eviction party is to say goodbye to their neighbours who've agreed to pull up stakes \u2014 and to create awareness about the impact gentrification is having on their Centre-Sud neighbourhood.\nThe building had been on the market years, and in May, tenants found out it had been sold, and the new owner,\u00a0Henry Zavriyev, planned to undertake major renovations.\u00a0\nZavriyev\u00a0offered tenants as much as $5,000 to leave and promised he'd help\u00a0find them an affordable place to move to.\nBernard and her roommate, and the people living in two other units have so far refused his offer and say they won't go without a fight.\u00a0\n\"I really, really love this neighbourhood,\" says Yasmine Belam, another\u00a0tenant who has said no to leaving.\nBelam, who has worked and lived in Centre-Sud for years, says they wanted to find a way to have fun amid \"a really, really stressful situation.\"\nZavriyev, who is still in his 20s,\u00a0says he purchased this building on De Maisonneuve Boulevard\u00a0with the help of investors, and he proposes to knock out the rear walls and expand\u00a0it into the big backyard, to create bigger units that are suitable for families.\nHe says the building is \"sagging in the middle\" and needs significant structural work, whether he gets the go-ahead for his rebuild idea or not.\nHe says he wants to keep the apartments as rental units, explaining he couldn't convert\u00a0them to\u00a0condos even if he wanted to because of a bylaw that prevents developers from doing so if they've been occupied by tenants within\u00a0the previous decade.\nSeveral of the building's tenants and soon-to-be-former tenants\u00a0are under the impression the building is to be converted into short-term rental units and posted on Airbnb.\u00a0\nZavriyev happens to run\u00a0a business called Padly, a service that\u00a0manages other people's Airbnb listings \u2014 dealing with renters and organizing the cleanup.\nBut he insists he has no intention of turning this building into a block of short-term rental units,\u00a0pointing to a Ville-Marie borough rule that restricts such rentals to Sainte-Catherine Street between Saint-Mathieu and Amherst streets.\u00a0\nBelam points out that, despite the borough's short-term housing bylaw, there are several apartments in the neighbourhood\u00a0known to be listed on Airbnb, including one right next to the women's centre.\n\"The women tell me,\u00a0'We're always dealing with their trash,' because they just put it out whenever they're leaving,\" she said.\n\"All year we've been fighting against gentrification,\" says Julie Leblanc, one of the women who works at the centre, as she fixes herself a hot dog.\u00a0\n\"It's crazy that it's come and settled right in front of us \u2026 in a neighbourhood where we cannot afford to lose rental units.\"\nAs Montreal families desperately hunt for affordable housing, advocates warn of looming crisis\nMontreal isn't the haven for renters it once was\nNew condo developments have brought an influx of people with higher incomes, too, Leblanc says, driving up the average income in the neighbourhood, which has cost some elementary schools in the areas their subsidized breakfast and lunch programs.\nMartine Cl\u00e9ment was born and raised in Centre-Sud, and her parents still live nearby. She said she was given no choice but to leave because she has two little dogs that aren't listed on her lease.\n\"I've been here for four years, and my old landlord never said anything,\" says Cl\u00e9ment.\nShe accepted Zavriyev's offer of $5,000, but with only a month to find an affordable apartment big enough for herself, her partner, her daughters and one of their boyfriends, the only place she could find was in T\u00e9treaultville, a half-hour drive away in the city's east end.\nAnother tenant, Alain Gaudet, also accepted the $5,000.\n\"Whoa, five Gs, man,\" says Gaudet. \"It's a lot of money in one shot.\"\nBut as he banded together with his neighbours to figure out what to do, he's ended up regretting his decision.\n\"I don't want to move anymore, man. They're all my friends now.\"\nGaudet, a carpenter, is the one who built the teepee-like structure in the backyard. It's made of scrap wood and a cardboard box. A bicycle tire hangs off the top, and there's a bright red heart on the door. There used to be a sign on it, too, that read \"Garden of the evicted,\" but Zavriyev took it down.\nZavriyev says he respects the tenants' right to protest.\n\"My reaction was that it was kind of cool,\" he told CBC News, although in an email to the tenants who have so far refused to leave, his tone is more defensive: \"To you \u2026 a landlord is a bad person that's it, that's all. Nothing I can do about that.\"\nGaudet lucked out in his search for a new apartment. He found one in the neighbourhood that will also let him move in with his two dogs. But he says the hunt wasn't easy.\n\"I was going to visit places, and there's like 20 people waiting in line.\"\u00a0\nZavriyev says he tried to ease tenants' stress as much as possible, offering more compensation money than his backers were comfortable with, in order to find \"a way that makes sense for everyone and where everyone is satisfied.\"\n\"I recognize that this is your home, and that this is not the ideal situation,\" he said. \"But how do I put this? I think everything that was done was done correctly.\"\nAs their neighbours move out, one by one, Bernard and Belam are torn about what to do. Because of the extensive repairs Zavriyev is planning, the eviction notice they got this spring, six months before the end of their lease, is entirely legal.\u00a0\nBelam says they'll continue to fight gentrification on all fronts in the Ville-Marie borough, but \"we feel like we're just leaving the problem to another time if we don't start to look for apartments now.\"\nZavriyev has also doubled his offer to $10,000 if they leave by September, says Bernard.\u00a0\n\"It's harsh because the last thing I want to do is take the money,\" she says. \"It's always tempting but I just feel like mad at him, mad at the system for buying people out.\"\n\"But, you know, it's not about landlords. It's about the lack of protection for citizens,\u00a0the lack of social housing and protection of neighbourhoods and how we want to live our lives in cities.\"\nBernard has moved often. She's planted gardens like the herb bed in the backyard on De\u00a0Maisonneuve wherever she has lived, but she's never stayed long enough to see them become well-established. She'd hoped this time it would be different.\n\"I make a garden and then we're evicted,\" Bernard says, cursing in French.\u00a0\nThen she laughed and ate a chip with some homemade pesto.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Mortgage insurer Genworth Canada may be sold as U.S. parent works on Chinese merger", "description": "Genworth MI competes with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/genworth-mortgage-canada-1.5196843", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3083745.1432309561!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/real-estate-condo-condominium-for-sale-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 02, 2019 12:26 PM ET", "2019-07-02T16:26:54.396Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Mortgage insurer Genworth MI Canada is up for sale as the company's U.S. parent is trying to streamline its operations as it works on being bought out itself by a Chinese buyer.\nVirginia-based\u00a0Genworth Financial Inc. is currently trying to hammer out the details of a deal that will see Chinese company\u00a0China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co.

For many people working in the corporate head offices of any number of oil and gas companies in Calgary, this was yet another sign that the federal government was choking the life \u2014 some believe deliberately \u2014 out of the energy sector.\nIt's surely tempting for them to think that a new tenant at 24 Sussex will change this state of affairs.\nFor example, Martin Pelletier, a Calgary-based portfolio manager, suggested on Twitter that the October federal election (and presumably a victory by Andrew Scheer's Conservatives) could be the \"catalyst\" that finally sparks a turnaround.\nBut those people were probably thinking the same thing about Jason Kenney and the UCP earlier this year, and despite cutting corporate taxes and declaring war against the industry's enemies, both foreign and domestic, the energy sector has continued to bleed jobs and capital. The shares of publicly-traded companies, meanwhile, are trading at multi-year lows \u2014 far lower than where they were at before April's election.\nThis isn't Kenney's fault, mind you.\nInstead, it's a reflection of the fact that there's nothing any Canadian politician can do to arrest the technological, economic, and environmental changes that are reshaping the oil and gas industry's future.\nIndeed, those sorts of tectonic shifts are beyond the reach of even the most powerful politician in the world.\nJust ask the U.S. coal industry, which pinned its hopes on Donald Trump's pledge to make it great again only to watch him flail impotently as ever-cheaper natural gas and renewables continued to eat away at their proverbial lunch. By the time he's out of office they'll be lucky if there's even a snack left for them. Politics, as ever, are no match for economics.\nThe same thing is true in the oil industry, where those technological changes have redefined the economic landscape and transformed a market that used to be defined by scarcity of supply into one that's practically drowning in surplus. That's put an end to the days when multinational corporations would back up the metaphorical truck in order to get their hands on some small slice of Alberta's billions of barrels of oil.\nAnd worse still, from the perspective of the companies that own those barrels (and the provincial treasury that benefits from their sale), the growing concern about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions is chipping away at the rampant growth in demand for oil that defined the early 2000s and marking a clear path to its eventual decline.\nThat raises an almost existential question for Calgary.\nIn a city where praying for another oil boom and promising not to piss it away is practically a rite of passage, what happens if God doesn't have any more booms left to give?\nIf Calgarians are looking for an answer, they could do a lot worse than asking someone who's spent the last few decades in Detroit.\nIn 1980, Detroit had the second-highest median income per capita for workers under 35 in the country (nearby Flint, Mich., was number one). Today, those incomes have dropped by nearly $15,000 a year. And while it probably seems strange to compare the two cities, Calgary and Detroit have more in common than it might appear.\nBoth are defined by one dominant industry\u00a0whose economic reach extends beyond its own supply chains and into the vitality of the city's restaurants, bars, boutiques\u00a0and housing market. Both have resisted efforts to diversify away from those industries and expand the scope of their economies. And while Calgary's stock in trade hasn't been disrupted in the way or to the degree that Detroit's was in the 1980s, we're all still in the early innings of a game that's yet to fully play itself out.\nFor Detroit, the disruptive change came in the form of increased competition from Japanese and German automakers and, somewhat ironically, a spike in the price of oil in the late 1970s. And despite increasingly desperate efforts to subsidize and support the city's auto industry, the slide continued more or less uninterrupted until it bottomed out during the 2008 recession.\nFor Calgary, and Alberta, the disruptive forces at work are twofold: the technology that's unlocked billions of barrels in the shales of Texas, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania, and the ever-improving economics of lower-carbon sources of energy like wind and solar. Together, they're transforming the global energy landscape \u2014 and turning what used to be a competitive advantage, Alberta's massive oil reserves, into a potential albatross.\nThat's a staggering turn of events, given that they looked until very recently like a licence to print money with no expiration date. But the fears of peak supply, which drove predictions of $200 per barrel oil and takeover offers in the oilpatch with generous premiums attached to them, have given way to the reality of peak demand. And while there's still disagreement about when demand for oil will peak, with more aggressive forecasts suggesting it could come as soon as the mid-2020s and more cautious ones pegging it closer to 2050, they all predict that demand will be plateauing in most of our lifetimes.\nAs Wood Mackenzie, one of the biggest energy research and consultancy firms in the world, noted in 2017, \"Although oil demand grows to 2035 on aggregate, it is minimal compared with what we have seen over the past 20 years. The prospect of peak oil demand is very real.\"\nThis doesn't mean Alberta's oil and gas industry is doomed, or that it needs to start shutting in production any time soon. Ironically, the very nature of the shale plays that makes them so attractive \u2014 their ability to bring on production quickly from new wells \u2014 also creates an opening for non-shale operators.\nUnlike the oilsands or conventional wells, whose production declines at a relatively gentle pace, shale wells are like a roller-coaster at an amusement park \u2014 a huge peak followed by a stomach-churning descent. Alberta can and will play a role in filling the gap they naturally create \u2014 a gap that will get much bigger as prices come down and fewer new shale wells are drilled.\n\"We can't try to live in the past and hope for more boom times,\" says Blake Shaffer, an economist with the University of Calgary and a former energy trader. \"But I do believe that there's scope for continued production \u2014 and especially when you look towards Trans Mountain and the potential for either west coast or cross-Pacific shipments.\"\nBut, he says, that scope will be informed by how quickly Alberta's oil and gas companies can drive down their costs \u2014 and their GHG emissions. And they'd better do it quickly, given that we're in the midst of a(nother) seismic shift in the global auto industry that will start hitting the demand for oil soon.\n\"I see the electric vehicle transition being far more rapid and far more widespread than I think even optimistic forecasts are calling for right now. And that's substantial,\" Shaffer says.\nIndeed, as Fortune noted in a recent story, \"EV sales are shooting up beyond many supposed experts' wildest predictions.\"\nAnd while petrochemical-driven demand is expected to continue growing, it won't be nearly enough to offset the growing impact of electric vehicles on transportation, which accounts for approximately 70 per cent of the overall appetite for oil.\n\"That's where the curve is going to bend,\" Shaffer says. \"I think we're going to see it in Europe, we're going to start to see it in the Americas, and we're going to start to see that sooner than we think in China.\"\nAnd Shaffer is clear: when it comes to that curve bending, it's only a matter of when, not if.\n\"Eventually, a transition is going to be required,\" Shaffer says, \"and we can do it in an orderly fashion or we can do it in a forced fashion. Preparing ourselves is prudent, simply from a risk management perspective.\"\nIt's this preparation that helps explain much of the so-called \"capital flight\" that's happened over the last four years, as American and international oil companies sell their Alberta assets to Canadian owned and controlled companies like Suncor and Canadian Natural Resources.\nDepending on oil prices and the quality of the acreage, an average shale well takes anywhere from 12 to 24 months to pay out \u2014 that is, generate revenue equivalent to its costs plus a return on the investment. An oilsands project, by comparison, can take upwards of a decade.\nIf you're a multinational company that's uncertain about the long-term demand picture for oil, you're going to start hedging out some of that risk.\n\"Just from a business point of view,\" Shaffer says, \"you want to reduce your exposure to being locked into long-life assets that may or may not be valuable. Having more flexibility with the shorter-life assets makes a lot of sense.\"\nThis is the reality that many Calgarians have yet to fully reckon with, the one where the recent pain and suffering is being meted out by global supply and demand realities rather than the person sitting in the prime minister's office (or, as some of the more conspiratorial whisperings would have it, his former principal secretary and longtime friend.)\nAnd while it's understandable that people want to go back to the days when the market traded on the basis of long-term scarcity rather than surplus, they're not coming back.\nNeither, just as importantly, are the days when the industry was significantly more labour-intensive than it is today. Companies are replacing workers with technology everywhere they can, from the drilling rig site to the head office, and there is nothing \u2014 not a new prime minister, nor any sort of short-term geopolitical disruption in the Middle East \u2014 that can change that.\n(This is the first of a two-part series examining the challenges facing Calgary's oil and gas sector.

Some of the poorest may no longer owe any tax at all.\n\"There is still about one million Canadians that earn less than that basic personal exemption,\" Gray said. \"So of course, that's going to be meaningful for them.\"\nFor Canadians in the middle-income\u00a0brackets, the annual savings could be up to $240.\nBut divide that across 26 bi-weekly pay periods and the income bump that starts appearing\u00a0on Canadian pay\u00a0stubs doesn't exactly look life-changing: it's enough for an extra cup of fancy coffee or, for higher earners, a food truck\u00a0lunch every two weeks.\nFor those earning more than $150,473 in annual income, the savings are partially clawed back,\u00a0or not offered at all for incomes over $214,368.\nFederal\u00a0tax brackets \u2014 the thresholds that\u00a0trigger higher rates of taxation as incomes rise \u2014\u00a0have been\u00a0adjusted for 2020 based on\u00a0a 1.9 per cent rate of inflation.\nGray points out that in several Canadian cities, particularly those with hot housing markets, the actual rate of inflation may be higher \u2014 which means that these tax brackets and sources of government income\u00a0like the Canada Child Benefit (also\u00a0indexed and rising slightly as of July 1,\u00a02020)\u00a0may not be\u00a0keeping up.\nWhen business or household budgets\u00a0are sensitive to things like rising food costs or higher\u00a0taxes on fossil fuels, the government's calculations fall behind taxpayers' lived reality.\n\"Some people are going to feel inflation more than others depending on their own lifestyle,\" Gray said.\u00a0\nFarther down the pay stub, deductions for Employment Insurance and the Canada Pension Plan are changing, too.\nEI\u00a0premiums are decreasing from 1.62 to 1.58 per cent in 2020, while the maximum insurable earnings will increase to $54,200 from $53,100.\nThat's a\u00a0saving, but don't spend it all at once: it amounts to\u00a0less than a dollar per bi-weekly paycheque.\nCPP premiums, on the other hand, are increasing from 5.1 to 5.25 per cent for employees (double that\u00a0for the self-employed)\u00a0and the maximum pensionable earnings\u00a0\u2014 the amount the government uses to calculate an employee's CPP contributions for the year \u2014 is going up to $58,700.\nFor those earning that much or more, deductions could increase by\u00a0about $5.73\u00a0per bi-weekly paycheque\u00a0(less for lower-income earners). But remember: today's CPP contributions become pension income at retirement, so CPP premiums are\u00a0a modest forced\u00a0savings program, not a tax.\n\"It's kind of painless, a little bit at a time,\" Gray said.\u00a0Young workers may find it difficult to save for retirement\u00a0and are\u00a0less likely than previous generations to have employer-sponsored pensions, so \"CPP is taking on a little bit more of that\u00a0job.\"\nThe problem, Gray said, is that many people max out their EI and CPP contributions before the end of the year, and get used to paycheques leading up to New Year's that have fewer deductions. When January comes around again, their net pay deposits drop\u00a0and \"it's a little bit of a shock.\"\nThis makes it harder to detect subtle deduction changes at the start of a new year.\nTaken together with Morneau's tax cut, \"I think it's going to be mostly a wash,\" Gray said.\nA few other tax items\u00a0change with the new calendar year.\nThe annual contribution limit for the tax-free savings account, which was launched in 2009,\u00a0doesn't change this year \u2014 it will be $6,000 as it was last year. Since your contribution room carries over year to year, eligible Canadians\u00a0will have a cumulative contribution room of\u00a0up to $69,500.\nFor those\u00a0considering upgrading professional skills, a new Canada Training Benefit allows\u00a0taxpayers to accumulate up to $250 per year toward a future tax credit to\u00a0offset\u00a0up to 50 per cent of eligible tuition costs.\nAnd those who spend some of their hard-earned income to support digital journalism will be able to\u00a0claim up to $500 in eligible subscriptions, for a tax credit worth up to $75, starting with their 2020 returns.\nAnother expected change was suddenly cancelled by Morneau's department late in the day on Dec.19: a move to start taxing stock options more like regular income.\nIn a press release, the department said that, following consultations with stakeholders,\u00a0\"the government will announce details on how it intends to move forward\" in the 2020 federal budget.\nPerhaps the most significant change for some Canadians is in the rebates they receive for living in provinces where they pay the federal carbon tax on things like gasoline and home heating fuels.\nAs of April 1, 2020, the federal price on carbon will rise from $20 to $30 per tonne of emissions. In line\u00a0with that, residents of four provinces will receive revised climate change incentives when they file their taxes this spring.\nIn Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the payments, based on household size, are higher than last year's.\nFor example, a single person in Ontario received $154 last year, but is eligible for $224 this year.\u00a0A family of four in Saskatchewan received $609 last year, but is eligible for $809 this year.\nNew Brunswick, which recently reached an agreement with the federal government on its carbon pricing\u00a0plan, will no longer be subject to the federal tax as of April 1 and its residents will not receive\u00a0rebates when they file their taxes.\u00a0\nGray said she doesn't think people make the connection between rising costs for things like gas\u00a0and the bonus they got at tax time.\n\"I don't know that it was a meaningful amount for many people, but it was still\u00a0nice to have,\" she said. \"It's a gift.\"\nWhich brings us to Albertans, who\u00a0will receive the federal incentive payments for the first time in 2020.\nTheir first payments are larger, to reflect three months when Albertans are paying a carbon tax based on $20 per tonne of emissions (January-March 2020) and twelve months when they're paying the $30/tonne price for 2020-21.\nAlberta\u00a0also generates relatively more carbon emissions that are now subject to the federal\u00a0tax, and the federal government pledged to return\u00a090 per cent of its carbon tax revenues.\nThe tax is meant to encourage households to consume less\u00a0carbon-polluting energy \u2014 so the\u00a0more people conserve, the more they benefit from the rebate.\nUnlike the provincial carbon pricing\u00a0scheme Premier Jason Kenney's government cancelled earlier this year, every Alberta household, regardless of income, is eligible.\nA single adult in Alberta will receive $444. A household of four will receive $888.\nNew climate incentive payments\u00a0could add\u00a0more to Albertans'\u00a0bottom lines than the Liberal tax cut.\n"}, {"author": "Andrew Leach", "title": "OPINION | NDP climate plan tries (and fails) to carve out middle ground", "description": "The plan is riddled with inconsistencies and short on details", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/ndp-climate-plan-andrew-leach-1.5276006", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5279668.1568227578!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jagmeet-canoe.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 13, 2019 5:00 AM MT", "2019-09-13T11:00:00.355Z"], "source": null, "content": "Editor's note: This is the third in a series of articles from energy and environmental economist Andrew Leach\u00a0about the federal political parties' climate plans. Read his previous articles here:\nLet's be honest: who among us would not like to commute to work in a canoe?\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh looks like he's doing just that on the cover of the NDP's Power to Change website.\nThe website and the accompanying, more detailed climate plan both contain multiple, veiled references to the Green New Deal plan put forward by New York congressional Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and are meant to evoke the same types of emotion and symbolism.\nIt's even in the web address: climate and jobs. But will it deliver?\nThe NDP plan carves out a middle ground between commitments to policies that might meet Canada's 2030 target from the Liberals, and the wildly ambitious platform of the Green Party.\nSingh's plan, though, is riddled with inconsistencies and short on details and, where details are given, the policies simply aren't stringent enough to meet the goals.\nThe NDP Plan highlights nine areas for action, of which six are related to reducing emissions.\nIn addition to setting new emissions targets, the NDP proposes a program of job creation through clean energy adoption, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, energy efficiency retrofits for buildings, cleaner transit, subsidies for zero-emissions vehicles and more involvement of Indigenous peoples in climate action.\nThere are also commitments related to single-use plastics, climate adaptation and the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).\nLet's start with their targets.\nWith all of the policies proposed to date by the governing Liberals, and notwithstanding potential reductions in the stringency of policies in Alberta and Ontario, we're on track for emissions of about 592 megatonnes (Mt) by 2030, well above our Paris target of 513 Mt.\nThe NDP plan sets a much deeper target.\nThey claim, with little evidence, that their policies will reduce our emissions to 450 Mt by 2030, and then add a statement that they plan to do more.\nThe monumental task of reducing national emissions by 38 per cent in 10 years is described as\u00a0\"an important first step,\" and they plan to add more measures to drive emissions down by a further 50 to 80 Mt, according to my calculations based on statements in the plan. We're just not told what those measures might be.\nHow is the NDP going to take this monumental first step? We're not told much about that either.\nThe plan states that the NDP will\u00a0\"continue carbon pricing, including rebates to households that fall under the federal backstop plan, while making it fairer and rolling back the breaks the Liberals have given to big polluters.\"\nWe're not told what the carbon price will be, just that there will continue to be one.\nInterestingly, later in the plan, the NDP has its own breaks for big polluters, although they call them a \"Low Carbon Industrial Strategy\" which will include\u00a0\"a fund that industrial operators like manufacturers can apply to in order to access support for investments in lowering emissions and keeping jobs here in Canada.\" This will also be complemented with a $3-billion \"Climate Bank\" that would provide loans to spur investment in green technology.\nThe plan tells us that\u00a0\"workers most impacted by the changes in our economy will not pay the price of action on climate change.\"\nHere, they draw on the work of the Task Force on Just Transition for Canadian Coal Power Workers and Communities, but managing a broad economic transition on the scale proposed by the NDP is an entirely different proposition than managing the impact of closing 14 coal power stations over 15 years. If you're not going to protect some of Canada's emissions-intensive sectors from competitiveness impacts, as the existing output-based-pricing system applied to industrial emissions does, you're talking about much more significant worker displacement still.\nWhat about oil and gas?\nFirst, the plan states that, \"where oil and gas will continue to form a part of Canada's energy mix in the immediate future, we will continue to prioritize domestic upgrading and refining instead of shipping our raw resources and jobs to other countries.\"\nDoes that mean new upgraders and refineries? Keeping the ones we have? Reducing production and export at the same time? If so, how? We're left to wonder.\nI was shocked that the plan doesn't even mention the oilsands, Canada's fastest-growing source of emissions, although it does mention bitumen once.\nThe plan also commits to eliminating oil and gas subsidies, claiming that\u00a0\"Canada spends $3.3 billion per year on oil and gas subsidies,\" and that\u00a0\"[the federal government] purchased the [Trans Mountain] oil pipeline for a staggering $4.5 billion,\" and that the government\u00a0\"gave another $1.6 billion in handouts to the oil patch.\"\nThese claims are worth unpacking because they're mostly smoke and mirrors.\nThe $3.3 billion number comes from a 2015 version of this IISD study, which is pretty dated when you consider how much has happened in oil and gas since then.\nThe up-to-date estimates from the same study group are smaller, with only about $380 million worth of federal subsidies on their list. Most of the subsidies in the original and up-to-date studies are attributed to Alberta and B.C. government policies: resource royalties, taxes, research grants and the like.\nIf Singh thinks the federal government can affect these policies, Sections 92 and 92A of the Constitution might have something to say about it.\nWhat about the $1.6 billion in \"handouts\"? That's where it gets interesting.\nThese were funds announced last year to, among other things, support investments in green technology and environmental efficiency. In other words, the same types of investments envisioned by the NDP's own proposed multi-billion-dollar Climate Bank and Low Carbon Industrial Strategy.\nAre we to understand that the NDP would not allocate any of these dollars to reduce emissions in the oil and gas sector? Or that similar investments made by the NDP would not count as subsidies or handouts for some reason?\nAs for Trans Mountain, the government did buy the pipeline for $4.5 billion, but this can't be seen as a direct subsidy, since the government also received a valuable asset in return.\nArguably, the pipeline expansion would not have been underwritten by any private sector company, but even so, the lion's share of the purchase price was not for the expansion but for the existing pipeline.\nInterestingly, the plan doesn't say what an NDP government would do with the pipeline, although presumably divestiture or outright cancellation would be on the list.\nIt's not clear in the plan how much the NDP expects these reductions in so-called subsidies to reduce emissions. What's certainly clear is that there are not billions of dollars worth of new dollars available to the federal government if federal oil and gas tax expenditures and other programs are cancelled.\nThe rest of the NDP plan for emissions reduction centres on three key commitments to buildings, greening transit and personal transportation and emissions-free electricity.\nThe NDP sets a target of retrofitting all housing stock in Canada by 2050, with half of these retrofits completed by 2030.\nHalf the homes in the country getting some sort of improvement by 2030 is ambitious in and of itself, but we're only told that\u00a0\"homeowners would be able to access low-interest loans repayable through energy savings to cover upgrades like insulation, windows, heat pumps, and other renewable technologies.\"\nInterest rates are already very low, so you're going to have to do a lot more than offer a low-interest loan (which would still likely have a higher rate than a mortgage or home-equity-secured line of credit) to get people to do a lot of things they would not already do to reduce emissions.\nOn electricity, the NDP will set\u00a0\"a target to power Canada with net carbon-free electricity by 2030, and move to 100 per cent non-emitting electricity by 2050.\"\nAs I wrote with the Green Party plan, this doesn't sound that ambitious at the national level, but regionally it's near-impossible.\nWe're not told much about the road from target to reality;\u00a0there's talk of the new Canadian Climate Bank, but new investment isn't the issue. If you're talking about a near-complete phase out of fossil fuel power in 10 years, you're going to need a big regulatory hammer or a much higher carbon price.\nAnd, supposing you were able to do that, you're going to need a massive increase in intertie capacity, storage and alternative, dispatchable electricity sources. Otherwise, it's going to be impossible to power many parts of the country when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing.\nOn vehicles, the plan is also quite ambitious in goals, but without a lot of detail on policies. Where there are details, there are also concerns.\nThe plan promises federal purchase incentives and federal sales tax exemptions\u00a0\"for working families\" on zero-emission vehicle purchases. I'm not sure how that means testing is actually going to work.\u00a0Do retired people not qualify?\nThese federal incentives will grow in value to $15,000 and be targeted to made-in-Canada vehicles only.\nThis is, of course, likely to run afoul of our free trade agreements, while also being a very regressive and costly policy.\nWe know that, historically, a significant share of electric or hybrid vehicle subsidies have been paid to those who a) would have purchased EVs anyway (see here for a review of research by Gulati and Antweiler) and b) are in the higher end of the income distribution.\nIf you walked into an NDP policy convention and pitched a policy that would hand out $15,000 cheques, predominantly to the most well-off households, and nothing to those who can't afford to buy a new car, how well do you think that policy would go over? Somehow, subsidies for electric vehicles always seem to escape that same type of scrutiny.\nTransportation and transit is the biggest line item in the plan at $6.5 billion, but when you consider that we have more than\u00a020-million light-duty vehicles on the roads in Canada, you're going to need a lot more than that to drive a large-scale conversion of Canada's fleet on subsidies alone, without additional regulations or, again, carbon prices.\nI was deeply critical of the Green Plan for pitching outcomes that, in many cases, were technically infeasible and of the Conservative Plan for promising more reductions from demonstrably weakened and/or undefined policies. The NDP fits in the middle of those two.\nThey offer targets which are, for the most part, at least technically feasible, but they don't offer the policy horsepower to get there.\nMany of the policies they do identify might be popular, but they simply won't generate the levels of emissions reductions promised.\nThis column is an opinion.

All were presented with the same questions.\u00a0Clicking the candidate's name above will take you to their survey responses. The candidates were told they had a 200-word limit for answers.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nTrust is the most important consideration facing residents of Perth\u2013Wellington in this election. Voters should consider two equally important questions.\nFirst, we must ask which leader, and which party, should we trust to take on serious national challenges.\u00a0Who do we trust to help make it possible for all of us to get ahead? Who do we trust to budget responsibly? Who do we trust to be a leader the world can take seriously?\nSecond, we must ask which local candidate has shown the ability to represent our values and capably serve our community. Which candidate do we trust to be accessible when we need them most? Which candidate has the experience we need to represent every community in Perth\u2013Wellington?\nTo earn voters' trust, I will continue doing what I have always done over the last four years: serving people to the best of my ability.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you return as the MP?\u00a0\nOver the last four years, we've been paying more for gasoline, home heating, hydro, housing, and much more. We must address the rising cost of living. As an MP, I would do what the Liberals did not do: I would oppose any measure that does not respect this reality facing too many Canadians.\nWe can start by trusting people with their own money. With the Conservatives' universal tax cut, the average Canadian family will save over $850 per year.\nAlso in our plan: tax credits for children's fitness and arts programs; tax-free maternity benefits; increasing the age credit for seniors by $1,000; and removing the federal tax on home heating.\nWe would also introduce four new measures to make it easier for first-time home buyers to buy a home.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nClimate change is real and requires immediate action. Andrew Scheer's plan would require the biggest polluters to reduce their carbon emissions or invest in new green technologies.\nIt is also a global problem requiring global solutions. For that, we must restore Canadian leadership on the world stage. We need a prime minister the world will take seriously.\nImposing additional taxes on people in our riding \u2014 who may have no choice but to drive to work or transport their crops to elevators \u2014 will make no meaningful difference in reducing emissions. It will just make life even more expensive.\nYou can read the Conservative plan for the environment at the website arealplan.ca.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nRaised on our family's farm near Mitchell, I learned early the importance of hard work. I believe in public service and our capacity to build strong, healthy communities\u00a0and a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I'm running to serve every person in every corner of Perth\u2013Wellington.\nService means representing our values and interests. That's what motivated me to introduce a bill to protect young people and those with disabilities from exploitation.\nIt's also why I have championed rural communities, stood up for local small businesses\u00a0and challenged the government to respect the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system.\nI'm running because I know we can build a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I will continue to be accessible to every constituent, no matter where they live, whether one-on-one or at community events. I ask for your support to continue serving everyone in Perth\u2013Wellington.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nSustainability is the top issue facing Perth-Wellington. I will work to ensure that life in Perth-Wellington is both economically and environmentally sustainable.\nWe owe it to our children and grandchildren to find solutions that are good for both the environment and the economy. The Liberal climate action plan is both ambitious and realistic. It includes innovation, research, clean technology, and putting a price on pollution. I am proud to support the Liberal plan that is committed to encouraging lower greenhouse gas emissions without putting a financial burden on households.\nWhen the Ford government cancelled Ontario's successful cap and trade system, the federal government implemented a carbon price (so-called \"carbon tax\") and a corresponding rebate called the climate action incentive payment.\u00a0\nLiberals value the small businesses in rural communities that create good jobs and the farmers that feed Canada and the world. We will help our family farms stay strong, help connect rural communities with high-speed internet, and continue to make rural success a priority with a dedicated minister of rural economic development.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Liberal government's plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class is working. It helped Canadians create over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014\u00a0most were full time positions \u2014\u00a0and brought the unemployment rate to a 40-year low. Despite that, many Canadians struggle to make ends meet given the high cost of living.\nA re-elected Liberal government will:\nCanada has the lowest debt to GDP ratio among G7 countries and this ratio has been reduced each year we've been in office. That means we will have the capacity in whatever economic situation to deal with that situation appropriately. To keep our economy strong and growing, we will also move forward with modest and responsible increases to immigration, with a focus on welcoming highly skilled people.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe've seen the impact of climate change, with floods and fires destroying entire communities in Canada. Our children are scared, because they know this will become their mess to clean up.\nThe Liberal plan isn't perfect, but it is both ambitious and feasible. Progress has already been made \u2014 putting a price on pollution, protecting our oceans, phasing out coal, banning single-use plastics. Canada is on track to reduce our emissions by 30 per cent\u00a0by 2030 and Liberals are committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That means not putting any more carbon emissions into the air than we take out.\u00a0\nA re-elected Liberal government will cut corporate tax in half for zero-emissions clean tech companies. We are committed to moving Canada forward \u2014 building a country where clean tech companies can thrive, where businesses and citizens are encouraged to go green, and where workers can succeed in the clean energy transition.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nPublic service means working to create a better community and country for our children and grandchildren \u2014 that is what motivates me to become the MP for Perth-Wellington. I will work to improve the environment, reduce the cost of living, and strengthen social services.\nMy varied work experience includes hosting a children's talent program on CFPL-TV in London; teaching special education students with the Thames Valley District School Board; and ministering to United Church congregations in St. Marys, Stratford, and Palmerston. My wife Ruth and I are residents of St. Marys; we have five children and three grandchildren.\nAs a former town councillor in Parkhill, I have political experience at the municipal level. I helped establish the London Convention Centre and was an early supporter of the Stratford Perth Rotary Hospice. I was a member of Stratford's Housing Committee looking for housing solutions for homeless people, and a co-organizer of St. Marys' Community Dinners.\nMy life's work has been focused on helping people in need. I will always stand up for the little guy. I know that public service is about addressing tough challenges, and I'm committed to continuing my work serving the citizens of Perth-Wellington at the federal level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nOne of the most important issues to citizens of Perth-Wellington is the climate emergency.\u00a0\nWe are keenly aware of the threat posed by climate change to the planet and our way of life. Extreme weather events like flooding, heavy rain, forest fires and intense hurricanes are seen across the country and we've felt the effects here in every part of the riding, both rural and urban. We have a number of active environmental groups such as Climate Momentum in Stratford, The Maitland Valley Carbon Footprint Initiative, and the City of Stratford itself has been a leader in a number of sustainability projects.\nI am inspired by the leadership of young people and was pleased to participate in the student-led climate action here in September.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy first order of business would be to press for action on affordable housing. Many people in Perth-Wellington can't afford to wait for solutions to the housing crisis.\nWe need the federal government to get back to work building social and non-market housing and supporting co-ops. I would work with colleagues from all parties to expedite the funding and assistance needed for municipalities, co-ops or social enterprises to get projects off the ground.\nDealing with precarious employment is a priority for the NDP. As a member of the NDP caucus, I will support the party's re-institution of a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour.\u00a0\nWe will work toward a living wage for all federally regulated workers which will set a standard for employers in every sector. We will give temporary and part-time workers access to the same compensation and benefits as their full-time counterparts.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe NDP knows that we don't have the luxury of time in taking action on climate change. On Day One, an NDP government would cancel the billions in fossil fuel subsidies as well as the Trans Mountain pipeline project.\nWe also stand firmly behind working people and will create 300,000 new jobs in our first mandate in the clean energy sector. Confronting climate change will require a massive mobilization of labour and resources to train and retrain Canadians.\nPriorities in a new energy economy include:\u00a0building a sustainable auto sector by manufacturing electric and zero-emission vehicles right here in Canada; retrofitting every home and public building by 2030 so that they are net zero ready; and expanding the availability of low-cost, zero-emission and accessible public transit.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI have been a social activist and a member of the NDP for the past 17 years. I\u00a0grew up in Markham and have an honours degree in political science from the University of Guelph. I was a member of the board of the Guelph Campus Co-op for five years, as well as serving as president of both the federal and provincial Guelph NDP riding associations. While in Guelph, I was the host of Words and Music\u00a0on 93.3 CFRU FM.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am also a person living with cerebral palsy. As such I know what it is to face and overcome challenges. I also know what it is to confront inequality and succeed.\u00a0\nIn Stratford, I am on the executive of the Rotaract\u00a0Club and have been working on the 211 database through the United Way of Perth Huron. I am committed to building a society where human need comes before corporate greed.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nClimate change is the world's biggest issue, but locally we won't see major frequent impacts until it's too late.\u00a0\nWe need to act because our cumulative emissions will continue to act for decades. To meet our 2030 goals, we have work to do, and only the Green Party's plan meets those goals. The Liberal government (and the Conservatives before them) continue to support the oil and gas industry despite the fact that continued resource extraction at this level will hasten the onrushing climate catastrophe. In 2017, just to extract the oil and gas, 200 of Canada's 700 megatons of CO2 were emitted.\nWe cannot maintain the status quo policy and have a livable planet. The Green Party will declare a climate emergency, work with the other parties in an inner cabinet, cancel all fossil fuel subsidies, ban fracking, support the adoption of electric vehicles, bolster public transportation, replace coal and natural gas electricity generation, modernize and expand the national electric grid, complete a national building retrofit, switch to biodiesel, ban foreign oil imports, and restore natural carbon sinks such as the soil and forests. It is all possible, we just need the political and personal will to do it.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nLife is expensive, and wages haven't kept up with costs. People are worried about making sure their families have what they need to get by and be happy. The Green Party wants to help financially with the things that matter the most.\nWe plan to abolish tuition at post-secondary institutions, expand public transportation (low cost and electric), and mandate a livable minimum wage ($15/hr).\u00a0 We will limit credit card interest rates to 10% and encourage competition in the cellular phone and internet markets to lower costs for everyone.\nGood health is currently a luxury and it shouldn't be; poverty directly affects your ability to care for yourself properly.\u00a0 We are proposing a guaranteed livable income (GLI) to replace the patchwork of federal and provincial programs that assist people who cannot work or are in low income situations. To pay for these programs, we will close tax loop holes used by the very wealthy and large corporations, so that they pay their fair share.\u00a0 Tax breaks for huge corporations don't help everyday people.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe climate crisis is the most important issue for Canadians, whether they realize it or not.\u00a0 The climate crisis requires a concerted effort at all levels of government and grass roots action by everyone.\u00a0\nFor the government to act in the long term best interest of the people of Canada, we need increased transparency and accountability.\u00a0The oil and gas industry is the largest source of emissions in Canada. The federal government needs to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry and put those funds into environmentally sound energy.\u00a0\nThe Transmountain Pipeline expansion should be stopped. The BC Liquid Natural Gas project should be stopped. We need to transition to 100% renewable energy sources. We need to do what is best of the health of our population and planet, not what makes the fossil fuel industry the most money.\u00a0\nThe argument that it is either\u00a0the economy or the environment is invalid, as there are more jobs in a renewable and sustainable economy (estimated 3 times\u00a0more). Corporate influence must be removed from politics and the science must be respected.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm a doctor and anesthesiologist. I've put my practice on hold to run for office\u00a0because I think climate change is the most important issue facing the country.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce I read the IPCC\u00a0(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate report last fall, I knew I had to get involved.\u00a0\nAt my regular job, I deal with sick people in complex situations as part of my routine work.\u00a0 For most people that would be stressful. After examining the evidence for climate change, I was losing sleep thinking about ways to change my personal environmental footprint.\u00a0 We need to make changes at the federal level because they control the sectors where the largest emissions occur.\nI got involved to try and make the changes we need to keep our planet in a livable condition.\u00a0The Green Party is the only political party with the ethics and conviction to stand up to the old parties and corporations, to get things done.\nI'm doing this so we have the best chance to maintain a livable planet, so my kids have a chance at a reasonable existence.\u00a0To not act given the current evidence will be disastrous, and future generations won't understand why we seemingly chose self-destruction because it was more convenient than change.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nHealth care is top of mind. Although this is a provincial responsibility, we can see that wait times and quality of care have been long time concerns without question. No one has been able to assist with changing this.\nThe People's Party of Canada understands that one of the issues here is that provinces have had an unreliable source of federal funding year to year, making it difficult for them to plan and deliver the necessary services. Ottawa's health care transfers to the provinces have doubled since 2006 from $20 billion to $40 billion this year with nothing to show for it.\nWe will give up the GST, which is expected to be around $40 billion and send it to the provinces each year in order to stabilize health care funding. Ottawa will stop meddling in health care\u00a0and allow the provinces to be fully responsible for delivery of this service as the Constitution states.\n2.\u00a0People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nPersonally, I will stand up as the MP for Perth-Wellington and speak out for what the residents of this riding need. Our party policies are extremely helpful in this regard.\nTo assist with the cost of living we will abolish the carbon tax, which is going to impact the cost of everything that we need from groceries to shelter and etc, and replace the tax with nothing.\nWe will simplify the income tax system by raising the personal exemption to $15,000, charging only 15% tax from $15,001 to $100,000,\u00a0and charging 25% for $100,001 and over. This will help the more vulnerable while assuring that more fortunate citizens will pay their fair share of tax.\nWe will end supply management which will allow Canadians to access nutritious food at a reasonable price. To assist the Canadian economy, one step is to ensure that pipelines get built by using the Constitutional laws and we will do that.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change has always happened, thankfully, as we could not live here in Perth-Wellington without it. Twelve thousand years ago, this area was under ice and the earth warmed up. It did not warm up due to human activity.\nWe do not believe that there is a climate emergency. Due to the fact that there is no scientific consensus on this issue, we will not invoke costly taxes that will hurt our prosperity. Until such time, if ever, there is clear consensus, our approach to climate change will be to assist those most vulnerable to flooding and other natural disasters.\nWe do believe in a clean environment and all of us need to assist with that each day, we can all do our part. What will you do? Give up single-use plastics? Walk and bicycle more? Stop burning large amounts of fossil fuels on personal vacations? Will you drink municipal tap water? Will you plant trees? Will you conserve electricity? All of these actions will help us build a cleaner environment.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a lifelong resident of Perth County, having grown up on a dairy farm. I built a successful tool and die business in Stratford and retired financially independent at the age of 38. I ran as an independent candidate in this riding in 2015.\nI am thrilled to be part of this grassroots movement, the People's Party of Canada, whose policies I align with. I stand for fiscal responsibility and a vibrant Canadian economy. I stand for secure Canadian borders and our rights as a sovereign nation. We must uphold the rule of law and I believe in putting Canadians first.\nI believe we need to stop sending billions of dollars overseas for various reasons while so many Canadians, such as our veterans and etc., are experiencing difficulty making ends meet. I believe we need to stop or minimize UN funding. I believe in ending corporate welfare in Canada, a policy which only makes the wealthy\u00a0wealthier. I stand for a bold, new, proud Canadian future for all of us.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThe national debt and interest payments of $70 million a day!\u00a0 We would treat the debt as a mortgage and begin paying it down.\nFamily breakdown is leading to a housing crisis and CHP CANADA would strengthen the traditional family unit by providing income to the parent, either or, who stays home to raise the children or care for disabled, elderly or others in their own home.\u00a0\nFibre [internet]\u00a0to the home is important and CHP Canada offers infrastructure loans to move this project forward.\nCHP Canada wants to maintain our borders, protect our sovereignty and slowly extend legal immigration to those most able to assimilate into our Canadian culture that was and still is, based on \"The Supremacy of God and the Rule of Law.\"\nOur Christian heritage protects the freedom of religion for all people while secularism and humanism would deny religious freedom to Christians.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nCHP Canada would eliminate the income tax \u2014\u00a0completely freeing Canadians from the associated compliance costs. Replacing the income tax would be a fair tax\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a national sales tax on NEW goods only. This would allow both rich and poor to decide when to pay tax.\u00a0\nFor example, the rich buy a new car and pay a higher tax, the poor buy a used car and pay no tax. It will lead to economic advantages! Strengthen the traditional family unit and teach individuals how to manage money. Playing the game Cash Flow with my preteen grandchildren has taught them to get out of the rat race and avoid doodads.\nIt is a shame that the government preys on people's weakness by the get-rich quick scheme of the lottery.\u00a0 If five\u00a0per cent\u00a0is returned to the town, then, after expenses, big bucks left town for big business profits.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change, and associated alarmism, is a financial movement in favour of big business and increased control over people all around the world.\u00a0\nC02 is not a pollutant. Farmers buy it to put into their greenhouses to make the flowers grow. Farmers inject it into soil to beneficially create plant growth.\u00a0\nThe more C02 the better everything grows. Canada was once much greener than today as the fossil records show. We will adapt as changes are slow! CHP Canada would protect water, air and soil by fighting nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulates.\u00a0\nOf greater concern is Canada's moral environment which is creating family breakdown.\u00a0The porn industry is harming everyone's ability to maintain strong family ties ... The lack of respect for life, from the not-yet born human beings who are not granted human rights, to the elderly and disabled who may be coerced to assisted suicide because of their life's circumstances. The moral compass of our nation is eroding leading to a weak and vulnerable populace.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI am a farmer and small business owner with my husband. We raised four children to be healthy adults and have grandchildren.\u00a0I love to read and learn and I read legislation, court cases and alternative news sites. I like to garden and scrapbook and play with grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Perth-Wellington candidates on environment, cost of living and top issues in this election", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/perth-wellington-federal-election-candidate-survey-1.5313132", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5315794.1570677080!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/candidates-in-perth-wellington.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-13T09:00:00.823Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Voters will head to the polls on Oct. 21 and in Perth-Wellington, people will have a choice between six candidates.\nThe candidates in Perth-Wellington are:\u00a0\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has asked the candidates to answer a survey. All were presented with the same questions.\u00a0Clicking the candidate's name above will take you to their survey responses. The candidates were told they had a 200-word limit for answers.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nTrust is the most important consideration facing residents of Perth\u2013Wellington in this election. Voters should consider two equally important questions.\nFirst, we must ask which leader, and which party, should we trust to take on serious national challenges.\u00a0Who do we trust to help make it possible for all of us to get ahead? Who do we trust to budget responsibly? Who do we trust to be a leader the world can take seriously?\nSecond, we must ask which local candidate has shown the ability to represent our values and capably serve our community. Which candidate do we trust to be accessible when we need them most? Which candidate has the experience we need to represent every community in Perth\u2013Wellington?\nTo earn voters' trust, I will continue doing what I have always done over the last four years: serving people to the best of my ability.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you return as the MP?\u00a0\nOver the last four years, we've been paying more for gasoline, home heating, hydro, housing, and much more. We must address the rising cost of living. As an MP, I would do what the Liberals did not do: I would oppose any measure that does not respect this reality facing too many Canadians.\nWe can start by trusting people with their own money. With the Conservatives' universal tax cut, the average Canadian family will save over $850 per year.\nAlso in our plan: tax credits for children's fitness and arts programs; tax-free maternity benefits; increasing the age credit for seniors by $1,000; and removing the federal tax on home heating.\nWe would also introduce four new measures to make it easier for first-time home buyers to buy a home.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nClimate change is real and requires immediate action. Andrew Scheer's plan would require the biggest polluters to reduce their carbon emissions or invest in new green technologies.\nIt is also a global problem requiring global solutions. For that, we must restore Canadian leadership on the world stage. We need a prime minister the world will take seriously.\nImposing additional taxes on people in our riding \u2014 who may have no choice but to drive to work or transport their crops to elevators \u2014 will make no meaningful difference in reducing emissions. It will just make life even more expensive.\nYou can read the Conservative plan for the environment at the website arealplan.ca.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nRaised on our family's farm near Mitchell, I learned early the importance of hard work. I believe in public service and our capacity to build strong, healthy communities\u00a0and a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I'm running to serve every person in every corner of Perth\u2013Wellington.\nService means representing our values and interests. That's what motivated me to introduce a bill to protect young people and those with disabilities from exploitation.\nIt's also why I have championed rural communities, stood up for local small businesses\u00a0and challenged the government to respect the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system.\nI'm running because I know we can build a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I will continue to be accessible to every constituent, no matter where they live, whether one-on-one or at community events. I ask for your support to continue serving everyone in Perth\u2013Wellington.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nSustainability is the top issue facing Perth-Wellington. I will work to ensure that life in Perth-Wellington is both economically and environmentally sustainable.\nWe owe it to our children and grandchildren to find solutions that are good for both the environment and the economy. The Liberal climate action plan is both ambitious and realistic. It includes innovation, research, clean technology, and putting a price on pollution. I am proud to support the Liberal plan that is committed to encouraging lower greenhouse gas emissions without putting a financial burden on households.\nWhen the Ford government cancelled Ontario's successful cap and trade system, the federal government implemented a carbon price (so-called \"carbon tax\") and a corresponding rebate called the climate action incentive payment.\u00a0\nLiberals value the small businesses in rural communities that create good jobs and the farmers that feed Canada and the world. We will help our family farms stay strong, help connect rural communities with high-speed internet, and continue to make rural success a priority with a dedicated minister of rural economic development.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Liberal government's plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class is working. It helped Canadians create over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014\u00a0most were full time positions \u2014\u00a0and brought the unemployment rate to a 40-year low. Despite that, many Canadians struggle to make ends meet given the high cost of living.\nA re-elected Liberal government will:\nCanada has the lowest debt to GDP ratio among G7 countries and this ratio has been reduced each year we've been in office. That means we will have the capacity in whatever economic situation to deal with that situation appropriately. To keep our economy strong and growing, we will also move forward with modest and responsible increases to immigration, with a focus on welcoming highly skilled people.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe've seen the impact of climate change, with floods and fires destroying entire communities in Canada. Our children are scared, because they know this will become their mess to clean up.\nThe Liberal plan isn't perfect, but it is both ambitious and feasible. Progress has already been made \u2014 putting a price on pollution, protecting our oceans, phasing out coal, banning single-use plastics. Canada is on track to reduce our emissions by 30 per cent\u00a0by 2030 and Liberals are committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That means not putting any more carbon emissions into the air than we take out.\u00a0\nA re-elected Liberal government will cut corporate tax in half for zero-emissions clean tech companies. We are committed to moving Canada forward \u2014 building a country where clean tech companies can thrive, where businesses and citizens are encouraged to go green, and where workers can succeed in the clean energy transition.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nPublic service means working to create a better community and country for our children and grandchildren \u2014 that is what motivates me to become the MP for Perth-Wellington. I will work to improve the environment, reduce the cost of living, and strengthen social services.\nMy varied work experience includes hosting a children's talent program on CFPL-TV in London; teaching special education students with the Thames Valley District School Board; and ministering to United Church congregations in St. Marys, Stratford, and Palmerston. My wife Ruth and I are residents of St. Marys; we have five children and three grandchildren.\nAs a former town councillor in Parkhill, I have political experience at the municipal level. I helped establish the London Convention Centre and was an early supporter of the Stratford Perth Rotary Hospice. I was a member of Stratford's Housing Committee looking for housing solutions for homeless people, and a co-organizer of St. Marys' Community Dinners.\nMy life's work has been focused on helping people in need. I will always stand up for the little guy. I know that public service is about addressing tough challenges, and I'm committed to continuing my work serving the citizens of Perth-Wellington at the federal level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nOne of the most important issues to citizens of Perth-Wellington is the climate emergency.\u00a0\nWe are keenly aware of the threat posed by climate change to the planet and our way of life. Extreme weather events like flooding, heavy rain, forest fires and intense hurricanes are seen across the country and we've felt the effects here in every part of the riding, both rural and urban. We have a number of active environmental groups such as Climate Momentum in Stratford, The Maitland Valley Carbon Footprint Initiative, and the City of Stratford itself has been a leader in a number of sustainability projects.\nI am inspired by the leadership of young people and was pleased to participate in the student-led climate action here in September.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy first order of business would be to press for action on affordable housing. Many people in Perth-Wellington can't afford to wait for solutions to the housing crisis.\nWe need the federal government to get back to work building social and non-market housing and supporting co-ops. I would work with colleagues from all parties to expedite the funding and assistance needed for municipalities, co-ops or social enterprises to get projects off the ground.\nDealing with precarious employment is a priority for the NDP. As a member of the NDP caucus, I will support the party's re-institution of a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour.\u00a0\nWe will work toward a living wage for all federally regulated workers which will set a standard for employers in every sector. We will give temporary and part-time workers access to the same compensation and benefits as their full-time counterparts.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe NDP knows that we don't have the luxury of time in taking action on climate change. On Day One, an NDP government would cancel the billions in fossil fuel subsidies as well as the Trans Mountain pipeline project.\nWe also stand firmly behind working people and will create 300,000 new jobs in our first mandate in the clean energy sector. Confronting climate change will require a massive mobilization of labour and resources to train and retrain Canadians.\nPriorities in a new energy economy include:\u00a0building a sustainable auto sector by manufacturing electric and zero-emission vehicles right here in Canada; retrofitting every home and public building by 2030 so that they are net zero ready; and expanding the availability of low-cost, zero-emission and accessible public transit.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI have been a social activist and a member of the NDP for the past 17 years. I\u00a0grew up in Markham and have an honours degree in political science from the University of Guelph. I was a member of the board of the Guelph Campus Co-op for five years, as well as serving as president of both the federal and provincial Guelph NDP riding associations. While in Guelph, I was the host of Words and Music\u00a0on 93.3 CFRU FM.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am also a person living with cerebral palsy. As such I know what it is to face and overcome challenges. I also know what it is to confront inequality and succeed.\u00a0\nIn Stratford, I am on the executive of the Rotaract\u00a0Club and have been working on the 211 database through the United Way of Perth Huron. I am committed to building a society where human need comes before corporate greed.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nClimate change is the world's biggest issue, but locally we won't see major frequent impacts until it's too late.\u00a0\nWe need to act because our cumulative emissions will continue to act for decades. To meet our 2030 goals, we have work to do, and only the Green Party's plan meets those goals. The Liberal government (and the Conservatives before them) continue to support the oil and gas industry despite the fact that continued resource extraction at this level will hasten the onrushing climate catastrophe. In 2017, just to extract the oil and gas, 200 of Canada's 700 megatons of CO2 were emitted.\nWe cannot maintain the status quo policy and have a livable planet. The Green Party will declare a climate emergency, work with the other parties in an inner cabinet, cancel all fossil fuel subsidies, ban fracking, support the adoption of electric vehicles, bolster public transportation, replace coal and natural gas electricity generation, modernize and expand the national electric grid, complete a national building retrofit, switch to biodiesel, ban foreign oil imports, and restore natural carbon sinks such as the soil and forests. It is all possible, we just need the political and personal will to do it.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nLife is expensive, and wages haven't kept up with costs. People are worried about making sure their families have what they need to get by and be happy. The Green Party wants to help financially with the things that matter the most.\nWe plan to abolish tuition at post-secondary institutions, expand public transportation (low cost and electric), and mandate a livable minimum wage ($15/hr).\u00a0 We will limit credit card interest rates to 10% and encourage competition in the cellular phone and internet markets to lower costs for everyone.\nGood health is currently a luxury and it shouldn't be; poverty directly affects your ability to care for yourself properly.\u00a0 We are proposing a guaranteed livable income (GLI) to replace the patchwork of federal and provincial programs that assist people who cannot work or are in low income situations. To pay for these programs, we will close tax loop holes used by the very wealthy and large corporations, so that they pay their fair share.\u00a0 Tax breaks for huge corporations don't help everyday people.\u00a0\u00a0\n3.

I believe we need to stop or minimize UN funding. I believe in ending corporate welfare in Canada, a policy which only makes the wealthy\u00a0wealthier. I stand for a bold, new, proud Canadian future for all of us.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThe national debt and interest payments of $70 million a day!\u00a0 We would treat the debt as a mortgage and begin paying it down.\nFamily breakdown is leading to a housing crisis and CHP CANADA would strengthen the traditional family unit by providing income to the parent, either or, who stays home to raise the children or care for disabled, elderly or others in their own home.\u00a0\nFibre [internet]\u00a0to the home is important and CHP Canada offers infrastructure loans to move this project forward.\nCHP Canada wants to maintain our borders, protect our sovereignty and slowly extend legal immigration to those most able to assimilate into our Canadian culture that was and still is, based on \"The Supremacy of God and the Rule of Law.\"\nOur Christian heritage protects the freedom of religion for all people while secularism and humanism would deny religious freedom to Christians.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nCHP Canada would eliminate the income tax \u2014\u00a0completely freeing Canadians from the associated compliance costs. Replacing the income tax would be a fair tax\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a national sales tax on NEW goods only. This would allow both rich and poor to decide when to pay tax.\u00a0\nFor example, the rich buy a new car and pay a higher tax, the poor buy a used car and pay no tax. It will lead to economic advantages! Strengthen the traditional family unit and teach individuals how to manage money. Playing the game Cash Flow with my preteen grandchildren has taught them to get out of the rat race and avoid doodads.\nIt is a shame that the government preys on people's weakness by the get-rich quick scheme of the lottery.\u00a0 If five\u00a0per cent\u00a0is returned to the town, then, after expenses, big bucks left town for big business profits.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change, and associated alarmism, is a financial movement in favour of big business and increased control over people all around the world.\u00a0\nC02 is not a pollutant. Farmers buy it to put into their greenhouses to make the flowers grow. Farmers inject it into soil to beneficially create plant growth.\u00a0\nThe more C02 the better everything grows. Canada was once much greener than today as the fossil records show. We will adapt as changes are slow! CHP Canada would protect water, air and soil by fighting nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulates.\u00a0\nOf greater concern is Canada's moral environment which is creating family breakdown.\u00a0The porn industry is harming everyone's ability to maintain strong family ties ... The lack of respect for life, from the not-yet born human beings who are not granted human rights, to the elderly and disabled who may be coerced to assisted suicide because of their life's circumstances. The moral compass of our nation is eroding leading to a weak and vulnerable populace.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI am a farmer and small business owner with my husband. We raised four children to be healthy adults and have grandchildren.\u00a0I love to read and learn and I read legislation, court cases and alternative news sites. I like to garden and scrapbook and play with grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Brandie Weikle", "title": "Restaurant industry faces critical worker shortage as holiday demand peaks", "description": "There are more than 67,000 vacant positions in bars and food service", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/restaurant-industry-worker-shortage-1.5382346", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5405500.1576884042!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/george-brown-culinary-arts-students.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 24, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-24T09:00:00.097Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Restaurants are facing a critical shortage of workers that's impeding new business\u00a0and limiting capacity\u00a0during the holiday season, a critical time of year for profitability, industry experts say.\nVeteran chef and restaurateur Hemant Bhagwani\u00a0had planned to open his\u00a0new restaurant, Popa, in Toronto's Bayview Village shopping centre on Dec. 1, but still doesn't have enough\u00a0staff to operate.\nFor the key position of chef, \"not a single application has come in,\" said Bhagwani. Although Popa will specialize in Burmese cuisine, which he travelled to Myanmar to learn,\u00a0Bhagwani\u00a0said he's not holding out for a chef with specialized skills.\u00a0\"I don't mind people from any other cuisine \u2014\u00a0Mexican, French. I can train them.\"\nIn the third quarter of this year, the most recent period for which numbers are available, there were 67,370 vacant jobs in food service and drinking establishments across the country, according to Statistics Canada, the highest it's been in nearly five years.\nRecord low unemployment, shifting demographics and competition for workers from a slew\u00a0of new restaurants and food delivery services are making it tough for restaurants to find enough workers to operate at capacity \u2014 opening the patio in\u00a0summer or hosting private parties during the holidays. Executing expansion plans seems impossible.\nRestaurant owners and industry associations say they won't be able to rectify the problem without substantially increasing immigration to Canada, loosening the rules about who can move here to work in hospitality.\n\"It's been very tough,\" said Bhagwani, who has opened dozens of food establishments in the Toronto area, including the Amaya\u00a0chain\u00a0of Indian restaurants. \"I had to set up a central kitchen because I could not place chefs or cooks in each restaurant.\" Though he said he's offering competitive salaries, he's perennially shorthanded and actively recruiting.\n\"I have five restaurants that have extensively had ads for the last five months and have not been able to get a job match for one person locally,\" he said.\nHe did receive one email inquiry about\u00a0a dish-washing job recently. The sender was from Dubai.\u00a0\nIn the meantime,\u00a0he still has\u00a0to pay $20,000 per month rent at Popa while he works to find the staff he needs to open the doors.\nBhagwani\u00a0is not alone, said\u00a0David Lefebvre, vice president of\u00a0industry association Restaurants Canada.\u00a0\nWhat used to be referred to as\u00a0labour shortages, \"now there are some places in the country we call them labour outages because you just cannot open a restaurant or find any workers to work at your place,\" he said.\nQuebec, British Columbia and some parts of\u00a0Atlantic Canada have the worst shortages right now, said Lefebvre. \"But you see it in every provinces. You get some places like Banff in Alberta; even though Alberta has been in the economic slowdown, you still have some labour shortage in the food service industry.\"\nThere are a number of reasons why this is the case, including that food services traditionally attract\u00a0a young workforce and young workers are now a smaller portion of the population. Canadians under age 25 made up 48.1 per cent of the population in 1971, but were projected to make up\u00a0only 28.2 per cent in 2019, according to Statistics Canada.\nBut there are other forces draining the restaurant labour pool.\u00a0The overall unemployment rate reached historic lows in 2019, meaning\u00a0young people who might previously have worked in restaurants while waiting\u00a0to land a position in another field\u00a0instead have their pick of jobs.\nLabour Force Survey data shows that since 2016,\u00a0workers 24 and under have increased their numbers in fields like tech, transportation, retail and education.\nAlso, skyrocketing housing costs, especially in Canada's biggest cities, make it harder to get by on a line cook or server's salary \u2014 even with a heavy take home from tips.\u00a0\nBhagwani\u00a0said the housing shortage is\u00a0particularly hard on his kitchen staff. \"They used to pay $1,200 for a basement apartment; now they pay $1,800.\"\nWhy not simply increase salaries and let free market forces correct the problem?\nPay has gone up, said Ian Tostenson, president and CEO of\u00a0BC Restaurant and Food Services Association.\" For a kitchen worker, three\u00a0or four\u00a0years ago wages were $13 to 14, now they're $19 or $20.\"\nThe association has put also together optional benefits packages owners can offer to\u00a0part-time employees who work 20 hours or more per week.\nIn Toronto, Hemant Bhagwani\u00a0has even offered ownership shares and profit sharing to entice both chefs and front-of-house staff to join his team.\nBut Bhagwani said there are limits to how much pay can increase given tight profit margins.\u00a0\nRent, labour and food costs have all spiked in the last three to five years. \"Our profit margin used to be 15 to 18\u00a0per cent. Now our profit margin has dipped to probably five\u00a0per cent. And we can't even increase our prices with all these Ubers and Skip the Dishes. We're also competing with them also.\"\nConsumers have more ways than ever to avoid dirtying dishes in their kitchens at home, between a\u00a0host of new delivery services, the breadth of prepared foods on offer at the grocery store and U.S. chains such as\u00a0Eataly and The Cheesecake Factory opening in Canada. Even retailers like Nordstrom and Restoration Hardware have moved\u00a0into the food game with in-store cafes.\u00a0\nSome restaurants are turning to tech solutions to fill staffing gaps. Toronto entrepreneurs Erika Mozes and Josh Karam created an app called Hyr to connect restaurants that are short of staff with workers who can fill in on a per-shift basis.\nBoth restaurants and workers create social-media-style\u00a0profiles and\u00a0can rate each other. In some cases the pay is slightly higher or the tips likely to be generous,\u00a0but one of the main incentives for workers is that they\u00a0receive their pay within 48 hours of their shift, said Mozes.\n\"As a business, you can download hire, create a profile and literally within minutes be able to post a shift,\" she said.\nBartender Collin Heath said he loves\u00a0his full-time job,\u00a0but because he easily gets his 40 hours per week over the course of three or four shifts, he has time to pick up shifts through Hyr.\n\"Toronto's a really extremely expensive city to live in. And at some point you have to do everything that you can in order to make money,\" said Heath. \"It could be the 28th of the month and I have until the first, which is two or three days, to pay rent, and I know if I take the right job with Hyr, I'm paid within two days and that money is coming in.\"\u00a0\nAt Canada's biggest chef's school, the Centre for Hospitality and Culinary Arts at Toronto's\u00a0George Brown College, enrolment by Canadians has plateaued, while international students have increased by six-fold between 2009 and 2019, said director Tony Garcia.\nOpportunities abound for graduates. \"There are approximately six field placements available for every student,\" he said.\u00a0\nFirst year student\u00a0Nhuy Mai first moved to Toronto from Vietnam to study English, but stayed for George Brown's program when she decided to pursue a career in hospitality.\n\"Cooking is my passion so I chose this school,\" she said. Right now she works part-time at Thai restaurant\u00a0Mango Garden, and hopes to\u00a0continue working\u00a0in Canada\u00a0after graduation, then\u00a0open her own Vietnamese restaurant here\u00a0within a few years.\u00a0\u00a0\nHospitality needs more people like her, said Lefebvre of Restaurants Canada. He said the industry wants the government to loosen rules about who can come to Canada to work in the\u00a0field so it's not just trained chefs who can move here, but front-of-house and other kitchen staff, too.\nHe said the organization wants a \"multi-pronged\" approach that also makes it easier for people on employment insurance or students with\u00a0bursaries to be able to work more hours before having their benefits clawed back.\nBut without dramatically increasing the number of immigrants to this country, said Lefebvre, the restaurant industry expects its staffing problems will continue.\nHemant Bhagwani\u00a0concurs.\u00a0\"I cannot open a restaurant without hiring a foreign worker inside my kitchen, period.\"\nAs for Popa, his Burmese restaurant in waiting, Bhagwani will soon take matters into his own hands.\n\"I think it's time to open up so I will jump in myself and probably start cooking.\"\n"}, {"author": "Eva Voinigescu ", "title": "Two families' modern take on the multi-generational home", "description": "\"It was really about setting up an ecosystem for our lives that really was self-sustaining.\"", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/life/culture/two-families-modern-take-on-the-multi-generational-home-1.5334295", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334526.1571953574!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hoi-bo-flagship-space.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 24, 2019 5:58 PM ET", "2019-10-24T21:58:00.644Z"], "source": "CBC Life", "content": "In September, the average selling price for a home in Canada was approximately $515,500 \u2014 an amount that can make home ownership seem out of reach, especially for those living in a major city, where prices are often much higher. No doubt, the rising cost of housing and the parallel rise in the cost of living are behind a growing number of Canadians who are considering innovative co-ownership arrangements as a way to pool both financial and social resources, at least in part.\u00a0\nOne such arrangement is a multi-generational household, which houses three or more generations of one family. According to Statistics Canada and the Vanier Institute of the Family, it was the fastest-growing type of household in Canada between 2001 and 2016.\u00a0\nJason Davenport, a branch manager for Meridian Credit Union in Toronto, says larger mortgages are driving the need for sharing financial resources. Meridian is one of a handful of lenders, including Vancity and DUCA Credit Union, that facilitate having multiple people on the title of a home. \"I would say it's more a niche than a trend, but there is this requirement for these sort of products now certainly in places like the GTA,\" says Davenport, who has seen the number of people choosing Meridian's friends and family mortgage increase in his five years with the company.\u00a0\nMulti-generational living isn't new in Canada (it was even more common before the Second World War than it is today). In fact, the term might immediately conjure images of the in-law suite, created expressly to house an aging parent. But the in-law suite is only one setup for multi-generational living, and the motivations for choosing a multi-generational living situation can vary greatly.\u00a0\nSome are designing their multi-generational households in a less conventional way to suit varying lifestyle needs and pursuits, and to care for all. Such is the case for Sarra Tang and Lulu Phongmany. We spoke to them about why they chose multi-generational living, how they executed their visions and how it has impacted their day-to-day.\u00a0\nSarra Tang is the founder of Hoi Bo, a Toronto-based sustainable clothing and accessories brand. Hoi Bo is set to open a new flagship store and community space in Toronto's west end \u2014 on the ground floor of Tang's home.\u00a0\nSarra Tang bought her semi-detached, 1,800-square-foot home in the early 2010s. She moved in with her son and partner, with the idea of undertaking a renovation, in stages, to the living space and to turn main floor into a retail space for her business. But shortly after they took possession, Tang's sister moved in, and the family realized the renovations would be better achieved in one go.\nThat's when they made the decision was made to move everyone into Tang's mother's house while they undertook the larger, full-scale renovation, which would involve adding another floor and engineering balconies that could double as spaces to grow their own vegetables.\u00a0\nAs well as the ground-floor flagship retail space for Hoi Bo, the home's interior will consist of a communal living area and kitchen, plus four studio-style apartments that will give each family member their own private space within the larger home. The rooms will vary in size from 230 to 280 square feet, and each will have its own three-piece bathroom. When construction is complete, they plan to sell Tang's mother's home.\u00a0\n\"What the project was really about for our family was how it is that we are all supporting each other,\" says Tang. She adds that she envisioned the space as one that would give each family member the flexibility to pursue their interests \u2014 something that might not be possible if they were each responsible for their own individual dwellings.\n\"We were able to pool our resources together to make sure that no one person was over-burdened financially, which was really important to health and wellness \u2026 it was really about setting up an ecosystem for our lives that really was self-sustaining.\"\u00a0\nThis flexibility means, for example, that Tang's mother can be freed of housekeeping responsibilities. It also means that Tang's 24-year-old-son can be spared the full blow of Toronto's crippling rental prices. While every family member is contributing to financing the project, they also contribute to the household in other ways. For her part, Tang enjoys being the cook for the family.\u00a0\nTang's philosophy of living sustainably is one that carries through all aspects of her life, from Hoi Bo to this new living space to the design of the home's long driveway, which is slated to become a green space open to the community, with market stalls for small business and emerging artists.\u00a0\nWhile the design and renovation process to date has not been without its challenges\u2060 \u2014 Tang says she has learned a lot about \"working with other people and communicating and managing expectations\u2060\"\u2060 \u2014 she credits her family for being \"enormously supportive\" throughout the process.\u00a0\n\"I think that it's such an amazing gift that immigrants bring to Canada \u2014 this different perspective and these different ideas on how it is that you can approach life and how you can support each other as a family,\" says Tang. \"It doesn't have to just apply to family members. It can apply to friends as well.\"\u00a0\nTang says that she doesn't consider her family remarkably close in the way people might expect \u2014 nor does she consider that a necessity to sustain this type of living arrangement.\n\"I think what is essential is to come at the project with people who are open-minded,\" says Tang. She hopes her example can help change the narrative around who can afford to own a home, and how, despite complex issues of affordability.\u00a0\n\"I'm optimistic that people will reimagine a different approach to homeownership. Toronto is ripe and ready for real change, and I look forward to seeing the creative approaches that people come up with to tackle the problem.\"\nLulu Phongmany is a growth consultant based in Vancouver. The Phongmany family made the decision to design and live together in a home with three distinct spaces.\nLulu Phongmany lives with her father, sister, brother-in-law and two nephews in a custom-built home and says that while multi-generational living was uncommon among people she knew growing up, it was \"not an unusual concept\" to her.\u00a0\n\"This might be a trend to other people, but it's not a trend to us. This was something that was inevitable, and we see it all the time. \"\nPhongmany and her sister always knew that they would eventually end up caring for their parents in their old age, but didn't know what form that care would take. When their mother passed away, the family decided to give up their individual dwellings in favour of finding a space that could work for them all.\u00a0\u00a0\nPhongmany says deciding to live together wasn't a matter of saving money or pooling financial resources to get something that was otherwise unattainable.\u00a0\n\"It wasn't less money to do this, and it definitely took a lot of time,\" she says. \"The biggest thing was that we wanted to be together. That was the core motivator of this project.\"\nThough they weren't originally interested in taking on such a large endeavour, they were unable to find an existing home that fit their needs. Ultimately, the family decided to purchase a property in their preferred neighbourhood and built a five-bedroom, three-bathroom main house for her sister's family, with a two-bedroom basement apartment for Phongmany and a one-bedroom laneway house for her father.\u00a0\nPhongmany's work takes her away from Vancouver often, and she was living abroad when the home was completed, which is how she ended up living in the spare bedroom in the main house. She plans to move into the basement when the current tenants vacate.\u00a0\n\"The idea was that we would always have space to be separated with \u2026 the three different spaces, but [that we could] also be together in one place,\" says Phongmany. The family worked with an architect to design a home in which they could live communally.\u00a0\nThe situation lends itself to evolution in the future, depending on how the family's needs change, for example, if her nephews want to move into the basement when they're older. It also offers them convenience now. Phongmany and her father can provide childcare for her nephews during the evenings and days respectively, and the family members take turns providing dinner.\u00a0\n\"It's a joy when everyone comes home. We have family dinners together almost every night,\" says Phongmany. She remembers feeling jealous of the time her family was spending together when the home was first completed and she was still living abroad, saying that living in a large city alone can feel lonely and superficial.\nThe design of the home, which contains both private and communal space, has helped her adjust after living alone for 18 years.\u00a0\n\"This concept that you can't have your individual time when you live with your family, I think needs to be revisited \u2026 I think if people understood that you can do both, they would probably be more open to this.\"\u00a0\nPhongmany says that while they've all benefited financially from access to more disposable income and flexibility to travel since living together, it's the generosity their new living situation has reintroduced to their lives that is most notable.\n\"The one thing that I think it brings out in you, when you live this way, is that it really makes you much more generous. Our parents were always really generous with their home, in the sense that if anyone needed a place to stay, they were always the first people to offer it,\" she says, adding that that generosity of space was not as prevalent when they all lived independently. At the moment, they also have a cousin staying with them.\n\"I just feel more connected to not just my immediate family but my extended family.\"\nEva Voinigescu\u00a0is a freelance journalist and producer.

It's the only province to see child poverty levels grow, as wages remain stagnant,\" he said in his opening statement.\n\"When we continue to have decisions based on balanced budgets, competitive taxes and the dogma that a trickle down economy will benefit all, this is where we start to see inequality grow.\"\nThe Liberal government provided a written response, saying it had made \"significant investments over the last number of years to help Nova Scotians achieve income security.\" The Department of Community Services says a variety of changes to its employment support and income assistance program have helped the poor.\nIt says in recent years it has allowed people with larger amounts of savings and other assets to qualify for income assistance, increased the monthly personal allowance by $20 per month, and removed child support payments from eligibility calculations.\nThe department says there are also plans to move welfare recipients \"to the maximum amount they are eligible for\" and for rate increases for all recipients, including five per cent for single people with disabilities who don't have children, those fleeing domestic violence, those who are 55 years and older and youth aged 16 to 18.\nEveryone else will see a two per cent increase.\nHowever, Amy Moonshadow, the chairwoman of the Community Advocate Network, said during a news conference that measures taken to date by the provincial Liberal government haven't gone far enough to ensure basic food security for many of its poorest citizens.\nShe said an adult person with disabilities must attempt to live on $821 per month, which isn't sufficient to purchase necessities after rent is paid.\n\"We are looking for more than adequacy. We want to live like humans,\" she added.\nOther groups in the coalition include the Schizophrenia Society of Nova Scotia, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, the Nova Scotia Association for Community Living, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul and CUPE Nova Scotia.\nStratford said in the past the various agencies have sometimes worked at cross purposes or been pitted against one another by provincial officials.\nThe coalition will help create a focused message and bring a clearer focus to policies aimed a reducing poverty, he said.\nAcross Canada, Statistics Canada figures show the percentage of children under the age of 18 who live in low-income households dropped to nine per cent in 2017 from 13.3 per cent two years earlier, resulting in 278,000 fewer children living in poverty.\nHowever, in Nova Scotia, child poverty levels increased to 17.1 per cent from 15.7 per cent over the same period, according to the surveys.\nA study carried out by the Food Action Research Centre at Mount Saint Vincent University in 2015 found that in Nova Scotia a household of four living on income assistance would run a deficit of $986 monthly if it were to purchase a \"basic nutritious diet.\"\nIf the family was surviving on minimum wages in the province, it would run a deficit of $418.\nPatricia Williams, director of the centre, said in an interview that, if anything, the situation has worsened in recent years as modest increases to income assistance haven't kept pace with the rising cost of rent and food.\n"}, {"author": "Eva Voinigescu ", "title": "Two families' modern take on the multi-generational home", "description": "\"It was really about setting up an ecosystem for our lives that really was self-sustaining.\"", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/life/culture/two-families-modern-take-on-the-multi-generational-home-1.5334295", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334526.1571953574!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hoi-bo-flagship-space.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 24, 2019 5:58 PM ET", "2019-10-24T21:58:00.644Z"], "source": "CBC Life", "content": "In September, the average selling price for a home in Canada was approximately $515,500 \u2014 an amount that can make home ownership seem out of reach, especially for those living in a major city, where prices are often much higher.

But shortly after they took possession, Tang's sister moved in, and the family realized the renovations would be better achieved in one go.\nThat's when they made the decision was made to move everyone into Tang's mother's house while they undertook the larger, full-scale renovation, which would involve adding another floor and engineering balconies that could double as spaces to grow their own vegetables.\u00a0\nAs well as the ground-floor flagship retail space for Hoi Bo, the home's interior will consist of a communal living area and kitchen, plus four studio-style apartments that will give each family member their own private space within the larger home. The rooms will vary in size from 230 to 280 square feet, and each will have its own three-piece bathroom. When construction is complete, they plan to sell Tang's mother's home.\u00a0\n\"What the project was really about for our family was how it is that we are all supporting each other,\" says Tang. She adds that she envisioned the space as one that would give each family member the flexibility to pursue their interests \u2014 something that might not be possible if they were each responsible for their own individual dwellings.\n\"We were able to pool our resources together to make sure that no one person was over-burdened financially, which was really important to health and wellness \u2026 it was really about setting up an ecosystem for our lives that really was self-sustaining.\"\u00a0\nThis flexibility means, for example, that Tang's mother can be freed of housekeeping responsibilities. It also means that Tang's 24-year-old-son can be spared the full blow of Toronto's crippling rental prices. While every family member is contributing to financing the project, they also contribute to the household in other ways. For her part, Tang enjoys being the cook for the family.\u00a0\nTang's philosophy of living sustainably is one that carries through all aspects of her life, from Hoi Bo to this new living space to the design of the home's long driveway, which is slated to become a green space open to the community, with market stalls for small business and emerging artists.\u00a0\nWhile the design and renovation process to date has not been without its challenges\u2060 \u2014 Tang says she has learned a lot about \"working with other people and communicating and managing expectations\u2060\"\u2060 \u2014 she credits her family for being \"enormously supportive\" throughout the process.\u00a0\n\"I think that it's such an amazing gift that immigrants bring to Canada \u2014 this different perspective and these different ideas on how it is that you can approach life and how you can support each other as a family,\" says Tang. \"It doesn't have to just apply to family members. It can apply to friends as well.\"\u00a0\nTang says that she doesn't consider her family remarkably close in the way people might expect \u2014 nor does she consider that a necessity to sustain this type of living arrangement.\n\"I think what is essential is to come at the project with people who are open-minded,\" says Tang. She hopes her example can help change the narrative around who can afford to own a home, and how, despite complex issues of affordability.\u00a0\n\"I'm optimistic that people will reimagine a different approach to homeownership. Toronto is ripe and ready for real change, and I look forward to seeing the creative approaches that people come up with to tackle the problem.\"\nLulu Phongmany is a growth consultant based in Vancouver. The Phongmany family made the decision to design and live together in a home with three distinct spaces.\nLulu Phongmany lives with her father, sister, brother-in-law and two nephews in a custom-built home and says that while multi-generational living was uncommon among people she knew growing up, it was \"not an unusual concept\" to her.\u00a0\n\"This might be a trend to other people, but it's not a trend to us. This was something that was inevitable, and we see it all the time. \"\nPhongmany and her sister always knew that they would eventually end up caring for their parents in their old age, but didn't know what form that care would take. When their mother passed away, the family decided to give up their individual dwellings in favour of finding a space that could work for them all.\u00a0\u00a0\nPhongmany says deciding to live together wasn't a matter of saving money or pooling financial resources to get something that was otherwise unattainable.\u00a0\n\"It wasn't less money to do this, and it definitely took a lot of time,\" she says. \"The biggest thing was that we wanted to be together. That was the core motivator of this project.\"\nThough they weren't originally interested in taking on such a large endeavour, they were unable to find an existing home that fit their needs. Ultimately, the family decided to purchase a property in their preferred neighbourhood and built a five-bedroom, three-bathroom main house for her sister's family, with a two-bedroom basement apartment for Phongmany and a one-bedroom laneway house for her father.\u00a0\nPhongmany's work takes her away from Vancouver often, and she was living abroad when the home was completed, which is how she ended up living in the spare bedroom in the main house. She plans to move into the basement when the current tenants vacate.\u00a0\n\"The idea was that we would always have space to be separated with \u2026 the three different spaces, but [that we could] also be together in one place,\" says Phongmany. The family worked with an architect to design a home in which they could live communally.\u00a0\nThe situation lends itself to evolution in the future, depending on how the family's needs change, for example, if her nephews want to move into the basement when they're older. It also offers them convenience now. Phongmany and her father can provide childcare for her nephews during the evenings and days respectively, and the family members take turns providing dinner.\u00a0\n\"It's a joy when everyone comes home. We have family dinners together almost every night,\" says Phongmany. She remembers feeling jealous of the time her family was spending together when the home was first completed and she was still living abroad, saying that living in a large city alone can feel lonely and superficial.\nThe design of the home, which contains both private and communal space, has helped her adjust after living alone for 18 years.\u00a0\n\"This concept that you can't have your individual time when you live with your family, I think needs to be revisited \u2026 I think if people understood that you can do both, they would probably be more open to this.\"\u00a0\nPhongmany says that while they've all benefited financially from access to more disposable income and flexibility to travel since living together, it's the generosity their new living situation has reintroduced to their lives that is most notable.\n\"The one thing that I think it brings out in you, when you live this way, is that it really makes you much more generous. Our parents were always really generous with their home, in the sense that if anyone needed a place to stay, they were always the first people to offer it,\" she says, adding that that generosity of space was not as prevalent when they all lived independently. At the moment, they also have a cousin staying with them.\n\"I just feel more connected to not just my immediate family but my extended family.\"\nEva Voinigescu\u00a0is a freelance journalist and producer.

No doubt, the rising cost of housing and the parallel rise in the cost of living are behind a growing number of Canadians who are considering innovative co-ownership arrangements as a way to pool both financial and social resources, at least in part.\u00a0\nOne such arrangement is a multi-generational household, which houses three or more generations of one family. According to Statistics Canada and the Vanier Institute of the Family, it was the fastest-growing type of household in Canada between 2001 and 2016.\u00a0\nJason Davenport, a branch manager for Meridian Credit Union in Toronto, says larger mortgages are driving the need for sharing financial resources. Meridian is one of a handful of lenders, including Vancity and DUCA Credit Union, that facilitate having multiple people on the title of a home. \"I would say it's more a niche than a trend, but there is this requirement for these sort of products now certainly in places like the GTA,\" says Davenport, who has seen the number of people choosing Meridian's friends and family mortgage increase in his five years with the company.\u00a0\nMulti-generational living isn't new in Canada (it was even more common before the Second World War than it is today). In fact, the term might immediately conjure images of the in-law suite, created expressly to house an aging parent. But the in-law suite is only one setup for multi-generational living, and the motivations for choosing a multi-generational living situation can vary greatly.\u00a0\nSome are designing their multi-generational households in a less conventional way to suit varying lifestyle needs and pursuits, and to care for all. Such is the case for Sarra Tang and Lulu Phongmany. We spoke to them about why they chose multi-generational living, how they executed their visions and how it has impacted their day-to-day.\u00a0\nSarra Tang is the founder of Hoi Bo, a Toronto-based sustainable clothing and accessories brand.

And while the\u00a0millennial demographic was one key factor to the Liberal win last time, as well as an increase in voter turnout\u00a0from First Nations communities, experts are skeptical as to whether the outcome will be similar this time around, given the last four years.\u00a0\nDespite claims of who \"won\" Oct. 7's federal party leaders' English-language debate, the reality is that this all comes down to every counted vote.\u00a0So, with the Oct. 21 election day looming large, we asked musical artists of varying ages, backgrounds and genres why they're voting\u00a0\u2014 and why they think everyone\u00a0should.\nEditor's note: all interviews have been edited for clarity and length. Artists answered a variation of\u00a0three questions via phone or email: Why are you voting in this year's federal election? What issues matter to you most this election? Why should others vote?\n\"Voting is more than a right in Canada \u2014 it is a responsibility we all share. The decisions that are made by our elected officials affect every area of our lives. We may have only one vote each, but collectively our votes are our voices and can make a difference.\n\"I am finding it very difficult to pinpoint issues that are most important to me, because everything is a concern these days. Environmental, health-care and education issues are cause for worry. The disparity between wealth and poverty; the pressure that is evident as Canadians try to find economic balance. Housing costs are insane and affordable rental housing nearly impossible to find in practically every corner of the country. Many Aboriginal communities in Canada are still fighting for clean water and reasonably priced food, amongst many other critical issues these vulnerable communities face.\n\"So many political systems seem to hinge on greed and an abusive battle for power, without being mindful of every Canadian citizen's fundamental rights. We have all the resources we need to take care of each other, but we need a non-partisan political will to ensure a healthy, thriving future for ourselves, our children, our grandchildren \u2014 and all generations to come.\"\n\"Succumbing to voter apathy plays into the hands of those who stand to gain from a weakening of democracy. There's a myth that rebelling against the system by not voting is somehow an enlightened position \u2014 the 'no party works for me' argument. This is an easy way out. It's not rebellious, it's just lazy. It's like refusing to clean your room on the grounds that it will become untidy again in time. Before long, you've got cockroaches, but these cockroaches are human-sized and actively suppress your emotional and economical mobility.\"\n\"I'm a settler and I want to elect the party that is the most invested in supporting Indigenous rights. Supporting parties to work towards decolonization also means that you can contact them between elections as one of their voters and urge them to work even harder to do so.\"\n\"I vote because it is a right that I value. First Nations people were only granted the right to vote in 1960. Previous to that we could only vote if we renounced our status as Indigenous people. That's only 59 years ago. If I don't vote then there is no reason for political leaders to take what I value and wish for this land seriously.\n\"I want to see follow-through on promises made. I have been disappointed over and over again by the lack of meaningful reconciliation after having my hopes raised by empty words. The continuation of 'negotiation'\u00a0which slows progress and leaves Indigenous people fighting for basic equality in so very many ways is frustrating at best. I want meaningful consultation where we are heard and respected. I want an end to fighting to keep Indigenous children in their own families and communities. I want immediate and real solutions to energy problems that mean an end to dangerous transportation of crude oil threatening our forests and waters. I want the ugly racism that surrounds immigration policy and the ignorance that is encouraged in society to end. I want all communities to have the same right to access clean drinking water. I want to see a shift in policy so that industry giants will no longer damage the land and waterways because the consequences will be too high for them to take risks.\u00a0\n\"If we don't exercise our right to vote, we give away our chance to hold the government accountable so they have no reason to serve our needs and wants. I've met Indigenous people who choose not to vote. Regardless of how one may feel about the legitimacy of the authority that Canada holds over our lands and people, voting is one of several tools we can use to effect change, and exercising this 'right'\u00a0doesn't preclude us from asserting our inherent rights in many other ways.\"\n\"I vote because it matters who's making decisions that affect our most vulnerable Canadian citizens. These politicians need to be reminded who their bosses are \u2014 you and me.\"\n\"Though we can't make our wishes known nearly as often as we might prefer, one of the places where we can make our wishes known is\u00a0when we vote for who is going to represent us.\n\"Whether or not we're going to exist 10 years from now [is an issue that's important to me]. Whether or not we will be called back as a result of our own ignorance and lack of understanding that this planet birthed us ... we have messed it up to the point where she can't necessarily continue to support us. And that sits squarely with us. That's our collective karma of the individuals who choose to be born on this planet that we all share that ... but at least when we go to the polls, we can say, this is who I believe represents where I want us to go, as best as we can get there.\"\n\"I vote because not doing so produces (even) worse governance and incentives for our elected leaders. I vote to protect our cultural institutions, our education system, and to preserve our national status as a leader on important global issues, such as freedom of the press, climate change, human rights and immigration.\"\nGeraldine Hollett: \"I think we vote because it's important to vote for a group of people who see that the arts is one of the wisest investments there is. And if a government isn't interested in equal rights for all and interested in making our world a healthier place in terms of mental health and our ever warming climate, then we have to make sure to keep them out.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nPhil Churchill: \"I've often said that there is still a fundamental misunderstanding in some sections of society at large as to the benefit of art. This is something that I'm OK with if the desire to understand is present. We should not go to war with everyone who does not immediately see our point of view, rather we should acknowledge that a changed mind can host a more powerful and stalwart ally than one simply born into an ideology. I vote to put into positions of power those who can frame arguments to open eyes and awaken new agents of education who want to teach even those who don't want to learn.\"\n\"I see voting as a form of harm reduction. I want to be thinking of how to support and protect the most marginalized among us, and voting is one important part of that, in addition to daily activism and work. As a settler on this land, centring Indigenous issues is important to me. I strive to be conscious of those treaty relationships and the many injustices and dangers that Indigenous communities continue to face. As a member of the Queer community, I'm aware of the need for access to extended health care and support from leadership. As an artist, more robust funding for artistic projects and addressing the dire need for affordable long-term housing are prominent in my mind.\n\"The electoral system often feels like it doesn't fully represent my own beliefs, but because I see it as a way of reducing harm against marginalized communities, I think it's important to take a few minutes out of a day to vote for who I believe will best protect and support those communities.\"\n\"You can't complain about the way things are if you don't vote. I vote because the right to vote is a very precious thing that many people have fought for and continue to fight for today. I don't take it for granted.\"\n\"I'm voting in this year's federal election in hopes that the Canadian government will never again come up with excuses as to why some people living here have clean drinking water, and others don't, and why we can't change that immediately.\"\n\"Voting is one of the few chances we get to have our opinions actually heard. We can make our posts on social media, or join groups that share our ideas, but I doubt any of that reaches the powers that be like the results of an election.\n\"Basically, [the issue that matters most to me is] how we treat Canadians. Those who were here first, those here now and those coming into the country. From how our country's Indigenous people have been treated in the past and are treated now, to the rights of every Canadian regardless of race, creed and sexual orientation. We need to focus on improving our country socially and environmentally.\n\"[People should vote] because doing nothing changes nothing. We need to take part in the decisions that affect us all.\"\n\"My parents were civil rights activists and I have always believed we can disrupt and resist most effectively through voter participation. The joy of non-violent activism. Everything is political in this world, therefore we must vote.\n\"I think I probably have many of the same hopes and dreams that so many Canadians have for the coming election, with issues that I'm deeply interested in such as stronger women's rights, food security and housing, refugee protections and health care and relationships with Indigenous communities.\n\"People should vote in this year's election because when we vote we reclaim\u00a0our voice! We owe it to our communities to vote. It is our responsibility and we must refrain from apathy, which is no solution at all! Voting is a privilege in this world and we must never squander our freedom to do it. Voting is our opportunity to effect real change.\"\n\"I always vote because I think it's important. I don't think it's just because I've studied history and because I know that not even women, people in general didn't always get to vote \u2026 you have to be counted. People fought for this.\u00a0\n\"Social welfare is so important. The health care system, particularly in our province, but other provinces I've lived in as well have so many issues ... those are things that happened because of government policy. The environment's a big one for me as well. It's such a no-brainer at this point. And just general human rights, like women should have the right to safe abortion, kids should not be hungry, queer and trans people should be recognized and treated equally, you know?\u00a0\n\"I think it's also just a question of protecting what we have and making sure we don't reverse course where there's been progress. The Harper government was a really dark time for our country, I think. And especially now where there's so many right-wing governments coming into power, and we're in this time where people are feeling disenfranchised, and people are feeling like they're not being heard and so they're voting for radical things. And while sometimes on either side of the centre we feel like we're completely at odds, the reality is that everybody really just wants to have enough.\"\n\"I believe election day is an opportunity to uplift marginalized voices, increase the quality of life for all people and to take action against climate change. It's time that our government reflect\u00a0the lives of all Canadians. I vote for the rights and lives of Indigenous, queer and transgender people, for women, immigrants and people of colour. For the homeless, poor and differently abled and for the preservation of this incredible land.\"\n\"I think voting is not just a privilege but a mandatory minimum for all citizens participating in a democratic society. Authoritarian governments seem to be back in style across the globe and the first step to undermining any democracy is apathy by its citizens. Even though we may sometimes feel discouraged by government corruption or lack of representation on matters that we consider important, refusing to exert our right to a voice in 2019 is not an option.\"\n\"It is important to have a government that is in it for all of us.\u00a0I watched our present leader lie to our country in front of Gord Downie on national television. Let's not forget that.\u00a0He let the Indigenous population down and with that dragged the potential of our country down with it. To have a leader that governs with love is our only hope .\n\"I get to vote for an inspiring and genuine leader, Jagmeet Singh. Different from all the same politicians we have seen. Fresh, real. He's proven time and time again that he cares about Canadians. A leader who leads with the love in his heart.\"\n\"I'm voting in the federal election because I love Canada and I'm proud to be here. To live in a country where I can be civically engaged in a fairly just process should not be taken for granted.\n\"The issues that matter to me most are the investments in the future. I look at platforms that have youth action plans, and proposals for education, green tech and sustainability. Housing is a big one right now, as fewer people than ever see themselves as homeowners. NDP is currently the only party with proposed plans for housing, so I'm hoping it's more of a topic in the debates.\n\"We can't underestimate how much of an impact the government has on our everyday lives. If you care about how the country is run, voting is the primary action to show that. James Baldwin said, 'I love America more than any other country in the world and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.' Although, we don't need everyone to be a staunch critic of the government, we need every citizen to be engaged and aware of the current state of affairs.\"\n\"Voting is a privilege we cannot take for granted, and no amount of cynicism about the faults of the system or of candidates should stop us from participating. We are never offered perfect choices. Nor are we ever given perfect information. But we need to invest ourselves in the urgency of the issues at hand. We all bear responsibility for our future.\"\n\"I only vote in elections where I\u00a0feel my vote will make a difference. If one party is overwhelmingly leading in pre-polls and I want to vote for the minority party, I usually don't vote. I understand that some feel 'one vote can make a difference.' Ultimately, one vote can make a difference but not as much as a crowd, a community or neighbourhood. MPs are the ones closest to the community. I vote because I care which MP is running my riding, not necessarily the prime minister.\"\n\"I always vote. My father was asked by John Diefenbaker twice to run for the Progressive Conservatives for the Rosetown-Biggar (Saskatchewan) riding in the 1950s. He declined, saying he didn't want to live in Ottawa! My father's sense of civic duty was strong; he was chair of several boards. My sister and I both follow his example and volunteer, sit on several boards, and lobby for social change. Like both my parents, I vote for different parties depending on principles and policies.\u00a0\n\"In general, I am a fan of minority governments. I remember both Liberal and Conservative federal administrations with large majorities cutting the CBC, treating the Mother Corps as though it were the official opposition. Canadians need\u00a0\u2014\u00a0desperately need \u2014\u00a0non-for-profit journalism and reporting. We also need a forum to learn about other Canadians.\u00a0\n\"There are so many [issues that matter to me]. I am so pleased by the increased funding to the Canada Council and the non-gender specific passports instituted by the current Trudeau government, but disappointed by so much, including the ongoing muddle and horror of the federal government's relationship to Aboriginal people.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Tear gas, reports of woman shot after weekend protests in Iran: video", "description": "Demonstrators protest against Tehran's initial denial it shot down Ukrainian plane", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/tear-gas-reports-of-woman-shot-after-weekend-protests-in-iran-video-1.5424585", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5424595.1578959797!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/iran-plane-crash.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 13, 2020 7:25 AM ET", "2020-01-14T00:02:40.307Z"], "source": null, "content": "Iranian security forces fired\u00a0live ammunition and tear gas to disperse demonstrators protesting against the Islamic Republic's initial denial\u00a0it shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, online videos purported to show Monday.\nVideos sent to the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran and later verified by The Associated Press show a crowd of demonstrators near Azadi, or Freedom, Square on Sunday night fleeing as a tear gas canister landed among them.\nPeople cough and sputter while trying to escape the fumes, with one woman calling out in Farsi: \"They fired tear gas at people!

A recent report issued by the organization said\u00a0the Ford government\u00a0has done almost\u00a0nothing on the bulk of the promises in the greenhouse-gas reduction\u00a0plan it introduced last November.\n\"Ontario needs to stop wasting our tax dollars \u2014\u00a0and time we don't have \u2014\u00a0fighting the federal government's carbon price,\" Brooks said.\nGreen Party of Ontario leader\u00a0Mike Schreiner\u00a0similarly called on Ford to drop the province's lawsuit.\u00a0\n\"[Ford] should drop the campaign to sabotage climate solutions and start showing Ontarians that he actually understands the urgency of the climate crisis,\" Schreiner said in a statement.\nIf the Premier is truly interested in fixing past mistakes, this is the next reset button he should push.\"\nThe federal carbon pricing law applies to Ontario, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan, all of which do not have their own carbon pricing schemes.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThere are several topics that I could bring up, but they all fall under one broad tent: their future. People are worried about their economic future, the future of the environment, and the future of Canada on the world stage.\nThe cost of living is rising faster than wages, Canada's emissions are growing at record rates, and Canadians are concerned that Canada's reputation has diminished on the world stage after four years under Justin Trudeau's leadership.\nA Conservative government will live within it's means, lower taxes for middle class Canadians, and make investments in our children. On the environment, rather than punish Canadians with a carbon tax for commuting to work and driving their kids to hockey practice, we will\u00a0incentivize\u00a0environmentally-friendly home renovations, and local green technology.\u00a0\nLastly, a Conservative government will reinvigorate Canada's role in the alliances we share with our democratic allies. This includes existing alliances like NORAD, NATO, CANZUK, the Commonwealth, La Francophonie, and the Five Eyes, but it will also include greater overtures to India and Japan.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nOver the past four years under Justin Trudeau, nearly 50 per cent of all Canadians are within $200 of insolvency every month. Because of their hard work, Canadians are able to get by, but many aren't able to get ahead. That's why a Conservative government, under the leadership of Andrew Scheer, will put you first and make decisions to help you get ahead.\nWe have introduced several measures to put money back into your pocket.\u00a0The universal tax cut will give the average Canadian family over $800 more per year to spend on home renovations, a trip or put into savings. The child fitness and arts tax credits will save Canadians 15 per cent of the total cost of those programs and activities. The transit tax credit will reduce the overall cost of your monthly transit pass; a cost saving measure that was cancelled by the Liberal government.\nKitchener-Conestoga residents are eager to see the removal of GST from home heating costs. When it's 30 below you shouldn't have to decide between putting food on your table or heating your home! That's why we will remove tax on those bills, leaving you more money at the end of each month.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur Conservative Party's comprehensive plan for the environment is built on three guiding principles:\nGreen technology, not taxes.\nA cleaner and greener natural environment.\nTaking the climate change fight global.\nThe full plan can be found at\u00a0arealplan.ca. One key issue that I feel very strongly about is our plan to protect our waterways against wastewater dumping. We will work with municipalities to end their practice of dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into our waterways.\nWe will also reinstate funding for wetland, watershed, and fisheries conservation that was revoked by the Liberals.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm a proud husband, father, and grandfather and I have been privileged to serve Kitchener-Conestoga as your Member of Parliament for the past 13 years.\nI want to continue to serve in this capacity because I love our region and the people who live here! Kitchener, Wellesley, Wilmot, and Woolwich all have a special place in my heart, and I believe I'm the best person for this job. Growing up on a farm in Wilmot Township and now living with my wife Darlene in Kitchener has given me perspective on how to represent both rural and urban constituents.\nOver the past 13 years, my office has helped hundreds, if not thousands of you deal with federal programs such as CRA, immigration, and other federal government related issues \u2014 and I hope to continue to serve you in this way for four more years.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nAffordability for families. Canada's economy is strong and growing, but the rising cost of living is making it harder for everyone to share in that success.\nFor too many families, it's still tough to make ends meet. Daycare spots are expensive and difficult to find, costing some families more than $4,000 this year. Meanwhile, parents who work late shifts or irregular hours have even fewer child care options.\nThat is why a re-elected Liberal government will give families up to $1,000 more through the Canada Child Benefit for kids under the age of one, make maternity and parental benefits tax-exempt and reduce childcare fees for before and after school care by 10%.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Liberal government's plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class is working. It helped Canadians create over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014 most of which being full time positions \u2013 and brought the unemployment rate to a 40-year low.\nDespite that, many Canadians struggle to make ends meet given the high cost of living. That is why a re-elected Liberal government will work with telecom companies to lower the cost of wireless services by 25%, increase Old Age Security by 10% once they turn 75 and ensure middle class Canadians pay no federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn, saving the average family $585 in taxes each year.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change represents an existential threat and Canadians are taking to the streets to demand stronger action to fight it. That is why the Liberal government is phasing out coal, banning single-use plastics and put a price on pollution.\nA re-elected Liberal government has committed to getting Canada to net-zero emission by 2050, make Canada a world leader in clean technology, protect 25% of Canada's lands and oceans by 2025, help homeowners and landlords retrofit their homes to make them more energy efficient and plant 2 billion trees.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI never thought of entering politics when I decided to run in 2015, and only lost by 251 votes. Like many, I was frustrated by the direction of our country under the former government and felt that middle class families like my own were left behind.\nIn 2019, I decided to run again because the Liberal government has improved the lives of middle class Canadians, but we know there is more work that needs to be done. We need more people who are middle class in Parliament, advocating for our issues. I feel that not everyone's voice is being heard in Kitchener\u2013Conestoga. If elected I will represent all voices, not just people who share my beliefs.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe concern I hear most frequently from people in the riding, is about affordability, and health care. For many families, these two are closely connected, especially when there are members of the family who need chronic medication.\nThe inclusion of pharmacare as part of Medicare will offer tremendous relief to many families in Kitchener-Conestoga. Making dental care and vision care available to families who can't otherwise afford it, will not just address a financial need with families, but will also allow people to better participate in the workplace or in schools.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThere are a number of practical things that will offer relief, like pharmacare. Knowing the NDP has the support of two parties, this finally seems achievable.\nAnother expense that's crippling is the cost of daycare. Rather than tax credits, which only refund a small percentage (two to three per cent) of the actual cost, I will support the introduction of publicly funded daycare.\nWe need to have broader conversations about how our economy functions. While wages for more than half of the population are stagnant, the richest people are seeing disproportionate and exponential growth in income. Statistics Canada reports the average total income of Canadians in 2017 rose by 2.5 per cent, barely keeping pace with inflation. However, the average income of people in the top one percent grew by 8.5 per cent and the wealthiest group, those in the top 0.01 per cent, had an increase of a staggering 27.2 per cent.\nWe need to collectively figure out how to make sure every Canadian benefits from the growth of wealth. This will not be an overnight change, but we have to make sure that as we encourage a vibrant economy, it is vibrant for everybody.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe first thing I'd support is to stop proving taxpayers' money in the form of subsidies to fossil fuel companies, who are making billions of dollars in profits, and certainly do not need it.\nInstead of funding them, they need to chip in and fairly contribute to solving our climate problems. They not only played a large part in creating this crisis, but they have also benefited enormously off it. Green technology, and specifically the development of clean energy, is one of the fasted growing economies in the world, and China and other countries are taking full advantage of this. Canada needs to step up and take our rightful place on that field.\nWe have a lot of technology and innovation in this country, much of it in our own region, and we have all the potential we need to be the world leader in clean energy and technology. We have to focus our collective will and resources on this, so that we can be an exporter of clean energy and technology, rather than having to become dependent on other countries for the importation of our energy.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI refuse to settle. Just like workers are worth much more, so are Canadian voters.\u00a0\nI believe in the worth and value of people \u2014 as people, as workers, as people, as citizens. I believe we deserve better government, better healthcare, better educational opportunities, better wages, a clean, sustainable environment, and a bigger slice of the enormous wealth of our country, wealth that is currently concentrated in the hands of a few, and squirreled away in offshore bank accounts.\nIf the people of Kitchener-Conestoga choose to send me to represent them in Ottawa, that is what I will fight for.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\n\"Water is life. The Green Party's vision for our water is clear: keep it, conserve it, and protect it,\" said Elizabeth May. \"We will defend Canada's water from bulk exports, create a National Water Policy, and restore Canada's environmental laws to protect our waterways.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We really need to do more to expand natural ecosystems ... Our lives depend on being able to access clean drinking water and on restoring more of nature's filtration systems for providing drinking water,\" May says.\nThe Green Party will:\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Green Party has three\u00a0priorities:\nIn 2017, 268,000 people were already employed in the clean energy sector. This does not include the 436,000 jobs in the energy efficiency sector & we have not yet begun a serious national retrofit of buildings and\u00a0industries. Projections put future jobs in energy efficiency retrofits alone at four million.\nGreen MPs will:\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nAccept, at every level of government, that climate is not an environmental issue. All parties will work together to ensure that the climate is no longer treated as a political football.\nEstablish a new target and file it as Canada's Nationally Determined Contribution with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change: 60 percent GHG reductions against 2005 levels by 2030; zero emissions by 2050.\nRestore funding of climate research within the Government of Canada.\nBy 2030, rebuild and revamp the east-west electricity grid to ensure that renewable energy can be transmitted from one province to another. Ensure all new cars are electric. By 2040, replace all internal combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles.\nCreate millions of new jobs in the trades by retrofitting every building in Canada \u2014 residential, commercial, and institutional.\nEngage every municipality and community organization, as well as every school and university to plant trees, install solar panels, heat pumps, assist in retrofitting buildings to maximize energy efficiency.\nInvest significant resources in adaptation measures to protect resource sectors such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. Map flood plains and other areas of natural vulnerability and adjust land-use plans accordingly.\nLaunch a global effort to restore carbon sinks.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nWith a strong desire to help build communities and people around her, Stephanie has worked tirelessly to promote a sense of community.\nIn 2007 she was hired by the Toronto Police Service and continued in this role until her first child was born. It was at this time that Stephanie decided to become an entrepreneur and work with small businesses and not-for-profits, who were passionate about increasing the health of local families.\nShe began to bring people and businesses together, from across multiple sectors and industries, to understand shared values and solve shared problems. Stephanie's father, Allan Beach, started his company when she was around two\u00a0years old. His work ethic and dedication to his job instilled in Stephanie the drive to keep building and expanding in business.

The candidates were told they had a 200-word limit for answers.\nCandidates who did not provide surveys by the deadline are invited to still do so and their responses\u00a0will be added to this story when they are received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThere are several topics that I could bring up, but they all fall under one broad tent: their future. People are worried about their economic future, the future of the environment, and the future of Canada on the world stage.\nThe cost of living is rising faster than wages, Canada's emissions are growing at record rates, and Canadians are concerned that Canada's reputation has diminished on the world stage after four years under Justin Trudeau's leadership.\nA Conservative government will live within it's means, lower taxes for middle class Canadians, and make investments in our children. On the environment, rather than punish Canadians with a carbon tax for commuting to work and driving their kids to hockey practice, we will\u00a0incentivize\u00a0environmentally-friendly home renovations, and local green technology.\u00a0\nLastly, a Conservative government will reinvigorate Canada's role in the alliances we share with our democratic allies. This includes existing alliances like NORAD, NATO, CANZUK, the Commonwealth, La Francophonie, and the Five Eyes, but it will also include greater overtures to India and Japan.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nOver the past four years under Justin Trudeau, nearly 50 per cent of all Canadians are within $200 of insolvency every month. Because of their hard work, Canadians are able to get by, but many aren't able to get ahead. That's why a Conservative government, under the leadership of Andrew Scheer, will put you first and make decisions to help you get ahead.\nWe have introduced several measures to put money back into your pocket.\u00a0The universal tax cut will give the average Canadian family over $800 more per year to spend on home renovations, a trip or put into savings. The child fitness and arts tax credits will save Canadians 15 per cent of the total cost of those programs and activities. The transit tax credit will reduce the overall cost of your monthly transit pass; a cost saving measure that was cancelled by the Liberal government.\nKitchener-Conestoga residents are eager to see the removal of GST from home heating costs. When it's 30 below you shouldn't have to decide between putting food on your table or heating your home! That's why we will remove tax on those bills, leaving you more money at the end of each month.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur Conservative Party's comprehensive plan for the environment is built on three guiding principles:\nGreen technology, not taxes.\nA cleaner and greener natural environment.\nTaking the climate change fight global.\nThe full plan can be found at\u00a0arealplan.ca. One key issue that I feel very strongly about is our plan to protect our waterways against wastewater dumping. We will work with municipalities to end their practice of dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into our waterways.\nWe will also reinstate funding for wetland, watershed, and fisheries conservation that was revoked by the Liberals.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm a proud husband, father, and grandfather and I have been privileged to serve Kitchener-Conestoga as your Member of Parliament for the past 13 years.\nI want to continue to serve in this capacity because I love our region and the people who live here! Kitchener, Wellesley, Wilmot, and Woolwich all have a special place in my heart, and I believe I'm the best person for this job. Growing up on a farm in Wilmot Township and now living with my wife Darlene in Kitchener has given me perspective on how to represent both rural and urban constituents.\nOver the past 13 years, my office has helped hundreds, if not thousands of you deal with federal programs such as CRA, immigration, and other federal government related issues \u2014 and I hope to continue to serve you in this way for four more years.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nAffordability for families. Canada's economy is strong and growing, but the rising cost of living is making it harder for everyone to share in that success.\nFor too many families, it's still tough to make ends meet. Daycare spots are expensive and difficult to find, costing some families more than $4,000 this year. Meanwhile, parents who work late shifts or irregular hours have even fewer child care options.\nThat is why a re-elected Liberal government will give families up to $1,000 more through the Canada Child Benefit for kids under the age of one, make maternity and parental benefits tax-exempt and reduce childcare fees for before and after school care by 10%.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Liberal government's plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class is working. It helped Canadians create over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014 most of which being full time positions \u2013 and brought the unemployment rate to a 40-year low.\nDespite that, many Canadians struggle to make ends meet given the high cost of living. That is why a re-elected Liberal government will work with telecom companies to lower the cost of wireless services by 25%, increase Old Age Security by 10% once they turn 75 and ensure middle class Canadians pay no federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn, saving the average family $585 in taxes each year.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change represents an existential threat and Canadians are taking to the streets to demand stronger action to fight it. That is why the Liberal government is phasing out coal, banning single-use plastics and put a price on pollution.\nA re-elected Liberal government has committed to getting Canada to net-zero emission by 2050, make Canada a world leader in clean technology, protect 25% of Canada's lands and oceans by 2025, help homeowners and landlords retrofit their homes to make them more energy efficient and plant 2 billion trees.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI never thought of entering politics when I decided to run in 2015, and only lost by 251 votes. Like many, I was frustrated by the direction of our country under the former government and felt that middle class families like my own were left behind.\nIn 2019, I decided to run again because the Liberal government has improved the lives of middle class Canadians, but we know there is more work that needs to be done. We need more people who are middle class in Parliament, advocating for our issues. I feel that not everyone's voice is being heard in Kitchener\u2013Conestoga. If elected I will represent all voices, not just people who share my beliefs.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe concern I hear most frequently from people in the riding, is about affordability, and health care. For many families, these two are closely connected, especially when there are members of the family who need chronic medication.\nThe inclusion of pharmacare as part of Medicare will offer tremendous relief to many families in Kitchener-Conestoga. Making dental care and vision care available to families who can't otherwise afford it, will not just address a financial need with families, but will also allow people to better participate in the workplace or in schools.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThere are a number of practical things that will offer relief, like pharmacare. Knowing the NDP has the support of two parties, this finally seems achievable.\nAnother expense that's crippling is the cost of daycare. Rather than tax credits, which only refund a small percentage (two to three per cent) of the actual cost, I will support the introduction of publicly funded daycare.\nWe need to have broader conversations about how our economy functions. While wages for more than half of the population are stagnant, the richest people are seeing disproportionate and exponential growth in income. Statistics Canada reports the average total income of Canadians in 2017 rose by 2.5 per cent, barely keeping pace with inflation. However, the average income of people in the top one percent grew by 8.5 per cent and the wealthiest group, those in the top 0.01 per cent, had an increase of a staggering 27.2 per cent.\nWe need to collectively figure out how to make sure every Canadian benefits from the growth of wealth. This will not be an overnight change, but we have to make sure that as we encourage a vibrant economy, it is vibrant for everybody.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe first thing I'd support is to stop proving taxpayers' money in the form of subsidies to fossil fuel companies, who are making billions of dollars in profits, and certainly do not need it.\nInstead of funding them, they need to chip in and fairly contribute to solving our climate problems. They not only played a large part in creating this crisis, but they have also benefited enormously off it. Green technology, and specifically the development of clean energy, is one of the fasted growing economies in the world, and China and other countries are taking full advantage of this. Canada needs to step up and take our rightful place on that field.\nWe have a lot of technology and innovation in this country, much of it in our own region, and we have all the potential we need to be the world leader in clean energy and technology. We have to focus our collective will and resources on this, so that we can be an exporter of clean energy and technology, rather than having to become dependent on other countries for the importation of our energy.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI refuse to settle. Just like workers are worth much more, so are Canadian voters.\u00a0\nI believe in the worth and value of people \u2014 as people, as workers, as people, as citizens. I believe we deserve better government, better healthcare, better educational opportunities, better wages, a clean, sustainable environment, and a bigger slice of the enormous wealth of our country, wealth that is currently concentrated in the hands of a few, and squirreled away in offshore bank accounts.\nIf the people of Kitchener-Conestoga choose to send me to represent them in Ottawa, that is what I will fight for.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\n\"Water is life. The Green Party's vision for our water is clear: keep it, conserve it, and protect it,\" said Elizabeth May. \"We will defend Canada's water from bulk exports, create a National Water Policy, and restore Canada's environmental laws to protect our waterways.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We really need to do more to expand natural ecosystems ... Our lives depend on being able to access clean drinking water and on restoring more of nature's filtration systems for providing drinking water,\" May says.\nThe Green Party will:\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Green Party has three\u00a0priorities:\nIn 2017, 268,000 people were already employed in the clean energy sector. This does not include the 436,000 jobs in the energy efficiency sector & we have not yet begun a serious national retrofit of buildings and\u00a0industries. Projections put future jobs in energy efficiency retrofits alone at four million.\nGreen MPs will:\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nAccept, at every level of government, that climate is not an environmental issue. All parties will work together to ensure that the climate is no longer treated as a political football.\nEstablish a new target and file it as Canada's Nationally Determined Contribution with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change: 60 percent GHG reductions against 2005 levels by 2030; zero emissions by 2050.\nRestore funding of climate research within the Government of Canada.\nBy 2030, rebuild and revamp the east-west electricity grid to ensure that renewable energy can be transmitted from one province to another. Ensure all new cars are electric. By 2040, replace all internal combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles.\nCreate millions of new jobs in the trades by retrofitting every building in Canada \u2014 residential, commercial, and institutional.\nEngage every municipality and community organization, as well as every school and university to plant trees, install solar panels, heat pumps, assist in retrofitting buildings to maximize energy efficiency.\nInvest significant resources in adaptation measures to protect resource sectors such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. Map flood plains and other areas of natural vulnerability and adjust land-use plans accordingly.\nLaunch a global effort to restore carbon sinks.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nWith a strong desire to help build communities and people around her, Stephanie has worked tirelessly to promote a sense of community.\nIn 2007 she was hired by the Toronto Police Service and continued in this role until her first child was born. It was at this time that Stephanie decided to become an entrepreneur and work with small businesses and not-for-profits, who were passionate about increasing the health of local families.\nShe began to bring people and businesses together, from across multiple sectors and industries, to understand shared values and solve shared problems. Stephanie's father, Allan Beach, started his company when she was around two\u00a0years old. His work ethic and dedication to his job instilled in Stephanie the drive to keep building and expanding in business. Stephanie's two children have given her the reason to run for MP.\nShe knows that the future is unknown, but by electing honest and ethical people in politics, ones who understand we are stronger together, there is hope. We need to act now. We can not wait another four years. We already know our system is broken. Vote for what we need and want, not for what we fear.\u00a0\nWebsite\nResponses not yet received.\n"}, {"author": "Jorge Barrera", "title": "THC slushies, pirate radio and the cannabis-driven boom in a Mohawk community", "description": "Renovation and construction dot Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory in Ontario, much of it fuelled by marijuana", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/tyendinaga-cannabis-economy-boom-1.5216532", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5216581.1569608535!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tyendinaga-pot.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jul 21, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-07-21T08:00:00.714Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Driving down Highway 401 in southern Ontario, with the FM dial tuned to 87.9,\u00a0the 1990s-era rap music fades into an ad, offering a free joint with every purchase over $20 between midnight and 4:20 a.m. at the Pot Shoppe.\nA second ad then promotes a \"car show for Jeeps\" in the parking lot of the Pot Shoppe every Tuesday night.\n\"Don't forget, we have free coffee for the driver and our famous Pot Shoppe slushies at half-price for the passenger,\" the ad says. \"THC-infused slushies\u00a0\u2014 just a little more brain freeze.\"\nThe transmission tower for the station \u2014\u00a0Real Peoples Radio\u00a0\u2014\u00a0stands over a small shack that was once the second cannabis store to open in Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory,\u00a0located about 200 kilometres east of Toronto. That shack\u00a0is now the broadcasting studio for a\u00a0pirate radio station that lives on the edge of the radio dial,\u00a0and\u00a0also streams online.\nBehind the microphone is Joseph Owl, from Serpent River First Nation, Ont.,\u00a0a full-time DJ at the station who hosts the 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. show.\nOwl was offered the job through friends and started working at the station at the start of June.\n\"This is the best [employment] opportunity I've come across,\" he said.\nThe station is one of many offshoots from a cannabis-infused economic boom in this Mohawk community of 2,100, nestled on the shores of the Bay of Quinte, between Belleville and Kingston, and just a short drive from Prince Edward County, a growing tourism hotspot.\nThere are dozens of cannabis stores here \u2014 some estimates place the number between 40 and 50 \u2014 with names like Smoke Signals, Better Buds, Legacy 420, Peacemaker 420, Buddy's Dispensary, Fiddler's Green and Cannabis Convenience.\nCannabis plants sprout outside the front doors of some homes and hundreds more line the surrounding back lots and fields, for harvesting in late summer or early fall.\nThe community is dotted with renovation and construction projects, including several new gas stations and at least one new franchise restaurant.\nMuch of it is attributed to the influx of\u00a0cash coming from sales at local cannabis stores, then spreading throughout the community.\n\"It's a straight up economic\u00a0boom,\" said Jamie Kunkel, who owns one of the local shops, Smoke Signals.\nMoney was already coming into the community from outside customers looking for cheaper gas and cigarettes,\u00a0Kunkel said. But\u00a0the increased traffic from cannabis stores has\u00a0meant more revenue\u00a0for existing businesses.\n\"All the stores that existed prior to cannabis were all running\u00a0busy all day long, making good money,\" said Kunkel.\u00a0\"You get the big rush coming in from the cannabis, thousands of extra cars on a daily basis.... Now there's lineups for cigarettes, lineups for gas.\"\nKunkel said his\u00a0own cannabis business has grown exponentially since he began a little over three years ago. He was involved with a business partner and then branched out on his own, opening\u00a0a store out of his home before\u00a0constructing\u00a0a separate shop and eventually franchising\u00a0out to four other First Nations in Ontario.\nHe also bought the land adjacent to his storefront to run an annual Indigenous \"Cannabis Cup\" event;\u00a0hip-hop group Naughty by Nature performed this year.\nThe opening of Ontario's licensed cannabis shops in nearby cities like Kingston, Toronto and Ottawa \u2014 places where Tyendinaga draws the majority of its customers \u2014 has had some impact,\u00a0Kunkel said. But overall, business is steady.\n\"Our traffic went down, but our sales stayed the same or increased, because the traffic that we did keep were the bigger ones,\" said Kunkel.\u00a0\"They are coming in, they are buying ounces ... half-ounces, plus whatever else it is they want.\"\nKunkel said his prices are sometimes $10 less a gram for the same strain of marijuana sold at Ontario's regulated stores. \"[Customers]\u00a0don't want to go to those stores, they don't want to pay that much tax,\" he said.\nSusan and John Lovecchio, senior citizens from Brighton, Ont.,\u00a0about 60 kilometres west of Tyendinaga, said they shop at the Pot Shoppe because of the\u00a0service.\n\"They've been super ... they are a pleasure to work with,\" said Susan Lovecchio, who received a senior's discount of $24 and spent about $130 on cannabis products.\nLovecchio said she shops in Tyendinaga because there are no marijuana shops near her home. \"I think it's great. The Natives are wonderful and they're making the most of this.\u00a0And I say, 'Yeah, go for it.'\"\nA cannabis economy began to bloom in Tyendinaga after the Liberal government first announced it would legalize cannabis. By Oct.17, 2018\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the date of legalization\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roots of the cannabis industry had already sunk deep into the community.\nIt's all unfolded\u00a0outside of the federal, provincial and\u00a0territorial\u00a0regulatory framework.\nOttawa has said that federal and provincial cannabis laws would apply on reserves, but individual provinces and territories can make room for agreements with First Nations.\nAccording to the office of federal minister of border security and organized crime reduction, legal\u00a0cannabis can only be sold through government-regulated stores.\u00a0\n\"The only legal quality-controlled source of cannabis in Canada is through provincially or territorially authorized distributors and retailers or federally licensed\u00a0sellers that have the authorization of their health care practitioner to access cannabis for medical purposes,\" said Bill Blair's spokesperson, Marie-Emmanuelle Cadieux.\nOntario's Ministry of the Attorney General said in a statement that the province continues to \"engage First Nations\" who want to explore their own models for on-reserve cannabis sales. But, it said,\u00a0\"selling outside of Ontario's authorized retail system is illegal under federal and provincial law.\"\nOntario recently announced it will soon allocate 50 new cannabis retail licences\u00a0\u2014 including eight for First Nations on a first-come, first-served basis\u00a0\u2014\u00a0up from the\u00a025\u00a0licences handed out by the province earlier this year.\nAccording to Kunkel, there is little appetite in Tyendinaga to fall under federal and provincial rules and pay taxes,\u00a0even if a deal were struck with the band.\u00a0\nThe cannabis industry in the community is also a political statement, Kunkel said, a display of sovereignty from a people who never surrendered their rights to self-governance.\nThe Tyendinaga band council, known as the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte council,\u00a0passed an interim cannabis bylaw on Oct. 16, 2018, and began community consultations on a permanent bylaw, which are still ongoing.\u00a0\nThe council released the results of an online survey in April that was completed by 147 on-reserve band members. It\u00a0revealed divided opinions on the issue, with many leaning toward\u00a0stronger band control over the cannabis industry.\u00a0\nSome of the participants, though, questioned the survey's accuracy, noting that it could be filled out multiple times by the same person and said that the questions were skewed.\nSome voiced concern over the rise in prices driven by the booming cannabis economy, along with complaints over the increased traffic and safety concerns.\n\"The pot market has driven up the price of property, making the housing situation worse,\" said one respondent.\n\"There does not appear to be any control over who sells cannabis or where shops are set up. I can think of a thousand things I would like our reserve to be noted for, but one is not for having a cannabis shop on every corner,\" said another respondent.\nOthers said the industry was having a positive impact.\n\"The majority of these shops are employing a lot of community members that, without these shops, may be unemployed due to lack of transportation and job opportunities within our community,\" said a respondent.\u00a0\n\"With a few minor changes, I believe that the cannabis industry within our community can become something that will allow for our community to succeed,\" said another.\nThe Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte band council did not respond to an interview request.\nTess\u00a0Brant, a manager at the Pot Shoppe, said her\u00a0job in the cannabis field\u00a0\"has made a huge improvement\" in her\u00a0life, beyond just her finances. \"It's kept me on the straight and narrow,\" she said.\nBrant, a mother of four, is a recovering addict and took the job a little over a year ago after completing rehab.\n\"Being here, coming here, gave me a purpose,\" said Brant, noting she\u00a0no longer smokes marijuana and instead\u00a0uses CBD oil, a non-intoxicating\u00a0extract derived from the cannabis plant.\nBrant works from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., running the store and handling the back end of the business, dealing with products and\u00a0choosing what to sell or what take a pass on.\u00a0\n\"I can afford a house, I can afford a car, I can afford for my kids,\" said Brant, whose\u00a024-year-old son also works at the store.\u00a0\"It's improved my life, 1,000\u00a0per cent.\"\nBrant said most customers come from Belleville, Kingston, Toronto, Ottawa and\u00a0Montreal; they even had a couple from Finland who stayed for a week to check out all the shops in the territory.\nBack at the studio of Real Peoples Radio, the speakers are thumping with hip-hop beats that fade as\u00a0Owl breaks in with the weather \u2014 in his own pirate-radio style.\u00a0\n\"It's gonna be hot, high of 28, humidex out\u00a0the roof.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI consistently hear from constituents that life is getting less and less affordable. Families are under pressure and worried about their future. Half of families are just $200 away from insolvency at the end of each month and Canadians' net worth declined for the first time in a decade.\nConservatives have a plan to leave more money in your pocket at the end of each month. Among other things, we are committed to:\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nIf re-elected, I'm personally committed to working on serious economic reforms by convincing my colleagues in Ottawa of the need for ambitious structural reforms to our economy. For example, we need a complete overhaul of Canada's tax system. It's completely outdated, overly complex and inefficient. It's a drag on wages, reduces business investment and dampens job growth. It also costs billions to comply with and administer. In short, Canada's tax system lags the rest of the world. We can no longer afford to not to reform it.\nWe need a Royal Commission on tax reform, one that we haven't had in almost 50 years \u2013 the last Royal Commission was the Carter Commission of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cleaning up and reforming our tax system would unleash the economic potential of this country. If done right, it would lead to rising productivity, higher wages, increased business investment and a reduced cost of compliance. If done right, it would benefit families and individuals in Wellington County and Halton Region for decades to come, just like the reforms of 50 years ago did. It's something I'm personally committed to advancing in Ottawa.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nI believe \u2013 as do Conservatives \u2013 that climate change is a serious global challenge. I also believe the challenge of climate change requires people to reach across the aisle to work together. That is why in 2011 Green Party leader Elizabeth May and I co-founded the All-Party Climate Change Caucus with members from the NDP and Liberal parties.\nEarlier this year, Conservatives released a plan to reduce emissions and create a healthier environment. The plan is guided by three principles: green technology, a cleaner and greener natural environment, and taking the climate change fight global. The plan is titled A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment and is available at arealplan.ca.\nIn addition to the Conservative plan, I will continue to fight for the environment and climate change. My track record demonstrates my leadership on this issue.\u00a0\nI'm the only candidate in Halton Region to be endorsed by GreenPAC for my environmental leadership \u2013 and only one of 25 candidates across Canada to be endorsed.\nGreenPAC is a non-partisan, non-profit organization of leading environmentalists whose goal is to elect and support environmental leaders in all parties. You can read more about the endorsement at GreenPAC.ca.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI was raised just outside of Fergus in Wellington County, where my wife Carrie and I continue to live with our three children. My father was a Chinese immigrant \u2013 he came here from Hong Kong in the 1950s. My mother was a Dutch immigrant \u2013 she came here in the 1960s.\u00a0\nI was first elected to Parliament in 2004 to represent Wellington-Halton Hills. I've served in opposition and government. I've served as a cabinet minister and as chair of several House of Commons Standing Committees (Industry, Science and Technology; Canadian Heritage and Official Languages). Currently, I'm the Official Opposition's Shadow Minister for Science.\nPrior to my election as MP, I worked in the private sector. I was the chief Information Officer for the National Hockey League Players' Association and worked for the Greater Toronto Airports Authority on the redevelopment of Toronto Pearson. I co-founded the Dominion Institute, now known as Historica Canada, an organization committed to Canadian history, and currently sit on its Board of Governors. Historica Canada produces the iconic Heritage Minutes, which have brought alive our history to Canadians.\nBoth my wife Carrie and I met and graduated from the University of Toronto, where I studied philosophy.\nWebsite\n1.\u00a0 What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nOur riding is a mix of small towns and rural communities\u00a0and for me, a top concern is making sure\u00a0they don't get left behind economically. Addressing that requires a multi-pronged approach.\nVitality in our agricultural sector is particularly important to our riding's success. Liberals supported our farming sector while negotiating international trade, I support continuing investment in research to help farmers adapt to climate change\u00a0and mitigate its worst effects.\u00a0\nSpeedy internet access is still lacking for many in this riding\u00a0and the Liberals have been working on that as well, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to expand the network to new communities. Ahead is a new, $1.7 billion fund to extend the network's \"backbone\" and secure new satellite capacity. We aim to have 100 per cent of households connected to the Internet at speeds suitable for streaming and cloud-based business by 2030.\nThe Liberals have also contributed to crucial local road and bridge infrastructure, and taken new funding measures to sidestep provincial-side delays to get the money to municipalities faster. Recognizing rising housing pressures faced by many in this riding, the Liberals introduced the first Canadian Housing Strategy and are providing help to first time home buyers.\n2.\u00a0 People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nAs a surgeon, I see the effects of poverty and financial worries trickle down to my patients, and as an MP, I'd support anything that will responsibly ease the burden on people.\nThe Liberals' tax plan will go a long way to helping those struggling the most by making sure people don't pay taxes on their first $15,000. Around 700,000 Canadians, including younger income earners and many seniors, won't pay any income tax at all in practice.\nFor people looking to buy a home, we've introduced a\u00a0First Time Home Owners credit, which takes 10 per cent off the cost of a new home, which will be especially helpful to young people. Students will have a two-year, interest-free grace period before having to repay student loans. Seniors will benefit from a 10 per cent increase in Old Age Security after age 75.\nAs for the economy, under Liberal management, unemployment is at its lowest in decades, growth is steady\u00a0and job creation is significant.\nThe thinking behind these kinds of targeted policies\u00a0and their results\u00a0is what attracted me to the Liberal Party\u00a0and as MP\u00a0I'll support these\u00a0and any measures that will improve people's cost of living.\n3.\u00a0 The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nCanada's government has three roles to play: Curb emissions, mitigate climate change's worst effects\u00a0and actively work to transition to a greener economy. Without active government policies, based on science, no progress on those fronts is possible.\nOn emissions, the Liberals brought in a price on carbon, which makes the high carbon polluters pay. A higher price encourages people and corporations to switch to other low-carbon energy sources. In addition, most of the carbon revenue is\u00a0rebated back into the pockets of Canadians. In fact, 80 per cent of families will get back more than they pay.\nOn transition, the Liberals have a raft of measures to encourage a green switch, like tax cuts for green tech businesses, interest-free loans for home energy efficiency retrofits, and rebates for electric vehicles paired with money to expand the network of charging stations, to name a few.\nClimate change in Canada is also expected to make extreme weather events, such as 2013's ice storm and this spring's flooding in Ottawa, more common. Government has a role to play in mitigation, and the Liberals will increase disaster relief funding, offer relocation to the most at-risk homeowners, and develop a low-cost national flood insurance program.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI've been a surgeon for around two decades, and have been practicing in Georgetown since 2008, when I first moved here. I live nearby in Limehouse with my husband Simon and three children Thea, Nori and Max. My mother lives in Fergus, so I was going up to visit very often even before deciding to make the leap to politics.\nI'm originally from Ancaster, but I've lived and travelled extensively outside of Canada. My time abroad really gave me an appreciation for the kinds of things we take for granted here in Canada, like universal healthcare, a stable democracy, even clean drinking water.\nA career in surgery gives you a particular perspective on poverty, lack of affordable housing, high drug costs, delayed access to a family doctor or mental health treatment, and numerous other afflictions of the mind and body \u2014 you see all the downstream health effects of those issues in your patients.\nThat's what pushed me to consider running. I want to bring my own experiences to bear to help fix those problems at the political level, and from what I've seen, the Liberals have made a genuine effort to improve people's lives.\nNDP candidate website\nResponse not yet received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nLocally, as Greens, we protect water; our water, which is a 'public trust.'\u00a0 Mike Schreiner, the sole Green MPP at Queen's Park, worked across party lines and got unanimous approval for his Paris Galt Moraine bill in the 2nd reading.\u00a0\nThe Green Party will develop a National Water Strategy to ensure safe drinking water, in collaboration with provinces, territories, municipalities and Indigenous peoples. The last National Water Strategy was delivered in the 1980s and was never fully implemented. Our goal is to protect a minimum of 30% of freshwater and land by 2030.\nWe will climate-proof drinking water and waste-water systems to protect against flooding, droughts, and contamination and increase \"green infrastructure\" by protecting watersheds and wetlands.\nThe Green party will restore buffer zones around waterways through tree-planting and soil rebuilding. We will support farmers in protecting wildlife habitat areas, water quality, and building soil quality on their lands.\u00a0\nThe Erin Soil Health Coalition relates good practices in the kitchen to good practices on the land.\nFarmers, by adding more carbon to the soil: 1) improve soil quality and thus crop yields, 2) improve water filtration, 3) draw down CO2 from the atmosphere, and 4) improve human health.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Green Party proposes to renew a social contract with Canadians. A Guaranteed Livable Income (GLI) will significantly reduce poverty and allow social services to concentrate on problems of mental health and addiction. A GLI will help us adjust to automation, and a shift to a 21st century, Green Economy.\u00a0\nFiscal responsibility is key. I will vote to reduce deficits and the debt burden on future generations. Their struggle to adapt to climatic extremes will already be enough of a challenge; they don't need big debts too. However, they do need jobs, jobs that persist in the new clean caring economy. This new economy already provides more jobs than the gas and oil sector.\nSmall businesses\u00a0create over 70 per cent of private sector employment in Canada, with good, stable jobs and competitive wages and benefits. They are flexible and nimble in adapting to changing global markets.\nGreens help others see that reducing GHGs, wasted food and pollution is good for us and for business. We can build a vibrant economy and pay our way as we go. We owe it to future generations to conserve cash, communities and nature so they will still have economic capacity.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe Green Party's made-in-Canada plan to address climate change is Mission: Possible.\nOur goal is to reduce GHGs 60 per cent by 2030 and to get to net zero by 2050. This is in line with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and is fully costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. It will be cost effective as we transition to a clean, caring economy with jobs that persist.\u00a0\nWe will retrofit buildings across Canada to be carbon neutral thus creating jobs, reducing heating costs and reducing green house gases. Revenue neutrality will be achieved with a carbon fee and dividend program and all subsidies to fossil fuels will be stopped.\u00a0\nBy 2030, we will rebuild the east-west electricity grid to ensure that renewable energy can be transmitted from one province to another. Replanting forests and incentivizing cover crops will be major thrusts.\nThe Green Party will establish an inner cabinet of all parties, modelled on the war cabinets of Mackenzie King and Winston Churchill.\u00a0 Parties will work together to ensure that climate is no longer treated like a political football. It requires all hands on-deck.\u00a0\nCanada can also use diplomacy to strengthen international climate agreements.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI grew up as a 4-H kid on a farm in Wallenstein, in Wellington Co. There Grampa taught me to respect soil, plants and animals.\u00a0\nAs a truck driver, bus driver, server and farmer, I know the value of a hard-earned dollar and what it means to work to work with my hands.\u00a0\nI have been a Plant Science professor for 29 years \u2013 most recently at the University of Guelph. My 76 scientific papers and 13 book chapters, pertaining to ecology, intercropping, pasture systems, organic agriculture and soil health, help me to see the potential for ecological resilience. Having written my new book on Food Security, I see clearly that farmers and consumers can benefit from incentives to restore soil health and human health, while addressing the climate crisis.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the late 1990s when organic agriculture was still being questioned, I used my sales skills as a pioneer in the organic sector to attract federal funding.\u00a0\nAs the Founding Director of the Organic Agriculture Centre of Canada, I also secured funding from most provinces. Since then sales of organic products in Canada have exceeded $55 billion.\u00a0\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nCost of living, housing affordability and unsustainable growth are recurring topics while canvassing.\u00a0 Students, low income families and seniors alike all share serious concerns with making ends meet while big corporations seem to endlessly benefit from our Government's largess with their money or get a pass on criminality.\u00a0 While the environment we live in is ranking high in priority, caring for our environment doesn't have to be an either/or situation. Students, low income families and seniors alike all share serious concerns with making ends meet.\u00a0 People need to be able to afford to live, without the government enslaving future generations with debt. The cost of living must remain affordable. Our plan to stop corporate bailouts, and reduce the size of Government will reduce the tax burden.\u00a0 Ending supply management will make eggs and milk more affordable by returning open market competition for the consumers' patronage.\u00a0\u00a0\nGrowth adverse Provincial planning policies and unfocused, unsustainable immigration levels collided to become major contributing factors that have driven up housing prices and suppressed wages.\u00a0 Reducing immigration to 150,000 per year will allow supply and demand to be in better balance while bringing Canada more in line with international per capita norms.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThis election has been hijacked by climate change hysteria ahead of affordability, housing, public debt, democratic reform and the economy.\u00a0 There was a time in Canadian politics when bread and butter issues were at the forefront of all debates.\u00a0\nThe People's Party has nonetheless developed a policy platform that will improve affordability.\u00a0 We will eliminate federal income tax for those earning less than $15,000 per year. This policy made so much sense that it has since been copied by all the other Parties.\u00a0 We are going one step further by reducing the next tax bracket for those individuals in the $15,000 to $100,000 to 15%. Everyone earning more than $100,000 will be asked to pay a little more at a flat 25%.\nAbolishing the supply management cartel will also save the average family up to $340 per year for the poorest of families.\nAbolishing capital gains and reducing the corporate income tax rate from 15% to 10% will stimulate investments and growth offering Canadians good paying jobs.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOntario is now paying a high price for leading by example on the perceived threat of global warming.\u00a0 The green energy act has had a very negative effect on energy affordability. Industries have been leaving our jurisdiction taking good paying jobs with them to jurisdictions that have little regard for the environment.\u00a0 It is an example of what not to do, yet we have 4 federal parties soliciting your votes aim to repeat it.\nSolar farms eat up huge amounts of land that can no longer be used to grow crops or sustain wildlife.\u00a0 Industrial wind generation is globally responsible for millions of birds and bats killed every year! Where is the public outrage like we saw with DDT?\u00a0 As we panic to save the planet from carbon dioxide, we are destroying our environment.\nThe People's Party will end virtue signalling carbon taxes, proven ineffective time and again and instead will focus on adaptation and practical solutions.\u00a0 We will support programs that will plant more trees and keep our air, water and soil cleaner. We will build on our progress and invest in infrastructure ensuring every community in Canada has access to clean drinking water.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI grew up in the suburbs of Montreal in an era of separatist sentiments and the divisive language bill 101.\u00a0 Against all odds, this then uni-lingual francophone joined the RCMP in 1990 as a 21 year old impressionable young man. Being given the opportunity to serve Canada and see both sides of the coin has given me a unique perspective that will serve the riding and Canada well.\u00a0\nMy wife and I made Halton Hills our home where we are raising our 6 children.\u00a0 I am currently a self employed businessman running a successful real estate development and leasing company.\u00a0\nI joined the People's Party because it offers the best platform to keep our Country united, strong and free.\u00a0 In that light, we are resolved to take coherent action on difficult issues impacting our National unity such as natural resources development, immigration, equalization, public finances and taxation.\u00a0 Our Country is facing a great number of challenges but solutions can only come by engaging what political correctness falsely labelled as taboo subjects. True leadership doesn't pander to special interest groups that divide; it sells what unifies and is best for all Canadians.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "California entrepreneur defends idea for remote COVID-19 'escape community'", "description": "Public health experts sound alarm about coronavirus retreats popping up in the U.S. ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-the-thursday-edition-1.5519086/california-entrepreneur-defends-idea-for-remote-covid-19-escape-community-1.5519092", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5519889.1585866403!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/1208903029.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 02, 2020 6:13 PM ET", "2020-04-02T22:47:18.644Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Transcripts\nIt's being billed as a \"modern-day escape community\" for people who are tired of being cooped up alone at home during the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt's called \"Haven\" and it's one of several coronavirus retreats that have been popping up in remote U.S. communities, much to the worry of public health officials.\u00a0\nFor a minimum of $750 US a month, people can wait out the pandemic together in an undisclosed Northern California ghost town.\u00a0\nThe website shows dreamy photographs of people having dinner parties, laughing together in a hot tub and doing yoga in groups \u2014 but Haven's\u00a0founder says residents will undergo\u00a0health screenings and abide by physical distancing measures.\nStill, health experts say that if just one person becomes infected, they could easily spread it to the whole group.\n\"There are so many potential risk factors here,\" Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, told tech magazine The Information, which published a feature about the COVID-19 retreat phenomenon.\u00a0\u00a0\nHaven is the brainchild of Jane Dinh, CEO of the travel company Jetters. Here is part of her conversation with\u00a0As It Happens host Carol Off.\nWe keep hearing that the best way to fight COVID-19 is to isolate ourselves, to stay at home. Isn't that good advice?\nIt definitely is, yes.\nDo you agree with it yourself?\nI do. I do. And I also think it's also great to stay home with people you can really connect with as well, whether it's your family or your boyfriend or a roommate. As long as there is social distancing involved as well.\nBut you are planning something quite large, don't you?\nYes, but it is pretty much like a town where everyone has their own cabana or their own cabin as well. So here's social distancing involved in this.\nThese are not with your closest friends. These are with people who will pay to go to this retreat, right?\nIt's actually being spread through, like, friends and friends of friends. So right now, it's like with my community, yes.\nAnd how do you propose to make this work?\nWe actually are working with the town owner for this. So we have, like, one-month minimum stays, and people can actually stay for as long as a year.\u00a0\nSo this isn't considered a trip or a retreat. It's actually a move. And moving residences is actually allowed under the shelter-in-place mandates in California.\nAnd you can rent this entire town?\nYes, because this town is actually normally rented out for retreats and weddings and corporate events.\u00a0\nUsually before, the owner only rented out for events. But this is the first time that she actually wants to use her town for residential purposes.\nHow many people do you propose will join you in this Haven?\nA few dozen.\u00a0\nDo they go back and forth to do their shopping, to get their own groceries?\nOh, no, no, definitely not. So we try to make this as sustainable as possible. So we've already just ordered a bulk order of food. So there's not going to be that many deliveries coming in and out.\u00a0\nWe also do not allow people to come in and out of the town. So, you know, once you get there, you have to stay there for at least a month. And we also don't allow, like, outside residents to come in as well.\nWe have our own garden, too, to produce our own produce. We have 50 chickens and ducks as well.\nYou say that no one be allowed in and people won't be going out. How do you police that? How will you keep your borders safe in this Haven?\nThere's actually only one way into the town, and we also have a security guard monitoring the entrance.\nOnce you're there, you're there?\nYou're there. I mean, you can leave after a month. Or, let's say, like, if you come in and you decide it's not for you, you can leave, of course. But if you leave, you can't come back. So we're not going to hold anyone hostage.\nHow can you be sure that you're not going to have COVID-19 inside your community?\nWe don't market this as, like, a risk-free kind of thing because, you know, there's so many unknowns about COVID-19.\u00a0\nThere's always going to be a chance, but what we can say is that we take as many precautions as you can. So it's a lower risk environment. There's always a chance. But where we have a lot of precautions in place.\nBut you have dozens of people who are going to come to this community, this small place, to live. If you have an outbreak of coronavirus, if you have the virus in your community, who do you turn to? Who's going to have to take care of the people in your community?\nWe actually have enough extra housing to \u2026 quarantine those who have been affected and those who have been in close contact with these people.\nWe have an emergency physician who has offered to give us telemedicine services for anyone who's been affected.\u00a0\nWe also have backup\u00a0oxygen concentrators in case nearby hospitals are overwhelmed.\u00a0\nFor the very serious cases, we are still within driving distance to a hospital nearby.\nBut we know that a large number of people get very sick and need to go to hospital with that. So what burden are you going to place on a rural hospital and community, the neighboring community, if you have an outbreak?\nThe age of our community \u2014 we don't discriminate by age \u2014 but it tends to be people who are more on, like, the millennial side. So it's we're not going to have as many cases as a normal aged population where it's, like, older family.\u00a0\nYou know, it's a myth, right, that this is something that just happens to older people?\nOh definitely. It does happen to anyone at any age.\u00a0\nAre you breaking any laws in California given that you have a shelter-in-place order?\nNo, because the shelter-in-place order actually allows people to still move residences. Since this is a 30-day minimum and you can stay for as long as a year, it's considered a move.\u00a0\nAnd still also require people to practice social distancing as well. You know, you still have to stay six feet apart from each other while shelter in place is, you know, mandated.\nAnd yet, [according to your website], you're going to have \u2026 lively dinners, speakers, workshops, music, meetings, celebrations and games. So how does that social distancing work?\nThe dinners are still, like, social distanced, you know. You'll still be far apart. And any workshops will also be, like, social distanced as well.\nAnd we limit the amount of people.\u00a0\n[Editor's Note: After the interview Dinh clarified that Haven won't host any events until after shelter-in-place orders have been lifted, and that her website will be updated soon with more information.]\nDo you think that people might regard this as a kind of a something that's a privilege reserved for the wealthy to be able to isolate themselves in a haven like this?\nI think definitely they could see it if they don't know the pricing beforehand. But even if the price is too high for someone, we can still work with them, because we definitely don't want someone\u00a0 \u2026 to\u00a0really want to join if they're a good fit for a community and they can't because of costs.\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear and Jeanne Armstrong.

His death angered some accusers who had hoped to confront him in court and see him serve a long prison sentence.\nIt also raises questions about how he was able to harm himself while in federal custody.\nEpstein was accused of paying underage girls hundreds of dollars in cash for massages and then sexually abusing them at various locations, including homes in Palm Beach, Florida, and in New York from 2002 through 2005. He had pleaded not guilty.\nHere's a look at Epstein's case and what comes next:\nEpstein, 66, was a hedge fund manager who hobnobbed with the rich, famous and influential, including presidents and a prince.\nEpstein owned a private island in the Caribbean, homes in Paris and New York City, a New Mexico ranch, and a fleet of high-price cars. His friends had once included Britain's Prince Andrew, former U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S. President Donald Trump. Clinton and Trump both said they hadn't seen Epstein in years and knew nothing of his alleged misconduct when new charges were brought against him last month.\nUnder a 2008 non-prosecution agreement, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution involving a minor and another similar prostitution charge. That allowed him to avoid federal prosecution and a possible life sentence.\nInstead he served\u00a013 months in a work-release program. He was required to make payments to victims and register as a sex offender.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Prisons said Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center early Saturday.\nStaff tried to revive him, and he was transported to a local hospital for treatment. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.\nEpstein had been held in the jail's Special Housing Unit, a heavily secured part of the facility that separates high-profile inmates from the general population, but his death is likely to raise questions about how the Federal Bureau of Prisons ensures the welfare of high-profile inmates.\nAttorney General William Barr said he was \"appalled\" by the news of the suicide.\nBefore he took his own life, Epstein has been taken off suicide watch, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press. The person wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nEpstein had previously been found\u00a0with bruises to the neck while in custody, though it was not clear if those were self-inflicted or the result of an assault.\nThe FBI and the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Justice will investigate his death.\nFederal prosecutors in New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy after investigative reporting by The Miami Herald stirred outrage over the 2008 plea bargain. They accused him of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls.\nA conviction could have put him in prison for 45 years.\nAt the time of Epstein's arrest, prosecutors said they found a trove of pictures of nude and seminude young women and girls at his $77-million Manhattan mansion. They also say additional victims have come forward since the arrest.\nBut his attorneys insisted that Epstein hadn't had any illicit contact with underage girls since serving his sentence in Florida. They argued that the new charges were improper because they covered largely the same ground as the non-prosecution agreement.\nSeveral of Epstein's victims said Saturday that they're disappointed that the financier won't have to face them in court or serve a long prison sentence if convicted. They called on federal authorities to investigate associates of Epstein for any role in his activities.\nSigrid McCawley, an attorney representing one accuser, said in a statement that \"the reckoning of accountability begun by the voices of brave and truthful victims should not end\" with Epstein's death.\nAnother accuser, Jennifer Araoz, who came forward after the new charges were filed, said she was angered by Epstein's suicide. Araoz alleged that Epstein raped her in his New York mansion in the early 2000s when she was 15.\n\"We have to live with the scars of his actions for the rest of our lives, while he will never face the consequences of the crimes he committed the pain and trauma he caused so many people,\" she said.\n"}, {"author": "John Paul Tasker", "title": "Liberals ask voters to 'choose forward' while Tories vow to help Canadians 'get ahead' in new campaign ads", "description": "Liberals, Tories launch TV ad campaigns ahead of Oct. 21 vote, NDP expected to follow next week", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-tory-campaign-slogans-ad-1.5259889", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5260009.1566834827!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/campaign-ads.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 26, 2019 1:16 PM ET", "2019-08-26T17:33:41.194Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Conservative and Liberal teams have launched television ad campaigns ahead of October's federal election with a shared focus\u00a0on offering to make everyday life more affordable for Canadians.\nThe Liberal campaign slogan is\u00a0\"Choose Forward,\" while the Conservatives have gone with \"It's time for you to get ahead.\"\nThe NDP is expected to launch a slogan and TV ad campaign next week; a party spokesperson said the slogan will tell voters that the NDP is the only party that\u00a0\"will put people and their interests first.\" The Greens' slogan is\u00a0\"Not left. Not right. Forward together.\" The populist People's Party is going with \"Strong and free.\"\nJustin Trudeau is featured prominently in the Liberal ad, which shows the leader meeting with constituents in his diverse Montreal-area Papineau riding.\nOther shots show Trudeau riding public transit while speaking directly to camera about his government's accomplishments to date, specifically the \"middle class\" tax cut and an enhanced Canada Child Benefit for parents with young kids. He defends the government's climate plan \u2014 which includes a national carbon tax imposed on jurisdictions that don't have a plan of their own\u00a0\u2014 as the best way to fight an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.\nTrudeau\u00a0doesn't mention by name his main opponent, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, but rather invokes former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper's legacy and takes a thinly veiled jab at Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford.\n\"I got into politics to help people like the people I've served here in Papineau for more than a decade, people who work hard to make ends meet, parents who want to build a better life for their kids, Canadians who want our country to stand for something positive in a world that's grown darker,\" Trudeau said.\n\"The Conservatives like to say they're 'for the people,' but then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else,\" Trudeau said, citing Ford's campaign slogan during the spring 2018 provincial election and a series of budgetary manoeuvres the Ford government has made to reduce a sizeable deficit in the country's largest province.\n\"In October we've got a choice to make \u2014 keep moving forward and build on the progress we've made, or go back to the politics of the Harper years. I'm for moving forward, for everyone,\" Trudeau said.\nAccording to the party, the ad is now airing on both conventional\u00a0television and digital platforms.\nTrudeau is expected to call an election sometime after Labour Day. Under federal fixed election date legislation, the vote must be held sometime on or before Oct. 21.\nThe Liberal slogan, Choose Forward, is similar to other Liberal campaign catchphrases from elections past\u00a0\u2014 especially to those deployed by governments trying to win re-election.\nIn the 2004 federal election campaign, Liberals opted for \"Moving Canada forward.\" The Ontario Liberals promised voters they were \"Moving forward, together\" in 2007 and then, in 2001, \"Forward. Together.\" (Former U.S. president Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign had a one-word slogan: \"Forward.\")\nThe Conservative ad features Scheer, dressed casually in a blue Oxford shirt,\u00a0speaking directly to camera and extolling the virtues of his plan to reduce taxes for Canadians.\nWhile he doesn't mention the carbon tax by name in the ad, Scheer\u00a0has said that one of his first\u00a0priorities in the event his party forms a government in the next Parliament would be to end the tax.\nScheer\u00a0also has promised to maintain the Liberals' enhanced Canada Child Benefit while introducing a new non-refundable tax credit that would make federal Employment Insurance (EI)\u00a0maternity and parental benefits tax-free. Under that plan, a person earning a salary of $50,000, who then goes on EI benefits after a birth, would save about $4,000.\n\"My plan for Canadians? Lower the cost of living and leave more money in your pockets,\" Scheer said. \"I believe Canadians across the country are so frustrated because they're working so hard and they're following all the rules, but they feel like they're falling further and further behind, or they're barely getting by.\n\"I have a plan to lower the cost of living to make life more affordable, to leave more money in the pockets of Canadians for their kids, for themselves or for your aging parents, because it's time for you to get ahead.\"\nScheer has said the Conservative campaign will be focused principally on affordability.\nWhen asked how he will appeal to young voters, Scheer\u00a0has said the Conservative Party has a plan to make the country's housing stock more affordable for millennial voters \u2014 many of whom are struggling to buy something in a time of sky-high real estate prices.\nA Conservative Party press release sent to reporters Monday said the campaign slogan reflects Scheer's positive conservative vision: \"A government that lives within its means and puts more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.\"\n\"We've seen who gets ahead under Trudeau. It's billion-dollar companies with high-priced lobbyists like Loblaws who get generous handouts from hard-working taxpayers. It's long-time corporate donors to the Liberal Party like SNC-Lavalin, who Trudeau broke the law trying to protect from criminal prosecution,\" Scheer said of the ad.\n\"Justin Trudeau has spent the last four years helping his political insiders get ahead. I think it's time for you to get ahead.\"\nThis isn't the first campaign-style ad to come\u00a0from the Conservative Party during the pre-campaign period. Over the spring and summer months, the party rolled out a series of attack ads targeted at Trudeau that say he simply isn't \"as advertised.\"\nDennis Matthews\u00a0is\u00a0a vice-president of marketing and communications at Enterprise\u00a0and a veteran campaign staffer who helped design ads for past Harper and Ford campaigns. He\u00a0said getting a slogan exactly right is hugely important to a campaign.\n\"A lot of work goes into crafting these slogans. There's a ton\u00a0of market research and focus groups. In the end they're to distil down the entire campaign. Every ad, every event, every speech, every press release, it all kind of boils down to your campaign slogan. It's something you really want rattling around in voter's heads when they're going in the ballot box,\" he said in an interview with CBC News Network.\n\"They're the embodiment of the entire campaign message for a team.

As well, under the current model, those in high-value areas like downtown pay much more than those on the outskirts of the city.\n\"Our commercial streets are bleeding, and we have to stop the hemorrhaging because\u00a0otherwise, we might be putting a lot more effort and a lot more money to get back to a normal situation,\" he said.\nBut taxes aren't the only problem. Corporate landlords can afford to buy up bushels of buildings in an area, raise the rent and then wait for the next big franchise to move in. People like Usher can't afford to leave her commercial space\u00a0empty for months, so she charges less rent to keep her storefront occupied.\nHer tenant, Robert Sutcliffe, said he searched the neighbourhood for four months for an affordable place to open Art et Son, a shop specializing in retro home stereo systems.\nThe vacant commercial spaces owned by corporate landlords\u00a0would have cost him thousands more, so he felt lucky to discover Usher's storefront.\n\"This one fit the bill perfectly for what I was looking for,\" he said. Still, he'd\u00a0like to see fewer vacancies on the street to attract more shoppers to the area.\nUsher is among those calling on the city to levy fines against landlords who leave commercial space empty.\nShe said those fines should be aimed at landlords\u00a0who have raised the rent more than 50 per cent\u00a0and have left a\u00a0space vacant for more than six months.\nMontreal architect Ron Rayside would also like to see landlords penalized for failing to fill vacancies because, he told the city commission, lowering\u00a0rents is a sure way to attract a tenant.\u00a0\nRayside, who owns a\u00a0couple of retail spaces himself, is a partner in a firm located on a commercial strip on Ontario Street East.\u00a0\nHe's always managed to keep his commercial space filled by keeping rents\u00a0low, he said. Once he even dropped the rent\u00a0down to a mere $100 per month, offering a local artist a short-term lease to help him get\u00a0his business off the ground.\nThe deal ensured the unit was maintained, secure and not just another vacancy in Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, he said.\nThere are creative ways like that to keep retail space occupied if landlords are motivated to do so, Rayside said. And it might take penalties to create that motivation.\u00a0\nBut the city needs to do its part, as well, he said. He suggested more flexible zoning regulations that would allow property owners to be more creative with their properties.\nThe Montreal youth council made a similar suggestion, saying it would like to see empty storefronts put to use with temporary occupation permits.\n\"You could even have other, non-residential uses that are not commercial, per se, even temporary spaces \u2014 whether it be for artists or other uses,\" Rayside said.\n\"Once we decide from a social point of view and a commercial and city point of view\u00a0that vacant commercial spaces are really bad for the commercial artery or bad for the dynamic of a neighbourhood, then there are all kinds of different ways to solve it.\"\n"}, {"author": "Dan Taekema", "title": "What will the federal election hold for Hamilton?

Will\u00a0Hamilton East-Stoney Creek MP Bob Bratina\u00a0pay any kind of price for alienating the steelworkers' union, a group he's sought to represent through the all-party steel caucus?\nIt's tough to say\u00a0what the campaign will focus on as the countdown\u00a0to Canada's 43rd\u00a0general\u00a0election on Oct. 21 begins.\nPeter Graefe, a political science professor at McMaster University, said some have predicted it will be messy and include \"personality attacks.\" Still, the parties have put some policies on the table and the professor said issues around rising housing costs, employment and benefits could come into play for Hamilton.\nOne issue that doesn't seem to be on any party's radar, but nevertheless is sure to have large and lasting repercussions for Hamilton, is industrial policy, he added.\n\"It isn't sexy,\" Graefe said with a laugh. \"We continue to be a major manufacturing centre, but one that's facing all kinds of competition, and there seems to be no collective plan from the federal government \u2026 about how we could do better at it.\"\nThe city has seen a flurry of visits from federal party leaders in recent months, with Trudeau, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and NDP\u00a0leader Jagmeet Singh all stopping in\u00a0Hamilton on\u00a0Labour Day.\nEach of the three major parties are currently represented in Hamilton's five electoral districts. One seat is held\u00a0by the Conservatives, while the Liberals and NDP each claim two\u00a0apiece.\nBut that could change this time around, said the professor, with\u00a0tight races expected across the region.\n\"[For] all the parties, if they're counting every seat this time, there's a number in Hamilton which may be in play for them.\"\nThis riding\u00a0makes up the hear of Hamilton's\u00a0federal electoral districts and has been an NDP stronghold since it was created in 2003.\nFor all that time, the seat has been held by David Christopherson, a member of parliament known for his thundering oration and staying power. But Christopherson announced back in July that he's retiring, raising an interesting question: Will the NDP be able to make sure the seat stays orange?\nMatthew Green certainly hopes so.

It also would raise corporate taxes, end fossil fuel subsidies, close tax loopholes and levy a foreign home buyers tax.\nBut another NDP\u00a0platform promise does have a price tag.\nThe Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO)\u00a0just released a cost analysis of the party's proposal to cut interest from current and future student loans.\u00a0\nThe report shows that plan would cost $432\u00a0million in 2020-2021\u00a0and\u00a0would gradually increase to $598 million\u00a0nearly a decade later.\nThe NDP\u00a0are the first party this year\u00a0to have a platform piece costed and the report released to the public.\u00a0\nThe PBO\u00a0can be used to cost out any campaign proposals during the 2019 campaign, and the subsequent reports will be published as the promises\u00a0are announced by the parties.\nSingh said as of this weekend 205 candidates would officially be nominated, with more announcements coming early next week bumping the number over 300. That\u00a0still leaves\u00a0a\u00a0gap to fill\u00a0before the campaign officially begins sometime this week.\u00a0\nThe leader's defence of the slow timeline has been that it takes longer to convince the diverse candidates the NDP is\u00a0courting \u2014 like Indigenous leaders and women\u00a0\u2014 to run for office.\u00a0\nAt least one prospective NDP candidate, Sid Ryan, dropped his bid for nomination citing a sluggish\u00a0process that wouldn't leave him enough time to run a proper campaign.\nSingh has said he hopes 50 per cent of his candidates are women.\u00a0All the other\u00a0parties have nominated candidates in more ridings than Singh's team.\nThe NDP is\u00a0currently straggling behind the Liberals and Conservatives in the polls, registering only 13.4 per cent nationally, with the Greens hot on their heels at 10.6 per cent.\nThey're also struggling to fill their coffers.\u00a0Elections Canada posted the party's annual financial return online on Thursday, showing the NDP finished last year with assets worth $4.7 million and liabilities totalling $9.2 million, leaving the party $4.5 million in the hole \u2014 a low the party hasn't seen in\u00a0at least 17 years.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Aaron Wherry", "title": "With Singh's environment plan, the left-centre climate change bidding war begins", "description": "It's aspirational and unclear \u2014 and it's designed to keep the Greens at bay while boxing in the Liberals", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jagmeet-singh-climate-change-green-party-1.5157591", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5158425.1559338932!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ndp-singh-environment-20190531.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 01, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-06-01T18:07:24.845Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "R.B. Bennett might have warned Jagmeet\u00a0Singh against framing the NDP's climate plan the way he\u00a0did\u00a0Friday morning.\n\"I've been inspired by people who want to bring a green new deal to Canada,\" the NDP leader said.\u00a0\"Canadians need and want a new deal.\"\nAnd so, Singh released what the NDP is calling a \"new deal for climate action and good jobs\" \u2014 a sprawling (but still somewhat notional)\u00a0agenda for preserving the planet.\nIn January 1935, having struggled to respond to the Great Depression, Prime Minister Bennett announced a series of social welfare reforms and economic interventions that resembled the \"New Deal\" that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had started implementing two years earlier.\nBennett never himself referred to his plan as a \"new deal,\" but critics applied the tag derisively and the name stuck.\u00a0Bennett's \"new deal\" is remembered now as a belated pivot that came much too late to save a doomed prime minister.\nLast year, two American Democrats\u00a0\u2014 one of them\u00a0the popular and charismatic congresswoman\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 introduced what they referred as to as the \"Green New Deal,\" a sweeping (but vague) plan for government intervention to deal with the global emergency of climate change. The basic idea of a Rooseveltian response proved interesting enough that some\u00a0Canadian progressives began to agitate for something similar.\nWhat Singh brought forward on Friday was an attempt to capture a similar sense of\u00a0excitement\u00a0\u2014 a feeling that has been lacking around Singh since he became leader of the NDP in October 2017. It's also another move in the progressive bidding war on climate action \u2014 with Singh now needing to fend off\u00a0the Greens to hold third place.\nTwo weeks ago, Elizabeth May's Green Party\u00a0announced that it would aim to cut Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, without quite explaining how they would do that. Singh's New Democrats\u00a0aren't yet committing to a specific target, though they do say that they would set a target that is\u00a0\"in line with stabilizing the global temperature increase at 1.5 degrees Celsius.\" That, they figure, would mean a reduction of somewhere between 40 per cent and 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.\nHow would a Singh government get there? It's not entirely clear. The NDP plan\u00a0does spend several pages throwing out an array of ideas that New Democrats claim would result in an emissions cut of 38 per cent. But they aren't showing their math yet.\nLike the American version, Singh's new deal speaks more about investment and jobs than restrictions and regulation. There's a section on training and income support, with a focus on workers in \"carbon-intensive industries.\"\nThe current federal framework includes commitments to increase energy efficiency and retrofit buildings.\u00a0But Singh sets a target to\u00a0retrofit all housing stock in Canada by 2050. Meanwhile, a \"climate bank\" would be established to \"spur investment in the low carbon economy.\"\nA \"Climate Accountability Office\" would be established to track and report on the government's progress. Like the Liberals, the NDP would act to advance\u00a0the adoption of electric and zero-emission vehicles.\u00a0The total budget for all measures in the platform document\u00a0is pegged at $15 billion over four years.\nWhile vowing to be bolder than Justin Trudeau's government, Singh's New Democrats say they will leave the federal carbon price as it is. Apparently they've\u00a0seen how hard it is for the Liberals to sell the current price and decided against trying to win support for an even higher rate.\nWhat they would change, slightly, is the way large, trade-exposed industries are handled. The Liberals have adopted an \"output-based pricing system\" for such emitters, modelled after a similar system introduced in Alberta by Rachel\u00a0Notley's\u00a0NDP\u00a0government. In the word of the federal NDP, a Singh government would be committed to \"rolling back the breaks the Liberals have given to big polluters.\"\nThe output-based system is a\u00a0little more complicated than that.\nThe\u00a0two-part industrial system\u00a0involves a carbon levy and a subsidy, with the subsidy linked to the average emissions intensity in a given sector. The Liberals originally proposed that emitters would receive a subsidy that covered 70 per cent of the average. After consulting with industry, the Liberals set thresholds at 80 per cent or 90 per cent of the average. If a firm emits less than that, it receives a credit that it can sell to a firm that emits above that mark.\nThe NDP isn't proposing to eliminate the system. Rather, they say they want to set the subsidy thresholds back at 70 per cent.\nThe system is meant to ensure companies that compete internationally don't simply relocate their emissions-producing activities to countries with lower standards. But both the Conservatives and New Democrats have criticized that approach as a special concession. Now, the NDP is suggesting it plans on \"rolling back the breaks the Liberals have given to big polluters\"\u00a0\u2014 which could have some economic impact.\nOther promises in the NDP plan seem more wishful.\u00a0A commitment to promote free public transit is cast as both conditional and aspirational: \"For provinces and municipalities that identify it as a priority, we will help them build towards fare-free transit.\"\nA Singh government would also \"use the powers of the federal government to ensure that the provinces set and meet interim emissions reduction targets in the lead up to 2030 and 2050.\"\nApparently undaunted by the Trudeau government's toil and trouble over the last four years to get the provinces to accept a common policy approach, a Singh government would aim to negotiate and enforce targets for each province. Members of the Ottawa press gallery would at least be happy to have a few more fractious first ministers' conferences to cover.\nThe New Democrats have five months to fill in more details on what they would do and how they would do it, but this new list of commitments does at least present a challenge for the Liberals. For the past two years, they've had to defend themselves from Conservative complaints that they were doing too much. The NDP and the Greens now will hit them from the other side, arguing that they should do more.\nAt the moment, the greater threat for the Liberals is still from the Conservatives. But Singh might now have a rallying cry, however unoriginal, to apply a little pressure of his own.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Get informed on the top stories of the day in one quick scan", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/morning-brief-march-26-2020-1.5509191", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 26, 2020 6:48 AM ET", "2020-03-26T10:48:40.428Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Good morning!

Her sister told her there were only two people working on her 96-year-old father's floor. Some aides were in isolation, at home with suspected cases of the novel coronavirus. And replacements were scared to come to the facility.  Residents were isolated in their rooms. Harlow estimates there must be about 45 units on the floor, each housing a patient. Many had complex problems. Catheters. Colostomy bags. Nearly all were wearing adult diapers.  A nurse arrived, meaning that three employees were now tending to a floor that would normally require at least twice that many workers,\u00a0Harlow said. The families pitched in to deliver meals and tend to patient needs.  \"Several patients, they were bedridden with a wet, wet diaper and calling out incessantly for help,\" said Harlow. \"It was just \u2014 it was mayhem.\"  The outbreak exposed weaknesses in the system, but what has happened at the Lynn Valley Care Centre is also a tale of a community's response to a tragedy;\u00a0of a home to many of the North Shore's oldest residents, now transformed into the face of the pandemic in Canada; of children and adults determined to support seniors isolated by the threat of death.gary law professor. \"It means that we may be creating barriers to victims.\" Read more on this story here.\n(Ina Fassbender/AFP/Getty Images)\nBen Zwiehoff,\u00a0a member of the German national mountain biking team training for the Olympics,\u00a0works on his balance on his bike in his apartment\u00a0as he practices social distancing\u00a0due to the spread of the novel coronavirus in Essen, Germany.\nCanadian airlines are telling grounded passengers without travel insurance they won't be getting a refund for flights cancelled because of COVID-19 \u2014 only travel credits.\u00a0A group of 43 people that were to go to the Dominican Republic for a wedding on March 25 is out about $80,000, said bride-to-be Jillian Wilson of Stratford, Ont.

The community benefits section of the deal, drafted without community input, makes up just one page of the 34-page deal.\nCritics have lamented the lack of firm targets for money toward affordable housing or jobs for people living in the community.\u00a0\nIt's still early days for the arena deal, Scherer\u00a0said, and its full merit and faults are yet to be seen.\u00a0\n\"Anyone who is going to say this is an immediate success story is being a bit premature.\"\n"}, {"author": "Nicole Brockbank", "title": "Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan had shares in company that runs controversial U.S. migrant detention centres", "description": "Alberta Crown corporation owns about $4.8M in shares in for-profit prison companies", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/teacher-pension-plan-invested-private-prison-company-1.5206796", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5207492.1562795943!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/450371247.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 11, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-07-11T18:48:18.187Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A few months after the Canada Pension Plan made headlines for investing in private U.S. prison companies that run immigration detention centres, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (OTPPB)\u00a0bought shares\u00a0in one of those same companies.\nGeo Group Inc. has come\u00a0under fire from authorities for improper segregation of immigrants and inadequate medical care in some of its facilities.\nThe teachers' pension plan bought more than 20,000 shares in GEO Group Inc. \u2014\u00a0worth just over half a million dollars \u2014\u00a0in the first quarter of this year, according to records at the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0Securities and\u00a0Exchange Commission.\u00a0\nBefore that, the pension plan had no shares in the Florida-based company, which owns or operates more than 130 prisons, immigration detention centres and community re-entry facilities.\u00a0\nWhen initially contacted\u00a0for comment on this\u00a0story, the OTPPB\u00a0declined an interview, but said in an email\u00a0\"that for competitive reasons, we do not disclose information on assets and holdings under $150 million.\"\nNow, the OTPPB\u00a0has told CBC News\u00a0it did have shares in the for-profit prison company, but divested them in early April.\u00a0\n\"We often trade in and out of companies that are part of major stock indexes,\" said\u00a0spokesperson Lisa Papas. \"We regret holding exposure to this stock.... Our members care deeply about human rights, and we are committed to investing responsibly.\"\nAn\u00a0inspection of one of GEO Group's\u00a0immigration detention facilities in Adelanto, Calif., last year found nooses in detainee cells, improper and overly restrictive segregation and inadequate medical care, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\nAt another GEO Group facility in Aurora, Colo.,\u00a0detainees were not allowed visits from friends or families, even though there was room for them to do so, according to the same report.\u00a0\nThe human rights organization Amnesty International is \"very concerned\" by those reports\u00a0said Justin Mohammed, its human rights law and policy campaigner in Canada.\u00a0\nHe suggested the pension plan should \"ask questions\" and\u00a0\"ensure that their investments are being done in a manner that is responsible.\"\n\"Considering that they are teachers and we're talking about some violations that may relate to young people, certainly we'd think that teachers would have a particular concern about the human rights of children,\" said Mohammed.\nThe teachers' pension plan isn't the only Canadian institution to have invested in GEO Group. In October, the Guardian reported that the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board owned more than $10 million in shares, total, in both GEO Group and another private prison operator,\u00a0CoreCivic Inc.\u00a0\nSince then the public pension fund for retired Canadians has sold all of its shares in the two companies, but another public institution has kept its stock.\nThe Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), which manages many public sector pensions and other government funds, has shares in both GEO Group and CoreCivic worth a total of about $4.8 million, as of March 31, according to its filings.\u00a0\nAIMCo\u00a0declined to comment for this story, saying in an email it \"does not discuss specific holdings within our portfolios.\"\nSo how exactly do institutions, like pension funds, choose what to invest in? \u00a0\nThe traditional approach would be to just consider a company's financial statements. But experts say responsible investing has entered the mainstream, which sees many institutional investors consider the environmental, social and governance factors of a company before buying shares.\u00a0\nBoth the OTPPB and AIMCo have committed to responsible investing by signing the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investment, which calls on investors to consider factors including the environment and social issues.\u00a0\nResponsible investing is\u00a0\"about considering things like human rights abuses,\" said Dustyn Lanz, CEO of the Toronto-based\u00a0Responsible Investment Association.\n\"If that's happening in the supply chain that could actually impact the share price of that company due to headline risk over the long term.\"\u00a0\nLanz says considering social and environmental factors is a necessary component of responsible investing \u2014 it doesn't mean that ethical reasons for not investing always win the day.\nTessa Hebb, with Carleton University's Centre for Community Innovation, agrees.\u00a0\nIt's a \"risk-return kind of equation,\" Hebb told CBC News. \"The primary driver for the investor is to reduce risk in their portfolio.\"\nBoth also say another part of responsible investing can involve\u00a0engaging with a company as a shareholder and pushing it to improve its standards, instead of divesting one's shares when the company gets into some sort of trouble.\n\"Selling your security to someone else who maybe doesn't care as much \u2026 that's not necessarily going to have any effect at all on the company,\" said Lanz.\u00a0\nIn that vein, late last year a shareholder of GEO Group tried to push the company to adopt a policy that would make sure it doesn't house\u00a0children or parents who are\u00a0separated during immigration proceedings.\nThe company opposed the resolution, denying it was housing children separated from parents, but also arguing it might enter contracts to house separated children in the future as part of \"its ordinary business operations.\"\nDespite opposing the resolution, GEO Group told CBC News in a statement that its facilities\u00a0\"have not and do not house unaccompanied minors including those who may have been separated from their parents or legal guardians, nor will they in the future.\"\n"}, {"author": "Kathleen Harris", "title": "Green Party platform aims to transition economy, protect consumers, promote tax fairness", "description": "Leader Elizabeth May says full costing of election promises to come within a week", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/green-party-platform-2019-1.5284872", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5285462.1568923292!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/green-party-leader-elizabeth-may-reveals-platform-in-toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 16, 2019 9:39 AM ET", "2019-09-16T21:02:43.322Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Green Party of Canada today released a campaign platform promising to\u00a0tackle climate change by transitioning Canada to a green economy\u00a0while also lifting Canadians out of poverty, abolishing tuition fees and bringing in national pharmacare.\nCentral to the Green plan are measures to address the \"climate emergency\"\u00a0\u2014 a 20-step action plan called Mission: Possible that has been released already.\u00a0The platform says a Green government would pass\u00a0into law a Climate Change Act that would require a 60-per-cent cut in emissions below 2005 levels by 2030, doubling the current 30 per cent target,\nThe platform offers a vision of a Canada in 2030\u00a0where homes and businesses are all powered by renewable energy, all new vehicles and public transit and passenger ferries\u00a0are electric and most food is locally sourced.\n\"It's an exciting time to be alive because we actually can do all these things, but not with business as usual,\" Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said during the platform launch event in Toronto.\nMay said the full\u00a0budget and costing analysis for the platform will not be available until later this week because the Parliamentary Budget Officer is still \"crunching the numbers\" and the reporting must be translated.\nSerge Buy, chief executive officer of the Canadian Ferry Association, said making all passenger ferries electric or hybrid would cost at least $10 billion.\n\"I'm not entirely sure where the money is coming from,\" he said. \"We are certainly concerned by statements like these which have not been developed in consultation with industry and even without any request for information from the industry.\"\nSome of the initiatives would be financed by boosting the\u00a0federal corporate tax rate to 21 per cent from the current 15 per cent. The current level of taxation for small businesses would remain the same.\nCalling her party's platform\u00a0\"comprehensive,\" May also is proposing\u00a0more affordable housing, electoral reform, improved Indigenous relations,\u00a0a single-payer, universal pharmacare system and dental care for low-income Canadians.\nThe Green Party also would eliminate fossil fuel subsidies worth several billion dollars annually, including those for liquefied natural gas (LNG), oil and gas projects and\u00a0coal mining exploration and development.\nMay said that, despite a promise to eliminate federal subsidies a decade ago, they have actually expanded for fracking and LNG development.\u00a0Under then-prime minister Stephen Harper, Canada was among the G20 countries that promised to phase out \"inefficient\" fossil fuel subsidies in 2009.\nA\u00a0Green government would halt all fossil fuel subsidies in its first year in office, she said.\nMay said that while she believes she is the best person to serve as prime minister, she conceded that prospect is unlikely.\nShe urged more parliamentary cooperation to accomplish real results and said she is not in the game for credit or to defeat the NDP.\n\"Overtaking the NDP isn't a goal. Ensuring we have good government and a strong Parliament is our goal,\" she said.\nThe CBC's latest Poll Tracker, which\u00a0aggregates all publicly available polling data, shows the Green Party now with 9.9 per cent support, with the NDP at 13.7 per cent.\nThe platform also promises to work with the provinces to establish a universal Guaranteed Livable Income (GLI) program to replace various other income supports such as disability payments, social assistance and income supplements for seniors.\nUniversity of British Columbia economist Kevin Milligan said the Green platform offers some \"visionary\" but costly ideas.\n\"They may be worthy policy proposals, but they will be expensive,\" he said.\nHe pointed to a means-tested guaranteed basic\u00a0income program\u00a0costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office\u00a0last year, which came with an annual price tag\u00a0of at least $76 billion.\n\"The Green platform commits to a guaranteed livable income\u00a0that would even more generous \u2014 no means testing,\" Milligan said in an email. \"We haven't seen a costing for this. The Greens are trying to offer both visionary policy and budgetary prudence, but I think they will struggle to deliver both.\"\nThere are also proposals in the platform\u00a0to protect consumers \u2014 including 'Right to Repair' legislation that would require manufacturers to provide consumers or repair shops with replacement parts,\u00a0software and tools for diagnosing, maintaining or repairing their products, for a fair price. It would also require them to\u00a0reset any electronic security that may disable the device during diagnosis, maintenance or repair.\n\"Setting product and service standards for consumer protection are well within the purview of government. A Green government will drop the hands-off approach. It's time to intervene,\" the platform reads.\nOther consumer protection measures in the platform\u00a0include:\nThe Green platform also promises to establish a Federal Tax Commission to analyze the tax system for fairness and accessibility\u00a0and says the federal tax system under a Green government would be based on the principle of \"progressive taxation.\"\u00a0The plan also includes a vow to find\u00a0a way to tax cryptocurrencies.\nThe platform also would introduce\u00a0a\u00a0corporate tax on transnational e-commerce companies doing business in Canada, requiring them to\u00a0register, collect and remit taxes.\n\"The e-commerce sector,\u00a0giants like Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, Google\u00a0and Uber, command a significant share of the Canadian market but pay virtually no tax,\" the platform reads.\nThe Green Party is also promising to amend the law on medical assistance in dying to ensure \"everyone has the choice of dying with dignity.\" It proposes giving every Canadian\u00a0the right to a \"living will\" allowing them to limit or refuse medical intervention and treatment.\nThe plan also offers $10 billion in post-secondary and trade school support and offers free tuition for all Canadian college and university students.\nAccording to the platform, the abolition of tuition fees would be financed by redirecting existing spending on bursaries and\u00a0tuition tax credits, savings from administering the student loan system, and the hundreds of millions of dollars in student loan defaults written off every year.\nOther measures in the platform include:\n\"Within the federal civil service, workers are still bullied by supervisors and redress is illusory,\" the platform reads.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Hong Kong protesters

"Following a day of sit-ins, tear gas and clashes with police, Hong Kong students and civil rights activists vowed Wednesday to keep protesting a proposed extradition bill that has become a lightning rod for concerns over greater Chinese control and erosion of civil liberties in the former British colony.\nThe violence marked a major escalation of the biggest political crisis in years for the semi-autonomous Chinese territory and forced the delay of legislative debate on the contentious bill.\nCollege student Louis Wong said he considered the blockade of government headquarters and the Legislative Council a success, because it appeared to prevent Beijing loyalists from advancing amendments to a pair of laws that would make it easier to send suspected criminals to China.\n\"This is a public space and the police have no right to block us from staying here,\" Wong said, surveying a garbage-strewn intersection in the Admiralty neighbourhood that had been blocked off by security forces after protesters broke through a police cordon and entered the government complex.\n\"We'll stay until the government drops this law and [Chinese President] Xi Jinping gives up on trying to turn Hong Kong into just another city in China like Beijing and Shanghai,\" he said.\nPolice Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung told reporters that officers used batons, pepper spray, beanbag rounds, rubber bullets, water hoses and tear gas against the demonstrators, taking action\u00a0after a group of masked protesters charged onto the roads in the\u00a0Admiralty district and started throwing objects, including metal barriers.\nLo\u00a0called the situation a riot, and said \"a\u00a0very dangerous action that could kill someone.\" He also said several people, including some officers, had been injured, and he urged protesters to return home.\nThe Hong Kong Hospital Authority said at least\u00a072 people were taken to hospitals from the protests, two in serious condition.\u00a0\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada is\u00a0following the proposal closely and is concerned about the effect it\u00a0could have on a large number of Canadian citizens in Hong Kong, as well as business confidence and Hong Kong's international reputation.\u00a0\nShe urged the Hong Kong government to \"listen to its people and its many friends around the world\" before\u00a0making any changes to the bill.\u00a0\nAmnesty International has condemned what it called excessive force by Hong Kong police against largely peaceful protesters demonstrating against a proposed extradition bill, saying it violates international law and is likely to lead to worsening violence.\nThe protesters overflowed onto a major downtown road as they overturned barriers and tussled with police outside the building\u00a0that also houses the chambers where the legislature was to discuss the bill, which would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent for trial in mainland China.\nWatch as police attend to an injured protester:\nMartin Lee, a lawyer, pro-democracy activist and the founding chair of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong's chief executive has a \"cold, cold heart\" for not considering the message from demonstrators of last weekend's massive protest against the proposed extradition law.\n\"I'm afraid our chief executive Carrie Lam has completely polarized our society. She has broken so many hearts today. These are young people in their teens, fighting for democracy and defending Hong Kong and hoping to stop Hong Kong from turning from an international financial centre into another Chinese city,\" Lee told CBC News.\nHe said people in the former British colony don't trust the courts or prisons in mainland China, and neither should the roughly 300,000 Canadians who are working and living in Hong Kong.\n\"The moment you are transferred [as a suspect] to mainland China, they make you confess before a TV camera. We have seen too much of this,\" Lee said.\nThe U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong said American citizens should avoid areas of Hong Kong where\u00a0protests are being held, \"exercise caution\" and \"keep a low profile.\"\u00a0The violence has prompted the Canadian government to update\u00a0its\u00a0travel advisory\u00a0for Hong Kong, acknowledging the demonstrations and advising travellers to \"exercise caution.\"\nCBC's Sa\u0161a Petricic, who\u00a0was in the streets of Hong Kong,\u00a0said the legislature was ringed with protesters, who had massed outside the government building overnight Tuesday and began pressing against\u00a0the police early Wednesday.\n\"There was union support and at least one instance of a bus driver who just simply parked his bus crossways on one of the major roads here\u00a0and blocked traffic,\" he said. \"It was just one of the scenes that played itself out today as the centre of the city was really paralyzed.\"\nWatch as protesters are hit with pepper spray:\nA protester who gave only his first name, Marco, said he hoped the protest would persuade Lam's administration to shelve the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance.\n\"We want the government to just set the legislation aside and not bring it back,\" Marco\u00a0said.\nA fellow protester who gave her name as King said the protest was a watershed moment for Hong Kong's young generation, who face difficult job prospects and skyrocketing housing prices.\nWatch as police fire tear gas:\n\"We have to stand up for our rights or they will be taken away,\" she said.\nThe reluctance of protesters to be identified by their full names and professions \u2014 many wore surgical masks to obscure their facial features \u2014 reflected an increasingly hard-line approach to civil unrest by the authorities. Such actions are never tolerated in mainland China, and Hong Kong residents can face travel bans and other repercussions if they cross the border.\nChief Secretary for Administration Mathew Cheung\u00a0gave\u00a0no indication of when the delayed legislative debate would begin.\nStaff members were advised not to go to into work and those already on the premises were told to \"stay at their working place until further notice.\"\nSome businesses closed for the day, and labour strikes and class boycotts were called.\nWaiting game: Centre of Hong Kong paralyzed, many thousands on the streets and around legislature to protest extradition law, riot police ready. But debate over law postponed, officially because legislators can\u2019t get in. Protestors think it\u2019s a ruse to get them to leave <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CBC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CBC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/OZgET8ouaB\">pic.twitter.com/OZgET8ouaB</a>\nUnder its \"one-country, two-systems\" framework, Hong Kong was supposed to be guaranteed the right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years following its handover from British rule in 1997. However, China's ruling Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular legal changes.\nLam has consistently defended the legislation as necessary to close legal loopholes with other countries and territories. A vote was scheduled on June 20.\n\"There's no urgency at all, and they are rushing it,\" pro-democracy politician Martin Lee said.\n\"They want the whole thing to be finished next Thursday in Hong Kong. They want to do it as quickly as possible.\"\nCritics believe the extradition legislation would put Hong Kong residents at risk of being entrapped in China's judicial system, in which opponents of Communist Party rule have been charged with economic crimes or ill-defined national security offences, and would not be guaranteed free trials.\nLam, who cancelled her regular question and answer session on Wednesday, said the government has considered concerns from the private sector and altered the bill to improve human rights safeguards. She said without the changes, Hong Kong would risk becoming a haven for fugitives.\nShe emphasized that extradition cases would be decided by Hong Kong courts.\nHong Kong currently limits extraditions to jurisdictions with which it has existing agreements and to others on an individual basis. China has been excluded from those agreements because of concerns over its judicial independence and human rights record.\nThe mainland's ruling Communist Party exerts influence on the Hong Kong government. Lam was elected in 2017 by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites and was widely seen as the Communist Party's favoured candidate.\nThe Legislative Council includes a sizeable camp of pro-Beijing legislators.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Michael Gorman", "title": "Budget aimed at health care, education and poverty likely to fuel N.S. election talk", "description": "Fallout from Northern Pulp closure and coronavirus could hurt province's economic growth", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/budget-aimed-at-health-care-education-and-poverty-likely-to-fuel-n-s-election-talk-1.5475294", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5475301.1582651006!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/karen-casey.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 25, 2020 1:16 PM AT", "2020-02-25T19:23:37.360Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "If Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil hoped to quell recent talk of a pending provincial election, his government's budget on Tuesday won't help.\nWith estimated expenses of $11.5 billion and a $55-million surplus, the 2020-21 budget sees major infrastructure projects beginning to ramp up, further increases in spending on health care and education, and the McNeil government's most targeted effort to date in trying to reduce poverty, all while some economic uncertainty looms.\nIn her budget speech, Finance Minister Karen Casey said that while the province might be in a \"positive fiscal position,\" the budget is intended to support people \"who may not have been feeling the success of the province.\"\nTo that end, the government will spend $18 million to increase the low-income threshold for the Nova Scotia Child Benefit, extending it to families with incomes below $34,000. The change is expected to help 28,000 families and 49,000 children.\nThe standard household rate will become fully funded this year thanks to an additional $17.3 million and there's $16.6 million for the Disabilities Support Program.\nAmong other things, the government is promising that new money will help transition residents from larger care facilities into community-based living. In her speech, Casey said 50 people would make the move this year, with more in the following three years.\nHousing Nova Scotia will add 560 new rent supplements, 120 of which will be directed to people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The government is also planning to spend $20.5 million in the next five years for the Integrated Action Plan to Address Homelessness. The intention is to help people find permanent, stable and safe housing.\nCommunity Services officials said the increased funding reflects how stubborn the poverty issue has been and that efforts to date haven't moved the needle far enough. Nova Scotia has lagged behind other provinces in recent Statistics Canada reports on poverty rates for children and families.\n\"We saw numbers come out that saw us drop\u00a0\u2014 the largest drops inside of Canada, but it's still too high,\" McNeil told reporters.\n\"And this is an acknowledgement of that and this is an investment in those kids, kids in our province who are living in poverty.\"\nHealth care, as always, gobbles up the largest proportion of the budget.\nThis year, the Health Department's budget will hit $4.8 billion, almost 42 per cent of the total.\nThere's $75.3 million more for doctors following the recently announced new master agreement. There's also previously announced money for more seats at Dalhousie University's medical school and for resident training, and money to create 70 new nursing seats \u2014 62 at Cape Breton University and eight at Dalhousie's satellite campus in Yarmouth.\nThere's more money for a variety of drug programs and $1 million for a new ovarian cancer research program at Dalhousie.\nThe Nova Scotia Health Authority will see its budget increase by $77.7 million, while the bottom line at the IWK Health Centre will go up by $8.4 million.\nThe government will also spend $3.2 million to implement the new Human Organ Tissue Donation Act, money that will go toward doing more transplants.\nThe Education Department's major increases include $21.5 million to complete the rollout of pre-primary and another $15 million for the recommendations in the Commission on Inclusive Education's report.\nThe student loan forgiveness program is increasing by $2.2 million to now include graduates of the Nova Scotia Community College, a move that should affect 1,400 people as of this summer.\nThen there's the capital plan.\nAs Casey announced last week, it will hit $1 billion this year, driven primarily by hospital construction and renovation, buying and building 46 schools, and work on highways, roads and bridges. This year's operating grant for the Nova Scotia-to-Maine ferry is $16.3 million.\nThere's also about $40 million dedicated to green programs, such as energy efficiency programs and community-based projects to address climate change.\nThe spending is helped by $395 million more from Ottawa this year, including more money for equalization ($200 million) and the federal health transfer ($41.3 million).\nOpposition leaders and others were critical of the budget, saying it either didn't go far enough on certain issues or\u00a0placed too much emphasis on some things at the expense of others.\nTory Leader Tim Houston called the document an\u00a0election budget filled with investments that should have come \"years ago.\"\nHouston pointed to the $700,000 to create the new nursing school seats as an example.\n\"They could have easily started that three years ago and we'd be graduating nurses today instead of trying to look for someone to go in the program,\" he said.\nHouston said the level of transfer payments the province is receiving from Ottawa is proof that things aren't as fiscally strong as the government would have people believe.\n\"There is huge headwinds before this province for sure and easily our economy could shrink this year and that's a major concern,\" he said.\nNDP Leader Gary Burrill\u00a0called it a tale of two budgets, with\u00a0\"a great banquet feast\" laid out for the business community while the most needy get \"crumbs.\"\n\"It has the character of a fiscal deathbed confession,\" he told reporters.\n\"After years in which the province has really been starved for social spending, now, on the front porch of an election, we have all these crumbs being tossed in all kinds of different directions. So the spending, yes, fine, but it's a little bit little and it's a whole lot late.\"\nChristine Saulnier with\u00a0the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said the new funding aimed at addressing poverty doesn't go far enough.\n\"We need to do much\u00a0more than wait for a business sector to do something with a tax cut,\" she said.\n\"We've had 30 years to know what they're going to do: they're going to sit on it, their shareholders are going to be enriched, maybe some of their top employees, but we're not going to see the trickle down that apparently the premier thinks will be different here.\"\nHealth-care advocates said there were some things to be happy about, such as extending dialysis to rural communities, but\u00a0both Nan McFadgen of CUPE and Chris Parsons of the Nova Scotia Health Coalition were concerned there aren't any new long-term care beds included in the budget or support for the workers who staff those homes.\n\"It's a problem for anybody that wants access to any kind of health care because it just flows through all of the system,\" said McFadgen.\nThe government may be opening up its wallet, but this budget will require people who smoke and vape to do the same. All tobacco taxes will increase as of Feb. 26. That includes a two cent increase per cigarette, increasing the tax on cigars from 60 per cent to 75 per cent and an increase on fine cut and other forms of tobacco to 40 cents per gram.\nVape products will begin being taxed in September and retailers will require a permit, the cost of which has yet to be finalized, in July. The vape tax, the second in the country after B.C., will include $0.50 per millilitre of liquid and 20 per cent of the retail value of all devices. For example, the taxes would amount to $10.40 for a $45 starter vape kit.\n\"A small price to pay for our youth health,\" Casey told reporters.\nCasey said the measures, along with a previously-announced ban on flavoured vape products, are intended to target youth vaping rates.\nThe premier's previously announced tax breaks for small business (down from three per cent to 2.5) and the reduced corporate rate (down from 16 per cent to 14 per cent) are included in this budget, moves that will cost $81 million.\nOther tax measures include a five-year extension of both the digital media tax credit and digital animation tax credit. The Nova Scotia Film and Television Production Incentive Fund will rise to $25 million.\nThere are risks in this budget, as with any. The government has not accounted for the short-term effects of the coronavirus outbreak, and that includes what effect it might have on seafood exports to Asia, a market that in recent years has been the engine for economic growth.\nThere is also the question of the long-term effects of Northern Pulp's closure. The government estimates the tax hit of losing the mill is about $32 million, something Finance Department officials say is offset by an otherwise strong economy. But offsetting mitigations and transitions related to the mill closure are not factored into the budget.\nMcNeil told reporters the shutdown of Northern Pulp had no correlation\u00a0with the increased capital spending, other than money tied directly to already-announced funds and initiatives designed to help the forestry industry transition.\nThe province's real economic growth is expected to slow to 0.4 per cent in 2020 before reaching 1.2 per cent in 2021. The 2020-21 debt is estimated to hit $15.7 billion, with the debt-to-GDP ratio coming in at 33.3 per cent.\nThe debt is projected to increase in each of the next four years, driven by construction of hospitals, highways and schools. The government is also projecting balanced budgets in each of those years, aided in part by favourable debt servicing costs as long-term high-rate loans come off the books and are replaced by loans at much lower rates.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": "Liam Britten", "title": "'You feel ashamed': Despite tighter rules, struggling British Columbians still embrace payday loans", "description": "Industry says loans provide options to consumers and rules are forcing lenders to close", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/treading-water-payday-lending-1.5423410", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5426563.1579028528!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/payday-lending.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 15, 2020 4:00 AM PT", "2020-01-15T12:00:00.479Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Downtown Eastside poverty advocate Elli Taylor has seen many desperate people struggling with payday loans.\nShe's been that person herself.\nIn 2014, while working as a part-time convenience store clerk in Williams Lake, Taylor took out what she thought would be a manageable $250 loan to buy a bus pass and\u00a0Christmas presents for her 14-year-old twins.\nHer take-home pay was about\u00a0$250\u00a0every two weeks, but monthly instalment payments of $50 became a problem with the then-legal rate of $20 interest and fees for every $100 loaned.\n\"You're snowballing into not being able to afford your groceries,\" Taylor said. \"You feel ashamed. It's dehumanizing.\"\nIt's stories like that that make it clear why B.C. has tightened the rules for payday lenders starting in 2016:\u00a0lowering how much can be borrowed and the interest rates allowed.\nBut while the number of lenders has declined under these new rules, data show British Columbians are actually borrowing from them more.\u00a0\nPayday loans offer quick cash but demand interest and fees greater than other loan types especially if not repaid quickly \u2014 perhaps\u00a0six to seven times the cost of an equivalent amount from a credit card cash advance or line of credit.\nAdvocates say many low-income people can't access those cheaper options,\u00a0and payday lender regulations are missing the point: too many British Columbians just aren't making enough money to get by.\nIsaiah Chan, director of counselling of the Credit Counselling Society, said the fact that there aren't fewer people seeking help with those debts speaks to bigger problems with affordability.\n\"Something's triggered it: either some sort of disruption like a family emergency or job loss, illness, something where they have to quickly resort to borrowing money at a higher cost,\" Chan said.\n\"The story that we hear from clients [is] they had nowhere else to turn.\"\nSince 2016, the province has taken a series of steps to tighten\u00a0payday lending rules: the maximum fee for every $100 borrowed is now\u00a0$15, limits have been\u00a0placed on information collection and the amount that can be loaned has been lowered to half a paycheque or half the earnings of one pay period.\nChan welcomes those changes but isn't seeing an impact.\nThe society helped over 20,500 Canadians from B.C. to Ontario through its debt management program in 2019. About 30 per cent had payday loan problems, numbers similar to 2018.\nChan said the people who rely on these loans tend to be poorer, have few credit options and are \"desperate.\"\nTaylor remembers that desperation.\nFalling behind, unable to afford groceries and without other options,\u00a0she took out more loans to stay afloat. The lenders would send people to her house and call her employer.\nTaylor also has clinical\u00a0depression. She blames\u00a0the stress of the loan for making her illness worse until she could no longer work. She became homeless.\n\"I was suicidal,\" she said. \"I just felt like, what the f--k is wrong with me?\"\nTaylor says she's doing better now, but it took time.\nShe moved to Vancouver where there are more supports for her mental health, and found work with organizations Raise the Rates and Carnegie Community Action Project.\nShe was able to pay the loans off eventually, after getting tax refunds from previous years she had not filed for, but to this day her credit rating is shot.\nAlan Evetts of the Canadian Consumer Finance Association, an industry association for payday lenders, said payday lending provides much-needed cash, quickly,\u00a0to people who normally wouldn't be able to get it.\nHe said it's unfair to compare the higher rates of payday lending with lower-interest options like lines of credit, likening\u00a0it to comparing the nightly price of a hotel room to monthly rent.\n\"They're intended to be used very differently.\"\nA provincial spokesperson said further regulations are coming\u00a0that will stop lenders from issuing further loans to a borrower who already has a loan with that institution and put in a waiting period after a borrower has paid off a loan before they can take on another one.\nEconomist Iglika Ivanova of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said regulations typically show governments don't understand payday lending.\n\"Payday loans are pitched as a sort of last resort,\" Ivanova said. \"A lot of people are actually taking these loans for utility bills and for groceries ... that are expected but they can't pay for.\"\nIvanova said banks and credit unions\u00a0need to provide alternatives.\u00a0Vancity's Fair and Fast Loan is one positive example, offering small, short-term loans at an interest rate about one-twentieth that of a payday loan.\u00a0\nFor Taylor, the answer is\u00a0more affordable housing, food security and a basic income.\n\"No amount of changing interest rates of loans is going to help,\" she said. \"We need equity.\"\nTreading Water is a series from CBC British Columbia examining the impact of the affordability crisis on people in Metro Vancouver and across the province, including the creative solutions being used to make ends meet.\nIf you have a story for our Treading Water series, please click\u00a0here\u00a0and tell us about it.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Kitchener South-Hespeler candidates talk environment, cost of living", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/kitchener-south-hespeler-federal-election-candidate-survey-1.5313708", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306047.1570037329!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/kitchener-south-hespeler-candidate-panel.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-13T09:00:00.875Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Voters will head to the polls on Oct. 21 and in Kitchener South-Hespeler, people will have a choice between seven candidates.\nThe candidates in Kitchener South-Hespeler are:\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has asked the candidates to answer a survey.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nAffordability is particularly important to my riding as it involves housing, seniors care, and post-secondary education.\u00a0\nSpecifically, to help seniors we have pledged to increase OAS for those who are 75 and older to provide greater financial security.\u00a0\nFor families looking to purchase a place of their own we introduced Canada's first National Housing Strategy to create new housing and repair and retrofit existing housing. Our First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, has the effect of a 10% purchase price reduction for first time home buyers.\nWe will continue to increase the number of grants, and provide up to $1,200 more to make post-secondary education more affordable.\u00a0Students won't have to start repaying their loans until they're earning at least $35,000 per year. This gives students more freedom to pursue and focus on their field of studies, without having to immediately take any job available post-graduation, whether or not in their field, simply to make payments.\nThere are a number of initiatives aimed at making life affordable for regular Canadians, and I look forward to being part of another Liberal government that brings that kind of positive change to the people of Kitchener South-Hespeler.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nI will continue to advocate for policies like the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) and the National Housing Strategy that are making a real difference for people in Waterloo\u00a0region I know the issues that face residents of Kitchener South-Hespeler, such as housing wait times and cost of living.\u00a0\nI have spoken to many families who are, for the first time, feeling the financial relief of the CCB and I want to ensure that those families, and many more can continue to rely on our support, because I know the difference it makes. This is why I'm also proud to support the strengthening of the CCB for parents with children under one-year-old, which is a very effective targeted increase.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nLiberals understand that the environment and climate change are an extremely high priority and as a result have implemented a multi-faceted environmental plan that tackles a number of different types of pollution in a concerted effort to limit our negative impact on nature and our climate.\nThe first of these is the carbon tax. It is no longer free to pollute in Canada. The higher price causes people to reduce their carbon emissions, while the rebate leaves most people with more than the tax costs them.\nFurthermore we moved to ban all single use plastics by 2021, which will not only reduce pollution from plastic bags and straws, but micro-plastics which are harmful to the environment due to the ease with which they can persist in ecosystems and even our food systems.\nA new Liberal government will also provide incentives for Canadians such as the, up to $40,000 interest free loan for the purposes of home retrofit to help existing homes reduce emissions.\nWe are committed to a thorough approach to combatting climate change and know that this is only possible with a complete and comprehensive strategy like ours.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI want the people of Kitchener South-Hespeler to know that my greatest driving force is ensuring that they are getting the services that they need and that I am part of a government that gives help to the families who need it most.\u00a0\nAs someone who was raised by a single mother\u00a0here in our riding, and who saw the difference that compassionate government programs can make, I want the opportunity to continue giving back to both this community and the country that afforded my family a chance to succeed.\u00a0\nWhile growing up I witnessed the hollowing out of the middle class\u00a0and I hope I will be able to continue my work for the people of Kitchener South-Hespeler and help to not just strengthen the middle class but open more opportunities for those working hard to join it.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nBy far, the top issue I am hearing about at the doors is how unaffordable life has become in our communities. Two thirds of Canadians feel that they either can't pay their bills \u2014 or feel that they have nothing left over at the end of the month after they do, and that is something being felt right here in Kitchener South-Hespeler.\nOver the past four years, costs have gone up, purchasing power is declining and families are finding it harder and harder to get ahead. Our middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than the average OECD\u00a0(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) country.\u00a0\nThe Conservatives have a plan to put more money back in the pockets of families, including a universal tax cut to all hard working taxpayers, returning the children's fitness tax credit, removing the GST off of home heating bills, increasing the government contribution for RESPs\u00a0(registered education savings plan), and increasing the age credit for seniors. We will also cancel $1.5 billion in corporate welfare and return that money to Canadians.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nWe have a plan to lower taxes and get the dollar going further for young folks, working families, and seniors. We also have a plan to spark our economy into action, as we now see it has stalled, limiting opportunity and prosperity.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe know that when our small businesses do well and grow in Canada, the result is shared prosperity for many. Having 10 years of experience in advising small businesses, I understand that they are the engine of our economy. I will champion our plan to cut taxes for small businesses, as well as to remove 25 per cent\u00a0of regulations that hold them back.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the people of our riding tell me they need better access to their MP. Many are going to other MPs for help with their concerns and opportunities. This is just wrong. I will get started on this problem by relocating the constituency office from the far end of Kitchener South to a more central location that better serves everyone in the riding. I'll also regularly host local businesses and community groups in Ottawa to help advocate for action that supports economic growth and improves affordability.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nHaving earned a master's degree in the environmental sciences and having a passion for climate action, I am especially frustrated by Canada's abysmal ranking amongst the worst of G7 countries on climate action. Our policies are evaluated to have the same effectiveness as Donald Trump's, resulting from a carbon tax that Justin Trudeau has largely discounted for Canada's heaviest emitters.\nOur Conservative plan forces Canada's heaviest industrial emitters to pay sooner, tightening their emissions cap from 50kt currently to 40kt and requiring that they invest in the technology that brings them back in line with these tougher emissions standards.\nWe will focus on technology, not taxes, to become an energy independent country by 2030 while also taking our climate fight global. As a stronger exporter, we can displace heavier emitters in other countries. Additionally, our Carbon Capture and Storage technology can help other countries to reduce their emissions substantially.\nWe will also implement the Green Homes Tax Credit and Green Public Transit Tax Credit to help Canadians with their daily environmental efforts. Canada's Conservatives are committed to protecting our environment and give our country \u2014 and the world \u2014 the best chance at meeting our Paris targets.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI was raised as a sixth-generation, hard-working Listowel sawmiller, which taught me from an early age about the importance of hard work, supporting local community, and environmental stewardship.\u00a0\nI was a lieutenant in the Canadian Armed Forces infantry reserves, serving both in Canada and in the UK, and possess a commitment to our veterans and men and women serving today.\u00a0\nI'm a business owner and a strong advocate for small businesses \u2013 the backbone of our economy \u2013 having spent my career helping small and medium-sized businesses to grow and create jobs as an operations and strategy consultant.\u00a0\nI'm passionate about climate action. I've earned an MSc in the environmental sciences from the University of Oxford, where I also completed my MBA. These studies inspired me to launch a service offering through a large consulting firm focused on helping small businesses to lower their carbon footprint.\u00a0\nI am thankful every day to share my life with my wife Jacqueline. We're fortunate to live in Doon South in our riding of Kitchener South-Hespeler, where I will work tirelessly to help folks get ahead.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it? \nThe top issue facing the Kitchener-South Hespeler\u00a0(KS-H) riding is the housing affordability crisis. The rising cost of housing continues to make the dream of purchasing a home an unattainable goal for so many, including families in KS-H.\nThe NDP is committed to making owning a home possible again and to maintain affordable, accessible rental options. I would support legislation to offer financial assistance to those looking to purchase their first home.\nAdditionally, the NDP plans to create and maintain affordable rental spaces. This is an initiative that will benefit many and I would encourage a development in the KS-H riding.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy.\u00a0What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\nThe future of our economy depending on progress and innovation. I support the implementation of green initiatives that would create stable, long-term jobs in the region, in addition to tackling our dependence on fossil fuels and looming climate crisis. Innovation also occurs in the booming tech sector in Waterloo region.\nTax incentives and grants to develop industry in the area will similarly create job opportunities and keep KW competitive with the world. It does seem that the cost of living is climbing ever higher, and with the climate crisis affecting supply chains and the need for preventative infrastructure, costs will continue to climb.\nHowever, the NDP has plans to implement a pharmacare plan to reduce the cost of medications, a plan to lower the cost of internet and cell phone service, as well as the recent announcement of funding to create 500,000 new, affordable childcare spaces will be change that can directly impact Canadians that they will see in their day-to-day life.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nThe climate crisis is an emergency and it is time that the federal government act like it. So much burden is placed on individual citizens, although we all play a role in protecting our future, it is large corporations who are the biggest polluters and should bear the biggest responsibility.\nThe NDP will hold these polluters and other corporations who profit from environmental harm to a higher standard and redirect corporate subsidies towards green initiatives. These initiatives like investing in transit options, creating green energy programs, retrofitting older buildings to be energy efficient, and improving recycling facilities will both reduce our footprint and create stable work to areas across the country.\nHowever, Canada cannot do this alone. We need to build strong relationships and commitments with other countries around the world to effect real change and create a better future for everyone.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI have a Bachelor of Arts degree, a diploma in engineering, and education in management and politics. I have 25 years of management experience and I have served on the board of directors of many non-profit organizations in Waterloo region and beyond.\u00a0\nThrough my volunteer efforts, and as a member of the Alliance Against Poverty, I have advocated for low cost transportation and housing affordability. As president of the Afghan Association of Waterloo Region, I have been campaigning for inclusion, belonging, and elimination of hatred. As a board member of Bridges-to-Belonging Waterloo Region, I have been advocating for people with autism and developmental disabilities.\nAs a member of the City of Kitchener's Safe and\u00a0Healthy Community Advisory Committee for the past eight\u00a0years, I have been seeking to eliminate the safety issues affecting residents of Kitchener. As a member of the Public Liaison Committee of Safety-Kleen Inc., I have been campaigning to make sure the company is not polluting the environment.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThe top issue that I have seen in the community is the lack of readily available mental health care, which often leads to self-medicating drug addictions with related drug crime and overdose deaths. Half the people in jail are mentally ill and this is due to insufficient mental health care putting people on the pathways to the worst outcomes.\u00a0\nWe need a proper mental health strategy, with funding and supports to help people be the healthiest versions of themselves as possible, thereby improving their lives and the social fabric of our community. This alleviates the exorbitant costs related to our inaction.\u00a0\nPolice repeatedly arrest the same people in chronic mental health distress, whom are taken to hospital and then released without admission to psychiatric care due to not being considered an immediate threat to themselves or anyone else. These sufferers are then often left without proper diagnosis or medical follow up supports sufficient to improve their mental health conditions, which leads to further encounters in which police are asked to intervene and take them back to the hospital in further revolving door contacts. Helping people in early stages of need eliminates costly hardships straining our community.\u00a0\n2.\u00a0People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nWe need a royal commission to investigate and give recommendations for renewal of our taxation system. Far too complex and unfair rules allow the wealthiest to escape their fair share, while the burden of funding services has been put too heavily on personal taxpayers.\nRevenue Canada collects $154 billion per year from individuals plus another $37 billion in GST. Corporations only contribute $47 billion per year, which is a quarter that of the monies collected from individuals. Fifty years ago, Canada had essentially no debt when corporations share of taxes was more than personal income taxes. They need to pay their fair share and we must stop their escaping taxation through offshore havens.\u00a0\nPersonal credit card rates need to be capped at 10 points above the the Bank of Canada prime lending rate.\nWe need a GLI, guaranteed liveable\u00a0income, to replace our employment insurance, disability and pension safety nets so that a more efficient and effective means of eliminating poverty is put into action.\u00a0\nWe need to catch up to the vast number of countries that value the education of their citizens with tuition free university, college and trades training.\u00a0\nThese things will help living affordability.\n3.\u00a0The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe have a tremendous opportunity to create an estimated four\u00a0million jobs in the clean economy, which will bring prosperity to Canadians and bring environmental and energy sustainability to our country.\nEnding fossil fuel exports of our raw bitumen and natural gas, and ending imports of fossil fuels too, will eliminate the potential fuel spills in our oceans and shorelines. Using our domestic oil on a declining basis as we build up renewable energy infrastructure and as doing so, transition oil and gas workers into renewable energy fields will protect their ability to have gainful employment while also taking action to protect our environment.\u00a0\nThere will be jobs in building up and renewing our electrical energy grid along with infrastructure for charging electric cars and to power all our transportation. There will be jobs in retrofitting homes, businesses and institutions to make them more energy efficient and thereby be less carbon emitting and be less costly to operate. New homes and businesses built at net-zero carbon footprint standards can eliminate the need of external energy sources to power them. Solar with batteries can have an efficient home off the grid. We can act to make this a reality.\n4.\u00a0What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI appreciate and enjoy diversity. Whether it be food, culture, music, choice of reading material or with whom I have friendships. Having exposure to different personalities, their thinking and views has me feel the energy that infuses dynamic life and makes it worth experiencing, learning from and growing with it.\nI have enjoyed training in karate to blue belt and riding my motorcycle on country roads. I also enjoy oil painting, writing poetry and sitting quietly in a park or woodland.\nI believe nurturing your inner self, your higher self, is as important as taking care of your body. The best way to love yourself and have peace\u00a0is to love others without judgment or condemnation and care for their needs in service. I believe that communication and empathetic understanding between people are fundamental for respectful relationships, which is also true for international relations.\nGreater diplomacy and collaboration for the common good of all people in the world will bring more peace than the military industrial complex. I believe in a strong defence; but, more so in a strong alliance building for our global good, especially in us all together taking climate action and in protecting our mother earth's biodiversity.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI believe that the biggest issue facing us right now is the opioid crisis and the mental illness that goes hand in hand with it.\nI was lucky enough to recently accompany city officials and a hazmat team while they cleaned out a homeless encampment\u00a0on Marsland Drive right next to a public park. At the bottom of a small hill, they cleaned out two dumpsters of garbage and around 500 dirty needles. The workers themselves say the disposal kits given to drug users are rarely utilized. This is the 50th camp they've cleaned out this\u00a0year and they're on track to hit 75 by the end of the year. They will more than double last year's number of 28. It's an epidemic.\nWe give these poor people plenty of assistance to slowly kill themselves but no help to get off the drugs. This needs to change,\u00a0rehab needs to be more of a priority along with other mental health supports.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nCost of living is a huge concern for the People's Party and myself personally. As a working class family man, I feel prices getting higher, too.\nWe will save you hundreds of dollars a year on your groceries by abolishing supply management. Our income tax plan will\u00a0let you keep more of your money. We will tax 15 per cent\u00a0for anyone making less than $100,000\u00a0a year and 25 per cent\u00a0for those making over $100,000\u00a0a year.\nOne of our candidates in Erin Mills also drafted a private member's bill that would make CPP benefits tax free. This would greatly help\u00a0seniors and have my full support if elected. \u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe narrative that man-made CO2 is the cause for all climate change is untrue. Over 30,000 scientists have signed petitions speaking out against the consensus myth. I agree that the climate is changing but there is no consensus on any one cause.\nThere\u00a0are so many factors that aren't considered. I would rather focus our efforts on concrete changes that are attainable. 1) We should clean our oceans first. They're the biggest ecosystem on the planet and we treat them like garbage dumps. Taking\u00a0full advantage of clean incineration technology, we can clean our oceans and solve an energy issue at the same time. 2) With oil and pipelines on everyone's minds, I'm surprised that few know about line 5, a pipeline running through the Straits of Mackinac, which\u00a0connect Lake Michigan to Lake Huron.\nThis pipeline was designed to last 50 years. It's currently 65 years old and threatening the Great Lakes system. I would fight to have this pipeline rehabbed or replaced in conjunction with the PPC pipeline plan. \u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm not your average politician. I hate politicians. They promise the world but live up to nothing. I can't promise you that I can fix everything but I can promise I will fight for us to be heard not ignored like we have been in previous governments.\nThe great thing about the PPC is that they allow their candidates to share their personal opinions, and that is something I am eager to do for Canadians.\u00a0I grew up facing many adversities that I was able to overcome. Unfortunately, not everyone who faces these adversities thrives.\nI'm here to fight for all people: those with families to take care of, those who need support, and those who struggle with daily life in Canada today. It should not be this difficult to get ahead in a country like Canada.\nParty's website\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThe pressing need facing people in this riding, as across the country, is to have the power to make the decisions which affect our lives. This includes, importantly, how we are governed.\u00a0\nWorking people can and should reject the path of dividing themselves behind the different cartel parties and their promises, which represent the narrow concerns of the rich minority to reap the benefits of robbing the state treasury, resources and labour of Canadians.\u00a0\nSpeaking out on the conditions of work and life and discussing solutions to the problems people face cuts through the shenanigans of the cartel parties, which are trying to keep working people passive observers of their drama within this obsolete system that brings elites to power to \"represent\" the people, speak in their name and rule over them.\u00a0\nIn this election, working people can embark on a new path to serve our own interests by exercising direct control over the decisions we take and speaking in our own name. This includes, importantly, what to do in the 2019 election itself.\u00a0\nThe Marxist-Leninist Party is making our bulletin, Renewal Update, available to workers, women and youth as a forum through which to have their voices heard.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\nThe economic, social and political rights of the people, which belong to all by virtue of being human, must be recognized and guaranteed.\u00a0\nCanada is a modern society where people rely on society for their existence, but the rights of many are being violated. More than a few working people in the riding have experienced being laid off, out-sourced or downsized. Their fate has been decided by those who control the means of production. Most often, the shuttering of plants serves narrow private interests, many times they are interests that are outside the community and even outside Canada.\u00a0\nWorking people need to have a say in the direction of the economy. It is the working people who must control their means of production and distribution for the good of all, to meet and guarantee their economic, social and political rights and well-being.\u00a0\nAs well, a new direction is required for the economy \u2014 one that stops paying the rich and increases funding for social programs. Such a society will serve the interests of working people and their families, and it will also defend the interests of all.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nIn Canada, as internationally, measures must be taken to overcome the destructive effects of climate change and end the pernicious practices of the monopolies and oligopolies such as fracking, clear cutting, detrimental mining methods, contamination of lakes and oceans, the privatization of water, and fraudulent environmental assessments.\u00a0\nAll over the world progress on this is being made on the basis of the peoples' struggles which restrict and successfully deprive the monopolies and oligopolies and governments in their service of their ability to pollute, destroy, super-exploit, trample on the sovereign rights of Indigenous peoples, and wage war for self-serving aims.\u00a0\nThe MLPC's call to humanize the natural and social environment requires that the peoples of the world, not the rich, are able to control the decisions which affect their lives and life on planet earth.\u00a0\nIt also requires an anti-war government that will end Canada's participation in all military alliances with the U.S., including NATO and NORAD, U.S.-led wars of aggression and occupation, and the U.S. war industry \u2014 which is the biggest polluter in the world.

It's dehumanizing.\"\nIt's stories like that that make it clear why B.C. has tightened the rules for payday lenders starting in 2016:\u00a0lowering how much can be borrowed and the interest rates allowed.\nBut while the number of lenders has declined under these new rules, data show British Columbians are actually borrowing from them more.\u00a0\nPayday loans offer quick cash but demand interest and fees greater than other loan types especially if not repaid quickly \u2014 perhaps\u00a0six to seven times the cost of an equivalent amount from a credit card cash advance or line of credit.\nAdvocates say many low-income people can't access those cheaper options,\u00a0and payday lender regulations are missing the point: too many British Columbians just aren't making enough money to get by.\nIsaiah Chan, director of counselling of the Credit Counselling Society, said the fact that there aren't fewer people seeking help with those debts speaks to bigger problems with affordability.\n\"Something's triggered it: either some sort of disruption like a family emergency or job loss, illness, something where they have to quickly resort to borrowing money at a higher cost,\" Chan said.\n\"The story that we hear from clients [is] they had nowhere else to turn.\"\nSince 2016, the province has taken a series of steps to tighten\u00a0payday lending rules: the maximum fee for every $100 borrowed is now\u00a0$15, limits have been\u00a0placed on information collection and the amount that can be loaned has been lowered to half a paycheque or half the earnings of one pay period.\nChan welcomes those changes but isn't seeing an impact.\nThe society helped over 20,500 Canadians from B.C. to Ontario through its debt management program in 2019. About 30 per cent had payday loan problems, numbers similar to 2018.\nChan said the people who rely on these loans tend to be poorer, have few credit options and are \"desperate.\"\nTaylor remembers that desperation.\nFalling behind, unable to afford groceries and without other options,\u00a0she took out more loans to stay afloat. The lenders would send people to her house and call her employer.\nTaylor also has clinical\u00a0depression. She blames\u00a0the stress of the loan for making her illness worse until she could no longer work. She became homeless.\n\"I was suicidal,\" she said. \"I just felt like, what the f--k is wrong with me?\"\nTaylor says she's doing better now, but it took time.\nShe moved to Vancouver where there are more supports for her mental health, and found work with organizations Raise the Rates and Carnegie Community Action Project.\nShe was able to pay the loans off eventually, after getting tax refunds from previous years she had not filed for, but to this day her credit rating is shot.\nAlan Evetts of the Canadian Consumer Finance Association, an industry association for payday lenders, said payday lending provides much-needed cash, quickly,\u00a0to people who normally wouldn't be able to get it.\nHe said it's unfair to compare the higher rates of payday lending with lower-interest options like lines of credit, likening\u00a0it to comparing the nightly price of a hotel room to monthly rent.\n\"They're intended to be used very differently.\"\nA provincial spokesperson said further regulations are coming\u00a0that will stop lenders from issuing further loans to a borrower who already has a loan with that institution and put in a waiting period after a borrower has paid off a loan before they can take on another one.\nEconomist Iglika Ivanova of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said regulations typically show governments don't understand payday lending.\n\"Payday loans are pitched as a sort of last resort,\" Ivanova said. \"A lot of people are actually taking these loans for utility bills and for groceries ... that are expected but they can't pay for.\"\nIvanova said banks and credit unions\u00a0need to provide alternatives.\u00a0Vancity's Fair and Fast Loan is one positive example, offering small, short-term loans at an interest rate about one-twentieth that of a payday loan.\u00a0\nFor Taylor, the answer is\u00a0more affordable housing, food security and a basic income.\n\"No amount of changing interest rates of loans is going to help,\" she said. \"We need equity.\"\nTreading Water is a series from CBC British Columbia examining the impact of the affordability crisis on people in Metro Vancouver and across the province, including the creative solutions

That's not what has happened.  Federal health officials knew when they drafted the law that they did not have definitive evidence e-cigarettes helped in quitting smoking.\u00a0Smokers have even added vaping to their nicotine habits. And even though the law that took effect in May 2018 tried to protect teens through advertising and age restrictions, it hasn't worked. The latest statistics show about a quarter of high school students across Canada are vaping.  Now, some of\u00a0the same health advocates who promoted vaping are calling for Health Canada to fix its policy.\u00a0This is in part due to a\u00a0mysterious and deadly vaping illness, along with new research showing vaping poses unique risks for organ damage and chronic disease.\u00a0\"We opened it up too wide,\" says David Hammond, a professor of public health at Ontario's University of Waterloo who researches tobacco-control policies.  The decisions that allowed all this to happen were based on an unproven hypothesis and some hopeful thinking.\u00a0This is why CBC News launched a new series,\u00a0Vape Fail, which\u00a0examines the policy and industry failures that went along with the introduction of vaping.\u00a0You can read more about the series here.

One 2012 study following the construction of a bike lane on 9th Avenue, found local businesses saw an increase in retail sales of up to 49 per cent,\u00a0compared to a three per cent\u00a0increase in the rest of Manhattan. \u00a0\nA broader evaluation of bike lanes in the Big Apple conducted by municipal officials in 2014\u00a0indicated that streets with protected bike lanes experienced retail sales spike by up to\u00a024 per cent compared to streets\u00a0without protected lanes.\nIn Salt Lake City,\u00a02015 sales tax statistics also noted a\u00a0sales bump with new bike lanes.\u00a0\nPositive results have been seen in San Francisco too;\u00a0after bike lanes and wider sidewalks were installed, two-thirds of merchants reported that increased levels of bicycling and walking improved business,\u00a0only four per cent said the changes hurt sales. \u00a0\u00a0\nIn Toronto, 2017 research into business activity and protected bike lanes on the downtown artery Bloor Street found \"a positive or at least neutral\" impact, with most merchants reporting more customers after the lanes were installed.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn contrast, a\u00a0study in Vancouver showed a change in the style of bike lanes on one street had a negative impact on businesses there\u00a0though\u00a0the analysis was limited to a short time period.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nBike lanes are believed to boost sales for some retailers because several studies have shown cyclists are good customers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn France, a recent study covering six\u00a0cities found that cyclists spend more money per week in shops than drivers. Research from Copenhagen has shown similar results.\nCloser to home, a 2012 study from Oregon found that in the city of Portland people who biked to a bar, restaurant or convenience store spent 24 per cent\u00a0more per month than those who drove. The cyclists spent more than drivers because they visited merchants more often.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe author of that study suggests cyclists have more disposable income because they spend less money on auto repairs, gas, insurance, and car payments.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, the same data shows that for trips to the supermarket, bikers didn't keep up with drivers on overall spending.\u00a0\u00a0\nA report from a real estate firm this month ranking Canadian cities on a 'Liveability Index\" included access to bike lanes as a key factor in making\u00a0a city attractive.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nIn the U.S., several academic studies have tried to quantify what close proximity to bike infrastructure means for\u00a0property values. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to a 2004 study in Indianapolis, Ind.,\u00a0homes within one\u00a0kilometre from the city's Monon Trail were selling for about 11 per cent\u00a0more than similar homes farther away.\nA 2006 University of Delaware paper looking at past research from across the U.S. concluded\u00a0that \"the majority of studies indicate that the presence of a bike path/trail either increases property values and ease of sale slightly or has no effect.\"\nThe papers said Delaware properties within 50 metres of bike paths had a value at least $8,800 greater than those farther away, and even more \"when controlled for specific variables.\"\nThat prospect for a premium price on homes with easy access to bike lanes or paths is not welcomed by everyone. Some observers point to bike lanes as a tool of gentrification that help create housing affordability issues.\nAnother unique factor some use\u00a0in favour of bike lanes actually comes out of critiques against them:\u00a0their cost.\nA Canadian report\u00a0from 2014 noted that the price for installing a bike lane can range from as low as $20,000 per/ km\u00a0for a painted lane to $1.2 million per/km if a road needs to be widened.\u00a0\nA 2011 U.S. study analyzing 58 projects in 11 different cities found that for every million dollars spent cycling infrastructure projects created 11.4 local jobs compared to 7.8 jobs for road-only projects. \u00a0\nThe study says a bike lane \"which requires a great deal of planning and design will generate more jobs for a given level of spending,\" than a road alone, employing more construction workers and engineers while utilizing less materials. \u00a0\u00a0\nNonetheless, bike lane budgets can still produce bad news for local leaders even in bike friendly cities. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCelebrity academic and urban planner Richard Florida of the University of Toronto asserts that many members of the so-called creative class\u00a0of workers are bikers. \u00a0\nHe's argued in editorials that cities seeking to attract these valuable workers should build bike lanes and noted that cities with a higher number of bicycle commuters also tend to have higher wages. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAcross North America, cities are investing in bike lanes, with\u00a0some mayors saying luring high tech workers and companies is part of their motivation.\nOver two\u00a0terms, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel poured millions into bike lanes, winning the best bike city in America title. While opening new bike lanes in 2012 he said \"you cannot be for a startup, high-tech economy and not be pro-bike.\" \u00a0\nOutside of health and environmental claims, there are also business arguments related to bike lanes for their role in helping combat\u00a0traffic congestion, and freeing up parking space for development.\nStill, there's\u00a0vocal opposition.\nLawrence Solomon, an environmentalist\u00a0and energy policy researcher once advocated in favour of bike lanes. Now, he rails against them.\nAnd just two\u00a0years ago, academics in New Zealand produced an international study on the \"bikelash\"\u00a0trend, against cycling infrastructure.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Bartley Kives", "title": "'They're killing themselves': Acrid smoke from copper-wire fires plagues South Point Douglas", "description": "Residents complain of frequent fires set to separate plastic from metal; police blame methamphetamine trade", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/wire-fires-south-point-douglas-1.5386008", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5388305.1575737870!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/wire-fire-lighter.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 09, 2019 5:00 AM CT", "2019-12-09T11:00:00.429Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Noxious black smoke and the acrid smell of burning plastic have become regular irritants in South Point Douglas, thanks to illegal fires set to remove\u00a0insulation from salvaged or stolen copper wire.\nResidents of\u00a0the inner-city Winnipeg neighbourhood, which sits along the Red River to the immediate northeast of downtown, say they're growing weary of wire fires set several times a week in Fort Douglas Park, a wooded area along the riverbank.\nCity hall concedes it has no immediate means of doing anything about the fires, which police believe are a consequence of the methamphetamine trade.\n\"The smoke wafts into the neighbourhood, and if you're sitting in your backyard or doing yard work, the smell is awful, never mind what's happening to the guys who are doing the actual burning. They're killing themselves,\" said South Point Douglas resident Jeff Monk, pointing out three separate wire-processing sites\u00a0within 100 metres of riverbank.\nHe said he noticed a spike in the number of illegal wire\u00a0fires this summer. They leave behind patches of scorched earth and molten plastic\u00a0below the spring high-water line, allowing the chemical byproducts\u00a0of the fires to end up in the Red River the next time it floods.\nMonk said while firefighters respond quickly to his 911 calls, the emergency response does not dissuade copper scavengers from setting more fires.\n\"The fire department comes, they put out the fire and the walk away. The police don't come because it's a fire, and the guys start chopping wood again and getting ready for the next fire, so it's kind of useless,\" Monk said.\n\"I don't mind phoning [911], but I'm not going to police it. I don't have the energy because I'm fighting cancer myself.\"\nMonk is undergoing his third round of chemotherapy in an effort to cure his\u00a0lymphoma. He said while he doesn't believe he's ingested much of the smoke from the burning plastic, he doesn't appreciate the airborne carcinogens.\u00a0\n\"It's another thing in my head, kind of going, 'What's this going to do to me when I'm trying to heal?'\" he said.\nLess than 10 minutes after Monk showed CBC News where the fires are set, a man rode into Fort Douglas Park on a bike, towing a trailer\u00a0filled with wire.\nCBC News observed as the\u00a0man used an accelerant and the remains of wooden pallets to start a fire, sending orange flames shooting up between the riverside trees. When the flames died down to less than a metre in height, he\u00a0placed a bundle of wires within his fire and tended to the small blaze until he noticed he was being filmed.\nHe declined an interview request and asked to be left alone.\nJordan Van Sewell, a Winnipeg visual artist who lives in South Point Douglas, said he fears homelessness and illicit substance use are driving downtrodden Winnipeggers to burn wire.\n\"I like the enterprising spirit. That's what built this town in the first place,\" he said.\n\"But the ends and means that people go through \u2026 when you think of the toxicity of what those guys are smelling and you see the big black cloud, you know\u00a0it's not good.\"\nThe economics behind illegal wire fires are simple. In Winnipeg, scrap dealers say they buy insulated copper wire for as little as $1.25 per pound. Clean copper wire, however, commands more than double the price: $2.65 a pound.\nScrap recycling companies say they buy most of their wire from reputable, industrial sources. The Winnipeg Police Service says some of the scrap is also salvaged or stolen\u00a0\u2014 and then sold to recycling companies to generate revenue to purchase methamphetamine.\n\"A lot of that material comes from thefts,\" said Const. Jay\u00a0Murray, a spokesperson for the police service. \"When wire is stolen, it's covered with plastic and they want to get that plastic off.\"\nMurray said the police support a city proposal to require metal buyers to follow procedures similar to those followed by gold buyers and pawn shops. Those shops are required to obtain identification from anyone who wants to sell their wares and keep photocopies of their IDs on file.\nThis proposal grew out of the city-provincial task force on methamphetamine and other illicit drugs. A report recommending additional\u00a0regulation\u00a0of the scrap-metal industry is due before city councillors\u00a0early in 2020, said Joelle Schmidt, a spokesperson for the City of Winnipeg.\nWestern Scrap Metals, which operates in North Point Douglas, said it already asks its suppliers\u00a0to provide\u00a0identification.\u00a0\nThe redevelopment of both Point Douglas neighbourhoods, which are home to a mix of residential housing and industrial businesses, could further ease tensions, said\u00a0Vivian Santos, the city councillor for Point Douglas.\nThat prospect is a decade away, at best. In the short term, Santos advises South Point Douglas residents to continue calling 911 when they see or smell wire fires.\n\"It's a very, very tough question,\" she said. \"I know people want immediate action, but I don't have a solution.\"\nJeff Monk said he would appreciate a more preventive approach, given the frequency of the fires. He said he's seen people carry entire coils of wire through his neighbourhood\u00a0\u2014 and once\u00a0saw a taxi pull up near his home and drop off a passenger who unloaded a full trunk-load of wire.\n\"All that energy could be used for other things, instead of killing themselves and screwing with the environment down here on the riverbank,\" Monk said.\n\"It's sad. It's sad for the whole situation: the riverbank, the guys breathing it [and]\u00a0for us to have to\u00a0see it and smell it. And nothing's really being done to manage it or police it.\n\"They're not here now, but they'll be back.\"\n"}, {"author": "Kathleen Harris", "title": "Canada's economy 'sound and growing,' says Morneau as he unveils fiscal update", "description": "Update shows deficits for next 5 years, with no sign of a planned return to balance", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fiscal-update-1.5397273", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5397746.1576516691!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fiscal-update-20191216.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 15, 2019 5:25 PM ET", "2019-12-16T19:36:14.077Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Despite a global manufacturing slump and rising world trade tensions, Canada's economy is \"sound and growing\" at a solid pace, according to an economic update delivered today by Finance Minister Bill Morneau.\nThe optimistic update points to low unemployment, growing wages and solid business profits as signs the national economy remains strong despite international challenges.\nThe update contains little in the way of new spending beyond what has been announced already.\nBut pension and benefits adjustments due to changing long-term interest rates, a new revenue-sharing deal on Hibernia and the recently passed tax cut, among other costs, are\u00a0driving up the deficit.\nThe deficit is pegged to rise to $26.6 billion for the current year \u2014 up from $14 billion last year, and up from the $19.8 billion projected in the spring budget. It's projected to fall to $11.6 billion by 2024-2025, with the size of the debt relative to the economy remaining flat for the next few years.\nIn a news conference on Parliament Hill, Morneau\u00a0defended the plan to carry ongoing deficits, saying it's necessary to ensure Canadians reap the benefits of a strong economy, including the residents of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador who are experiencing economic anxieties.\n\"We know that in order to ensure we continue on this positive trajectory, the strong economy that we've seen, the very strong employment numbers, that we should be continuing to invest at an appropriate level, and that's what we are doing with this economic and fiscal update and with the campaign that we ran on,\" he said.\nThe update shows an increase of nearly $10 billion in spending since the spring budget, including nearly $5 billion for employee pension and benefits adjustments, nearly $2 billion for a new revenue agreement on the Hibernia oil project in Newfoundland and Labrador\u00a0and\u00a0millions in compensation for dairy farmers harmed by new trade deals.\nThe government announced a $1.75-billion compensation package for dairy farmers in August, of which $345 million was to be paid out in the first year.\nSome of the government's spending is offset by $1.7 billion in increased tax revenue.\nNearly 400,000 new jobs have been created so far in 2019 \u2014 Canada's\u00a0strongest rate of growth since 2007, according to the Department of Finance.\nBut not all parts of the country are experiencing the benefits of that growth;\u00a0Canada's oil-producing provinces are\u00a0still feeling the pinch.\n\"Insufficient export pipeline infrastructure is reducing Canadian crude oil and natural gas prices, meaning lower profits for producers, reduced investment within the industry, fewer good, well-paying jobs for Canadian workers and lost revenues at all levels of government,\" the report reads.\n\"These challenges are expected to persist until major projects, such as the Trans Mountain and LNG Canada (pipelines), are completed.\"\nThe economic update also earmarks an extra $69 million for compensation payments to provinces for costs associated with asylum seekers entering the country outside of official border points, such as interim housing, social assistance and education.\nThe update also points to the positive impact of immigration on the country's economy. Since 2015, immigrants have accounted for three-quarters of population growth, resulting in Canada's population growing at its fastest pace in 20 years, and much faster than that of the other G7 economies.\nAsked if the government is prepared to respond to a possible recession, Morneau said it is prepared \"for all eventualities.\"\n\"We already have the strongest balance sheet among G7 countries, we have the lowest level of debt as a function of our economy and what we're projecting is that we're going to be able to reduce that level of debt as a function of our economy, down to 29 per cent during the forecast horizon,\" he said.\nConservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre rejected Morneau's positive outlook, saying that Canada's economic performance lags behind other G7 countries. He said the government is responding to economic challenges by piling up debt, adding \"devastating\" red tape and creating obstacles to building major projects.\n\"What we're facing now is the prospect of a made-in-Canada recession,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"When we went into the last downturn in 2008, Canada led the pack. We were the last into the recession\u00a0and the first out. It looks like this time that Canada could be in the worst position of our competitors going into the troubled waters ahead.\"\nNDP finance critic Peter Julian said he was \"profoundly disappointed\" by the update.\n\"It's surprising how weak this economic update is when you contrast it with how readily the Liberal majority government was willing to give billions of dollars to Canada's biggest corporations when they were in power,\" he said.\n\"Now in a minority Parliament they should be thinking about regular families and communities and they seem to be ignoring that.\"\nThe Canadian Chamber of Commerce is also disappointed with the update, noting that it does little to help the businesses that are the drivers of the economy. Chief economist Trevin Stratton said the update makes deficits an\" enduring fixture\" of the fiscal plan and leaves untenable levels of debt to future generations.\n\"Our perpetual structural deficit will put Canada in a difficult position to use fiscal stimulus should it be required in the event of a widely expected global downturn. Should a foul economic wind blow at anytime in the next four\u00a0years, this fiscal house of cards will inevitably fall,\" he said in a statement.\nEconomic growth: GDP growth after inflation projected to be 1.7 per cent this year and 1.6 per cent in 2020, second only to the U.S. in the G7 \u2014 no change from the spring budget. Outside experts are not predicting a recession.\nJobs: Despite a loss of 71,000 jobs in November, 2019 has recorded the highest number of jobs added this decade \u2014 nearly 400,000.\nDeficit: Projected to be $26.6 billion (including $1.5 billion for \"risk\") \u2014 a jump of $6.8 billion from the spring budget mostly due to pension and benefit adjustments, a new revenue agreement with Newfoundland and Labrador on Hibernia, compensation for dairy and canola farmers and the recently passed tax cut. Higher expenses were offset by $1.7 billion in higher tax revenues.\nDebt: The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise slightly to 31 per cent for 2019-20 and then fall again in 2021-22.\n"}, {"author": "Chris Hall", "title": "Get ready for an unruly House of Commons divided along regional fault lines", "description": "Election 2019 managed to deepen Canada's east-west, rural-urban divides in an alarming way", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-liberal-2019-election-1.5330092", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5330106.1571760401!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-liberals-20191002.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 22, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-22T13:15:16.715Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Justin Trudeau and the Liberals shook off a lacklustre campaign and his own uneven performance on the hustings to win another mandate. But it's a minority mandate, one that requires him to work with at least one of the opposition parties to get anything done.\nIf last night's speeches were any indication, co-operation will be hard to find.\nTrudeau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and NDP\u00a0Leader Jagmeet Singh took the stage in the wee hours of the morning at almost the same time\u00a0\u2014 leaving\u00a0the networks to either choose one speech to cover or let all three talk over each other.\nFor Trudeau, the election results could have been worse. They could also have been better.\u00a0\nThe Liberals stand to lose in the neighbourhood of 30 seats across the country. They were shut out entirely in Saskatchewan and Alberta, and saw the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\u00a0re-emerge as a powerful force in Quebec\u00a0\u2014 if not for sovereignty, then at least for the brand of nationalism being advocated by Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault.\nBloc Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet \u2014 who earned the nickname \"goon\" for his no-holds-barred approach to politics when he was a member of the provincial Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u2014 could prove a significant opponent.\nBlanchet can be expected to argue forcefully for Legault's demands that Quebec be given more power over immigration and a single tax return managed by the province, and that Ottawa stay out of any efforts to overturn the province's controversial secularism law. Each of those demands will be difficult for the Liberals to swallow.\nThere is no escaping the fact that this is a country divided. Trudeau couldn't ignore it even in his victory speech, which directly addressed\u00a0voters in the Prairies and Quebec; Trudeau assured them he had heard their message, without suggesting\u00a0how it might influence his decisions.\nBut it's not only a regional divide. The Liberals' support is overwhelmingly in urban centres and their suburbs. For the Liberals, winning this election was hard \u2014 but governing might turn out to be harder.\nFirst, Trudeau will have to pay more attention to his own caucus than he and his senior staff did over\u00a0the past four years. Backbench MPs have little or no leverage in a majority. They have far more power when the fate of the government hangs on each and every confidence vote.\nThe other big challenge facing the Liberals is to decide how to face the Commons going forward.\u00a0\nSome prime ministers have been very successful at negotiating support on an issue-by-issue basis. It worked for Stephen Harper in the 2006-2011 period\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but at the time, he was benefiting from disarray in the Liberal Party.\nTrudeau doesn't\u00a0appear to enjoy a similar advantage. Scheer may well face some Conservative criticism for his own uneven performance in this campaign\u00a0\u2014 but in his concession speech, he issued a clear warning.\n\"Tonight, Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice,\" he said.\u00a0\"And Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win.\"\nNew Democrats hold the balance of power. Jagmeet Singh spoke to Trudeau last night but didn't divulge what they talked about.\nBut Singh set out what he called six urgent priorities during the campaign \u2014 things his party wants the next government to tackle.\u00a0\nTopping the list are a single-payer, universal pharmacare program\u00a0and\u00a0more ambitious carbon emissions reduction targets. So far, the Liberals haven't committed to anything (there is more common ground between the two parties\u00a0on the need to build affordable housing).\nOne hurdle to co-operation between the Liberals and New Democrats may be insurmountable. Both the NDP and Greens are adamantly opposed to the expansion of the Trans-Mountain Pipeline. Will that be part of the price for Singh's co-operation?\n\"These are the priorities of people that New Democrats will put at the heart of the conversations that we are going to have in the days and weeks to come,\" Singh told supporters in Burnaby.\u00a0\"And if the other parties work with us, we have an incredible opportunity to make the lives of all Canadians so much better.\"\nIt's not clear when Trudeau and Singh will talk, or what the prime minister will offer in return for NDP support as he pursues his next agenda in a divided Parliament and a divided country.\nMinority governments can produce big things in Canada.\u00a0Under Lester B. Pearson in the 1960s,\u00a0the Liberals worked with the New Democrats to introduce medicare and the Canada Pension Plan.\nStephen Harper's Conservatives formed two minority governments and, at the insistence of his finance minister Jim Flaherty, embarked on a massive program of stimulus spending and tax cuts that took Canada through\u00a0a global recession and allowed this country to emerge more quickly and in better shape from the downturn than other advanced economies.\nIt's possible climate change and universal pharmacare might be the issues that get this new minority government to introduce some\u00a0lasting initiatives.\nFor now, common ground remains elusive. And nothing any of the leaders said in the wee hours of this morning suggests unity is high on their list of priorities.\n"}, {"author": "Shanifa Nasser", "title": "What will become of Toronto's Chinatown?

Though Chinatown then wasn't where we know it to be today.\nAt the time, Toronto's Chinatown was about where\u00a0city hall stands now. But eventually about\u00a0two-thirds of that land was expropriated for the municipal government building, prompting Lumb and others to try to save the remaining third.\nMany others in the Chinese community relocated\u00a0to Spadina Avenue at Dundas Street, where rent was more affordable. And a third Chinatown had sprung up in the Broadview and Gerrard area, where prices were even lower.\nToday, that first Chinatown is pretty well gone, says Chan. And the Broadview iteration, once home to about 30 Chinese restaurants, now has less than a handful.\nSpadina Avenue is now the last remaining snapshot of the Chinese community's earliest days in Toronto. And the history isn't confined to the buildings themselves.\n\"It's thriving, it's busy ... On the weekends, the grandmothers that make their own sticky rice dumplings are selling them on the corner with the vegetables that they grow in their vegetable gardens.\"\nThat in part is why Chan is optimistic.\nChinatown, she says, has always been a place of change. Most notably, there was the SARS outbreak in 2003, when an elderly woman who had travelled to Hong Kong died of the deadly virus in Toronto. Fears about the illness \"almost wiped out Chinatown,\" says Chan.\nThen there were plans for a Spadina Expressway that would have run right through the area.\nAnd of course\u00a0346 Spadina Avenue wasn't always the site of the beloved Bright Pearl. Before it was sold to a Taiwanese restaurateur in 1971, the building was home to the historic Labour Lyceum, a hub for Jewish textile workers and activism,\u00a0where in 1937, famed American labour organizer Emma Goldman once spoke.\nEven the population of Chinatown has changed over the years:\u00a0around the time of the Second World War it was largely Cantonese-speakers from Guangdong province, then there was the influx from Hong Kong, and later immigrants from China.\n\"So you could see the influence of the newer Chinese immigrants in Chinatown, we have these hand-pulled noodles and the immigrants coming from Taiwan brought us bubble tea,\" she says.\nStill, she says she applauds young people like Lam and Yee who are organizing to make sure the area doesn't disappear.\u00a0\n\"My hats off to the young people who are being vigilant and watching to make sure that what has happened to other communities doesn't happen to our Chinatown.\"\nBut while Lam and Yee are concerned about the effect of gentrification in the area, Tonny Louie, chair of the Chinatown BIA, isn't worried.\n\"I think gentrification is a good thing because new shops are coming in. And as you know, the population has grown older and at a\u00a0lot of the earlier businesses, the people are retiring so we need some new ideas and new operators,\" he says.\nBesides, he says, whereas Chinatown might have once been the singular hub for Chinese groceries and community events in Toronto, today there are thriving hubs of Chinese-owned business all over the Greater Toronto Area in places like Markham, Richmond Hill and Scarborough.\u00a0\nAnd while several of the newer businesses in the area are Chinese-owned, Yee worries their concerns are less about growing the\u00a0existing relationships and communities in the area, and more about catering to, say, the significant international student body at the nearby University of Toronto.\u00a0\n\"Usually more affluent people who come in \u2026 are not necessarily interested in the history of this space and the people who are already here, rather instead bringing a different, more affluent student business to Chinatown,\" she says.\nChinatown, she says \"is not only an important place for housing, but also culturally important as a place where people find each other, and find community and find ways to keep their roots, their family and their heritage alive.\"\nFor Chan, whose roots in the community run deep, it's impossible to ignore that the face of Chinatown is changing.

For authors, artists\u00a0and freelance journalists, it has often been the rule rather than the exception. Even before the computer age, some people with special skills found ways of using the telephone, fax and Fedex to do their job from a home office.\nBut\u00a0more and more, jobs on employment aggregators require familiarity with project management software, such as Basecamp or Slack\u00a0\u2014\u00a0created to allow remote teams working on software projects to share ideas on virtual whiteboards or to collaborate in chat rooms categorized by project or shared task.\nThe technique is ideal for teams building software, where steps must be created and physically documented by individual engineers working alone during periods of intense concentration before being vetted and tested by a larger group. Even in companies where everyone gets a desk, software engineers usually keep in touch\u00a0through a system like Slack.\nThe practice has become so widespread\u00a0that GitLab, a tech company that provides software-sharing repositories\u00a0for NASA, IBM and many others,\u00a0boasts it is 100 per cent remote.\u00a0\nGitLab\u00a0has created what it calls the \"Remote Manifesto,\" which, among other things, calls for no central location for the company, flexible working hours for everyone, \"asynchronous communication\"\u00a0and compensation measured by results rather than hours worked.\n\"The future of work is remote,\" declares Carol Teskey, a member of the company's \"people team\" in a video posted to the company's website.\nTurow's employer, Page Zero Media,\u00a0does have a physical office in Toronto.\u00a0But company founder Andrew Goodman points out that he has clients around the world, so why can't the same be true of his employees. His second and third in command\u00a0live in Vancouver and St. Louis, Mo., part of a team of 16 people, mostly scattered across Canada.\nFrom the beginning, Goodman says he was \"tolerant\" of remote workers.\u00a0But then his partner got a tenure track job at the University of New Brunswick,\u00a0so he went remote himself.\n\"It worked out very nicely,\" recalled Goodman, whose company specializes in helping advertisers get the best results in the complex world of online ad placement. \"We sold our house in Toronto. We got a cheaper and nicer house in Fredericton.\"\nNow he spends one week a month in Toronto, where he keeps a flat, working out of the company's newly acquired office space.\n\"The rest of the time I'm pretty much at my home office, with the big screen, talking on the phone, collaborating with both staff and clients\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and everyone's getting more and more used to that,\" said\u00a0Goodman.\nClearly not every job and every person is suited to remote working. Loneliness can be a factor for some;\u00a0will power to get up and get to work is essential.\u00a0But for those who can make it work, there are advantages for both employees and employers.\nOne advantage for Goodman, he says, is getting top quality staff without paying the six-figure salaries often needed to compete for workers in a high-cost city.\nFor Turow, who says she has spoken frankly with Toronto\u00a0friends in similar jobs who are not paid as well,\u00a0her comfortable, modern house would\u00a0be unaffordable in Canada's largest city.\n\"I already end up financially better off,\" she said.\u00a0And trips twice a month into the city for \"office days\" gives her a chance to catch up with friends.\nBut just as Goodman looked outside Toronto for talent, U.S. tech giants are discovering the advantages of remote workers in Canada.

Taken together, the degree of accommodation being provided by the current policy interest rate remains appropriate.\"\nThe Bank of Canada, which was widely expected to stand pat Wednesday, said it will continue to monitor data ahead of future decisions with a particular focus on developments in the energy sector and the effects of global trade tensions.\nFallout from the uncertain international trade environment was also reflected in the bank's updated economic projections, which were also released Wednesday in the bank's quarterly monetary policy report.\nThe bank downgraded its 2019 global growth forecast to three per cent from 3.2 per cent due to trade disputes \u2014 the U.S.-China fight, in particular \u2014 that have rippled through the world's economy.\n\"Escalating trade conflicts, geopolitical tensions and related uncertainty are contributing to the broad-based slowdown of global economic activity,\" the bank said in its report.\nThe wider trade-related fights and, in some cases, direct actions are having an impact on Canada.\nChina's recent trade actions on meat and canola products from Canada are expected to lower exports by 0.2 per cent, the bank said. The changes, including stricter inspections on Canadian goods by Chinese authorities, have come amid a bilateral diplomatic dispute.\nThe bank predicted economic growth in Canada this year of 1.3 per cent, up slightly from its April forecast of 1.2 per cent, and an expansion of 1.9 per cent in 2020, down from its previous call of 2.1 per cent.\nThe Bank of Canada raised its forecast for second-quarter growth to annual pace of 2.3 per cent, up from its April projection of 1.3 per cent, following the stronger-than-expected rebound from the slowdown at the start of the year. It predicted growth an annual pace of 1.5 per cent for the third quarter.\nThe unexpectedly robust bounce back, the bank said, was due to temporary factors such as a recovery from weather-related weaknesses and a boost in oil production.\nConsumption in Canada is being supported by the healthy job market and rising wages, while the housing market at a country-wide level is stabilizing, the bank said. In addition, climate-related incentive payments from the federal government, which are front-loaded, could also provide a temporary boost to household spending.\nThe Canadian economy ran at close to full tilt for most of 2017 and 2018 \u2014 a stretch that saw Poloz hike the interest rate five times. A sharp drop in oil prices in late 2018 prompted the bank to hit pause and it hasn't raised the rate since last October.\nCandice Bangsund, vice-president and portfolio manager\u00a0of global asset allocation for\u00a0Fiera Capital, said the Bank of Canada's decision not to cut rates is \"largely justified given the latest economic developments in Canada.\"\n\"Oil production has recommenced, exports have spiked, business confidence has improved, and domestic conditions remain stable thanks to supportive labour market trends (record-low unemployment,\u00a0surging wages),\" Bangsund said in a written statement.\nBrian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, said the monetary report and interest rate decision support TD's view that the Bank of Canada \"will stand pat\" on rates as the domestic economy settles into a steady pattern of growth.\n\"They would likely need to see more of the downside risks materialize in hard data to alter that position, with trade tensions topping the list,\" he said in a written response to the update.\nJames Laird, co-founder of Ratehub Inc. and president of CanWise Financial mortgage brokerage, said the announcement is \"welcome news for Canadians considering a variable rate mortgage.\"\n\"In the absence of major economic changes, the bank seems intent to maintain this policy interest rate in the near future,\" he said in a written statement.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Finding a job far from home without moving house: Don Pittis", "description": "Tech is changing how people work \u2014 and location is no longer the deciding factor", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/employment-remote-work-1.5269792", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5269934.1567610600!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/allie-turow-remote-worker-at-her-home-in-belleville-on.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Sep 05, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-09T14:28:40.764Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When Allie Turow's partner got transferred from Saskatchewan's 15 Wing Moose Jaw to a job flying giant Hercules transport aircraft at CFB Trenton\u00a0on the shores of Lake Ontario, she faced a modern dilemma.\nAfter settling into nearby Belleville, Ont., the 25-year-old university graduate had to go out and find a new job.\n\"I was looking at the job market in Belleville and there wasn't what I wanted,\" she said.\u00a0\nShe wasn't yet thinking that she would become part of a global wave of employees\u00a0whose physical location is unconnected to the place they work.\nWhen Canadian jobs numbers come out tomorrow, they will include thousands of people like Turow, who live and\u00a0work in one city or country, but whose employer is based\u00a0far away.\nLed by the tech industry and served by high-speed internet\u00a0and digital tools,\u00a0location\u00a0of employment has begun to fade in importance as employees\u00a0interact in a virtual space instead.\u00a0\nThanks to\u00a0upstart firms like co-working office space group\u00a0WeWork and remote communication software provider Slack, the trend is becoming increasingly apparent.\nThe person on the computer at the next caf\u00e9 table to you may be working for a company in New York.\nThe exact size of the phenomenon is hard to track; Statistics Canada doesn't currently collect data on how many Canadians work remotely.\nWorking from home is by no means new. For authors, artists\u00a0and freelance journalists, it has often been the rule rather than the exception. Even before the computer age, some people with special skills found ways of using the telephone, fax and Fedex to do their job from a home office.\nBut\u00a0more and more, jobs on employment aggregators require familiarity with project management software, such as Basecamp or Slack\u00a0\u2014\u00a0created to allow remote teams working on software projects to share ideas on virtual whiteboards or to collaborate in chat rooms categorized by project or shared task.\nThe technique is ideal for teams building software, where steps must be created and physically documented by individual engineers working alone during periods of intense concentration before being vetted and tested by a larger group. Even in companies where everyone gets a desk, software engineers usually keep in touch\u00a0through a system like Slack.\nThe practice has become so widespread\u00a0that GitLab, a tech company that provides software-sharing repositories\u00a0for NASA, IBM and many others,\u00a0boasts it is 100 per cent remote.\u00a0\nGitLab\u00a0has created what it calls the \"Remote Manifesto,\" which, among other things, calls for no central location for the company, flexible working hours for everyone, \"asynchronous communication\"\u00a0and compensation measured by results rather than hours worked.\n\"The future of work is remote,\" declares Carol Teskey, a member of the company's \"people team\" in a video posted to the company's website.\nTurow's employer, Page Zero Media,\u00a0does have a physical office in Toronto.\u00a0But company founder Andrew Goodman points out that he has clients around the world, so why can't the same be true of his employees. His second and third in command\u00a0live in Vancouver and St. Louis, Mo., part of a team of 16 people, mostly scattered across Canada.\nFrom the beginning, Goodman says he was \"tolerant\" of remote workers.\u00a0But then his partner got a tenure track job at the University of New Brunswick,\u00a0so he went remote himself.\n\"It worked out very nicely,\" recalled Goodman, whose company specializes in helping advertisers get the best results in the complex world of online ad placement. \"We sold our house in Toronto. We got a cheaper and nicer house in Fredericton.\"\nNow he spends one week a month in Toronto, where he keeps a flat, working out of the company's newly acquired office space.\n\"The rest of the time I'm pretty much at my home office, with the big screen, talking on the phone, collaborating with both staff and clients\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and everyone's getting more and more used to that,\" said\u00a0Goodman.\nClearly not every job and every person is suited to remote working. Loneliness can be a factor for some;\u00a0will power to get up and get to work is essential.\u00a0But for those who can make it work, there are advantages for both employees and employers.\nOne advantage for Goodman, he says, is getting top quality staff without paying the six-figure salaries often needed to compete for workers in a high-cost city.\nFor Turow, who says she has spoken frankly with Toronto\u00a0friends in similar jobs who are not paid as well,\u00a0her comfortable, modern house would\u00a0be unaffordable in Canada's largest city.\n\"I already end up financially better off,\" she said.\u00a0And trips twice a month into the city for \"office days\" gives her a chance to catch up with friends.\nBut just as Goodman looked outside Toronto for talent, U.S. tech giants are discovering the advantages of remote workers in Canada.

My mum and I were on the 32C bus and as it turned out of Eglinton West station, the sound of reggae music caught my attention. When I looked out the window, my eyes widened. Flags seemed to hang from every window, barrels piled in front of doorways, BBQ\u00a0grills spewed smoke into the air.\u00a0Voices with accents from Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad, Grenada and St. Lucia could be heard and people \u2014Black people \u2014\u00a0lined the streets. My mum and I wondered aloud what was going on. Was it a festival? A street party? An old woman next\u00a0to us chuckled. Apparently what we were witnessing was just an average day in the neighbourhood I later learned was called Little Jamaica.\nThat memory of a vibrant, pulsating and dynamic community is what inspired writer and director Sharine Taylor to create her new documentary short Tallawah Abroad: Remembering Little Jamaica which premiered earlier this week at the Montreal Black Film Festival. Taylor moved out of the neighbourhood and into the suburbs as a child, so when she returned almost two decades later in 2017, she was stunned to see the transformation. Shuttered storefronts, clouds of dust and cranes reaching to the sky were now the features that characterized Eglinton West.\u00a0\n\"I was really taken aback by everything,\" she told me during a phone interview earlier this week. \"There's nobody there.\" Taylor is following the footsteps of other Toronto based artists like photographer Jon Black and writer Zalika Reid-Benta who are doing the urgent work of documenting the Caribbean-Canadian community before it disappears.\nLittle Jamaica's devolution into a virtual ghost town is a direct result of the ambitious, costly and several-times delayed transit project: the Eglinton Crosstown Light Rail Transit.\u00a0 Years of noisy construction, constant road closures and hijacked sidewalks have led to a plunge in revenue for the local businesses that once populated the area. Hair salons, barbershops, Caribbean grocery stores, clothing stores, music stories and restaurants have experienced plummeting revenues, forcing some to close their doors forever.\u00a0\u00a0\nTallawah Abroad follows Vernal Small, a tailor whose shop has been open on the corner of Oakwood Avenue and Eglinton West for over four decades. His frank and sorrowful tone when discussing the disruption that the construction has caused to his business is a quietly devastating reminder of the very real and human consequences that are a result of this construction. \"There were people that I spoke to who were just like, 'I've given up. I'm not even trying to fight anymore. They've taken so much from me,'\" Taylor said. \"That's a really hard thing to negotiate.\"\nIn the mid-twentieth century, when Black immigrants from the Caribbean began arriving in large numbers to the city, they settled in areas such as Bathurst and Bloor, the community around Jane and Finch\u00a0and of course\u00a0Eglinton West. At a time when wide-spread housing discrimination was the\u00a0norm, these geographic enclaves became spaces of refuge and belonging where communities, institutions and culture was built.\u00a0\n\"When my grandma first came to Toronto in the '70s, [Eglinton West] was a place that she frequented to get specific brands or food items that weren't as widely available as they are now.\" Taylor told me over the phone. \"My aunt used to drag me there every weekend when she was getting her hair and nails done. My mom used to go there to get certain groceries. For it to not have the same feel as it did in the past is really disheartening.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nMy mum and I moved to the area a few years after visiting, yearning for that sense of community we couldn't find in the suburbs. When I purchased my first home, I chose one\u00a0in the neighbourhood, still wanting to remain within walking distance of roti shops and stores where I could find raw shea butter. Growing up I recall the crowds that would flood the streets of Eglinton West for Kiddies Carnival. I remember standing in front of Randy's Patties with friends after school or meeting up with a crush at\u00a0Trea-Jah-Isle record shop.\u00a0 I wonder about the future of many of these businesses, especially those that don't own their buildings. The transit line brings with it an increase in property value and that can often lead to a spike in rental prices.\nA recent graduate paper\u00a0by Debbie Gordon on the transformation of Little Jamaica considers the stated goals of the transit project and argues that \"their primary focus is on developing infrastructure to maximize profit opportunities along the Eglinton Crosstown's route for commercial and real estate investors.\" There is a language that is used in many of these transit proposals. It's a language that may not utilize the term 'revitalization' but exploits its meaning constantly. Gordon challenges that language and the ethos of progress that it asserts (because of course in Toronto condos = progress) writing, \"Considering historical precedents around transit development, these developments most likely foreshadow Little Jamaica's displacement and erasure rather than its improvement.\"\nThere's a saying in Toronto that there are only two seasons in the city: winter and construction season. It's a wry observation of the ongoing construction and development happening everywhere. In a city dominated by condos and glass skyscrapers that seems to have little regard for history or cultural memory, it can be easy to categorize the destruction of Little Jamaica as yet another victim of this widespread rush to development.\u00a0 However Gordon argues that Eglinton West needs to be examined through another, more historical lens.\nAs the home to such a large and concentrated population of Black people who built communities, businesses and institutions in the area, its dismantling points to a more insidious pattern. She lists the destruction of Africville in Nova Scotia and Hogan's Alley in Vancouver, the renaming of Negro Creek Road to Moggie Road in Holland Township, Ontario and the ploughing over of the Black Durhan Road Cemetery in Southwestern Ontario as incidents that point to Canada's pattern of consistent erasing and displacing of Black communities.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"One of the larger questions that I wanted to prompt in this is whose spaces get marked as spaces that are in need of preservation,\" Taylor says of her film. In 2014, the City of Toronto named the historic alleyway at Eglinton and Oakwood \"Reggae Lane\" and a 1,200 square foot mural by artist Adrian Hayles was created in recognition of its storied history as a hub for Jamaican migrants and reggae music in the 70s and 80s. However in Tallawah Abroad, Zalika Reid-Benta questions the intention behind naming this space, wondering if it was done to commemorate a community that would no longer be there. \"I wanted for people to think about gentrification without explicitly saying it,\" Taylor tells me. \"It's so obvious that this is what it is. It works in such secret and silent ways too. When areas get 'revitalized'\u00a0there's a whole other set of politics that come with it. All these things become available but it's definitely at the expense of pushing the original inhabitants of the space out.\"\nI rode the 32C bus for the first time in many years last month. This time the sounds of reggae music were replaced by jackhammering and rumbling drills. Entire buildings were knocked down, countless store fronts were covered up and although the streets weren't empty, they were a shell of the vibrant, colourful and dynamic neighbourhood that my mother and I fell in love with. I wondered about future generations who may not have a Little Jamaica and where they would find their spaces of physical and geographic Caribbean community. \u00a0\n\"I want people to know that we have a storied history and ties to that space,\" Taylor told me. \"I guess I'm asking folks to ponder a little bit more about what kinds of spaces go through this process and what's at stake when things like this happen.\"\nTallawah Abroad: Remembering Little Jamaica premiered earlier this week at the Montreal Black Film Festival. It will also screen at the Toronto Black Film Festival and the Halifax Black Film Festival in February 2020\n"}, {"author": "Elizabeth Fraser, Bobbi-Jean MacKinnon", "title": "N.B.

The party says the net-zero plan\u00a0would be based on the advice of scientists, economists and other experts, as well as consultations with Canadians. To date, there have been few details on how those targets will be met, but Trudeau said other announcements will roll out through the week.\nNet-zero means some sectors could still emit carbon pollution, but those emissions would be offset by other actions such as planting trees.\nThe Liberal plan also promises\u00a0to exceed Canada's 2030 emissions goal.\nTrudeau is also announcing a Liberal government would ensure all federal buildings run on clean electricity by 2022, and that the government would strengthen green procurement policies and leverage bulk\u00a0purchasing power to drive clean technology.\nAccording to the Liberal Party, the clean tech tax measure would cost about $15 million in 2020-21 and rise\u00a0to about $67 million by 2023-24. The other measures Trudeau announced would be paid for\u00a0by current departmental resources, the party said.\nThe Liberal Party said costing details would be released over the course of the campaign. The party has not released a costing analysis carried out by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, as the Conservatives and NDP\u00a0have been doing with their announcements.\nTrudeau said climate change is the great global challenge of the age and tried to frame the choice Canadian voters have to make in the upcoming election as one between ambition and complacency.\n\"Do you want to be represented by a team that has a serious, ambitious plan that is committed to do more, or do you want a team of climate deniers with no long-term vision for Canada's environmental and economic future?\" he said.\nEarlier today, Ottawa Centre Liberal candidate Catherine McKenna, who has been serving as federal environment minister, said Canadians have a stark choice to make on climate policy in this election.\n\"Conservative politicians want to stop this progress. They want to follow (Ontario Premier) Doug Ford's example, where it's free to pollute, where we cancel programs that are helping businesses, schools, hospitals, people save money and do right by the environment,\" she said during a campaign event at a local Ottawa company that transitions homes and businesses to solar power.\n\"That is exactly what [Conservative Leader] Andrew Scheer would do, too.\"\nPressed by reporters on how the Liberals would achieve the ambitious targets, McKenna was light on specifics. She would not say if pursuing a net-zero target would require an increase in the carbon tax, or what penalties could\u00a0be imposed for not meeting legislated emissions targets.\nMcKenna said the path forward would\u00a0be charted by an expert panel, adding climate change represents both a moral responsibility and an economic opportunity for Canada.\n\"We may not know exactly how to get there, but that's the same of all the countries that have committed to this and the businesses,\" she said.\n\"But we will figure this out, and the way we will do this is by having a serious climate plan with credible and pragmatic action, by listening to the experts and, most of all, listening to young people in the streets who are saying, 'Are you going to act for our future?'\"\nMillions of young people have\u00a0taken to the streets in about 150 countries around the world demanding that world leaders adopt urgent measures to avert an environmental catastrophe.\nThe worldwide action was inspired by 16-year-old\u00a0Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who castigated national\u00a0leaders at the United Nations on Monday for their failure to combat climate change.\nThe climate change plan would include bringing in something called a \"Just Transition Act\" to give workers in affected sectors access to training, support and new opportunities to adapt to the transforming economy.\nIn August, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May offered a similar proposal to transition oil and gas sector workers to green energy jobs.\nKey to the Liberal climate change action plan is the carbon tax, which\u00a0set a minimum carbon price of $20 per tonne this year, increasing $10 a year to $50 by 2022. The federal government imposed the tax on businesses and individuals in provinces with no federally approved carbon pricing\u00a0plan. In those provinces, the government is handing back carbon tax rebates to most residents. Several provinces have challenged the tax in court challenges without success.\nThe Conservatives are campaigning against the carbon tax, calling it a \"Liberal tax grab\" that hikes costs for consumers.\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said his first act in government would be to scrap the tax.\nAsked to respond to the Liberal announcement today, Scheer said Trudeau is a \"master at improv\" and accused the Liberals of making up policy on the fly without providing details on how it would work. He said that, under the Liberals, Canada would fall behind in the climate change fight because of the carbon tax that he says is driving up the cost of living for Canadians.\n\"We are committed to the targets that we signed on to. That is our plan and our plan gives the best chance to Canada of succeeding,\" he said during a campaign stop in Thorold, Ont.\nThe NDP has said it would keep carbon pricing in place, double funding for disaster mitigation caused by climate change and create 300,000 new green jobs in infrastructure, transit, housing and renewable energy as part of its environmental plan.\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh accused Trudeau of offering \"nice words\" and \"pretty promises\" that are not backed up by action.\n\"No one believes that Mr. Trudeau is going to actually follow through on those commitments,\" he said during a campaign stop in Winnipeg. \"We believe that we have to take action and now we are committed to moving away from fossil fuels. We know the future for our country and for the world is a future where we are not burning carbon for fuel.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jamie Malbeuf", "title": "Soaring condo insurance rates help push Fort McMurray homeowner into bankruptcy", "description": "'There's not anything we can do anymore,' Kaleena Carriere says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/fort-mcmurray-bankruptcy-condo-insurance-1.5393448", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5393453.1576115316!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/kaleena-carriere.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 15, 2019 6:00 AM MT", "2019-12-16T03:27:34.127Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A woman says she walked away from her Fort McMurray condo after skyrocketing insurance costs became \"the final straw\" in her battle to keep the home.\nKaleena Carriere, 31, bought her townhouse-style condo in April 2014. It was her first home. Now the bank owns it and the locks have been changed.\nIn September of this year, Carriere received a letter from the Cedarwoods Condominium Corporation explaining that the board had struggled to find an insurer to cover the complex.\nThe lone policy on offer came at a high cost, yet only promised coverage for a fraction of the complex's $65-million appraised value. The condo board accepted the offer.\nAs an owner, Carriere was hit with a $6,000 special assessment \u2014 six months of $1,000 payments \u2014 to cover her share of the insurance premium. It was a hit she couldn't take.\nThe condo board got only one quote from an insurer and it came with a premium of\u00a0$925,000 for the whole complex. It\u00a0struggled to get an insurer because it's considered \"high risk.\" In the last three years the complex made four insurance claims totalling $11.7 million. Two were related to the 2016 wildfire, one was a water claim and the last was another small fire.\u00a0\nIt's a problem that has been facing many condo boards in the regional municipality of Wood Buffalo in the wake of the Fort McMurray fire.\nIn July, Carriere and her husband had left Fort McMurray for work. They moved in with her dad in Kamloops, but they were still keeping up with payments on the condo, which was registered in her name.\n\"We've been struggling for the last year,\" she told CBC News. \"Then we got this letter and it was just kind of the final straw. OK, we're going to lose the house. There's not anything we can do anymore.\"\nEvery month Carriere was making mortgage payments of $1,800, plus $450 in condo fees, $300 for heat, $100 for personal liability insurance and $50 for municipal services.\u00a0\nPaying another $1,000 a month wasn't an option. In a Facebook post, Carriere said she stopped making payments on her home and \"accepted that the bank was going to take it from me.\"\n\"I didn't believe it,\" Carriere told CBC. \"I cried when I came to the realization that this was happening.\"\nCarriere said she considered selling the condo, but figures she would have ended up deep in debt.\nShe had paid $350,000 for the home but believes it is now worth less than $200,000 because of declining property values in Fort McMurray.\nIn a statement of claim, her bank alleges she still owed $278,000 on her mortgage when she stopped making payments.\nIn Alberta, condominium boards must carry insurance on all units and common property against loss resulting from destruction or damage caused by fire, lightning, windstorms, hail, explosions, water damage and other perils. The coverage must be for replacement cost value. Owners pay the insurance costs through their condo fees.\u00a0\nThe Cedarwoods condo board was offered $10 million of coverage, even though the appraised value of the 156-townhome complex was $65 million. That's despite the insurance premium of $925,000.\nIn 2018, the board had been able to get\u00a0insurance coverage for the full property appraisal at a cost of $142,000.\nDan Edwards, vice-chair of the Cedarwoods condo board, said the board got only one insurance offer and had to take it, in an effort to comply with the Alberta Condominium Property Act.\n\"You have to accept it whether you like it or not,\" said Edwards, who owns a condo in the complex. \"I can't make an insurance company offer me insurance.\n\"No one wanted to pay this.\"\nEdwards said if there's a disaster that destroys everyone's property, the board doesn't have enough coverage to rebuild and everyone \"will likely be out on the street.\"\n\"We don't understand what's going on. We're all hurt by this,\" he said.\nHe's not sure what the legal ramifications of not having enough coverage are because this is \"uncharted territory,\" he said.\nEdwards said the board is still working with a lawyer and trying to come up with a solution to get full coverage at a reasonable price.\nEdmonton lawyer Robert Noce said owners of Cedarwoods condos should be worried.\nThe condo board's decision to accept insurance coverage that only accounts for one sixth of the appraised value is so uncommon that he's never heard of it happening before, Noce said.\n\"It's impossible to think that an insurer would only insure a portion of that, knowing full well that the value of the property is significantly higher,\" Noce said. \"I can't think of any board, individual board members, that would be so negligent and expose themselves to personal liability by making such a decision.\"\nOwners and the condo board should immediately seek legal advice, he said.\n\"I would truly hope that that particular condominium corporation has sought legal advice to protect them from what will inevitably be exposure at a personal level of the board members if they can't get this issue resolved.\"\nIn October, Wood Buffalo councillors voted to lobby the provincial and federal governments in an attempt to ensure that condo boards are able to secure complete, affordable insurance coverage.\nAdam Hardiman, spokesperson for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, confirmed the municipality sent letters to members of Parliament, local MLAs and the prime minister's office, among others.\u00a0\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Mayor Don Scott said the lack of affordable condo insurance options is quickly becoming a crisis\u00a0that will affect other parts of Canada, \"particularly those that have experienced flooding or wildfire.\"\nRob de Pruis, director of consumer and industry relations with the Insurance Bureau of Canada, said in an email that IBC is still talking to insurance companies and government about solutions for condo insurance.\n\"We understand the seriousness of this issue and we are doing everything we can to address individual circumstances,\" de Pruis said.\nThe government says it's still working with insurance providers about the issue, and Finance Minister Travis Toews has \"asked industry to work to find solutions for condominium owners in the region,\" Service Alberta representative Tricia Velthuizen said in an emailed statement.\nCarriere said it's unlikely she'll be able to buy a house again for years. She received an outpouring of support after posting about her bankruptcy on Facebook. She said dozens of people told her they were going through the same thing.\n\"There needs to be some sort of cap on insurance for housing,\" Carriere said. \"There needs to be some regulation or something from the government that stops this from happening, because it's not just me.\n\"There's tons of my friends \u2026 tons of my neighbours. It saddens me that it's not as public as it should be.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Election winner will choose new ambassador - and possibly a reset with Washington", "description": "The Canada Votes newsletter is your weekly tip-sheet as we count down to Oct. 21", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-votes-newsletter-week18-1.5242542", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5028510.1565278749!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cda-us-trade-20190219.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 11, 2019 4:00 PM ET", "2019-08-11T20:00:00.302Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Katie Simpson, Senior reporter\nEver heard of dry January?\nIt's an attempt by those who practice new year's resolutions to swear off alcohol for the first month of the year.\nNot that I want to fulfil stereotypes, but as a journalist, I've never been successful in doing a full dry month.\nJust for fun, I often joke around with some of the producers at Power & Politics, that I'm going to do dry July, or dry August, which we have dubbed \"draugust.\"\u00a0\nWhy is it a joke?

It is something Canada agrees with, though the Trudeau government's official position is that it does not support re-opening the deal, since it could mean other aspects of the agreement are tinkered with.\nThis echoes a debate that emerged in the 2015 campaign \u2014 when then-prime minister Stephen Harper announced Canada would be a part of the new Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade pact between pacific rim countries.\nShortly after the announcement, then NDP leader Tom Mulcair set off on an anti-TPP whistle-stop tour, visiting a half- dozen cities in southern Ontario.\u00a0\nWhile trade did not dominate the last campaign, expect it to pop up this go around.\u00a0\nNow, if you read all this on an August day, you deserve a drink.

After all, over the last three elections three different parties have won the most seats in the province.\nBut it's Newfoundland and Labrador that has suffered the most serious cases of whiplash over the last 15 years.\nSince 2004, no province has had a bigger average shift in support per party between elections than Newfoundland and Labrador.\nMajor parties have seen their share of the popular vote fluctuate by an average of 12 percentage points between one election and the next in the province.\nIn 2008, Premier Danny Williams' 'Anything but Conservative' campaign contributed to a 26-point decline in support for that party compared to the 2006 election. The NDP picked up most of that slack, surging 20 points.\nThere was another big move in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2015, when the Liberals jumped 27 points from their 2011 performance. The NDP dropped 12 points and the Conservatives fell 18 points as a result.\nDouble-digit wobbles for the Conservatives in 2006 and 2011 helped cement Newfoundland and Labrador as the province that has gone back and forth the most over the last few elections. But despite all that movement, there hasn't been a significant number of seats changing hands.\nThat's perhaps where Quebec has earned its reputation. The average fluctuation for each party between elections has been about 10 points since 2004, with enormous implications for party standings in the House of Commons.\nThe next two swing-iest on the list are New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\nThe province with the least swing? You could probably guess that one \u2014 it's Alberta, where parties have averaged a shift of less than five points between elections.\nAt this stage, at least, it looks like these provinces are going to hold true to form. The polls suggest big changes are in store in Atlantic Canada and Quebec, while the political map in Alberta might only see a few minor adjustments come October.\nPerhaps some things never change \u2014 including where things change the most.\nTap here to go to the\u00a0Canada Votes Poll Tracker\nOwenquann on Instagram asks: Will there be online voting? \nThe short answer is no. There won't be online voting in this election.\u00a0\nRemember that committee of MPs studying whether to change Canada's voting system? Along with recommending a referendum on proportional representation (a recommendation the government ignored), they also studied the possibility of online voting.\u00a0\nTheir conclusion: Don't do it.\u00a0\u00a0\nTheir report pointed to security concerns about online voting and unequal access to reliable internet across the country as just some of the reasons not to move to online voting.\u00a0\nAlthough the federal election won't have online voting, other jurisdictions are moving in that direction.\u00a0\nPeople in the Northwest Territories will elect 19 members to the N.W.T. Legislative Assembly in October \u2014 and it will be the first provincial or territorial election to use online voting in a general election. Voters can use a new website to vote online, as long as they've registered for an absentee ballot beforehand.\nSecurity experts have sounded the alarm about that election, but the company behind the voting site says it is safe for an election the size of N.W.T.'s.\u00a0\nIf things go smoothly in that election, maybe the federal government might take another look at online voting, but for now you'll have to vote the old fashioned way.\u00a0\nOf course, information on how to do that is available online.\u00a0\n\u2014 Tyler Buist, Producer\nHave a question about the October election?

It's a military and political alliance, formed after the Second World War, between Europe and North America. At NATO's heart is the concept of collective defence, enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty that created it. It means that an attack against one NATO member is regarded as an attack against all of them.\nNATO has taken some heat over the past few years from Trump. The president has suggested the U.S. could withdraw from the alliance, questioned the utility of Article 5 and called member states \"delinquent\" in their defence spending.\nHe's not entirely alone on that last point; former presidents like Barack Obama also have come down on allies like Canada for not spending enough on defence, arguing the U.S. has to do too much of the heavy lifting.\nCanada appeared at first to be responding to Trump's goading on defence spending. The Trudeau government released its defence policy in 2017, promising a 70 per cent increase in defence spending over a number of years.\nBut that timeline is important. A lot of that spending is contingent on whether projects go ahead as planned. The nightmare that is military procurement in this country (ships, jets - you know what I mean) doesn't exactly bode well for any timetable.\nCanada's spending on defence this year amounts to 1.23 per cent of this country's GDP. There was a loose agreement among NATO members to shoot for the 2 per cent mark.\nWe aren't the only ones missing that mark, of course. According to NATO's latest analysis, only seven of the 29 member countries hit that target. They include the U.S., the U.K. and Greece.\nThis stuff matters as far as the 'rules-based international order' goes - but will it matter in the next federal election? Traditionally, defence issues aren't a big factor for Canadian voters.\nI remember asking an expert about that in the midst of one of our fighter jet procurement controversies: billions of taxpayer dollars on the table, millions misspent - why wasn't it bothering people more? He told me Canadians like to see themselves as peaceful people (or at least they like the image), while the sums involved are too big, too abstract to really matter at the polls.\nWhat might lift the defence file to the level of an actual election issue in 2019 is the government's handling of the military itself. I'm thinking particularly of Mark Norman, the former second in command of the military, and everything that's happened in his case over the past few months.\nNorman was accused of leaking cabinet secrets, investigated, charged and suspended from his job. Ultimately, the charge against him was dropped. Along the way, his legal team accused the Prime Minister's Office of withholding evidence and meddling in the case. Norman's case had ended but it wasn't clear if he'd get his old job back. Turns out Gen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's top soldier, was going to reinstate Norman - and Norman's replacement wasn't happy with that.\nIn the end, Norman settled with the government (no details were released); he won't be going back to his old job. But the man who replaced him, Lt. Gen. Paul Wynnyk, was so put off by the whole experience he decided to leave his job early. Basically, it's all a huge mess.\nWill Canadians buy the Opposition's claim that this is a mess created by the Liberals, that the military is in disarray because of unnecessary politicking? I don't know, but disarray in the Canadian military certainly strikes closer to home than NATO and defence spending. Stability in the military's top ranks really matters to the men and women tasked with defending our country. It might also turn out to matter to voters in October.\u00a0\nVassy Kapelos is host of Power & Politics, weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on CBC News Network.\nThe Power & Politics Power Panellists on where the big parties will be focused this week\nAmanda Alvaro,\u00a0president and co-founder of Pomp & Circumstance\nLiberals and Justin Trudeau, at the 100-day countdown to Election Day, are launching the largest Day of Action so far of 2019. Hundreds of Liberal teams across Canada will be on the doorsteps connecting with Canadians about the clear choice in this election, between the Liberal plan to invest in the middle class and the Conservative plan to go backward with cuts to vital services.\nRachel Curran,\u00a0senior associate at Harper & Associates Consulting\nThe Conservatives will be focused next week on an emergency meeting of the Public Safety Committee, which Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer pushed for, to discuss the massive data breach at Desjardins Group. They will also be highlighting agricultural issues, including ongoing trade access problems between Canada and China, ahead of the mid-July FPT Agriculture Ministers' Conference in Quebec City.\nKathleen Monk,\u00a0principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group\nNew Democrats will be in Canada's manufacturing heartland this week. The manufacturing sector has been dealt some serious blows in 2019 and folks are frustrated that politicians keep pointing fingers at one another. Jagmeet Singh will campaign alongside NDP candidate Malcolm Allen in Welland, Ont. to announce a plan to return those good, family-supporting manufacturing jobs to Canada.\n\u00c9ric Grenier's weekly look at key numbers in the political public opinion polls.\u00a0\nThe gap between the Conservatives and Liberals is narrowing \u2014 and it's mostly because of Ontario.\nA couple of polls this past week gave the Liberals the national edge over the Conservatives. It's possible that the political environment has flipped from the Conservative lead that has prevailed for the past five months.\nBut some caution is called for here. Mainstreet Research and Nanos Research, the two pollsters that put the Liberals ahead last week, have tended to post better results for the Liberals than other polling firms.\nConfirmation of a Liberal lead would have to wait until more pollsters weigh in \u2014 particularly those that have been less bullish on the Liberals in the past.\nNevertheless, the Poll Tracker is moving and the margin between the two parties is now just 2.9 percentage points. In the June 10 update, that gap was 5.7 points.\nMost of the shift can be chalked up to Ontario. The Conservatives have slipped 2.7 points there since June\u00a010, while the Liberals have gained 3.1 points \u2014 a total swing of nearly six points that's responsible for most of the movement we've seen in the national numbers.\nThe Liberals now lead in Ontario with 36.7 per cent in the Poll Tracker, compared to 32.4 per cent for the Conservatives.\nThe dial also has moved in a similar direction in most other parts of the country, particularly in Alberta, the wider Prairies and in Atlantic Canada. But it's Ontario that has the biggest electoral implications.\nThat's why \u2014 despite the Conservatives still leading by just under three points nationwide \u2014 it's virtually a toss-up as to which party would win the most seats if an election were held today.\nThey don't call Ontario \"seat-rich\"\u00a0for nothing.\nTap here to go to the full poll tracker\u00a0\nWe want to know what YOU want to know\nIrene Beaupr\u00e9 asks: What are the Conservatives, NDP and Greens promising on Indigenous issues? Are they committed to following the recommendations of the TRC? Are the Liberals promising to continue with their commitments to First Nations?\nHistorically, federal political parties haven't done all that much to court Indigenous voters. The First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit demographics have seen some of the lowest voter turnout rates \u2014 no doubt owing to a legacy of mistrust between many of them and a federal government that didn't always have their best interests in mind (the Indian residential school experience and the Inuit tuberculous policy are two obvious cases in point).\nIndeed, status Indians\u00a0\u2014\u00a0First Nations peoples with 'status' under the Indian Act \u2014 weren't even allowed to vote until reforms were pushed through by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in 1960 to extend the franchise.\nIn the modern era of reconciliation, ushered in by the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) final report documenting the horrors of residential schools, there has been a shift in Indigenous voting patterns.\nIn the 2015 federal election, First Nations members living on reserve voted in record numbers, recording a massive 14 point jump in participation, from 47.4 per cent in 2011 to 60.2 per cent in 2015. While that's still much lower than the overall voter turnout rate of 69.1 per cent, a new generation of First Nations people was clearly motivated to vote. In 2015, Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde reversed what he called a long-standing practice and cast a ballot in a federal election.\nTo that end, political parties, particularly those on the centre-left, have made more of an effort to champion Indigenous policy options to court a growing voter bloc. The 33 federal ridings with substantial Indigenous populations could be very important to the fates of all the major parties, especially with Liberals and Conservatives deadlocked in the most recent polls.\nLiberal Party\nThe current Liberal government has had a mixed record on Indigenous issues. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau clearly made reconciliation a top priority, investing billions of dollars in new money in program spending (in the last federal budget alone, 25 per cent of all new spending was earmarked for Indigenous-related initiatives). His government has lifted 58 of 105 long-term drinking water advisories on-reserve, committed $333 million over five years to revitalize Indigenous languages, passed legislation to begin reforming a badly broken child welfare system, signed a host of self-government agreements and made a series of apologies for past wrongs against Indigenous people.\nIt's a good record by many measures \u2014 but it's undermined by Trudeau's conflict with former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, the first Indigenous person to hold such an important cabinet position, and by the government's championing of some natural resources projects (hello, Trans Mountain!) against the will of coastal First Nations in B.C. And even with the new investments, Indigenous activists have argued that much more money is needed to end persistent inequities.\nLook for the Liberals to propose further, deeper reforms to the Canadian state during the election campaign, including measures to enact the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) inquiry's \"calls for justice\" to address systemic levels of violence.\nConservative Party\nThe Conservatives have not been as vocal on the Indigenous file \u2014 Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said the word \"Indigenous\" only seven times in the House of Commons over the last four years \u2014 but former Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose signalled a shift early in the last Parliament by dropping the party's longstanding opposition to an MMIWG inquiry.\u00a0\nThe party's Indigenous critic, B.C. MP Cathy McLeod, said that while the party doesn't agree with the inquiry's final \"genocide\" finding, a government led by Scheer would draw up its own proposal to implement those \"calls for justice.\"\nTrue to form, the Conservative Party also has said that it will champion oil and gas projects \u2014 and energy infrastructure initiatives like the Indigenous-led Eagle Spirit pipeline \u2014 to bring more wealth and prosperity to remote Indigenous communities that have few economic opportunities beyond the natural resources sector.\nIn 2015, the Conservative platform had three pages of specific Indigenous proposals \u2014 including a promise to establish a property ownership regime for those reserves that want it, and pitches to expand anti-gang programming and rural broadband services. Scheer could very well recommit to those promises and build on them.\nThe NDP\nThe New Democratic Party has been a champion of Indigenous issues in this Parliament, with the party's MPs frequently lambasting the prime minister and his ministers for perceived inaction. They successfully pushed the government to begin fully implementing 'Jordan's Principle' to ensure equal funding for Indigenous kids in health care and other social services, and to end discriminatory practices in the child welfare system.\nJagmeet Singh will likely look to continue the party's strong legacy on the First Nations file by promising to introduce government legislation to enact the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (as the Liberals also have promised to do) and kill pipeline projects they think lack sufficient Indigenous support. The most important aspect of the NDP's Indigenous policy platform is the idea of spending more to tackle the on-reserve housing 'crisis' that has left so many First Nations people without adequate shelter.\nThe Green Party\nElizabeth May's Green Party also has said it will act on Indigenous issues if elected but their proposals to this point have faced criticisms. Robert Jago, a prominent Montreal-based Indigenous writer, businessperson and member of the Nooksack Tribe and Kwantlen First Nation, called them \"thin, unrealistic and riddled with embarrassing errors\" in a piece for the B.C.-based online news outlet The Tyee. The party's \"Vision Green\" platform proposes a phase-out of the Indian Act, \"ideally in less than 10 years,\" and better accommodation of Indigenous interests with respect to natural resources projects.\n\u2014 John Paul Tasker, senior writer\nHave a question about the October election?

Without immediate action, there will be more outbreaks and avoidable deaths in these settings, Tam said on Twitter.\nCanada had more than 31,000 confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19\u00a0as of Friday afternoon. And while health officials have expressed some cautious optimism that public health measures are slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus, some provinces and regions are still scrambling to meet the needs of vulnerable populations.\nQuebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said\u00a0Thursday that about 2,000 specialist doctors had signed up to help provide care to the elderly. But he\u00a0noted that integrating the physicians into the system will come with challenges.\u00a0\n\"It will not necessarily be easy, especially in conditions that are really exceptional.

Premiers\u00a0were\u00a0to discuss the issue of how to improve staffing with Trudeau on a call Thursday night. While most cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus,\u00a0are mild to moderate, seniors and people with underlying health issues are more at risk of severe disease and death.\u00a0\nAs of\u00a010 p.m.\u00a0ET on Friday, Canada had 31,927 presumptive and confirmed coronavirus cases. The provinces and territories that provide data on recoveries listed 10,556 cases as recovered or resolved. A CBC News tally of deaths linked to COVID-19 based on provincial reports, regional public health information and CBC reporting\u00a0listed 1,366\u00a0deaths in Canada. There have also been two reported coronavirus-related deaths of Canadians abroad.\nThe outbreak\u00a0\u2014 and the strict public health measures implemented in a bid to slow it \u2014 have\u00a0hit businesses and families hard, as companies close their doors or cut back operations. The federal government has announced a range of programs to help families pay bills and companies stay afloat as the crisis unfolds, but Ottawa has faced\u00a0criticism over delays and gaps in coverage.\nSpeaking before Trudeau's announcement on Friday,\u00a0Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the measures aimed at supporting the hard-hit energy sector should have come sooner.\nWATCH |\u00a0Scheer 'disappointed' with lag in help for energy sector workers:\nTrudeau said Ottawa will spend $1.7 billion to clean up abandoned oil and gas wells, a move that he said is good for the environment and will help maintain jobs in Alberta, Saskatchewan and B.C.\nThe energy sector has been hit not just by the coronavirus and shutdowns meant to fight the virus\u00a0\u2014 the sector has\u00a0also seen a major plunge in oil prices.\nTim McMillan, CEO of the\u00a0Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, sent\u00a0Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan\u00a0a letter in late March asking Ottawa to\u00a0freeze the carbon tax and delay new climate change regulations as the sector confronted a major drop in demand along with sinking prices.\nAlberta Premier Jason Kenney said on Twitter shortly after the announcement that the funding for orphan well clean up \"is critical to getting thousands of people in the energy sector back to work immediately.\"\u00a0\nIn a late afternoon news\u00a0conference, he added the package has been in the works since last summer. \"This is a really efficient way of getting good, blue-collar skilled labour back to work,\" he said. \"This is an important lifeline.\"\nKenney said it is \"encouraging to hear of new measures to enhance credit support for mid-sized energy companies\" and noted on Twitter that the provincial government looks forward to reviewing the details of the support in the days ahead.\nThe federal government also announced a $750-million fund to cut emissions, with a focus on methane.\n\u201cOur gov\u2019t will invest $1.7B to clean up orphan and inactive wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and B.C.,\u201d said PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JustinTrudeau</a>. \u201cOur goal is to create immediate jobs in these provinces, while helping companies avoid bankruptcy and supporting our environmental targets.\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/FZG2GsQEGM\">pic.twitter.com/FZG2GsQEGM</a>\nThe prime minister also announced hundreds of millions in spending on other initiatives outside the energy sector, saying the government would offer:\nRead on for a look at what's happening in Canada, the U.S. and around the world.\nThe federal government is planning virtual Canada Day celebrations in place of the traditional gathering on Parliament Hill.

Yuriko Koike. The Japanese capital has seen its new cases shoot up since late March, raising concerns about the infections becoming explosive.\nFriday's increase\u00a0in\u00a0cases comes 10 days after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a month-long state of emergency in Tokyo and six other urban prefectures, a measure he expanded to all of Japan on Thursday.\nThe city of Wuhan in China, where the novel coronavirus\u00a0that has since spread around the world was first reported, said it had revised up its total death toll by 50 per cent, addressing incorrect reporting, delays and omissions of cases. That would take China's total deaths to over 4,500.\nThe revision comes as U.S. and other officials question the accuracy of China's tallies \u2014\u00a0but also as those countries hit hardest by the pandemic have widely varying methodologies for counting their dead. The World Health Organization in Geneva has so far not commented on the Chinese revision.\nGermany's official statistical office said Friday that some 2.6 million students will soon return to schools as the country relaxes its pandemic lockdown rules. Authorities in Germany's 16 states agreed this week to allow a staggered reopening of schools, with students in their final two years of high school and the final year of primary returning first.\nGermany, a country of 83 million people, has so far recorded almost 137,700 confirmed infections of the novel\u00a0coronavirus, according to the\u00a0tally by Johns Hopkins University. Compared to other countries, Germany has had relatively few deaths \u2014 4,052 so far \u2014 less than a third the number seen in Britain, which has fewer confirmed cases.\nSome 940 of the 2,300-strong crew aboard France's Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier group have tested positive for COVID-19, the French Senate said in a statement on Friday, citing the military's chief medical officer.\nSpain's official gazette published Friday a government order for the country's 17 autonomous regions to unify the criteria on counting the dead in the coronavirus pandemic. The government said\u00a0that it's following WHO guidance and insists on counting only those who die having tested positive for the virus, whether they show symptoms or not\u00a0and no matter where the death takes place.\nThat figure on Thursday rose above the 19,000 mark, with a total of more than 182,000 infections. But the accounting system leaves out the patients who died with symptoms but were not tested.\nThe United Kingdom's hospital death toll from COVID-19 rose 847 to 14,576, as of Thursday afternoon local time, the Health Ministry said.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan says wearing face coverings, such as bandanas and scarves, could provide people with another layer of protection against the coronavirus and is lobbying the British government to change its advice.\nKhan told BBC radio that the evidence he has seen is that wearing a non-medical facial covering \"reduces the chances\" of those who have the virus giving it to somebody else. However, he did concede that it \"doesn't necessarily limit your chances of catching the virus.\"\nHe said changing the advice would be helpful for those in public transport or in shops, where some people may find it difficult to abide by the physical\u00a0distancing guidelines of staying two metres apart. Khan said it's important that there's a \"consistent approach\" across the country and that's why he's lobbying the government and its advisers.\nThe government's chief medical adviser, Chris Whitty, said Thursday that the evidence around masks being helpful in preventing the spread of the coronavirus is \"weak,\" while conceding it was a \"live issue.\"\nCoronavirus outbreaks across the Middle East threaten to shatter the lives of millions of already destitute people in conflict zones, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said.\u00a0Hard-hit Iran, which has like several other countries\u00a0faced questions about how cases are identified and disclosed,\u00a0reported a new case total of almost 80,000 on Friday, with 4,958 deaths.\nThe African continent, which has some 400 million people living in poverty, also had weak health systems that were grossly inadequate to test for the COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus and manage those infected, she said.\nNigeria's finance minister said a debt relief agreement reached this week to help the world's poorest countries deal with the coronavirus pandemic was a welcome first step but that middle-income countries with debt challenges also needed urgent help.\nIn remarks to be delivered at Friday's meeting of the World Bank's Development Committee, Zainab Ahmed said most countries in sub-Saharan Africa\u00a0were particularly vulnerable to the pandemic because high rates of self-employment meant physical distancing could not be sustained for long.\nRwanda is\u00a0using drones to keep residents of the capital Kigali informed of coronavirus lockdown measures \u2014\u00a0and to help catch those who abuse them. As police stop cars and pedestrians on streets to ask why they are out, two drones buzz above the city\u00a0\u2014\u00a0one loudly broadcasting instructions and the other monitoring movements. \"Drones are flying in areas where checkpoints are not mounted and where patrols could not be there,\" a police spokesperson said.\u00a0Among the culprits who have been caught is a pastor who pretended to be on her way to give a radio interview when, in fact, she was heading to church despite A ban on public gatherings.\nMexico's president said the country was looking to return to normal beginning June 1, with schools and businesses reopening provided people comply with anti-coronavirus health measures until then.\u00a0The Mexican government will inject around $2.5 billion US into the economy in May, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday, as the country gears up to weather economic shocks from the coronavirus.\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday called for the reopening of his\u00a0country's borders, as he pushes to restart South America's largest economy.\u00a0But he conceded he may be blamed if the new coronavirus outbreak worsens as a result.\n\"Opening trade is a risk that I take, because if [the outbreak]\u00a0gets worse, it will fall on my lap,\" Bolsonaro said at the inauguration event for his new health minister, Nelson Teich.\u00a0Bolsonaro fired his health minister on Thursday after clashing with him over lockdown measures, which the president argues are overly damaging to the economy and should be rolled back.\nBrazil has 33,682 confirmed cases, with some 200 fatalities per day in the last four consecutive days, bringing the death toll to 2,141 as of Friday, according to Health Ministry data.\nWATCH |\u00a0Brazilian city tries novel way to force people to self-isolate during COVID-19:\nBangladesh has reported 15 more deaths and 266 cases of new infections from coronavirus over the last 24 hours, the country's health minister said Friday. Health Minister Zahid Maleque said with the latest figures, the death toll reached 75 and the number of infections stood at 1,838.\u00a0Experts say Bangladesh, a nation of 160 million people, lacks proper management in handling the situation.

And of those, 150 were Inuit.\nAnd many of those children are sent to non-Indigenous rural communities in Newfoundland like Roddickton and Englee.\nKavanagh said the current approach is not working because it's \"reactive and crisis-oriented,\" and\u00a0does not incorporate Inuit knowledge.\n\"Young people in care told us they miss home terribly, and fear losing their cultural connections and sense of Inuit identity.\"\nThe recommendations, meanwhile,\u00a0are sweeping, and\u00a0would require action\u00a0from the departments of Children, Seniors and Social Development, and\u00a0Justice and Public Safety. It would also require a significant boost in funding.\nKavanagh, for example, is calling on CSSD to\u00a0complete an audit of all incidents where children were sent away from their home community, and ensure every option for keeping the child in Nunatsiavut territory was exhausted.\n\"It's important to take stock of where these children are,\" she said.\nThe advocate also wants the department to focus more on prevention and early intervention, and explore a new model for foster care that could include placing parents and children together.\nThe report also recommends a review of the financial supports for\u00a0Inuit children, families and caregivers to ensure they reflects the \"northern Labrador reality.\"\n\"This must include addressing prices of goods and services, as well as transportation and delivery costs,\" the report states.\nKavanagh acknowledged\u00a0there are many dedicated people who go to work in the child protection system every day.\n\"[But] their hard work is not providing the needed results for these young people [because] it involves problems with the system of child protection services.\"\nFor social workers, the advocate wants mandatory Indigenous cultural education training, improved\u00a0access to clinical supervision and mentoring, and a commitment to ensure\u00a0CSSD offices are appropriately staffed and equipped.\nThe report also calls for more incentives to improve recruitment and retention for social work positions in Nunatsiavut.\nFrom a broader perspective, the report recommends that the provincial government work with Inuit leaders to improve\u00a0housing, food insecurity and provide safe shelters for Inuit children and their families.\nDespite her grim assessment, Kavanagh said all hope is not lost.\n\"Many Inuit still believe that change is possible and that things can look and work differently if Inuit values, beliefs, and knowledge inform a new way of keeping children safe. There is an opportunity to make this shift now,\" she wrote in her report.\nOne of those encouraged by the report is Richard Leo, who had two daughters and a granddaughter placed in foster care.\nLeo attended Wednesday's release and expressed optimism that \"finally someone is listening to families like myself who need to be heard and want change.\"\nThe report does not directly recommend that Nunatsiavut establish its own child protection system, but Kavanagh strongly hints at such a system.\n\"This is a decision for Nunatsiavut to make on its own terms, timing, and readiness. However, there is widespread support that services and solutions for Indigenous children must be led by Indigenous governments, organizations and people.\"\nThe final recommendation is that the province continually monitor the child welfare system, and present a report annually to the House of Assembly.\nMeanwhile, the minister responsible for child protection services, Lisa Dempster, was also in Nain\u00a0on Wednesday. She\u00a0said her department's commitment to children and families is unwavering.\n\"We share the goal of improving the experience and outcomes of Inuit children, youth and families,\" she said.\nDempster\u00a0said her department will analyze the recommendations and develop a\u00a0plan, noting\u00a0the new Children, Youth and Families Act, which came into effect in June, contains provisions that directly address many of the report's recommendations.\nShe said a renewed partnership between her department and the Nunatsiavut\u00a0government is already showing results, with a full complement of social workers now on staff in Inuit communities.\nAnd Dempster said training for new foster parents has taken place in every Inuit community in recent months.\n\"Our goal is to support families so they can ensure the safety and well-being of their children, so they can grow up in their communities, closer to their families and culture, and achieve their full potential,\" she said.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 8", "description": "Ontario is testing fewer people than other provinces and fewer than it had hoped to by this point", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-covid19-april8-canada-world-1.5524933", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Apr 08, 2020 7:41 AM ET", "2020-04-09T05:35:49.428Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The latest:\u00a0\nOntario Premier Doug Ford says his \"patience is running thin\" when it comes to the low rate\u00a0of testing for COVID-19 in his province.\n\"No more excuses.

The data does not say when that peak is expected nor when distancing measures might be eased.\u00a0\nNewfoundland\u00a0and Labrador also released\u00a0projections\u00a0Wednesday, which focus\u00a0on how the province's intensive care units would deal with a surge in patients. They did not release projections related to numbers of cases or deaths.\u00a0The data found the\u00a0province will exceed its ICU capacity by the end of June if the spread of the virus continues at its current rate.\nIn Alberta, Premier Jason Kenney\u00a0outlined what he described as a \"probable\" scenario for the province\u00a0on Tuesday that suggested the province won't see a peak in the virus until mid-May. That model suggested Alberta could see as many as 800,000 COVID-19 cases by the end of the summer, with death figures ranging from 400 to 3,100. Another more \"elevated\" scenario pointed toward the possibility of both higher case numbers and between\u00a0500 and 6,600 deaths.\nKenney noted that the figures may seem overwhelming, and was quick to caution that the models are \"not a done deal.\"\u00a0\n\"How many people are infected, how many die, whether we overwhelm our health-care system \u2014\u00a0all of that depends on us and our choices.\"\u00a0\nWATCH | Quebec presents COVID-19 scenarios:\nQuebec also offered up modelling information earlier this week at the request of Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault, who wanted to share the information publicly\u00a0despite concerns from his chief public health official.\nThe modelling out of Quebec suggested the province could see between 1,200 and 9,000 deaths by the end of April. Public health officials noted that the current thinking is that the number of deaths will be closer to the lower estimate.\nOntario, which saw its total number of reported cases pass 5,000 on Wednesday,\u00a0presented its modelling\u00a0last week.\nThe federal government has suggested it will do the same once it has sufficient information from the provinces\u00a0\u2014 though when that might be was not immediately clear.\u00a0\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau largely focused on emergency economic measures Wednesday as he gave his daily address outside Rideau Cottage, but he also faced questions about when Canada would release national-level forecasts.\nWhen is the federal modelling coming? Trudeau says the provinces have released more data this week - they're \"collating, looking at those and integrating them into a national model and we'll have more to say over the coming days.\"\nTrudeau said people would learn more about a national model in the coming days, but did not provide a specific date. The prime minister also said it's not yet clear\u00a0exactly when Canada will reach a\u00a0peak\u00a0but that strict adherence to critical public health measures \u2014 including physical distancing and staying home as much as possible \u2014 will help reduce the impact of the outbreak.\n\"Let's keep doing what we're doing,\" he said.\nIn British Columbia, case numbers haven't hit the levels\u00a0seen in Quebec and Ontario. Premier\u00a0John Horgan said officials in his province are \"optimistic\" but noted that \"we're far from out of the woods yet.\"\u00a0\nHorgan\u00a0told CBC's Rosemary Barton on Wednesday that in his view\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the view of B.C. chief health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry \u2014\u00a0the objective of modelling is to help the province plan and prepare.\u00a0\n\"We need to use that modelling for practical reasons,\" he said.\nHorgan\u00a0said\u00a0the \"curve is starting to bend\" in B.C. and he is encouraged by that, but expressed concern about people getting less vigilant about physical distancing and other measures as the weather improves.\u00a0\nDr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, has previously noted that projections are used for planning purposes and are\u00a0not \"crystal balls.\" The models can vary widely, Tam has said, and\u00a0are \"highly sensitive to our actions,\" including measures like distancing, self-isolation and handwashing.\nTam reminded Canadians\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0not to visit extended family for upcoming religious holidays.

Both figures were slightly higher than Tuesday's, when the first increase in five days was explained by a backlog of test results and fatalities that had gone unreported over the weekend. But doubts about the statistics are growing as fresh data starts to emerge.\nAuthorities in Spain have already acknowledged that a scarcity of testing kits and a bottleneck in the number of tests that laboratories can conduct on a daily basis are giving an underestimated contagion tally, which rose to 146,000 on Wednesday. A nationwide survey of 30,000 households has been launched to figure out what is the more approximate extent of the epidemic beyond hospitals and nursing homes.\nIn Italy,\u00a0the hardest-hit country of all with over 17,000 deaths, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday that Italy must stick with its rigid lockdown, rejecting calls from businesses in the country's northern industrial heartland urging the government to allow them to reopen as soon as next week. After the latest data was published on Wednesday the country's top health officials urged the government to resist the pressure. \"The trend of the epidemic curve is not declining, it is slowing, we are looking at a plateau,\" Ranieri Guerra, an Italian World Health Organization official told reporters.\nIn\u00a0Germany, the\u00a0daily case tally increased for the second straight day after four previous days of decreases.\nFrance will extend its lockdown past the previously set end date of April 15, the presidential palace announced on Wednesday.\u00a0 A French military ship is heading back to port after some staff on board showed signs of COVID-19 symptoms.\nThe Chinese city of Wuhan ended its more-than-two-month lockdown on Wednesday, even as a small northern city ordered restrictions on residents amid concern about a second wave of infections. Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus emerged and eventually saw more than 50,000 people infected, reported just three new confirmed infections in the past 21 days. New imported cases in the far northern province of Heilongjiang surged to a daily high of 25, fuelled, it said, by an influx of infected travellers crossing the border from Russia.\nWATCH |\u00a0COVID-19: Can you disinfect a paper or N95 mask to re-use it?\nThe Saudi-led coalition fighting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen will begin a ceasefire Thursday, in response to UN\u00a0calls to halt hostilities amid the pandemic. In a statement, a Saudi military spokesman, Col.

India has put its entire population, one-fifth of the worlds' population, under lockdown until April 14.\nJapan saw its biggest daily jump in infections on the first day of a state emergency aimed at containing the outbreak. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was previously criticized for taking so long to declare an emergency, while \u2014 in most cases \u2014 Japanese authorities have no penalties to back calls for people to stay home and businesses to shut. There were 144 new coronavirus infections recorded in the country on Wednesday, while deaths stood at 98, according to public broadcaster NHK.\nSouth Korea's\u00a0government said on Wednesday it will increase restrictions on people travelling from overseas to prevent new coronavirus infections, and announced new stimulus measures for exporters hit by the outbreak.

'Where are the seats that I can win to produce a majority government?'\" said University of Calgary political scientist Anthony Sayers.\nNo doubt, Justin Trudeau and his re-elected party will first try to please voters in Ontario. Then Quebec. Then B.C. Then, in rough order, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, P.E.I., Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Yukon and Saskatchewan.\nFinally, stubbornly conservative Alberta.\nWhat will matter more than Monday's results, however, are the agreements made among\u00a0the various parties that will prop up a Liberal minority and under what conditions. It is these agreements that will determine just what impact the election will have on Alberta.\nEven so, the odds that the next government will fulfil Albertans'\u00a0fondest wishes by booting the tanker ban on a portion of the West Coast, ditching the federal carbon tax and repealing\u00a0the Liberals' environmental review legislation\u00a0are likely non-existent.\nFirst, a note to the reader.\u00a0\nThis will be written as though Alberta is a sort of monolith. That's because the majority vote Conservative, and so it's assumed Albertans are conservative and all want the same thing. Despite the stereotypes, that's not true.\u00a0\nThat said, the majority view and the attendant conservative policies will be taken as a de facto classification for what Alberta wants \u2014 and that means, generally, these things are paramount.\nPipelines.\nEnergy.\nThe economy.\nSo, what's likely to happen in the coming days and weeks?\nTrudeau's party could form official coalitions with any one of the other four parties with seats,\u00a0meaning a cabinet with members from the Liberals and whoever else has signed on.\u00a0\nWhile common in the rest of the democratic world, in Canada a coalition is rare and unlikely.\u00a0\nMore likely is some form of agreement between the Liberals and one or more other parties that essentially says they'll support the government in confidence votes to keep it in power, but might defeat separate bills.\u00a0\nThat can be formalized, or a bit more back-of-the-napkin in nature.\u00a0\nStephen Harper managed to get quite a bit done while managing two consecutive Conservative minorities from 2006 to 2011\u00a0\u2014 mainly by making agreements on the fly, on issues like the current equalization formula and boutique tax breaks.\u00a0\nCurrently, there are plenty of matters on the minds of the majority of Albertans, from equalization payments that redistribute wealth across Canada, to what to do about the continued stagnation of Alberta's oil patch.\u00a0Perhaps top of the list: the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.\u00a0\nCoalitions and partnerships will have a profound effect on what's discussed and how it's dealt with, if at all.\u00a0\nDespite having the highest incomes in the country, unemployment remains stubbornly high in Alberta compared to the rest of Canada and it's becoming clear that the boom times and oil and gas jobs that produced staggering wealth in the province aren't likely to return to pre-oil crash levels.\u00a0\nThat has produced anger and anxiety in the province.\u00a0\nMany of the policies that Albertans have blamed for the continued downturn, however, are unlikely to change after Monday's election.\u00a0\nThe Trans Mountain pipeline, which the Liberals purchased for $4.5 billion, is tied up in the courts, but it's difficult to imagine Trudeau killing it.\u00a0\nDespite opposition to pipelines, Sayers doesn't think the federal New Democrats would force the matter if they helped prop up the Liberal minority.\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said during the campaign that any party looking to partner up would have to consider the NDP's\u00a0series of\u00a0priorities in order to work together: creating universal pharmacare, investing in housing, waiving interest on student loans, committing to reduce emissions, ending subsidies for oil companies and delivering aid to oilpatch workers to transition them to a new economy, increasing taxes on the wealthiest Canadians and closing tax loopholes, and reducing cellphone bills.\u00a0\nMissing from his demands were any mention of pipelines and Trans Mountain in particular, despite his opposition to the project.\u00a0\nThen, there's the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\nOf course, Alberta and Quebec often see eye to eye when it comes to more power for the provinces. But the Bloc is also antagonistic to pipelines. It wants the federal government to sell the Trans Mountain pipeline and wants to see strong legislation on the environment.\n\"If the Bloc is holding the balance of power and they're solely interested in Quebec's interests, who are the biggest recipients of equalization, you know, that's a very different calculation than even if the NDP is holding the balance of power,\" said pollster Janet Brown.\nUnlikely to happen is repeal of Bill C-69, which clarifies what is required for approval of major industrial projects. Opponents like Alberta Premier Jason Kenney decry it as the \"no more pipelines act.\" The province has mounted a constitutional challenge against the legislation.\u00a0\nAlso unlikely? Repeal of Bill C-48, which bans tanker traffic on a stretch of Canada's West Coast, but wouldn't affect Trans Mountain.\u00a0\nAll of that will surely contribute to the overheated anger and rhetoric in Alberta, but what could be done to calm it?\nIn a word: not much.\u00a0\nAlberta has long relished flinging mud at the Laurentian elites of Central Canada. It's a storied pastime, not without merit, to grumble about the province's lot in Confederation.\u00a0\nThere have been political upswells, from the socialist prairie populists angry at the price of grain and the railways to the more recent rise of the Reform Party (which morphed and merged into the Conservative Party of Canada).\nNow the anger is more nebulous and, according to political scientist Melanee Thomas from the University of Calgary, stoked by political parties for short-term gain.\u00a0\n\"This is an elite-driven narrative,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"The prize with this particular election now, where it's kind of like what can we say that will basically be the message for 2019 that will help us win both elections? And a lot of this is just: these people are against Alberta.\"\nIn the end, the narrative worked for the Alberta election and the federal one.\u00a0\nBut that kind of genie bottle is difficult to recork.\nUniversity of Alberta political scientist Jared Wesley said he's not sure a Conservative federal government can meet the \"nebulous demands of the Western populist movement.\"\nHe researches campaign rhetoric in the west and how leaders in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta present themselves in relation to the rest of Canada.\u00a0\nHe says the feeling in his focus groups has shifted from Alberta being held back to the province being left behind by Canada and the rest of the world.\u00a0\n\"That starts to bring in feelings and sentiment \u2014 worry, anxiety, alienation, resentment, rage \u2014 that we've seen in other parts of the world, including the United States,\" he said.\u00a0\nAccording to Wesley, the rust belt states like Michigan where the primary industry has collapsed could provide a more realistic parallel for Alberta than Texas.\u00a0\nThe question is whether anyone, or any party, can fix what ails Alberta and its main source of income.\nWesley sees regionalism and partisanship melding \"into a really potent force.\"\nThat kind of thinking and the divisiveness that has been exposed by the recent campaign and the years leading up to it, all point to one thing: the need for a national vision and someone capable of inspiring the regions to band together.\u00a0\nWho, and what, can achieve that?\nThis is the part of the narrative that requires the little shrugging emoji.\u00a0\nSayers says there are no policies on the table that could become the great unifier. Instead, he argues it has to be a metaphysical plea for a Canada that is stronger together.\n\"I think between now and the next election, which I assume will happen pretty quickly, it's going to be pretty tumultuous and there's not an obvious [unifying force] other than the claim that we are better off together than we are divided,\" he said.\n\"And I'm not sure who is capable amongst the current crop of leaders to really pursue that vision.\"\nIt will also be difficult for the current Alberta government to work with any minority government that doesn't have the Conservatives at the head.\u00a0\nKenney has campaigned for federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's party in Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta, and has openly said it would be difficult to work with another Trudeau-led government.\u00a0\nHe has threatened to hold a referendum on equalization \u2014 a legally non-binding exercise \u2014 if bills C-69 and C-48 aren't tossed and a pipeline built.\u00a0\nHeck, his party sent out an email telling supporters they should protest Trudeau's visit to Calgary last Saturday night.\nMeanwhile, if Quebec feels shorted, it could ratchet up separatist sentiment.\u00a0\nSayers hopes the election provides a moment of pause where Canadians realize they can't keep going down the route they're going and that big conversations come from that pause.\u00a0\n\"Politicians have seen the writing on the wall, that if we don't work together here, things are going to look pretty nasty,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"And that's the moment, it's like the '95 referendum and these things, that I think we'll be looking for a moment of 'gee, you know, if we carry on allowing this fragmentation to get worse, we will end up in a really bad spot.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coronavirus: Here's what's happening in Canada and the world March 19", "description": "PM talks about need for increased testing, travel restrictions between Canada and U.S.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-covid-19-canada-world-march19-1.5502505", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5502521.1584612588!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cda-coronavirus-20200318.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 19, 2020 6:57 AM ET", "2020-03-20T12:00:20.049Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The latest:\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke about the struggles of Canadians abroad and the need to step up testing for COVID-19 on Thursday,\u00a0a day after announcing an $82-billion COVID-19 response package that includes measures ranging from wage subsidies and income supports to a temporary boost to the child benefit program.\nCanada has more than 800\u00a0confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19, an illness caused by the novel\u00a0coronavirus that first emerged in China.

The Housing and Urban Development Department will suspend foreclosures and evictions through April to help the growing number of Americans who face losing jobs and missing rent and mortgage payments.\nThe administration announcements came on a fast-moving day of developments across the capital, its empty streets standing in contrast to the whirlwind of activity inside the grand spaces of the White House and the Capitol.\nThe U.S. military said Thursday it is pausing the movement of any new troops into Afghanistan and is quarantining 1,500 troops and civilians who recently arrived in order to protect them from the new coronavirus. Troops who are already in the country may have their deployments extended so missions can continue.\nFrom Reuters and The Associated Press, updated at 2:30 p.m. ET.\nItaly's death toll surpassed China's on Thursday, in a stark illustration of how the outbreak has pivoted toward Europe and the United States. With a population of 60 million, Italy has recorded at least 3,405 deaths as of Thursday, or roughly 150 more than in China \u2014 a country with a population over 20 times larger. Also on Thursday, a northern Italian town whose cemetery has been overwhelmed began loading bodies into trucks to move them to neighbouring provinces.\nItaly reached its bleak milestone the same day that Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged three months ago, recorded no new infections\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a sign that the communist country's draconian lockdowns were a powerful method to stop the virus' spread.\u00a0\nThe United Nations and Italian health authorities have cited a variety of reasons for Italy's high toll, key among them its large elderly population, who are particularly susceptible to developing serious complications from the virus. Italy has the world's second-oldest population after Japan's and the vast majority of Italy's dead \u2014 87 per cent\u00a0\u2014 were over age 70.\nIn addition, virtually all of Italy's dead had one or more underlying medical condition, such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension or renal insufficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Italy still has far fewer confirmed cases than China \u2014\u00a041,035 as of Thursday, compared to more than 80,900 in China.\nSchools in Italy are likely to remain closed beyond April 3, Italy's education minister said on Thursday. \"As Prime Minister [Giuseppe] Conte said, I think we are going toward\u00a0an extension of the April 3 deadline,\" Lucia Azzolina told SkyTG24. Schools and universities were closed on March 5.\nAs of late Wednesday, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported almost 71,000 cases, with 3,309 deaths.\u00a0\nThe palace of Monaco says its ruler, Prince Albert II, has tested positive for COVID-19\u00a0but that his health is not worrying. Albert, 62, appeared to be the first head of state who has publicly said he contracted the virus. In a statement Thursday, the palace said he is being treated by doctors from the Princess Grace Hospital, named after his American actress mother.\nFrance's Cannes Film Festival has been postponed, following weeks of speculation over whether it would go ahead. Meanwhile,\u00a0the Costa Luminosa transatlantic cruise ship, which has recorded several cases of COVID-19 among its passengers, has docked in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille on Thursday morning. More than 1,400 people, including more than 75 Canadians, are on the cruise. French authorities have allowed the ship\u00a0to dock and stay up to four days under strict conditions. It is not known whether passengers will be allowed off, given the current stringent restrictions in France amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn Sweden, more than 1,000 laid-off SAS airline workers\u00a0are being offered fast-track\u00a0health-care training to help fight the coronavirus. Sophiahemmet University will run a three-day pilot for 30 people at the end of March with the hope of eventually extending the course to hundreds more.\nEurope is scrambling to slow the spread of the virus, with countries introducing a range of measures including tighter border controls, school and business closures and\u00a0plans designed to boost ailing economies.\nOn Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he's confident the U.K. \"can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks,\" and that Britain is in talks to buy a coronavirus antibody test \"as simple as a pregnancy test.\" The British government previously announced it plans to introduce a bill in Parliament later\u00a0Thursday that will give authorities stronger powers to respond to the pandemic. The bill gives police and immigration officers powers to detain people and put them in appropriate isolation facilities if necessary to protect public health.\nThe Bank of England also slashed its key interest rate to 0.1 per cent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0its lowest-ever level\u00a0\u2014\u00a0amid global economic turmoil sparked by the\u00a0pandemic. The bank's monetary policy committee says the unanimous decision is part of moves \"to meet the needs of U.K. businesses and households in dealing with the associated economic disruption.\" Thursday's rate cut came a week after the central bank cut its rate from 0.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent.\n\u00a0At least 137 people have died from 2,689 confirmed cases of the virus so far in the U.K.\u00a0\nWATCH | People around the world applaud health-care workers:\nFrom Reuters, The Associated Press\u00a0and CBC News, updated at 8 p.m. ET.\nThe total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at more than 80,900 on Friday, with the overall death toll at 3,248\u00a0as of the end of Friday morning.

As candidates were announced, CBC provided each an opportunity to answer a questionnaire tackling a wide range of subjects, from their own qualifications to themes impacting their riding and the territory as a whole.\nRead their responses below, presented in the order they were received by CBC.\nSome answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nI wanted to get involved in municipal politics, initially, in 2015. I broached the subject with my father, who immediately suggested I'm far better suited for territorial politics. He knew I was passionate about not only Yellowknife, but the entire North.\n\"I've seen you in action, kid.\u00a0I know you bring people together to help make a real difference. You are well respected in the North, and Yellowknife, which really needs champions like you.\"\nIt took everything I had to maintain my composure. I made a promise to him that day:\u00a0\"Dad, if I even enter politics, I promise you I will do so with compassion, dignity, honesty, respect and represent the people who elect me into office, if successful.\"\nHis response was simple: \"I know you will.\"\nHearing these words from the man I respect most was surreal. The confidence he instilled in me was immeasurable.\nWhen I got back to Yellowknife, I was prepared to enter the territorial election and was just starting to research what that entailed, the roles and responsibilities, etc. Three\u00a0weeks afterwards, I received a call that anyone would dread.\n\"Jan, dad passed away last night.\"\u00a0\nI was in complete disbelief and stunned. I was just talking face to face with him three\u00a0weeks ago.\u00a0Needless to say, my drive to enter politics was shattered. I didn't have it me anymore. I was devastated, angry and sad.\nRoll forward four\u00a0years and that drive is back, alive and stronger than it has ever been.\u00a0\nMy passion for our North and her people is strong. I want to make and be the difference in people's lives, for the better. I want to bring people together at a time when it's needed most. We need to drive positive change collectively, and more importantly, co-operatively. To be able to fulfill a promise I made to my father is a dream I want to turn into reality.\u00a0\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nMy entire life, I've been a leader, team builder and decision maker. My passion for positive change is deeply entrenched in my blood stream. I have over 30 years experience in the GNWT, two\u00a0decades of which are directly in the heart of health care, at Stanton, in the\u00a0IT field.\u00a0\nI was president of a territorial sport organization for over 10 years, have been a member of territorial and national committees, chaired a western Canadian committee and most importantly, I lead by example. I'm not one to sit on the fence.\u00a0I'm decisive and here for the people of Yellowknife and the North.\nI'm also open to correction if fact-based, majority constituency desired, or scientifically-backed information is brought to my attention. I actively support open debate.\nI have already made positive changes in the North by volunteering well over 10,000 hours and raising more than\u00a0$250,000 for several NGO's. I am committed to community and have helped many. This is how I was raised. I intend to bring this same energy to the Legislative Assembly and BE the difference our North needs.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nPractising what I preach, walking my talk, committing\u00a0to my community and living by example. I've had so many people reach out and thank me for inspiring them to make positive lifestyle changes and living a more positive life, in general.\u00a0\nIn 2015, I made a conscious effort to live better and focus on increasing better lifestyle choices. I have shared this ongoing journey in person and on Facebook and many have reached out to let me know what a difference my journey has made in their lives. It has encouraged them to embrace a healthier lifestyle and volunteer in their community.\u00a0\nI wish to continue this type of legacy at a level where I can reach more people. This is, by far, the best human quality, period.\u00a0\nThe number of hours volunteered and dollars raised is one that I am very proud of, as is representing Canada, the N.W.T., and Yellowknife, with dignity and honour on the world stage and nationally.\u00a0\nI changed the conversation with Broomball Canada. All of their materials, (coaches' and officials' manuals, bylaws, constitution, etc.) only had references to provinces throughout. I ensured all future revisions contained the word territories. All of the documents and the language at meetings have since been modified with the proper references:\u00a0provinces/territories. I can enact change at the most fundamental levels.\nEverything I've had the opportunity to be involved in directly has seen improvements.\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nHealth and social issues are the largest issue facing the North. Cost of living and the economy are also substantial issues facing the North. They are all equally significant and important.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nCost of living and lack of available recreational lots.\u00a0\nWe need to be able to reduce the cost of living by doing a better job with rebates that everyone can afford, not the few. Not everyone can afford $15,000 to switch over to propane, so these incentives reach but a few. The intention is excellent, but in reality, it needs to be improved so more residents can access this funding.\nThe lottery for recreational lots was an obvious indicator of the need for more lots. People want to enjoy our amazing wilderness and teach children what it's like to re-energize with nature. Nature is good for the soul.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nImproving the health and social well being of northerners. This is a colossal task that will require engaging multiple groups and every government. When we work together, we can accomplish amazing feats for our most important resource:\u00a0our people. But it will take collaboration among many. I've extensive experience building teams, so this is a task I could lead.\nWe also need to see additional funding from the federal government for wellness programs, especially 'on the land' programs. We are seeing fabulous gains from other communities embracing this structure of healing. Cambridge Bay is a fabulous example.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nHydroelectricity will bring cheaper power to all northerners. It would significantly reduce GHG emissions and\u00a0allow communities to drastically reduce their dependency on diesel.\nWe need to offer better incentives for residents wanting to embrace cleaner energy solutions:\u00a0wood pellet, solar, small windmill technologies, conversion to propane, to name a few. Open the territory up for green energy companies wanting to test cold climate energy solutions. Research other circumpolar communities for solutions that work in their cold climate environment.\nI would also like to see more greenhouses developed in the communities to ensure better food security and less transportation of food supplies.\u00a0\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nMore accountability and more transparency for all GNWT programs. We don't know how successful, or not, the existing programs within the GNWT are if they aren't measured. Are we wasting money on programs that are not being utilized? Are there two programs offering the same services? Can we combine programs that cross over? We just don't know until they are measured.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nWe need to streamline the resource development application process. At present, it is horrendously cumbersome, bureaucratic and time consuming. It deters exploration companies from investing in the North, providing much needed jobs. This must be done while maintaining cultural and environmental stewardship.\u00a0\nWe also need to diversify our economy by expanding tourism, agricultural, and\u00a0commercial fishing opportunities. The South Slave and Deh Cho regions could feed the North with their fertile soil.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe could bring portable sawmills into the smaller communities to create fire barriers and utilize the harvested wood for building more public housing. The by-product can be turned into wood pellets. This will create much needed employment.\nWithout diversifying with out of the box solutions, we will witness stagnant growth, if at all.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nWe have to ensure the Indigenous people and governments are at the table, period. We must be inclusive, transparent and work closer together to come up with made in the North solutions. I've mentioned some already (above).\nWe need face to face meetings on a regular basis and to collaborate with one another to come up with solutions that benefit all people. The GNWT must recognize that Indigenous culture needs to be a factor in all the decisions.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position? \nVery likely, if this is something members feel I would be suited for. I would look to the health and\u00a0social services portfolio, which I fully recognize is significant. I have extensive experience, over two decades, directly in the health industry, so who better to represent health issues\u00a0than a member who has worked in the industry, specifically in the hospital.\nWould you like to be premier? \nNot at this stage. I would consider it after fulfilling the first four-year term.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nI believe the GNWT has lost sight of larger ideals and putting a vision forward that reflects the true potential of all our citizens. I want a territory where our largest corporations are owned and operated here and compete for contracts across the North, as opposed to the status-quo of southern and foreign ownership sending money out of territory.\nWe are on a tipping point, where the GNWT must take action to become more adaptable to change\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not only climate change, but adapting to a global economy with increasing inequality, while navigating to the closure of the diamond mines. The Northwest Territories has one of the highest rates of income inequality in Canada, especially between our Indigenous and non-Indigenous population.\nAs a lawyer working in government I felt I was part of the problem and not part of the solution. I found my co-workers either overworked or unmotivated. In seeing no one step up and put forward a vision and progressive agenda, I felt I was in between a rock and a hard place. Continue to be a participant in a misled government, or run and give those who want to ensure our government can adapt a voice.\u00a0\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nAs a lawyer, I have spent years working firsthand with legislation. Most recently, as a senior adviser, legislation and legal affairs at\u00a0the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, I helped develop legislation from the policy research to drafting stage, working closely with Indigenous governments.\nI have no doubt I will be one of the strongest legislators in the assembly, something many of our politicians forget is key to the role. I will aim to introduce more private member's bills than any other MLA in history. I have read legislation from across the world and have consistently seen our government miss solutions that are already working in other jurisdictions.\u00a0\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nI am most proud of my role in enacting the Protected Areas Act of the N.W.T. It was humbling to play a role in laying the groundwork for the landmark Thaidene Nene National Park and giving the territory the tools to protect our environment for the future. I just recently received a Deputy Minister's Award for this work.\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nThe biggest issue facing the territory\u00a0is the biggest issue facing the planet: climate change. We are especially vulnerable to the consequences here in the Northwest Territories. Inaction is not an option if we want to protect our economy, keep our communities connected, and maintain our way of life in the future.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nWhen I go door-to-door, I'm hearing a lot of people who are anxious about the state of our economy. The Conference Board of Canada and Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses agree that our economy is in a tough spot and our territory is one of the worst in Canada for emerging entrepreneurs.\u00a0\nI believe that's in part because our bureaucracy is stifling and inflexible. And that's why I plan to advocate for smart policies to unleash entrepreneurship in our territory, incentivize businesses to come North, and break down the barriers to innovation and economic development.\u00a0\nYellowknife North is an extremely unique riding with so many amazing local businesses. Removing the red tape and government competition they face is key. We have seen the GNWT balloon and start entering into areas of the private sector, stifling our local northern businesses. We must ensure the GNWT is working with local businesses, not against them.\u00a0\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nI would like to implement a pilot project for universal daycare in the N.W.T.\u00a0\nToday, it costs around $1,000 a month for daycare in Yellowknife, and daycare services are not available in many communities.\u00a0\nThis is a huge point of anxiety for families around the territory. And it's a drag on the economy.\u00a0At this price point, many choose not to enter the workforce.\nI want to see a future where people aren't paying more than around 10\u00a0bucks a day for their daycare services to relieve the anxieties of families, and help our territory reach its full potential.\u00a0\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nFirst and foremost, we need to continuously evaluate how our carbon pricing is working, and retarget if our emissions aren't coming down fast enough.\u00a0\nNext, we need to make big investments in clean energy. Right now, the Taltson expansion is one relatively defined way forward, but I also think we need to look outside the box for micro-grid solutions that make sense in each region. By this I mean\u00a0things like small-scale hydro, solar, or wind projects where they make the most sense. We must step back and work with Indigenous governments to let them take the lead in federally funded renewable projects.\nOn the political front, I believe the N.W.T. needs to be an active participant in international discussions by sending our leadership to remind the world that we are disproportionately feeling the effects of climate change. We also need to make sure the GNWT allies with Indigenous governments in this fight \u2060\u2014 there is an incredible amount of traditional knowledge and leadership we would be smart to tap from these organizations.\u00a0\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nI think fundamentally, we need to move our approach to providing public services to a more client-focused model. That means creating a culture of service where the endless telephone tag ends and people get what they need without the headache.\u00a0\nI also think we get failing grades on transparency. I want to see a truly open government, where the public and the press know what's going on in our institutions. I would support looking at our access to information legislation to align our laws to these ambitions.\u00a0\nAnd to complement that, I want to get citizens more involved in our policy deliberations. Most provinces have a public engagement division driving this forward, and I think it's high time we make that investment in citizen participation.\u00a0\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nOne opportunity we're missing out on right now in the territory is building a knowledge economy. I think a big part of finding success on that front will be building a polytechnic university in Yellowknife as its hub.\u00a0\nIn order for the university to succeed, it can't just be a re-branded Aurora College. We need to offer something unique that is going to attract world-class researchers here, and incentivize innovators to choose the Northwest Territories.\u00a0\nWe already have a lot going for us. Researchers already come here in droves from the University of Alberta and other institutions to study permafrost, climate change, and our huge slice of the Canadian Shield.\u00a0\nThis is a solid foundation for us to build a cutting-edge university around which a new economy can thrive.\u00a0\nI also think we need to go big on tourism.\u00a0\nWe have a lot of catching up to do compared to our neighbours in Yukon. While their highways are dotted with immaculate, engaging tourism infrastructure, ours sometimes make the news for offering tourists very different experiences.\u00a0\nI want to see transformative investments in tourism infrastructure across the territory so guests from around the world have they amenities they expect from their vacations.\u00a0\nI also want to see an end to unnecessary red tape and an evaluation of our licensing process. I hear too often from people who have an idea for businesses which would offer amazing experiences to visitors, but gave up on their ideas when faced with the bureaucratic process. This aligns with giving municipalities control over their land so they can take the lead in economic development.\u00a0We should be encouraging entrepreneurship, not stifling it.\u00a0\nAnd I believe responsible development is going to play a role in our economic future. While it is largely rooted in market trends, I think we would be smart to bring the rest of our resource management legislation \u2014 the Mackenzie Valley Land and Resource Management Act \u2014 under territorial jurisdiction.\u00a0\nIt's one of the last missing pieces for our territory to truly have control over how our land and resources are managed. That kind of control is going to be important to what our economy looks like in the future.\u00a0\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nI believe we need to accelerate our path toward the promise of co-management at the heart of the devolution project.\u00a0\nThat means empowering Indigenous governments to take the reins on managing their own affairs and doing our part to give them the tools to do it effectively. I believe there are numerous steps we can take immediately.\u00a0We just need a GNWT that is willing to give up control, and let Indigenous governments operate free from interference.\u00a0\nBut there's no denying that one of the biggest things we could do to improve our relationship with Indigenous peoples is bringing a respectful, equitable conclusion to our outstanding land claims. This would be a big win for reconciliation and our collective economic fortunes. Once again, the solution here is to realize that the best thing we can do for the territory is allow our Indigenous governments to lead, they are better suited to be flexible and better suited to obtain federal funding. We are leaving millions of dollars in Ottawa by not settling land claims.\u00a0\nAnother big way we can improve this relationship is making a special effort to make sure Indigenous peoples and their governments shape our public policy. This is the least we can do to help right our wrongs and build a government that operates in a way that works for our majority-Indigenous population.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\nNo.\nWould you like to be premier? \nNo. For various reasons I believe it is important that we have an Indigenous premier, especially until such time as land claims and self government agreements are settled.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nI was born in Inuvik and I grew up in, and currently live in, the riding of Yellowknife North. I have a deep passion for our city and territory. I'm focused on the opportunities we have to effect change and shape our future. I'm more confident than ever that our future is now and the right time is now for positive and productive change.\nI am running to be your MLA for one reason:\u00a0to build a healthy, sustainable and prosperous territory, where all N.W.T. residents share in the benefits. I have the experience you can count on to make it happen.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nI bring extensive experience from my two terms on city council and four years as MLA for the riding of Yellowknife North. As MLA I was on a number of committees, including the chair of the standing committee on economic development and environment, that conducted extensive reviews of bills, department business plans and annual budgets. I'm a critical thinker and make decisions based on triple bottom line principles.\nI have also owned two successful small businesses, where I have gained an ability for understanding financial statements and fiscal responsibility. I also bring a wealth of experience gained through a number of diverse management roles throughout my working career. I have a reputation for working collaboratively and positively with individuals, NGOs, business and industry, and other orders of government.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nI have lived a very good life which has provided me with more than I could ever imagine. I want to be able to give back to our city and territory, as it has given so much to me.\nMy public service over the last 10\u00a0years as a city councillor and MLA has been my proudest accomplishment. My view is that I want to leave this great city and territory in a better state than prior to my contribution. I feel I have done that\u00a0so far, and that's why I continue to say that I am running to build a healthy, sustainable and prosperous territory, where all N.W.T. residents share in the benefits.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nWe are an Indigenous territory that still has unsettled land rights. In order for Indigenous peoples to move toward self-determination and gain more cultural, political and economic autonomy we must settle and finalize those agreements. Then, we can move closer to devolving more responsibility and independence through the self-government agreements that would follow.\nThis is not going to happen overnight, but we must keep heading in a positive direction and bring more certainty for the territory.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nYellowknife North is a diverse riding. In general, the riding is made up of families and individuals that are educated and have good standards of living.\nThat said, the impacts of homelessness, addictions and mental health have always been present in Yellowknife, but recently, the impacts have become increasingly visible within the community. While significant work has been done to address homelessness, addictions and mental-health issues in Yellowknife, individuals and families continue to struggle with these complex and often intertwined problems.\nClose co-operation must continue to be encouraged between the city, GNWT and Canada, because much of the funding available through the federal government is only accessible through such partnerships. The GNWT must step up and re-affirm its leadership on these files.\u00a0\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nIt would be\u00a0to build an undeniable sense of spirit and pride from within all N.W.T. residents, knowing that they are enjoying the standard of living and quality of life that they have always dreamed of!\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nGreenhouse gas is the largest contributor impacting climate change. Lowering the consumption of energy that is, directly or indirectly, generated by the burning of fossil fuels is typically the first major step that is taken in greenhouse gas reduction initiatives.\u00a0\nThis can be achieved through either just using less energy, increasing the efficiency of the things that consume energy, or increasing the efficiency of the things that create energy,\u00a0particularly electricity. There are several established technologies that are proven in providing clean energy, including\u00a0solar, wind, geothermal and hydro, although they are not without their critics.\u00a0\nNuclear energy is also often touted as a \"clean\" alternative to fossil fuels, although public opinion has been biased against it as a result of high-profile accidents. Wind and solar power generation are viable options for power production in the N.W.T. and are being applied in certain areas. The continued rollout of these technologies should be furthered by the GNWT, with the N.W.T. Power Corporation taking a proactive position regarding green power generation, particularly in those communities still dependent on diesel powered generators.\u00a0Nuclear options should continue to be monitored as new, innovative, safer and most importantly, small scale solutions continue to be developed.\nIn the meantime, existing power generation should be evaluated to utilize cleaner burning fuels, such as natural gas and biodiesel. This should be done in conjunction with evaluating the feasibility of utilizing natural gas resources in the N.W.T. and test piloting certain communities with the use of biodiesel. Where we can, hydro-electric development should always be considered where appropriate, including the further development and utilization of current capabilities.\nReducing energy consumption is the flip-side to more efficiency in energy production.\u00a0This is an area in which the GNWT (through allied agencies such as the Arctic Energy Alliance) has had many years of experience.\u00a0The provision of incentives to Northerners to build more energy efficient homes and to purchase more energy efficient appliances for example, are examples of initiatives that have a proven track record of success.\u00a0More of this is needed.\nImproved efficiency in building construction standards (residential, commercial, and government) should also be regulated and incentivized, where necessary. Reducing actual consumption of energy, both in the home and workplace can now also be assisted by new \"smart home\" technologies.\u00a0 Promotion of their use should also be encouraged.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nWe became a government in 1967, over 50 years ago. So much has changed since then: globalization, internet, smartphones, climate change, reconciliation, etc.\nIndustry and business have evolved with all these changes, even municipal governments have redesigned and modernized themselves. While change is happening elsewhere, the GNWT has stayed stuck in the past. This is the age of change, and while all of us are living in the competitive 21st century, our government is still struggling to get out of the 20th.\nOver many years and several assemblies, the GNWT has added many new programs, services and departments. Rarely have we seen any of our departments or agencies downsized or streamlined, much less the reduction\u00a0or removal of\u00a0antiquated programs or services.\nIf anything, we have grown exponentially.\nBefore separation in 1999, we had 2,500 employees looking after the western and eastern Arctic.\u00a0Now, we have 4,600 employees managing the west only. On occasion, we have seen departments amalgamate but that has resulted in a mega-department rather than a downsize. The result: overlapping and even duplicative responsibilities that waste resources and needlessly complicate government.\nThis is why we continually receive a grade of F from CFIB and continue to have an enormous amount of red tape and layers of bureaucracy that no one can navigate. It's also why we struggle to come to terms with our Indigenous partners and settling land rights and self-government agreements.\nWe are a lopsided, top-heavy organization that has no ability to be flexible or pliable enough to adjust with the quick moving pace and changing times of our world. We need to begin a process of re-inventing government where we create a more linear or horizontal organization that puts the resources at the front lines and better serves the residents through efficient and quick responses and effective results that provide long term solutions for residents' needs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nThe sustainability and growth of the N.W.T. economy requires strategic investment, diversification, and modernization. We also need investment in innovation and technology if we are to work toward a carbon free future.\nMining and exploration will continue to play a significant role in the N.W.T.'s economy. But, in addition, we need to support economic diversification through investment in entrepreneurship and small business, green energy, tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, fisheries and arts and\u00a0film.\nEconomic development must be supported by improved and strengthened skills development for the labour market, so that residents can take advantage of current and future job opportunities and build lasting careers. I believe in a responsible, sustainable and balanced approach to land use. With devolved responsibility for lands and resources, now is the time to work collaboratively with Canada, Indigenous governments, industry and environmental partners to evolve and improve our regulatory system.\nWe need to work together to create the conditions for economic investment, while preserving the values of sustainability. This also means having a strategic response to climate change that recognizes territorial and national emissions targets, while recognizing the realities of our geography and cold climate which drive energy consumption and the cost of living in the North.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nI am grateful every day that I have the opportunity to live in this great Indigenous territory. I have the utmost respect and appreciation of all our Indigenous peoples. Going forward, it is essential that our government to government relationships continue to be based on mutual respect, recognition and shared responsibilities.\nTo further strengthen relationships and in the spirit of working toward self-determination, the GNWT must communicate and work with leaders and communities from every region of the territory to discuss ways we can continue to work together. A number of key areas need to be strengthened as we move forward, including\u00a0committing departments to undertake appropriate consultation when proposing actions that may impact on Indigenous governments, and continuing\u00a0the commitment to negotiate and finalize land rights agreements in all regions of the N.W.T.\nWe need to engage in a way that acknowledges the unique governance structures, status of Indigenous rights negotiations, economic opportunities, and culture in each community. As I discovered when travelling through the territory with many pieces of legislation, we need to recognize and contribute to addressing capacity challenges faced by Indigenous governments in terms of human and financial resources that make it difficult for them to effectively engage. We must be open and transparent by committing to sharing information with Indigenous governments. And\u00a0we must continue our commitment to work with all governments to ensure that we make decisions that support a healthy and diverse ecosystem.\nThere is much more we can do, but ultimately we need to do it together so that the positive benefits can be had by all N.W.T. residents.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\u00a0\nThere are many important roles for all 19 MLAs to fill once elected. I will respect the collective decision making process that takes place to decide who will fill what role and I will give 110 per cent\u00a0no matter what role I am in.\nWould you like to be premier?\nMaybe someday\u2026ha!\n"}]
