The Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.\nGross domestic product increased at a 2.1 per cent annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of third-quarter GDP. That was up from the 1.9 per cent pace estimated last month. The economy grew at a 2.0 per cent pace in the April-June period.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast third-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at 1.9 per cent.\nThe upward revision to GDP reflected more inventory accumulation than initially thought, as well as a less steep pace of contraction in business investment. Inventories increased at a $79.8 billion US pace instead of the $69.0 billion rate reported last month.\nWhen measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.4 per cent rate in the last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a rate of 0.9 per cent in the second quarter. The income side of the growth ledger accelerated despite a drop in profits.\nSecond-quarter GDI growth was revised down by 0.9 percentage point, with growth in wages and sales during that period slashed by $46.7 billion to $62.1 billion.\nAfter-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, decreased $11.3 billion, or at a rate of 0.6 per cent, as they were held down by legal settlements with Facebook and Google. Profits increased at a 3.3 per cent rate in the second quarter.\nThe average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.3 per cent rate in the July-September period, quickening from a 1.4 per cent growth pace in the second quarter.\nU.S. stock index futures briefly extended gains and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose after the release of the data. The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies.\nGrowth has slowed from the 3.1 per cent rate notched in the first three months of the year. The slowdown is largely blamed on the Trump administration's trade war with China, which has eroded business confidence, contributing to the second straight quarterly decline in business investment.\nThe fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also sapping momentum from the expansion, now in its 11th year. But there are some hopeful signs for business investment.\nThe Commerce Department said on Wednesday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3 per cent last month as households spent more on electricity and gas, offsetting a drop in new motor vehicle purchases.\nWith consumer spending rising moderately, inflation remained benign in October. Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% last month, lifted by food, energy goods and services prices. The PCE price index was unchanged in August and September.\nWages increased 0.4 per cent in October after climbing 0.1 per cent in September. Wages were boosted by a $7.2 billion adjustment to account for General Motors strike pay and payments associated with a new contract for members of the United Automobile Workers union.\nWith spending outpacing income growth, savings fell to $1.29 trillion from $1.34 trillion in September.\nOrders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 1.2 per cent last month, the largest gain since January, after falling 0.5 per cent in September. These so-called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery, computers and electronic products and fabricated metals.\nEconomists had forecast core capital goods orders would drop 0.3 per cent in October. Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.8 per cent last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.\nCore capital goods shipments fell 0.8 per cent in September.\nBusiness investment dropped at a 2.7 per cent rate in the third quarter, rather than contracting at a 3.0 per cent pace as previously reported. The declines in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells, were not as steep as previously estimated.\nA report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Nov. 23. Claims had been stuck at a five-month high over the previous two weeks, pointing to some easing in the labor market.\nStill, the labour market remains on solid footing, helping to underpin consumer spending. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was unrevised at a 2.9 per cent rate in the third quarter.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada-s-debt-to-gdp-ratio-isn-t-a-major-election-issue-but-should-it-be-1.5327513", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1626791491581", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "David Cochrane", "title": "A crisis like no other: Canada's finances could take years to recover from the pandemic recession", "description": "No one knows for sure what the post-pandemic economy will look like \u2014 or which businesses will live to see it", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/coronavirus-pandemic-covid-budget-deficit-morneau-1.5571999", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5561880.1588962682!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-cda-20200506.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 16, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-05-16T15:27:12.435Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Sean Speer was working for a different prime minister when a different recession forced Canada to run what was then the largest federal deficit in history.\nSpeer was a policy adviser to then-prime minister Stephen Harper during the 2008 global financial crisis. The urgent need for stimulus compelled the deficit-hating Conservatives to run a $55.6 billion deficit in their 2009 budget.\u00a0\nIt was a staggering \u2014 but necessary \u2014 addition to the debt that amounted to 3.6 per cent of GDP. The current deficit will be at least five times bigger. The parliamentary budget officer says the deficit this year will be at least\u00a0$250 billion \u2014 and that's the optimistic estimate.\n\"It really is an extraordinary magnitude,\" said Speer, now an assistant professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. \"It will blow the previous largest deficit in Canadian history completely out of the water.\"\nThe unprecedented financial crisis of a decade ago has been eclipsed by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, both in the scale of the deficits it will create and in the uncertainty it generates\u00a0about\u00a0the path back to normal.\nThe global financial crisis seems almost simple in comparison to what the world is facing today. Back then, unsustainable mortgage policies and excessive market risk-taking triggered a banking and debt crisis that sparked a global recession.\nBut while money stopped moving, people did not. So traditional approaches to stimulus spending (combined with massive bailouts for key industries) could, and did, jolt the economy back to life.\nA decade later,\u00a0public health orders and the lack of a vaccine have put the global economy into what amounts to a medically induced coma \u2014 which makes arranging a traditional recovery difficult, if not impossible. Instead of billions of dollars in stimulus spending, the government is running up debt by sending billions of dollars in subsistence payments to Canadians and Canadian companies.\nNo one should count on a swift return to balance at the federal level. Such estimates are based on numbers that are changing constantly, but a senior government official said internal modelling suggests it will take several years at least before Ottawa's fiscal track returns to pre-pandemic levels.\n\"Things will improve fiscally from what they currently have,\" Speer said. \"But because we won't have a fully functioning economy, revenues won't rebound for God knows how long.\"\nIt's a level of uncertainty profoundly\u00a0greater\u00a0than what\u00a0Harper faced in 2009, or what Paul Martin confronted\u00a0after the Liberals won the 1993 federal election.\nMartin was the finance minister who finally balanced the federal budget after a quarter century of deficits. Speaking on a recent Canada 2020 podcast, the former prime minister said the challenge facing him\u00a0back then\u00a0was very different from what is happening today.\n\"This is primarily a health problem,\" Martin said. \"We really have to understand that the increasing growth of this debt will only stop when we have found a vaccine or a treatment.\"\nAll of which means the federal government likely will\u00a0be running eye-popping deficits for at least several years. There is no immediate prospect\u00a0of a vaccine, while a second wave of cases could halt the tentative economic re-openings many provinces are starting to explore.\nBank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz this week called the pandemic a \"massive economic and fiscal challenge\" that will \"leave higher levels of debt in its wake.\" He also said Canada was in relatively good economic and fiscal shape going into this crisis, allowing\u00a0the federal government\u00a0to carry extra debt.\n\"We began this with a very healthy economy, with unemployment at a record low and inflation on target and government debt \u2026 was in a reasonable position,\" Poloz said.\n\"That suggests to us \u2014 to me, anyway \u2014 that the kind of scenarios that are being painted here are not untoward and in historical context that there is room to manoeuvre there.\"\nMartin said the federal government will need a lot of that room\u00a0until a vaccine or viral treatments allow for an return to normal economic activity\u00a0that will largely take care of the deficits.\n\"As long as (economic growth) is greater than the interest rates of the time, it will deal with the indebtedness that has been created,\" he said. \"That's been history and there is no reason why that will not happen today, and that is why we should not be afraid to spend whatever we have to do to deal with the human tragedy we are living through.\"\nMartin said that gradual deficit reduction will accelerate\u00a0as the temporary suite of government funded relief programs are wound down.\n\"This is not a debt built up over a 20 or 30 year period,\" he said. \"It is a debt that has occurred because there is a whole suite of programs that have got to be put in place because people have been told they have to leave their jobs.\"\nBut even if Martin's optimistic growth projection comes to pass and the aid programs can be quickly wound down, Canadians should expect recovery to be slow.\nWatch: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on businesses rehiring\nThe senior official said\u00a0discussions are taking place within the federal government now\u00a0about scaling back or postponing the fulfilment of\u00a0some Liberal\u00a0election promises to deal with the larger deficits and new demands on the public purse.\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau has been reluctant to speak about post-pandemic plans and options. Like most of his provincial counterparts,\u00a0 Morneau has shelved plans to table a budget due to the current economic uncertainty and volatility.\nBut Morneau did say this week that tax hikes \u2014 including a GST increase \u2014 are not part of the government's\u00a0immediate plans to deal with the deficit.\n\"We're not thinking about raising taxes,\" Morneau told the CBC's Rosemary Barton. \"We recognize raising taxes is not what Canadians want us to do, so we're going to face up to it.\"\nWatch: Finance Minister Bill Morneau on tax hikes\nSpeer argues the federal government eventually\u00a0will have to make some difficult choices as it starts to climb its way out of the budgetary hole the pandemic created. Historically low interest rates will keep higher\u00a0debt payments manageable in the short-term, he said\u00a0\u2014 but that will change once economic activity revives and\u00a0interest rates and inflation start to creep up.\n\"I'm not a debt alarmist. I'm not saying this is a fiscal crisis,\" he said.\u00a0\"It just narrows the list of options available to federal policy makers.\"\nSpeer suggested the federal government deploy a combination of\u00a0the program review process Martin launched\u00a0in the 1990s and the deficit reduction plan Harper followed as the recession triggered by the\u00a0global financial crisis wound down.\nHe also recommended\u00a0a review of tax expenditures \u2014 to eliminate outdated tax credits and boost revenue to avoid more painful austerity measures.\nIn short, some difficult political choices face the party in power once the final tally of the pandemic is known. There's a real prospect\u00a0now\u00a0of a federal election campaign being fought\u00a0while the deficit is still north of $100 billion.\nThat's something nobody thought was possible just a few months back \u2014 which seems like\u00a0a very long time ago now.\n"}, {"author": "John Paul Tasker", "title": "Federal deficit likely to be higher than $252 billion, parliamentary budget\u00a0officer says", "description": "PBO says it's possible federal debt will hit $1 trillion because of pandemic relief spending", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-deficit-higher-than-252-billion-1.5566768", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5138746.1558027091!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/phoenix-pay-system.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 12, 2020 5:34 PM ET", "2020-05-13T17:44:54.995Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The parliamentary\u00a0budget officer (PBO) says the federal deficit likely will\u00a0exceed what he projected at the end of April as the federal government continues to spend billions of dollars\u00a0on COVID-19 support programs with no clear end in sight.\nSpeaking before the Commons finance committee Tuesday, Yves Giroux said the $252 billion figure he cited only a few weeks ago is a\u00a0low-ball estimate of\u00a0just how much the programs will cost the federal treasury this fiscal year.\nHe said Finance Minister Bill Morneau should provide a fiscal update soon to give Canadians a better sense of how much Ottawa is spending on the pandemic.\nThe $252 billion figure was based on the data the PBO had as of April 24. Since then, said Giroux,\u00a0new\u00a0aid programs have been announced for commercial rent support, the agricultural sector, students and seniors \u2014 things he called \"very expensive measures.\"\n\"I think $252 billion is on the very optimistic side, as things stand now,\" Giroux said.\n\"In all likelihood the deficit will be higher than $252 billion. If I had to bet on that number, I'd say it's more likely to be worse than that than better than that.\"\nAs a result, the federal debt will rise to more than $900 billion \u2014 or roughly $24,000 for every man, woman and child in Canada.\nGiroux said it's \"not unthinkable\" that the federal debt could reach $1 trillion, and it's\u00a0both \"possible and realistic\" that the debt could hit\u00a013 figures by this time next year.\nIn fact, depending on how long the pandemic lasts, it's possible that pandemic\u00a0programs could cost more than what the entire federal government\u00a0spent last year on everything \u2014 which was roughly $337.8 billion for the 2018-19 fiscal year.\nWatch:\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's full press conference for Tue.

Before the pandemic, the government projected a ratio closer to 30 per cent.\nWhile that figure is high, Giroux said it's still well below the 66 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio the country reached in the 1990s\u00a0\u2014 when the Wall Street Journal branded Canada \"an honourary member of the Third World.\"\nThe cost of financing this massive increase in government spending, and the resulting debt, will be relatively low, Giroux said. He said interest rates have hit rock bottom \u2014 the Bank of Canada's benchmark interest rate is now at 0.25 per cent \u2014\u00a0and\u00a0the cost of servicing the debt will be manageable.\n\"We anticipate that debt charges will not go up, which is surprising and counterintuitive,\" Giroux said. \"Interest rates are so much lower than what we anticipated them to be just two or three months ago. It doesn't cost that much to finance that growing debt.\n\"Is the government in a worrisome position right now? The answer is no.\"\nHe said the debt load could become \"unbearable\" in the event of a sizeable spike in interest rates and added the prospect of such an increase is\u00a0\"concerning.\"\nThe Liberal members of the committee asked Giroux what the cost to Canadians would have been if the government hadn't\u00a0stepped in to flow funds to Canadians through programs like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the wage subsidy.\nGiroux said that, without government support, Canadians would have suffered considerable economic pain because of the pandemic.\n\"We would have seen widespread \u2014 and I mean widespread \u2014 bankruptcies at the individual and corporate level,\" he said. \"There would be lots of defaults on mortgages, repossession of homes and cars, credit card debts that would go unserviced.\n\"The cost of doing nothing would be high.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "New Zealand plans spending spree to counter virus job losses", "description": "Finance Minister Grant Robertson unveiled a budget Thursday unlike any in nation's history", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-zealand-budget-1.5569118", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5569130.1589434734!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/new-zealand-budget.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 14, 2020 2:47 AM ET", "2020-05-14T10:49:58.433Z"], "source": null, "content": "New Zealand's government plans to borrow and spend vast amounts of money as it tries to keep unemployment below 10 per cent\u00a0in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\nFinance Minister Grant Robertson on Thursday unveiled a budget unlike any in the nation's history. Debt would shoot up from just over 20 per cent of GDP to 54 per cent by 2023, and thousands of jobs created by putting people to work building homes and improving the environment.\nStill, the increased spending will not be enough to offset the economic devastation caused by the pandemic. Unemployment is expected to rise from just over four\u00a0per cent\u00a0to nearly 10 per cent\u00a0by June. And Robertson acknowledged that tourism, which had accounted for about 10 per cent\u00a0of the economy, was not going to be the same for many years to come.\n\"We face a global economic and health crisis not seen since the Great Depression,\" Robertson said.\nThe budget was released on the same day the nation lifted most of its lockdown restrictions.\nMalls, retail stores and restaurants all reopened, and many people returned to their workplaces. That reflected the country's success to date in its attempts to eliminate the virus. Health authorities on Thursday reported zero new infections for the third day in a row. New Zealand has reported a total of about 1,500 confirmed infections and 21 deaths.\nUnder the budget plan, the government will spend 50 billion New Zealand dollars ($42\u00a0billion Cdn) over four years to help boost the economy.\nThe government had entered the crisis running a surplus and with its books in good shape compared to many other countries. Robertson said the crisis called for increased spending rather than cutting back.\n\"I'm not a fan of austerity,\" he said.\nMore than half of all workers in New Zealand are currently being subsidized by the government under a scheme that was quickly set up as the nation went into a strict lockdown in March.

Three months ago, few of us would have been aware that a handful of processing plants are responsible for most of our meat supply, or that much of the country's fruit and vegetable farming depends on the labour of migrant farm workers.\nThe question of access to food is now on the frontburner too. Within just a few weeks of the lockdown, demand\u00a0at food banks across Canada shot up by 20 per cent \u2014 or as high as 40 per cent in some cities\u00a0\u2014 as millions of Canadians lost their jobs.\nThe global food chain, meanwhile, is a complex matrix of interlocking demands and needs \u2014 a system so delicately balanced that the shocks of COVID-19 have threatened to throw off its equilibrium at almost every turn.\n\"What this crisis has done is magnify and shine a light on these cracks within our food system, which are primarily about poverty \u2014 whether we're talking about Canada or whether we're talking about global poverty,\" said Gis\u00e8le Yasmeen, Executive Director of Food Secure Canada, a national alliance of organizations and individuals working to improve food security.\n\"In a wealthy country like Canada, 4.4 million of us were food insecure before COVID-19 \u2026 including one in six children,\" she told The Sunday Edition's Michael Enright. \"Experts are predicting a doubling of people in Canada living with food insecurity by the end of this year due to widespread unemployment from the pandemic.\"\nFor Yasmeen, addressing food insecurity necessitates looking at how poverty is structured in Canada \u2014 and which communities are more likely to be marginalized within the food system.\n\"Black Canadian households are 3.5 times more likely than white Canadian households to be food insecure \u2026 Half of all First Nations families are food insecure ... And we know that two-thirds of food insecure people are working,\" she said.\nAnd any solutions for tackling food insecurity must take a systemic and integrated approach too, she added.\nSince the pandemic began, the federal government has provided $100 million in funds to help improve household access to food banks and other local food organizations. But Yasmeen believes that this type of response is short-sighted.\n\"Food banks and community food centres are doing fantastic work. There are a lot of community organizations that are really working around the clock. But the frank reality is that short-term charitable responses will never solve food insecurity,\" she said.\n\"Food insecurity has to be handled primarily through income support measures,\" Yasmeen added. \"We need to get to the root of the problem, which is poverty. And in a country like Canada, which is highly urbanized, that's about income \u2014 having adequate income relative to the cost of living.\"\n\"The evidence shows that cash transfers and income support programs \u2014 like, for example, the Canada Child Benefit, or Old Age Security \u2014 you can see very clearly in the food insecurity statistics that those programs made a difference. They are a type of basic income, essentially.\"\nYasmeen sees COVID-19 as a chance to take these income support programs further.\n\"We need a universal, livable income floor through which nobody can fall. This is long overdue,\" she said. \"And you know what? Everyone is talking about it now \u2026 We have seen what is possible. And so this is the time now, particularly in a wealthy country like Canada, to make sure that we really use this opportunity to do it right.\"\nThe pandemic has also provided an opening to rethink how our entire food system is structured, Yasmeen added.\n\"Farmers are really hurting right now. They were already facing huge challenges \u2026 Farmer debt has doubled to $106 billion since the year 2000, according to the National Farmers Union,\" she said, adding that the challenges of making a living have meant high levels of depression and anxiety among farmers.\nThere is a need for more infrastructure and support at the local and regional levels, and a move away from our excessive orientation towards exports, Yasmeen suggested.\nCanada currently imports about 30 per cent of its food and exports about 50 per cent of what it grows \u2014\u00a0but increasing local food production would strengthen the economy and help create more jobs too, she said.\nAccording to a study on Ontario, for example, replacing just 10 per cent of the province's top fruit and vegetable imports would result in a $250-million increase in provincial GDP and the creation of 3,400 new jobs, Yasmeen added.\n\"This moment is showing our incredible interdependence internationally, but also how the current Canadian food system is oriented. And that is a system which is extremely oriented towards the export of commodities \u2026 and where we're seeing all sorts of logistical bottlenecks,\" she said.\nRather than the current over-concentration of power, where just a handful of large multinationals control our food system and create various kinds of dependencies, Yasmeen believes we need to build more resilience.\n\"There is such a thing as diseconomies of scale,\" she said, pointing out that our meat supply is at the mercy of just a few plants.\nWhat this pandemic has shown is that the biggest threat to food security is not the lack of food availability or supply \u2014 it's the nature of the supply chain itself, Yasmeen added.\n\"There was a recent study that showed that close to 60 per cent of food in Canada before COVID-19 was lost or wasted\u2026 worldwide those figures are at least 30 per cent, if not higher,\" she said.\n\"The mainstream discourse is so much about 'we have too many people, not enough food,'\" Yasmeen said. \"The ghost of Thomas Malthus from the 18th century is still alive.\"\n\"In fact, we live in a world of plenty \u2026 So the global response has to be conditioned by the evidence, which shows that this is about poverty reduction and this is also about resilience and supporting small farmers.\n\"Most of the food in the world is actually grown by very small farmers, by peasants. And they need to be supported and they need the right infrastructure so that they can stabilize and thrive.\"\nClick 'listen' above to hear the full interview.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "England tiptoes out of lockdown as economy dives", "description": "U.K. economy contracted by a record 5.8 per cent in March from February", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/england-lockdown-1.5567345", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5567352.1589365190!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/1224544629.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 13, 2020 7:30 AM ET", "2020-05-13T13:51:40.106Z"], "source": null, "content": "England tentatively began easing its coronavirus lockdown on Wednesday\u00a0with some people who cannot do their jobs at home urged to return to work, as stark economic data showed the disastrous impact of the pandemic.\nThe worst-hit country in Europe with more than 40,000 deaths from COVID-19\u00a0\u2014 including 275 health and care workers, according to official data\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Britain has been in lockdown since March 23.\nThe government is loosening restrictions only gradually\u00a0for fear of triggering a second peak of infections.

The lockdown message was very straightforward \u2014\u00a0it was just stay at home.

A rebound of 5.2 per cent is expected in 2021.\"\nHamilton's GDP is set to decline by 3.2 per cent this year but will jump by 6 per cent and kick off a steady and strong resurgence \u2014 as long as the pandemic continues to become less of a threat and there isn't another set of shutdowns.\n\"When economic activity contracts so swiftly, on the other side of it you will have a stronger rebound,\" Crawford said.\nHe added Hamilton was in a great economic position before the pandemic, which has softened the impact.\nThe city is also planning an economic recovery task force to deal with the aftermath of COVID-19.\nBy summer, if the virus hasn't rebounded, Crawford thinks people will begin spending more as businesses open up and restrictions fade away.\n\"If cities like Hamilton, which have seen very strong population growth, which do have a strong and vibrant housing market, which do benefit from high-paying jobs \u2026\u00a0can just get through this lockdown period and successfully navigate the re-opening hopefully we can all put this in our rearview mirror and start the recovery in mid-summer moving on into the fall.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1732957251767", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "It's official \u2014 Canada's economy is in a recession, C.D.

Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council declared Friday.\nThe council, which monitors recessions and recoveries in Canada, said the economy peaked in February, just before drastic measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 were implemented across the country.\n\"Members agreed that by applying the council's methodology to the preliminary data available, Canada entered a recession in the first quarter of 2020,\" the council said in a statement.\nThere are no hard and fast rules for declaring a recession, although one rule of thumb used by economists is that an economy is probably in one if it has shrunk for two three-month periods in a row.\nThe council rejects the \"two quarters\" rule and instead defines a recession as a \"pronounced, persistent\u00a0and pervasive decline in aggregate economic activity\" based largely on GDP and the job market.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is still less than two months old in Canada, but the council said Friday that the slowdown is already so swift and deep that it's safe to declare a recession already.\n\"The council agreed the magnitude of the contraction makes it extremely unlikely that any future adjustments will overturn the conclusion of a major drop in economic activity in the first quarter,\" the council said.\nDeclaring a recession is always controversial, since there is no\u00a0unanimous view as to what qualifies as one. By the \"two quarters of economic decline\" definition, Canada had a brief, slight recession in late 2014 and early 2015, as the price of oil crashed.\nBut the Business Cycle Council still says\u00a0that slowdown didn't meet the\u00a0bar as an official recession by their metrics.\nIn the council's view, this is the first recession Canada has seen since the financial crisis that began in 2008. And the data suggests this one is on track to be quite a bit worse than that one.\nThe March jobs report showed more than a million jobs were lost in the month, while a preliminary estimate by Statistics Canada suggested the economy contracted by nine per cent in the same month. Those are\u00a0the biggest one-month plunges in jobs and GDP on record in Canada.\nWhile the decline in March was record-setting, economists expect the data for April will show an even bigger drop, with the measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus in place for the entire month.\nThe eight-person council, which normally meets once a year in December, decided to meet twice last month, once it became clear that something dramatic was happening to Canada's economy.\nStephen Gordon, an economics professor\u00a0at Universit\u00e9 Laval and member of the council, says the current economic slowdown is a great example of how the \"two quarters of contraction\" definition of a recession is too dogmatic.\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, he noted that if the slowdown had started in April as opposed to March, the entire first quarter would have been excluded. And since a rebound in the summer is quite plausible, that would make the current recession only one-quarter long\u00a0\u2014 deep though it may be.\n\"This episode would fail the two-quarter test, even though it's obviously a recession,\" he said.\nThe current episode is a good illustration why the the \"2 quarters of declining GDP\" definition of a recession is not a hard-and-fast rule. 1/\nStatistics Canada reported Thursday that economic growth had stalled going into the crisis, with real gross domestic product essentially unchanged in February due to teacher strikes in Ontario and rail blockades across many parts of the country.\nThe official estimates of GDP for March and the first quarter of 2020 will be released on May 29.\n"}, {"author": "Jesse\u00a0Hajer and Lynne Fernandez", "title": "Austerity and COVID-19: Manitoba government creating, not solving, problems", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-government-economy-covid-19-1.5539666", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5539238.1587498532!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-mba-20200415.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 21, 2020 4:24 PM CT", "2020-04-21T21:24:17.437Z"], "source": null, "content": "COVID-19 has upended communities and economies across the globe. Canadian political leaders have taken unprecedented steps to slow the spread of COVID-19, including the closure of non-essential businesses, schools and universities. These measures, while necessary, have led to a severe drop in economic output and employment.\nIn response, governments in Canada, as elsewhere, are intervening in economic affairs in a manner not seen in generations.\nThe scale of the crisis and its exposure of woefully inadequate social safety nets\u00a0has led to even established conservative voices calling for a permanent growth of the role of government in the economy.\nThe approach of the Manitoba government has been restrained compared to other Canadian jurisdictions, particularly with economic measures and supports aimed at low-income Manitobans and workers who have lost their jobs.\nMany of the economic measures announced to date have taken the form of tax and payment deferrals, as opposed to flat-rate cash benefits that have played a role in the federal response.\nThis week, the provincial response appears to be moving from lacklustre to straight-up counterproductive.\u00a0\nTwo sets of austerity measures aimed at cutting provincial costs are planned: the first is reducing the employment and wages of public sector workers, with a target of $500 million (but under some scenarios discussed, that number would be as high as $900 million).\nThe second measure is to cut spending by $750 million through other spending control mechanisms. This has involved directing government departments to compile lists of service providers funded by the province, for the purposes of making cuts to these organizations.\nThe lack of support and cuts are in stark contrast to the way other provinces are responding. The Manitoba response is the opposite of what standard economic theory would suggest in a recession.\nMaintaining government employment and spending supports the overall \"aggregate demand\" for goods and services. This demand creates sales for businesses and supports jobs.\nEconomists statistically quantify these effects with multipliers reflecting how $1\u00a0in spending in the economy leads to more than $1 in economic activity, because that spending is revenue for someone else, and in turn stimulates more spending/revenues, etc.\nThe opposite is also true, with spending cuts having negative ripple effects throughout the economy. This is a big part of the reason the government of Canada has come up with several programs to flow money to Canadians during this crisis.\u00a0\nWe can use multipliers to estimate the overall impact of the proposed government of Manitoba cuts on labour incomes, income tax revenues and economic activity in Manitoba.\nTo cut public sector employment, the government is proposing a federal work-share program where \"non-essential\" government workers would be reduced to working two or three days a week, while the federal government would pay benefits for the remaining two or three days at 55 per cent of salary, up to the maximum annual insurable earnings of $54,200.\nFor the public service as a whole, we estimate they will keep on average 67 per cent and 78 per cent under the two scenarios.\nUsing the multiplier approach, we estimate that the combined impact of the proposed work-share program and $750 million in additional cuts will result in:\nThe provincial government claims that COVID-19 expenditures and lost revenue will require a $5-billion increase to the provincial deficit, pushing us to the edge of a looming \"fiscal cliff.\"\nThis $5 billion fear-mongering assumes that the monthly deficit increase being experienced now will continue for the entire fiscal year.\nThis is not consistent with economic forecasts that predict the impact to be concentrated in one or two quarters of 2020, as social distancing measures are gradually relaxed.\nAs a comparison, the $5 billion works out to approximately $3,650 per Manitoban, while all of New York state, with\u00a0a current infection rate 70 times that of\u00a0Manitoba, is\u00a0estimating a fiscal impact of $770 US per person.\nEven giving the province the benefit of the doubt on the questionable $5 billion estimate, what would be the actual impact of fully funding this $5 billion deficit through government borrowing?\nThis is an important question, as the government should be borrowing at this time.\nOur debt is currently at $26.7 billion. The most widely accepted measure of the effect of debt on the economy is the debt to GDP ratio (debt/GDP).\nGoing into 2020, GDP was around $74.8 billion, so our debt/GDP was 34.3 percent. Although this is higher than what it was 10 years ago, it is a perfectly manageable ratio.\nThe $5 billion extra debt will put our debt up to $31.7 billion.\nWe know that our economy, like every other economy in the world, is going to shrink. Assuming a 3.1 per cent reduction, our GDP could fall to $72.5 billion.\nThat will bring our debt/GDP to 44 per cent. A 44 per cent debt/GDP ratio is underwhelming given the enormity of the crisis we face. In fact, this new ratio is still less than some other provinces had in 2017.\nThere are also two moving parts to the debt/GDP ratio:\u00a0if the Manitoba government spends and allows the debt to increase, the economy is stimulated, increasing GDP. Shoring up Manitoba's economy now will increase our capacity to weather the crisis, rescue our businesses, grow in the future\u00a0and repay the debt later.\nHow much of a difference would this borrowing actually have on our debt servicing charges?\nAssuming we were to borrow the $5 billion at Manitoba's going rate of 3.2 per cent for a 30-year bond, we would incur debt servicing charges of $260 million/year. Dramatic as this number sounds, the PST cut in 2019 cost us $330 million in annual revenues.\nOnce the economy recovers, we can look at new taxes on high income earners taxes and reverse tax cuts, if necessary, to manage the debt.\nIt seems as if Premier Pallister thinks the real crisis is one of provincial government debt, whatever the amount turns out to be\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not the hardships people and businesses are facing as they lose customers, jobs, wages and security.\nThe premier insists that we need all hands on deck to deal with this calamity, yet is unwilling to commit his government to do its part.\nWhere our economy lands when we come out of the pandemic depends on him stepping up to the plate sooner rather than later. That includes using government borrowing for necessary expenditures rather than putting that burden on the backs of workers and business and, as a consequence, dealing the economy another blow.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Many employees who could were sent to work from home, while others were laid off or had their hours slashed.\nSo far, more than seven million people have received federal emergency aid through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which has paid out more than $25.6 billion in benefits, based on the latest federal figures.\nThe Liberals have budgeted $35 billion for the CERB, which pays $2,000 a month for up to 16 weeks to anyone whose income has dropped below $1,000 a month. Giroux's report estimates the measures will end up costing the government $35.5 billion.\nA more detailed note explaining the figure, published separately this morning, estimates the CERB will end up reaching 8.5 million people.\nBut the note warns the estimates are \"highly sensitive\" to the course the economy takes over the coming months, as well as the spread of COVID-19. And some of the spending will depend on how\u00a0the program interacts with a new wage subsidy program that begins payments next week.\nGiroux also estimates the wage subsidy program will cost $76 billion, slightly more than the $73 billion price tag the Liberals have put on the measure.\nThe subsidy will cover 75 per cent of employee salaries, up to $847 a week,\u00a0for 12 weeks, retroactive to mid-March and through to the start of June.\nIn a costing note specifically about the subsidy, the PBO says the cost of the program will depend somewhat on the behavioural response of employers.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Ontario confirms 308 new COVID-19 cases, state of emergency to be pushed to June 2", "description": "COVID-19 death toll in Ontario sits at 1,776, according to a CBC count", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid-19-coronavirus-may-11-emergency-order-extended-1.5564237", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5543698.1587736372!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/to-lockdown.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 11, 2020 9:55 AM ET", "2020-05-12T01:29:10.034Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Ontario reported 308 additional cases of COVID-19 on Monday, the third straight day\u00a0that the growth rate in new cases has been below 2 per cent.\nThe province has now seen a total of 20,546 cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak began in late January.

Millions more have lost most of their work hours. In total, 5.5 million people have either lost their jobs or have been working far less since the week of April 12.\n\"These numbers tell us what we already knew \u2013 that right now, Canadians are hurting because of this pandemic,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday.\u00a0\nThe hurt likely goes even deeper than those numbers suggest.\nAlready, 7.7 million Canadians are getting\u00a0cheques\u00a0through the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, while 1.7\u00a0million workers have qualified for the federal emergency wage subsidy. \u00a0More than 45\u00a0per cent of the labour force is now receiving some sort of federal government support.\nWatch: The pandemic and essential workers\nEven as some provinces inch toward\u00a0reopening their economies, there are few signs of rapid economic improvement. The PBO's office projects the economy could shrink by as much as 30 per cent in the second quarter.\nIn a recent article for Policy Magazine, former parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page said the staggering economic data left the government with two clear choices: run up the debt to help households and businesses and increase the odds of recovery\u00a0and longer-term growth \u2014 or offer less help, minimize debt growth and diminish the chances of recovery.\n\"All countries will wake up after the global pandemic with much higher debt levels. Canada is fortunate because we are starting at a much lower net debt-to-GDP level,\" Page wrote. \"If low interest rates are maintained, there is no good policy case for rushing to austerity \u2014 either spending cuts or tax increases. The economic recovery will likely be much too weak and fragile for austerity.\"\nFederal bureaucrats are in the middle of a review of pandemic-related aid programs, primarily to see if they need to be tweaked or extended. What could emerge from that process is what the senior\u00a0official described as a \"glide-and-launch phase,\" where some direct aid programs slowly wind down while economic stimulus programs are launched.\nTrudeau revealed\u00a0one of the first steps of that review on Friday when he announced that the wage subsidy program would continue beyond June to help kick-start the reopening of provincial\u00a0economies\u00a0and allow people to move from the CERB to paid work.\n\"We need an economy to come back to and direct support is a key part of that,\" said a finance official speaking on background.\u00a0\"Everything is going to be largely dependent on where we are and what the needs are.\"\nBut even as the federal government prepares for the next phase of its pandemic response, it's\u00a0still busy trying to deal with the first wave of challenges. The already-extended wage subsidy is still in the getting-money-out-the-door phase. There's also the\u00a0unfulfilled promise of direct financial help for seniors to address. And hard-hit sectors such as airlines, energy and hospitality will need some kind of sector-specific bailouts.\n\"The big business bailout is the hardest one to do out of all of them,\" said the senior federal official. \"How do you bridge people to a better time and what do you get in return for that?\"\nPart of the government's\u00a0concern here is the risk of being seen bailing out companies that use tax havens or engage in tax avoidance. There's a desire at the federal level\u00a0to make sure that any bailout includes a degree of public oversight and can support\u00a0the argument that it was done in the public's interest.\n\"We will, over the coming days, start looking at specific sectoral supports,\" Trudeau said Friday. \"But even then, our focus will be on the workers \u2026 and not on the corporate well-being of an industry or sector.\"\nAnd while airlines have been promised some sort of help, public transit companies are also knocking on Ottawa's door.\u00a0The Trudeau government is a big booster of mass public\u00a0transit and a big spender\u00a0when it comes to capital investment to boost transit capacity.\nBut transit operations are largely a municipal responsibility. Ottawa is trying to find a way to help that sector without becoming a long-term player in transit policy.\nAs this crisis continues, jurisdictional lines are blurring. Many municipal and provincial governments were in\u00a0precarious\u00a0financial situations going into the pandemic and will be even more\u00a0vulnerable as they emerge from it. The Bank of Canada already\u00a0has launched a multi-billion dollar program to buy provincial government bonds because provinces like Newfoundland and Labrador have had trouble borrowing on the open market.\nAll of this will require Ottawa's attention when the dust settles \u2014 and billions of dollars more in federal spending may be required. Senior Liberals are already conceding they may need to go slower and be less aggressive on their campaign commitments, because the virus\u00a0has presented them with an urgent new\u00a0set of priorities.\n\"We are not yet talking about stimulus,\" Trudeau said. \"We are still very much in the support and emergency phase right now.\"\nBut the costs will keep growing. We still have no clear idea of how much this will cost the country. And the government's view is that it's still too early to talk about paying the bill.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Diverting water from Lake Diefenbaker could help expand Sask. agriculture, Ralph Goodale says", "description": "Conduit infrastructure would cost about $3B", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/diverting-water-from-lake-diefenbaker-could-help-expand-sask-agriculture-ralph-goodale-says-1.5560773", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4216709.1500666872!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/lake-diefenbaker.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 08, 2020 5:00 AM CT", "2020-05-08T11:00:00.021Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Ralph Goodale, former Regina MP, thinks an old idea could provide a fresh start for Saskatchewan's agricultural industry.\nThe idea \u2014 conduits in Lake Diefenbaker which could divert water in four different directions to other parts of the province \u2014 would effectively prevent flood or drought in large portions of the province's grain belt, Goodale said.\n\"I think the time has come to finish the vision,\" Goodale told CBC Radio's\u00a0The Afternoon Edition\u00a0on Thursday. \"It would vastly expand our productive capacity in agriculture.\"\nThe former federal cabinet minister said the diversions could irrigate about 400,000 acres of farmland\u00a0\u2014 roughly 161,874 hectares\u00a0\u2014 and increase its capacity for production.\n\"The other thing it does is directly addresses the consequences of climate change on the prairies by giving us the infrastructure capacity to control water flows,\" he added.\nThe idea of conduits, though\u00a0they've never materialized, were motivation behind the constructions of the Gardiner Dam, Lake Diefenbaker and Douglas Provincial Park, Goodale said.\n\"You expand agriculture, more diversification, more innovation and probably in the process of building and running this project, the experts are saying you would add something like four per cent to Saskatchewan's GDP,\" he said.\nThe cost is estimated at $3 billion.

He hopes to be back in business for the 2021 season.\u00a0\nThe Reversing Falls Restaurant had been open year-round until last December, when Kotlowski decided to become a seasonal business.\nEven if the borders were to open with Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, there still wouldn't be enough visitors to warrant opening, he said.\u00a0\n\"We were actually hoping for a gain of 10,000 visitors. Last year, we had 17,000 visitors to the skywalk and we were hoping to increase that, but with a decline of this proportion, it's a no-brainer that there's not going to be enough business for us to open.\"\nFitch said it's important to get tourism going for more than just economic reasons.\n\"People have been working very hard, who continue to work, and there's other people that have been cooped up a little bit and been isolated.

In order to prevent the collapse of the economy, aggressive fiscal and monetary policy become the order of the day.\u00a0\nThe Manitoba government, though, appears to disagree with the weight of historical evidence, preferring to focus on the costs to the provincial treasury rather than costs of the government's lack of action on the lives of Manitobans.\u00a0\nAs economist Joseph Stiglitz put it, when you are at war, you don't ask \"Can we afford it?\"\u00a0\nIn 1930, as the Great Depression took hold in the U.S., President Herbert Hoover infamously made the depression worse by focusing on balancing the budget. As the Great Depression wore on, deficit spending became widely accepted as a remedy to mitigate the crisis (as historian Michael Horn put it, \"only government could keep hundreds of thousands of Canadians from starving or freezing to death\").\nBut the spending was too parsimonious to actually end the Depression.\u00a0\nWhen the Second World War began, government spending expanded significantly, essential to winning the war and finally getting us out of the Great Depression. At the end of the war in the U.S. and Canada, the debt-to-income ratio rose to historic levels \u2014 in 1946, Canada's debt was 109 per cent of GDP.\u00a0\nIt declined over the next few decades while the economy prospered not because anxious post-depression governments cut public spending, but in part because they spent taxpayer dollars to develop our modern health and education sectors, making productive investments in infrastructure and research.\nRather, the government used the resulting growth in GDP to pay down the debt over time. Keynesian economics 101.\u00a0\nIn the 2008 Great Recession, the opposition parties forced Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper to pass a massive fiscal stimulus package to prevent unemployment and bankruptcy. The Bank of Canada contributed tens of billions of dollars to shore up our financial system.\nThe Bush and Obama administrations in the U.S. did the same to stave off a potential repeat of the Great Depression. In the early days of the crisis, conservative Republican George W. Bush argued that without a government bailout of the financial sector, \"this sucker could go down.\"\nThe treasury bailed out the financial system and Obama's $800-billion stimulus bill extended unemployment benefits, rebuilt roads and bridges, prevented teacher layoffs and provided temporary help for people who lost their jobs or needed other assistance because of the poor economy. For economists like Paul Krugman, while the stimulus prevented a deeper decline in the economy, it should have been much larger.\nIn the current pandemic crisis, Prime Minister Trudeau is clearly paying attention to these lessons of history by ensuring the needy will not freeze in the dark, that the federal public sector maintains its workforce and wages, and that businesses and their workers will get support.\u00a0\nHe understands that without this kind of government support, huge structural problems with the economy will prolong the pain well beyond the end of the pandemic.\u00a0\nLike Hoover, though, the Pallister government is rowing in the opposite direction by pursuing its long-standing desire to reduce the size of the government with plans to cut funding for charities and non-profit organizations, the public sector and the universities.\nThe province is threatening to lay off workers and cut wages in the middle of the pandemic.\nThus far, the provincial government's underwhelming support measures consist of hiring a local firm to set up a call centre to help Manitobans access federal money and a program to give eligible small businesses $6,000 each, neither of which suggests a government committed to addressing the massive economic downturn caused by the crisis.\nEconomists Jesse Hajer and Lynne Fernandez estimate that the proposed cuts would reduce provincial GDP by between $1.3 and $1.5 billion. Members of Manitoba's business community have described the province's approach as \"penny wise and pound foolish.\"\nAs Stiglitz suggests, such cutbacks in jobs and funding \"will show up in the unemployment statistics, but the deeper effects \u2014 on our economic growth and social fabric \u2014 won't be fully apparent for years to come.\"\u00a0\nNo other government in Canada has done more to damage \u00a0our future with less economic justification than the government of Manitoba.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs Asper School professor Shiu-Yik Au perceptively pointed out, while Ontario and Quebec face greater health costs from the pandemic, both provinces have taken much greater responsibility to help their citizens.\u00a0\nAmong its actions, Ontario increased payments to low-income seniors\u00a0and families with children, and funded Indigenous communities and municipalities. In Quebec, the government has provided emergency support to small and medium businesses, the tourism industry, and workers.\u00a0Both of these provinces have higher debt-to-GDP levels than Manitoba.\u00a0\nAusterity has failed as an economic strategy wherever and whenever it has been tried. The Pallister government is rowing against the tide of history, creating lasting damage for Manitobans to clean up for years to come.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

The IEA also said the buildup of unsold oil from the first part of the year \"threatens to overwhelm the logistics of the oil industry \u2014 ships, pipelines and storage tanks \u2014 in the coming weeks.\"\nCOVID-19 also caused Canadian home sales to plunge 14 per cent in March.

Social distancing measures stay in place until May 2021, non-essential businesses are shuttered and\u00a0there is another global economic slowdown.\u00a0\nIn the worst-case scenario, GDP contracts 3.5 per cent in 2020 and a further one per cent\u00a0in 2021.\nEven the best-case scenario predicts\u00a0unemployment levels over 10 per cent in 2021 and at worst\u00a015.6 per cent that\u00a0year.\nThe report says the city's goals through the economic fallout from COVID-19 (beyond maintaining essential services such as police and fire) are\u00a0to \"sustain employment both privately and publicly\" in the short term and \"be prepared to identify major shovel-ready infrastructure projects\" in the long term.\nThose projects would be financed by either the provincial or federal governments.\nBowman says the commitment to maintain the city's capital spending on roads, sewers and other infrastructure\u00a0is \"incredibly important to the economic recovery.\"\nThat got support from the Business Council of Manitoba, whose\u00a0members have grown increasingly concerned about how a recovery would take shape.\n\"The important thing with infrastructure is you get something for your money,\" said business council president Bram Strain.\u00a0\n\"So you're not giving a subsidy, you're not giving out tax deferral.

Bowman told reporters Tuesday a decision on that was due soon.\nThe head of the Amalgamated Transit Union says the city should find ways to deploy staff rather than making cuts.\n\"Service cuts at this point will hurt the local economy in the short\u00a0and long term, and could result in the city losing experienced personnel,\" said\u00a0ATU 1505 president Romeo Ignacio.\n"}, {"author": "Shiu-Yik Au", "title": "Austerity is the wrong path for Manitoba during coronavirus pandemic: U of M professor", "description": "'We can't afford not to help those around us,' says Asper School of Business assistant prof Shiu-Yik Au", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/opinion-coronavirus-manitoba-economy-austerity-1.5534427", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5534540.1587055876!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/empty-winnipeg-streets-covid-19.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 16, 2020 3:19 PM CT", "2020-04-16T20:19:00.779Z"], "source": null, "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a tumultuous time for both the health and wealth of all Manitobans.\nHowever, Premier Brian Pallister's and Mayor Brian Bowman's\u00a0dangerous plans to reduce non-essential government spending\u00a0during this pandemic \u2014\u00a0such as laying off workers or reducing government pay to just two days a week\u00a0\u2014\u00a0will badly damage our economy.\nThe 2008 financial crisis showed that a better plan is to increase spending during this pandemic.\nPeople often falsely use the analogy of a province or country being akin to a family \u2014 if a family has less income, then it should cut back on its expenses. However, a province is not a family \u2014 every dollar that the province saves\u00a0is a dollar (or more) that someone else in the province will not earn.\u00a0\nIn economics, this is called the paradox of thrift. If everyone in the Manitoban economy cuts back spending, then everyone's income will fall \u2014 and as everyone's incomes fall, spending will once again fall, triggering a vicious cycle. Paul Krugman, 2008 Nobel laureate in economics, noted these exact same problems with austerity following the financial crisis.\nAusterity was tried in Europe following the financial crisis of 2008. There, countries desperately cut government spending to balance budgets. The International Monetary Fund found that austerity worsened the financial crisis rather than easing it, as this graph shows.\nEvery $1 reduction in deficit reduced the gross domestic product (GDP) of their country by up to $1.70!\nIf Manitoba were to cut personnel expenditures by 60 per cent for four months, the government would save approximately $118 million\u00a0\u2014 but this could cost the economy up to $201 million.\nIt's clear that fiscal tightening or austerity will be damaging to our province, but that leads to the natural question \u2014 what is the best path forward?\u00a0\nIn this time of fear and uncertainty, we need the government of Manitoba to spend more money. Governments can break the vicious cycle of reduced spending and income by leaning into the wind and spending more in times of crisis.\u00a0\nFor example, in Ontario, the government has issued greater support for low-income seniors, helped families with children with direct payments, provided funding to Indigenous communities and emergency funding to municipalities, reduced payroll taxes, and many other items. In Quebec, the government has provided emergency support to small and medium businesses, the tourism industry, and workers.\nThe province of Manitoba should enact similar measures that focus on individuals who are less able to handle the economic shock, such as the homeless, youth, single-parent families, etc.\u00a0\nThe province's existing programs could be enhanced temporarily to expand employment and income assistance, the Manitoba child benefit, rent assist, and 55 Plus, etc., to a larger group of individuals.\nFurther, the province could replicate some of the better programs from other provinces, such as emergency loans to small businesses or reducing payroll taxes. These temporary enhancements would help Manitoba weather this crisis and avoid a long-lasting recession or even a depression.\nCan Manitoba afford short-term emergency measures like this? The answer is, resoundingly, yes.\u00a0\nManitoba's 2018-2019 debt was 34.4 per cent of GDP, which was lower than Ontario's and Quebec's debt levels, both of which are suffering more heavily at the hands of COVID-19. Yet both of those provinces have enacted large spending programs during the pandemic.\u00a0\nWe are lucky that we both have more fiscal room to act and less damage from the virus and should act more.\u00a0\nBack to the lessons learned from 2008.\nThere were European countries that increased their government spending: Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands and Slovakia were all able to tolerate large increases in government debt.\nFor example, Finland had a debt equal to 32.7 per cent of GDP before the crisis, which rose to a high of 63.4 per cent in 2015.

However, a province is not a family \u2014 every dollar that the province saves\u00a0is a dollar (or more) that someone else in the province will not earn.\u00a0\nIn economics, this is called the paradox of thrift. If everyone in the Manitoban economy cuts back spending, then everyone's income will fall \u2014 and as everyone's incomes fall, spending will once again fall, triggering a vicious cycle. Paul Krugman, 2008 Nobel laureate in economics, noted these exact same problems with austerity following the financial crisis.\nAusterity was tried in Europe following the financial crisis of 2008. There, countries desperately cut government spending to balance budgets. The International Monetary Fund found that austerity worsened the financial crisis rather than easing it, as this graph shows.\nEvery $1 reduction in deficit reduced the gross domestic product (GDP) of their country by up to $1.70!\nIf Manitoba were to cut personnel expenditures by 60 per cent for four months, the government would save approximately $118 million\u00a0\u2014 but this could cost the economy up to $201 million.\nIt's clear that fiscal tightening or austerity will be damaging to our province, but that leads to the natural question \u2014 what is the best path forward?\u00a0\nIn this time of fear and uncertainty, we need the government of Manitoba to spend more money. Governments can break the vicious cycle of reduced spending and income by leaning into the wind and spending more in times of crisis.\u00a0\nFor example, in Ontario, the government has issued greater support for low-income seniors, helped families with children with direct payments, provided funding to Indigenous communities and emergency funding to municipalities, reduced payroll taxes, and many other items. In Quebec, the government has provided emergency support to small and medium businesses, the tourism industry, and workers.\nThe province of Manitoba should enact similar measures that focus on individuals who are less able to handle the economic shock, such as the homeless, youth, single-parent families, etc.\u00a0\nThe province's existing programs could be enhanced temporarily to expand employment and income assistance, the Manitoba child benefit, rent assist, and 55 Plus, etc., to a larger group of individuals.\nFurther, the province could replicate some of the better programs from other provinces, such as emergency loans to small businesses or reducing payroll taxes. These temporary enhancements would help Manitoba weather this crisis and avoid a long-lasting recession or even a depression.\nCan Manitoba afford short-term emergency measures like this? The answer is, resoundingly, yes.\u00a0\nManitoba's 2018-2019 debt was 34.4 per cent of GDP, which was lower than Ontario's and Quebec's debt levels, both of which are suffering more heavily at the hands of COVID-19. Yet both of those provinces have enacted large spending programs during the pandemic.\u00a0\nWe are lucky that we both have more fiscal room to act and less damage from the virus and should act more.\u00a0\nBack to the lessons learned from 2008.\nThere were European countries that increased their government spending: Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands and Slovakia were all able to tolerate large increases in government debt.\nFor example, Finland had a debt equal to 32.7 per cent of GDP before the crisis, which rose to a high of 63.4 per cent in 2015. Belgium had an 87 per cent debt level pre-crisis and that rose to a whopping 107.5 per cent in 2014.\nAll of these countries were able to increase spending and survive the increase in debt, and continue to thrive today.\nThese countries'\u00a0debt-to-GDP levels typically peaked between six and seven years after the crisis, and then started to decline through a combination of increased GDP growth and controlled government spending. Thus, Manitoba could increase its debt during this pandemic and then control spending over the next six or seven years, to reduce debt to more manageable levels.\u00a0\nThis is less damaging than cutting during the pandemic as the economy is less sensitive to government spending in economic boom times.\n_______________________________________________________________________\n______________________________________________________________________\nManitobans have a proud history of protecting their communities.

But the pandemic and the subsequent global economic shutdown have not\u00a0slowed down Canada's efforts to secure a seat at the UN table.\nThe bid instead has been redirected toward organizing or chairing virtual global conferences the Trudeau government sees as\u00a0demonstrating Canada's global\u00a0leadership in a way that could win\u00a0more votes.\n\"The best campaign is when we don't need to campaign, when we just show our leadership, that this is the type of voice that you would want at the Security Council,\" Foreign Affairs Minister\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne told CBC News.\nCanada is in a tight fight with Norway and Ireland for the two non-permanent seats\u00a0out of 10\u00a0on the 15-member council that are reserved for Western countries.\nMost experts think Norway has a lock on one of those seats, leaving Ireland and Canada to duke it out for the other one (even though Canada entered the race late).\nBut the Liberal government now\u00a0sees an opportunity. Champagne said he believes Canada's international standing has grown in 2020, and not only because of its response to the pandemic. The minister also\u00a0is banking on a boosted\u00a0profile because of Canada's role in coordinating efforts to investigate the destruction of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, which was\u00a0shot down over Iran in January, killing all 176 passengers and crew.\nChampagne points to the fact Canada is a member of both the G7 and G20, unlike its competitors, and argues that status allows the government to bring other leaders together and \"amplify the voice of other nations\" that are more vulnerable in the current health crisis.\nAnd the pandemic itself also could cut the cost of Canada's\u00a0campaign\u00a0for a Security Council seat,\u00a0which already has set the government back $2 million.\n\"We do a lot of things virtually these days, so it allows us to reach more people without having to go very far,\" Champagne said.\nCritics were questioning the Trudeau government's Security Council campaign even before the global pandemic upended government agendas around the world. Now, the government is saying\u00a0Canada needs\u00a0to be at the big\u00a0table to have a say in how the world recovers from the pandemic \u2014 even though\u00a0the Security Council has been relatively silent on the crisis to date.\n\"It's also in our very selfish national interests that the recovery in other parts of the world is as strong as possible,\" said Canada's Ambassador to the United Nations\u00a0Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blanchard, who has been working behind the scenes on the campaign.\n\"This is a table where the entire world wants to be, because when you're around that table you're more influential and you're more relevant.\"\nStill, the factors that made Canada's bid look like a long shot before the pandemic arrived are still in play: a faltering peacekeeping commitment and relatively low foreign aid commitments.\n\"Ireland has been peacekeeping since 1958. It's never stopped,\" said Stephen Lewis, a former Canadian ambassador to the\u00a0UN\u00a0who is closely following the race.\n\"Our failure on that front is our most serious Achilles heel in seeking the seat.\"\nThe pandemic has allowed Canada to boost its presence on the international stage. Trudeau participated Monday in an\u00a0online pledging conference to raise funds for vaccine development,\u00a0spearheaded by the European Union. While\u00a0Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg pledged more than $1 billion US\u00a0for vaccine development and eventual distribution, Trudeau pointed to $850 million Cdn Canada already had committed to accelerated vaccine development.\nThat $850 million includes $74 million that's part of the $159.5 million foreign aid package Canada's international development minister announced in April. Ottawa says it's only a beginning.\n\"This takes a global effort,\" Trudeau said Monday at his daily briefing. \"There will be more to come as the world grapples with this pandemic.\"\nStill, Lewis said Canada's international funding\u00a0commitment maintains the same level of aid Canada has\u00a0always\u00a0offered, and the Liberal government needs to work harder to match\u00a0its \"rhetoric with performance,\"\u00a0particularly when it comes to the pandemic.\nCanada gives about 0.26 per cent of its GDP in foreign aid. Norway, the world's most generous donor, gives 1 per cent of its GDP.\nThe old way of winning\u00a0a Security Council seat \u2014 having the prime minister or other high-profile ministers show up in foreign capitals to schmooze\u00a0\u2014 is \"a bit of a sham,\" said Lewis.\u00a0The vote is a secret ballot and the ambassadors who cast the votes don't always follow orders from the top.\nLewis said the popularity of Canada's ambassador could\u00a0tip the scales, however.\n\"Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blanchard is the real key to this [campaign],\" he said. \"He's really first-rate and that does not happen often.\"\nGlobal Affairs Canada is campaigning as though the vote will go ahead on June 17, but there is pressure from some nations to postpone it until the fall, given the logistics involved in having 193 representatives of member states vote online.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2655700928", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada's economy grew at 0.3% pace in fourth quarter, slowest level in almost 4 years", "description": "Bad weather and strikes slowed growth to a crawl", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-gdp-december-1.5479368", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4757643.1538604600!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/factory-worker-chris-rebelo-at-automatic-coating.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 28, 2020 8:58 AM ET", "2020-02-28T13:59:50.737Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada's economic growth slowed to an annualized rate of 0.3 per cent\u00a0in the fourth quarter, the worst performance in almost four years, thanks in part to strikes, bad weather and shutdowns, Statistics Canada said on Friday.\nThe increase matched both the forecast of analysts in a Reuters poll as well as the Bank of Canada's prediction.

We also recognize that raising taxes is not what Canadians want us to do,\" he said.\u00a0\"\nWatch:\u00a0Morneau 'not thinking about' raising GST despite COVID-19 relief spending:\nMorneau's comments come as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today sounded a similar tone, downplaying\u00a0the need for a federal budget in the short term, saying the fast-moving\u00a0effects of the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic would render any projections moot.\nBut members of the Conservative opposition are demanding that Morneau heed calls from the parliamentary budget officer (PBO)\u00a0\u2014 who estimated that\u00a0this year's budget deficit could be more than $250\u00a0billion\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to table some sort of update to give Canadians a better sense of the country's fiscal health as\u00a0government\u00a0spending reaches levels not seen in decades.\nMorneau was set to deliver a federal budget at the end of March. The pandemic disrupted those plans.\nSince then, Ottawa has rolled out hundreds of billions of dollars in supports for workers and employers \u2014 programs that have pushed the 2020-21 deficit to an estimated $251\u00a0billion.\nThe PBO said Tuesday that deficit estimate, first reported on April 30, is already outdated and likely\u00a0will need to be revised upwards.\nHe said a\u00a0federal debt\u00a0topping $1 trillion by year's end is \"not unthinkable\". At the start of the year, the federal debt was roughly $700 billion.\nBut Trudeau said today he has no immediate plans to table a budget because the government simply doesn't know how the economy will fare in the months ahead, as social distancing measures continue to cripple economic activity.\nHe also seemed to rule\u00a0out tabling some sort of document that could be updated as the fiscal situation stabilizes.\nTrudeau said the government is focused on \"immediate\" needs over long-term budgeting.\n\"A budget is usually something that projects what's going to happen to the Canadian economy for the next 12 months and right now, we're having a lot of difficulty establishing with any certainty what's going to happen in the next 12 weeks,\" Trudeau said today at his daily briefing with reporters.\n\"The situation is changing extremely rapidly.\"\nIn the midst of the 2008-09 global recession, the previous Conservative government tabled a budget in January 2009 and a fiscal update followed in September as the Tories responded to a cratering economy.\nWhen asked if there were any plans for a fiscal update this year, a spokesperson for Morneau said the department\u00a0had no comment beyond what Trudeau said at his press conference.\nConservative members pressed Morneau in the Commons today,\u00a0asking if the government had any projections of how much it would cost to finance the growing debt.\nMorneau said he will give a full accounting of the costs of the government's pandemic measures \"when we have the ability.\"\nThe PBO said the cost to service the debt will be manageable\u00a0for now,\u00a0because interest rates are at record lows \u2014 but a spike in those rates would be very \"concerning.\"\nWhile cabinet ministers have been reluctant to say if or when the next fiscal update will be released, a senior public servant told the Senate's national finance committee Tuesday that work is underway on such a plan.\n\"We're in the process of beginning that fiscal update, which, of course, involves consultation with the private sector, and we expect to be able to provide a fiscal update in the coming weeks,\" said Alison McDermott, an official in the economic and fiscal policy branch of\u00a0the\u00a0Department of Finance.\n\"I don't think the government has made any announcements about the timing of that at this point.\"\nKevin Page, the country's first PBO and the president and CEO of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa, said Morneau should produce a fiscal update by June to make\u00a0Canadians feel confident that the government has its fiscal house in order.\nPage said nobody is expecting a traditional 500-page budget \u2014 \"We're not in that\u00a0world right now, we get that,\" he said \u2014 but there's still a need for some sort of planning document. He said the prime minister should face pressure to release some numbers soon.\n\"It's pretty hard to say we don't need a fiscal strategy right now. The way to engender confidence is to be transparent,\" he told\u00a0CBC\u00a0News. \"I don't think they\u00a0can get away getting much past early June without a fiscal statement ... there's no accountability without a plan. We need to see a\u00a0tally.\"\nHe said people need to know if the government intends to continue programs like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the wage subsidy, and, if so, for how long.\n\"Just tell people \u2014 this is the situation, this is how we're going to respond. We need a strategy.\u00a0We need to tell people what to expect over the next few months,\" he said.\nSuch information is also important for would-be bondholders, Page said, who will be extending credit to a money-hungry government.\nSahir Khan, Page's former deputy PBO, said the government is probably reluctant to release numbers now because opponents could pounce\u00a0if the fiscal situation rapidly deteriorates.\nBut if health officials are expected to release modelling for COVID-19 infections and deaths, he said,\u00a0federal finance officials should do the same with deficit\u00a0spending and debt.\nAs spending continues unabated, former prime minister Stephen Harper voiced concerns Tuesday with the debtload much of the Western world has taken on in recent weeks in response to\u00a0this crisis.\nHarper, an economist by training, said balance sheets have become an \"unholy mess\" and some states are likely to face sovereign debt crises in the months ahead.\n\"If they fail to practice mild austerity proactively, a brutal kind will be thrust on them,\" Harper said in an op-ed published in the U.S.-based Wall Street Journal.\nHarper said \"leftists\" are trying to capitalize on this crisis to permanently expand the size of government by pushing ideas like a \"guaranteed minimum income.\"\n\"A new era of big government in the economy is unlikely, undesirable and far from inevitable,\" Harper said.\n\"When focus shifts from the pandemic to the economy, it will need to shift from a lot more government action to a lot less.\"\nBut Page, who was appointed by Harper, said now isn't the time to talk about austerity.\nHe said Canada is still in a strong fiscal position compared to\u00a0other industrialized nations,\u00a0with roughly half the average\u00a0debt-to-GDP ratios of other advanced economies.\n\"We're nowhere near code red,\" Page said, when asked if belt-tightening is needed now.\n\"If\u00a0you phoned someone from Washington, D.C. and told them Canada is hitting $1 trillion they'd say, 'Boy we wish we had your numbers,'\" Page said, citing the country's projected debtload.\nPage said that,\u00a0rather than austerity, the government should start talking about a stimulus package \u2014 measures beyond direct payments to Canadians. \"We have to take care of our citizens or else we'd be in a Great Depression-mode.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2676409153", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content":

relatives to the sixth degree and kin to the fourth.\nIn plain language?\u00a0They can now visit their cousins' children, their spouse's cousins and anyone in between.\nWithin minutes of the new rules being released, social media mockery poured forth, with suggestions for naming them\u00a0including spoofs of popular movie titles such as\u00a0\"Call me by your last name\"; \"The last name of the\u00a0rose\"; and \"Children of a lesser uncle.\"\nBut it was the ambiguous third category the government listed \u2014\u00a0affetti stabili,\u00a0\"stable affections,\"\u00a0a vague and strangely formal term that\u00a0could refer to a romantic relationship \u2014\u00a0that triggered the most ferocious mockery. Fake versions of the self-certifications Italians are still obliged to carry with them appeared online, jokingly listing \"stable affection\" options such as \"someone who dumped me but who I'm still hoping to hook up with\"\u00a0and \"someone whose best friend told me might be interested in me.\"\nIf there is one common thread that has run through Italy's tragic experience with coronavirus\u00a0\u2014 the worst in Europe with more than 210,000 recorded infections and almost 30,000 recorded deaths \u2014\u00a0it has been a healthy dose of irony to help people here cope.\nItalians are going to need it moving forward.\nThe country is in a deep recession, with a 4.7 per cent\u00a0drop in its GDP in the first quarter of this year, greater than in the financial crisis that put the whole eurozone\u00a0on the precipice of collapse a decade ago. The second quarter is expected to be worse, with warnings that if COVID-19 infections persist, Italy's economy could shrink by more than 10 per cent.\nSome five million workers in the construction and manufacturing sectors \u2014\u00a0essential to Italy's exports economy \u2014\u00a0will be back on the job Monday. But the equally important tourism sector still faces months of hardship.\n\"Unlike other sectors, we were never obliged to close,\" says Stefania Stea, vice-president of Italy's National Hoteliers Association and a Venice hotel owner. \"But we're empty. And before we welcome guests again, we have to figure out a whole range of safety protocols.\"\nShe says if things go well in the second half of the year, her hotel will bring in 20 per cent of its usual revenue. Like 90 per cent of hotel workers throughout Italy, the government is now paying a minimum wage to her employees\u00a0as they wait to return to work.\u00a0But, says Stea, even when tourists eventually do return, they will be almost exclusively Italians\u00a0\u2014\u00a0at least for the first months \u2014 given restrictions on air travel and quarantine requirements.\nRoberta, 53, a beautician who works south of Rome who did not want her last name used, says as painful as the lockdown has been for her family,\u00a0it was the only responsible decision the government could make given the number of deaths.\nStill, she says after two months of bringing in no money, she may see clients privately before the work ban on her category of business,\u00a0which includes hairdressers and barbers,\u00a0lifts on June 1.\n\"We're in deep financial trouble,\" she says. \"My husband works at a pharmacy and doesn't earn much, we have two children and still have to pay our mortgage and bills. If I have to be sincere, our situation is bad.\"\nHer only criticism of how Italy has handled the crisis is what she calls the inadequate financial help for small businesses and individuals, a limited monthly payment of\u00a0about $950. It was complicated to access and\u00a0has taken weeks to arrive.\nEven promised loans have provoked frustration among many Italians.\nUnlike Canada, where the government has issued interest-free loans to small businesses, it's Italy's banks that will decide which small businesses will get the loans\u00a0(with a ceiling of about $40,000 fully guaranteed by the government) and what the interest rate will be.\n\"It's a system that is not going to produce any good results for the Italian economy,\" says Rome tax consultant Giovanni Barlassina.\u00a0\"Apart from the fact that it won't be easy to get the money from the banks, small businesses don't want loans.\u00a0They need money\u00a0that they won't have to pay back. Gifts. And that's because many simply won't be in a position to repay loans.\"\nItaly itself, with a debt of over 130 per cent of GDP and rising fast, is pushing for gifts\u00a0from the European Union.\nThis month, European finance ministers will meet again to try to agree on a comprehensive rescue package that will benefit hard-hit countries like\u00a0Italy the most. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is pushing for much of the financial help to come in the form of pooled debt and grants, something most observers say is unlikely.\nIn the meantime, high-density cities are coming up with ways to fast-track the revitalization of urban life. Rome has promised 150 kilometres of new bike lanes, though the few it has now are poorly maintained.\nMilan has\u00a0in recent years been on the vanguard of urban planning and green architecture,\u00a0rolling\u00a0out a program to facilitate remote working;\u00a0transforming streets into bike lanes; widening sidewalks to encourage cycling and walking to work; and\u00a0setting up tables in public squares and parking spots\u00a0to help restaurants and caf\u00e9s stay in business.\nPlexiglas\u00a0separations between workers and the public\u00a0may be required for\u00a0food establishments, something renowned architect Stefano Boeri urges caution around.\n\"In some cases, Plexiglas barriers\u00a0will clearly be needed, above all to protect front-line workers dealing with the public,\" says Boeri, who notes that creative ways to extend retail space outdoors are the best solution. \"But an exaggeration of walls, barriers and obstructions would be a disaster. We need above all to focus on externalizing commerce.\"\nBut Pierfrancesco Maran, Milan's deputy mayor, says his biggest concern is increased car traffic. With physical distancing in place, the Milan subway, once the linchpin to its sustainability plan, can only accommodate a third of its capacity.\nHe worries people will opt for cars, and smog will once again descend on Milan.\n\"Some people will say the economy is so important that we should abandon\u00a0ideas of energy efficiency and sustainability. I disagree,\" says Maran. \"Now we have the two ways in front of us. We not only have to get over coronavirus, but we have to do it in the most sustainable way possible.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/michael-s-essay-on-mind-boggling-wealth-1.5479858", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "How bad will Canada's COVID-19 recession be?", "description": "2 million jobs could be at stake, and the economy could shrink by more than it did in 2009", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/covid-19-recession-economy-analysis-1.5510596", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5496168.1587913387!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/aptopix-financial-markets-wall-street.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 27, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-27T13:39:52.704Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The black swan has landed.\u00a0\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic is well underway worldwide, but it wasn't until this month that Canadians started coming to grips with the economic pain it can bring, in addition to its heavy human toll.\nEconomists are struggling to come up with best guesses as to what might be coming. There's still a lot that they \u2014 and we \u2014 don't know. But the picture they're painting for Canada's financial future\u00a0is already bleak.\nAt a minimum, the Conference Board of Canada is assuming that most industries across the country will be essentially shut down for at least six weeks.\nIf they take an optimistic view and assume that's enough to contain the outbreak, even that short term pain will make a major dent in the country's total output, a metric known as the Gross Domestic\u00a0Product, or GDP.\nShould this relatively mild scenario come to pass, Canada's economy would eke out a tiny 0.3 per cent growth for 2020\u00a0as a whole as things ramp up in the latter half of the year. That's far from booming \u2014\u00a0Canada's\u00a0economy grew by 1.6 per cent last year, for example \u2014\u00a0but it's\u00a0preferable to other alternatives.\nUnder a more pessimistic scenario, the board sees lockdowns and quarantines stretching for up to six months, until August.\u00a0If that happens, the GDP hit would be massive \u2014 an annualized contraction rate of 9.6 per cent in the second quarter, which is worse than what we saw in the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. The economy shrank at an annual pace of 8.7 per cent at its worst stage, in early 2009 before rebounding starting in the spring.\n\"Brace yourself for some horrible data in the near-term, as there's little doubt that the second quarter will produce some painful and likely historic figures on ... economic contraction,\"\u00a0the economics team at TD Bank said in a note to investors.\nEconomists tend to focus on GDP in their modelling, but when you ask Canadian workers how they think the economy is doing, they tend to focus on whether they have jobs that pay the bills.\nIt already looks like the recession caused by COVID-19 will be one for the record books when it comes to joblessness.\nIn any given week, Canada gets about 45,000 claims for jobless benefits, according to the economics team at TD Bank.\nBut the numbers for\u00a0March 16-22 came in at more than 20 times that, with 927,000 Canadians tossed out of work in a single week.\nDavid MacDonald, an economist with Ottawa think-tank the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said those numbers are likely just the start.\n\"The situation is still moving rapidly: people who may have been employed and surveyed on Monday could easily have been laid off by Wednesday,\" he said. \"It's likely not until the April data is collected and released at the start of May that we will see the full picture of what happened in the second half of March.\"\nBy the time all is said and done, MacDonald thinks roughly two\u00a0million Canadians will at least temporarily lose their jobs in the current panic. That would cause the jobless rate to spike to more than 13 per cent.\nTD's forecast is only slightly more positive, predicting the rate to rise to nearly 12 per cent before hopefully levelling off to about half that by the end of the year.\u00a0\nBut that's only if the unprecedented steps being taken now do any good.\n\"If fiscal and monetary policies prove successful, and social distancing tactics gradually ease, the unemployment rate should level off after one to two months and quite possibly fall just as fast if workers are called back to work,\" the bank said.\nThe cure for the disease may be widespread shutdowns and social distancing efforts, but that underlines a fundamental paradox of the disease: the cure for the virus is precisely what makes the economy even sicker.\nAt least Canada's jobless rate was close to a record low before all this started.\nEven officials in Ottawa are willing to admit they're expecting a record-setting flood of job losses to hit home, and soon.\n\"We have enormous job losses right now,\" Finance Minister Bill Morneau told the Senate on Wednesday. \"We hope and expect it will be temporary.\"\nNot everyone is sure they will be.\nThe Canadian Federation Of Independent Business says its monthly measure of small business confidence fell to the lowest level in its\u00a032-year history\u00a0this week. Normally, a reading of 65 suggests an economy that's basically operating close to its full potential. But the CFIB's gauge fell\u00a0to a record low of 30.8 in March. That's lower than the 39 it hit in the depths of the 2009 financial crisis.\nRoughly 50 per cent of small businesses say they expect to lose workers this year. Only five per cent are planning to expand, according to the CFIB's\u00a0small business barometer.\n\"March 2020 has turned out to be a month like no other in Canada's economic history,\" said Ted Mallett, CFIB's chief economist.\nIf there's good news in these bleak numbers, it may be that the depth and breadth of the slowdown may be so sharp and sudden that it can't help but spur a big rebound.\nThis\u00a0recession is looking to be what economists described as \"V-shaped\" \u2014 meaning one that plunges quickly down and then quickly back up the other side. That differs from a \"U-shaped,\" which is slower and less dramatic in both directions, or even a dreaded \"L-shaped\" recession where the economy falls off a sudden cliff and never bounces back to its previous level.\nDoug Porter at Bank of Montreal notes that numerous countries have been through economic shocks as bad as the Canadian economy's current one. And they all emerged stronger on the other side.\nMexico's peso crisis of 1995, Russia's debt default in 1998 and South Korea the previous year during the Asian currency crisis all saw those economies shrink by more than 20 per cent.\u00a0\n\"In all three cases, activity bounced and forcefully within two quarters,\" Porter says.\n\"All different conditions, true,\" Porter said. \"But very rapid rebounds from hard stops have and can be done.\"\nIf a rebound is coming, it's likely to be fast. And stock market investors are tentatively showing signs of believing that could be the case.

Di Matteo says there are a\u00a0 few\u00a0ways to look at the debt. There's the gross debt, or the total debt, and that's everything the federal government owes. There is also the \"federal debt,\"\u00a0which is the difference\u00a0between the government's total liabilities and total financial and non-financial assets.\nThose non-financial assets,\u00a0however, include things like the Parliament Buildings, Di Matteo says,\u00a0which are unlikely to be sold off any time soon. So\u00a0the net debt takes\u00a0everything the federal government owes and subtracts\u00a0the government's financial assets.\nAccording\u00a0to the Department of Finance, the government posted a budgetary deficit of $14 billion\u00a0for the fiscal year that ended on March\u00a031, 2019. (Compare that, for example, with the U.S., which just recorded a deficit topping a trillion dollars.)\nThe federal debt (the difference between total liabilities and total assets) stood at $685.5\u00a0billion and Canada's net\u00a0debt is $768 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. debt is more than $22 trillion.\nThe debt-to-GDP ratio is the\u00a0the federal debt\u00a0compared to the gross domestic product of the country. In other words, taking the debt and dividing it by the GDP.\n\"There is no official number of what it should be. But generally, the higher it\u00a0is the larger the debt burden,\" Di Matteo said.\u00a0\nCurrently, Canada''s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at\u00a030.9. According to Liberal projections, it will shrink to\u00a030.2 per cent of GDP in 2023-2024.\nFor a comparison, before Chr\u00e9tien and Martin embarked on a series of cuts,\u00a0the federal debt-to-GDP\u00a0ratio was 66.8. It was at its highest in 1946 at 108.9 per cent\u00a0and at its lowest in 1913 at 11.3 per cent.\nThe reason the Liberals like to focus on this measurement is that Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio is the lowest among the G7 countries. For example, the figure for Japan is 237.5 per cent of GDP, 106.7 per cent for the United States and 99.2 per cent for France.\nBut the figure used by the Canadian government doesn't include the debt from all levels of government, like the provinces and municipalities. When those figures are included, the ratio, according to the International Monetary Fund,\u00a0jumps to 88 per cent.\nThat may be an easier way for people to understand our debt. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation calculated that every Canadian's share of the debt is a little over $18,000. (Compare that to the U.S., which, according to the U.S. Debt Clock, estimates debt per citizen at just under $69,000 US)\nThe Liberals promised in the 2015 election campaign that they would run temporary deficits, but by 2019, Canadians could expect a balanced budget.\u00a0\nThat never\u00a0happened\u00a0and isn't expected to happen in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0According to the campaign platform they released, their government, if re-elected, would\u00a0increase the deficit to $27.4 billion next year. It then projects deficits of more than $20 billion over the next three years. The party has not offered a firm timeline as to when it\u00a0would balance the books.\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said his government would take five years to balance the budget, but his party has not yet released its campaign platform, or any figures on the deficits they expect to run.\nNDP Leader\u00a0Jagmeet Singh\u00a0hasn't been clear on how his government would tackle the federal deficit. The party's platform isn't fully costed and doesn't include\u00a0deficit estimates\nBack in September, at a campaign event in Ottawa, Singh would\u00a0say only that his approach would be different from the one Justin Trudeau's Liberals have chosen and that his priority is helping Canadians now.\nHis party platform does say his government would\u00a0\"manage debt and deficits responsibly, borrowing when required to defend the services that Canadians and their families rely on, and moving to balance when prudent.\"\nGreen Leader Elizabeth May has committed to returning Canada to budgetary balance in five years. For the 2021-2022 fiscal year, a Green government would run up a\u00a0$22.7-billion deficit, cut that down to around $19 billion the next year and come up with a $400-million surplus by\u00a02023-24.\nPeople's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier\u00a0has vowed that his government would present a balanced budget within two years of taking office.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/681088579524", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada's economy shrinks 0.1% in October, StatsCan reports", "description": "UAW strike weighted down manufacturing sector which declined for the 4th time in 5 months", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gdp-october-2019-stats-canada-1.5406578", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5406602.1577110028!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/statcan-gdp-20191223.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 23, 2019 9:19 AM ET", "2019-12-23T18:11:51.424Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada's economy slightly shrank in October with real gross domestic product edging down 0.1 per cent, Statistics Canada reports.\u00a0\nThis marks the first decline in eight months.\u00a0\nEconomists had projected a flat GDP report for October compared with September, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nThe manufacturing sector was down\u00a0for the fourth time in five months, declining by 1.4 per cent with transportation equipment manufacturing contracting the most at 2.5 per cent.

The cash will top up the emergency fund to $872 million.\nThe province's budget is now forecasting three consecutive quarters of economic decline, which meets the technical definition for a recession.\u00a0\nWhile COVID-19 is the economic factor that is top of mind right now, the budget documents point to international trade uncertainty, climate change, extreme weather events and wildfires, and overspending on major Manitoba Hydro projects as other potential economic stumbling blocks.\nThe financial performance of Manitoba Hydro is \"one of the single largest risks to our ability to balance the budget,\" the province's documents say.\nAs major projects like the Keeyask Generating Station and the Manitoba-Minnesota Transmission Project come online, carrying costs \u2014 including costs associated with amortization and interest \u2014 will affect Manitoba Hydro's bottom line, the budget documents say. As well, Hydro's revenue could be affected by factors like weather and energy export prices.\nPoor market conditions for mining and petroleum \u2014 Manitoba's third-largest primary resource industry \u2014 have kept commodity prices low, the province notes.\nGlobal trade challenges, meanwhile, cut Manitoba's international trade growth to 2.1 per cent in 2019, compared to 11.6 per cent growth in 2018. A hard crop season last year and China's restriction on Canadian canola imports bit into canola and soybean sales.\nThe 2020 budget breaks down the potential positive or negative impacts of certain factors on the province's bottom line:\nIn addition to boosting the province's rainy-day fund, the Manitoba government will also spend more on its emergency expenditures fund, increasing the annual allotment to $100 million \u2014 an increase of $57 million over 2019.\nUnlike the rainy-day fund, emergency expenditures are set aside to prepare for challenges like flooding and forest fires \u2014 events that are anticipated each year, but vary in their severity.\nLast week, Finance Minister Scott Fielding touted the 2020-21 spending plan as \"the most emergency-ready budget in Manitoba history.\"\nThe commitment to top up the province's rainy-day fund will make good on the goal of keeping the fund's balance at five per cent of provincial GDP, Fielding told reporters, who agreed to keep budget information under embargo, on March 11, when the provincial spending plan was supposed to be released.\nThe fund is \"liquid cash,\" he said, set aside for unforeseen emergencies.\n\"I want Manitobans to know that our government is prepared and we have a plan to deal with any downturns in the economy,\" he said last week.\nBut a lot has changed in succeeding days. On March 12, the province identified its first cases of coronavirus. Temporary business closures and mass layoffs quickly followed, potentially upending the provincial economy.\nIn Thursday's addition to the budget, the government suggests Manitoba's diversified economic base can withstand the pandemic, even if the tourism, oil and gas production and supply chain-dependent sectors are negatively affected.\nBased on preliminary estimates, the first three quarters of 2020 will see economic declines \u2014 real GDP drops of 1.3 per cent in the first quarter, 0.7 per cent in the second and 0.1 per cent in the third.\nThe province expects a turnaround will begin by the second quarter due to federal initiatives to stimulate the economy. Growth is expected to strengthen in the second half of the year as pent-up demand from consumers and businesses lifts the economy.\u00a0\nThe government is now reluctant to make estimates about its bottom line for the upcoming fiscal year because of the rapidly changing situation around COVID-19.\u00a0\nIn a worst-case scenario, the province's preliminary estimates say revenue could drop $682 million more than originally projected, due to higher health-care costs and other hits to the economy.\nHowever, even before Manitoba's first coronavirus case was reported, the province's budget took a more conservative estimate of economic growth than usual, Fielding said. It includes $500 million in spending that could be saved if necessary by delaying planned projects, the finance minsiter said \u2014 although he didn't say which projects might be deferred.\nHe said there's reason for optimism thanks to Manitoba's diversified economy, which he said could insulate the province from economic downturns around the world.\n\"Manitoba has the most diverse economy in Canada, by far,\" Fielding said. \"What that means is in times of crisis, we are a little bit more insulated. We have a very resilient economy here.\"\n"}, {"author": "Alex Brockman", "title": "N.W.T. small businesses wonder if they'll survive 'tough year' ahead caused by COVID-19", "description": "Businesses, government doing what they can, but economic fallout from COVID-19 will be deeply felt", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/covid-19-business-impact-nwt-economy-1.5521490", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5521529.1585949273!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cambridge-bay-welding.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 06, 2020 4:00 AM CT", "2020-04-06T10:00:00.095Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Mike Riling wants to hear the hiss of his welding torch.

If the federal estimates are copied over to the territory, it could mean $500 million wiped away from the GDP.\u00a0\nThe economic effects of COVID-19 are being felt everywhere. Here's a look at the big picture across Canada\u00a0\n\"Customer bases are gone, no one's spending money, airlines, retail, auto, you name it,\" said Michael Miltenberger, who served as finance minister from 2007 to 2015 and now runs a consulting firm in Fort Smith, N.W.T.\u00a0\n\"I lived through 2008 as a finance minister, where the markets crumbled,\" he said. \"It was a major impact, but nothing like this.\"\u00a0\nThough small businesses are critical to the N.W.T. economy, its three diamond mines are its engine. Miltenberger estimates they produce at least $1 billion to the territory's GDP each year.\u00a0Though two, Diavik and Gahcho Kue continue to operate at full capacity,\u00a0Ekati has been shuttered since March 19.\nIf the others shut down too, either for health reasons during the pandemic or because of the economic downturn after the fact, the fallout could be catastrophic, Miltenberger said.\u00a0\nKatrina Nokleby knows this. She knows business owners can't make their payments and she knows what could happen if the diamond mines close. It's on her to do something about it.\u00a0\nSix months ago, she was an engineer. Now she's the territory's minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment, responsible for steering the N.W.T. economy through the pandemic.\u00a0\n\"This is the largest project I've ever managed,\" she said. \"I'm still in the same role of bringing people together, gathering the information where it needs to be and making strong, science-based, evidence-based decisions.\"\u00a0\nSince March, Nokleby has announced\u00a0two aid packages, representing up to $21.5 million in low-interest loans, deferred payments and waived fees. Now, her focus is shoring up the territory's supply chain, both between the Northwest Territories and southern Canada, and between its regional centres and small communities.\u00a0\nHere's more information on the N.W.T.'s low-interest business loan program\nShort term, she's also looking at mobilizing businesses that can help in the relief efforts: transporting medical supplies, personnel and resupply.\nLong term, the government is assessing projects that were already in the works and see if they're safe to go ahead, Nokleby said.\u00a0\n\"We have to think with our heads, remain calm, and put the measures in place where we can be as safe as possible,\" she said. \"I will never sacrifice health and safety for the economy.\"\u00a0\nThat's a wise statement. But business\u00a0owners like Riling and Hinchey can only wait so long before they'll have difficult decisions to make about whether they can go back to business when this is all over.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1699928131709", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "What a 'well-being budget' could look like in Canada", "description": "The government may focus on mental health, climate change and housing, says Jennifer Moss", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/well-being-budgeting-happiness-1.5455821", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5456001.1581096757!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fiscal-update-20191209.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 09, 2020 7:00 AM ET", "2020-02-09T12:00:00.761Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The federal government is\u00a0looking at a new way to measure economic success ahead of their spring budget.\nMinister of Middle Class Prosperity,\u00a0Mona Fortier, has been asked to look at so-called \"quality of life measurements.\" Those measurements are supposed to translate into the government's decision making and budgeting.\nIt's something other countries are already doing. Last year, New Zealand unveiled its \"well-being budget\" with billions of dollars for some of the country's most vulnerable.\u00a0\nBut what exactly does it mean \u2014 to budget for well-being? CBC Happiness and Well-being columnist Jennifer Moss, who sits on the UN Global Council for Happiness, explains to CBC Kitchener-Waterloo's The Morning Edition.\u00a0\nCraig Norris: Why incorporate well-being into federal budgets?\nJennifer Moss:\u00a0This has actually been a long time in the making. Some of the most respected economists in the world believe that GDP should have been obsolete a long time ago. We really need to see countries expand their current way of showing economic success.\nIt's really just been this main tool for measuring a country's economy, but it's morphed into this planning tool and that provides really a risk for us defining our country's success and it just makes us look through a very narrow lens.\nCN: So I assume you agree with the economists that the GDP is too narrow a way to define economic success. Why is that?\nJM:\u00a0Even the man behind the concept said that it should not be used as a welfare measure and if used as a planning tool, it just makes really the wrong assumptions. We have a pretty varied socioeconomic spectrum in our country. Take for example \u2014 2008, the big crash. Roughly 91 per cent of those gains went back to the top one\u00a0per cent, but GDP would say we have a robust economy and so that's really not accurate.\nAnd then there is an example of how the idea of GDP actually isn't understanding our modern economy. They didn't understand that Internet would be free. So it's hard to map that. And you have families that would have spent money on going to the movies or going out for dinner and now they're binge watching Netflix or\u00a0Prime or Disney Plus or whatever. And so GDP would say they're not better off. But that's arguable. So we're really you know missing a lot of that grey area data.\nCN: So is using GNH or the Gross National Happiness \u2014 is that a better way to measure this?\nJM:\u00a0The\u00a0GNH \u2014 probably why it's been hard for a lot of countries to adopt it is that idea of measuring happiness is so nebulous. But it was developed about 20 years ago by Bhutan, it tracks 300 items. The Global Happiness Council has started to modify that since 2012 and they created this happiness index and then they mapped it over the Gallup World Poll. And the thing with the Gallup World Poll is it tracks\u00a0and continually surveys citizens in 160 countries. It actually measures 98 per cent of the global population and it looks at stuff the GDP is looking at too.\nSo you merge those two things and then what happens is that you could analyze how clean drinking water can both be socially beneficial as well as financially beneficial. And you're looking at the value of cultural inclusion and trust in government. Loneliness epidemic \u2014 it costs a lot of money. But what if we could improve loneliness.\u00a0I mean we're looking at some of these things that are social impacts, but they have very expensive costs if we don't handle them.\nCN: What other countries might Canada would look at to make this a reality?\nJM:\u00a0Scotland and Iceland have been doing a pretty big effort. Brexit has slowed down their budgeting, now that should probably change. But what they've done is create this well-being economy government initiative and so the three prime ministers \u2014 all three women I should add \u2014 what they've done is they've created this framework. And so they're looking at creating this sort of objective. And Canada will be looking toward them as this framework to create more of an economic policy that shaped around collective well-being, to show that happy and healthy can also equal wealthy. One doesn't have to come at the expense of the other.\nCN: So if Canada were to develop a well-being budget, what do you think they would focus on?\nJM:\u00a0Well, I think they'll follow similarly to what New Zealand is\u00a0looking at because there are similar issues. And often these issues for everyone are the most expensive band aids. The most expensive issues are the ones that we want to tackle first because we can basically show that there's\u00a0a quantified reason for it.\nWe'll look at mental health and solving for that as much as we can. Obviously housing is a big one in Canada and solving for\u00a0not just homelessness but adequate housing. And\u00a0we'll also look at making sure that there is some sort of way of looking at climate change. Obviously it's important to be able to manage prosperity in climate change and also just you know the other factors that play into that.\nCN: So let's say the government does do these things. How then did they measure whether or not they're successful?\nJM:\u00a0The thing is that they're already doing a lot of this prevention stuff now. But it's not inside of that budget, it's sort of buried in different places. And so what that means is\u00a0Canadians can't actually see how that's being impacted. So taking it into a well-being budget basically says \"OK, we're going to tackle these issues.\"\nLet's look at New Zealand for example, their domestic violence issue \u2014 it's a big one. They actually have police called every four minutes to someone's home. I mean that's huge. It's costing them $4-billion to $7-billion a year, unchanged it could cost $80-billion in the next 10 years. So if we look at that they're going to put $500-million dollars annually in that year and they're going to say how much are we getting back from that. And so right away, it's an upstream investment which is scary for a lot of politicians. But we show it over time that it does actually make an impact.\nCN: So in essence is that what this is? It's just placing the budget investment further upstream?\nJM:\u00a0Yeah, that's exactly what it is. So you know it's scary, like I said.I mean New Zealand right now they had a 3.1 per cent prediction of their GDP,\u00a0it's now 2.1 per cent. And so obviously they're going to blame it on a well-being budget when there's a lot of factors.

A change.org petition in support of the letter garnered 21,000 signatures within the first week.\nAnother campaign spearheaded by senators called Let Our Voices be Heard\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a wry reference to the fact that the only female presence in the daily COVID-19-update news\u00a0conference here\u00a0is the sign language interpreter.\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte responded by saying advisory commissions should bear in mind gender representation, though has taken no action towards that end.\nPoli and others said\u00a0they do not want fairer representation delivered in the form of what are known in Italy as \"pink quotas,\" where a certain percentage of spots on government and company\u00a0boards and commissions are reserved for women.\n\"We are allergic to that. We think that it should not be necessary. We don't want to be considered a kind of panda that needs to be preserved,\" she said.\nInstead, the group wants the criteria for which experts are recruited to task forces made public beforehand, so people can judge the selections, and to require all public task forces and commissions to include both genders.\nAlessandra Casano, 37, a freelance consultant with the United Nations in Rome and mother of two small children, said\u00a0she's also frustrated with the lack of government attention to working mothers in Italy, which has one of the lowest rates in Europe with just over half of women in the paid workforce.\nWhile she and her husband share child care, she said\u00a0she still\u00a0bears the brunt of it.\n\"They rely on their mums first and then their dad,\" said\u00a0Casano. She said\u00a0there is still strong cultural pressure in Italy for mothers to do everything.\n\"This is why we have more pressure at home. I have my husband asking for something, then the kids, 'mamma!' Then my supervisor calling.\"\nWATCH | \u00a0How to talk to your kids about the coronavirus:\u00a0\nAlmost five million workers returned to their jobs on May 4, as part of the first step in Italy's lockdown easing, but three-quarters of them were men in the construction and manufacturing sectors.\nThe government is promoting remote working, an option more available to female workers. But at the same time, it's keeping schools closed until September with the only support thus far a babysitting voucher worth about $900. That is set to rise to $1,800, though not everyone qualifies and so far, only 40,000 Italian families have applied.\nThe implicit government expectation, said\u00a0many women, is that grandmothers will step in to help out, reflecting an antiquated grasp on Italian reality.\n\"My parents are still young and have a million interests \u2026 Finally, they have some time for themselves, and now they have to take care of\u00a0their grandchildren? No,\" she said. \"I wouldn't ask them.\"\nCasano's biggest concern is that when schools finally reopen, the government will introduce a staggered day to reduce the density of students, something she said\u00a0is a co-ordination nightmare for parents with more than one child.\nEconomist Azzurra Rinaldi, a professor at University of Rome Unitelma Sapienza and mother of three young children, shares that concern.\nAnd her biggest concern with the recession now descending upon Italy is that the most precarious workers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0those in part-time jobs, with temporary contracts and who bear the brunt of child care \u2014\u00a0are women.\n\"I am deeply worried because many of these women are going to lose their jobs, and they're not going to get them back,\" if the government does not make keeping women in the workforce an explicit priority in its plan, said\u00a0Rinaldi.\nShe said\u00a0such a scenario would not only undermine the small\u00a0but hard won gains Italian women have made in recent years, but it would have disastrous consequences for Italy's GDP\u00a0and the economic future of the country.\n\"In imagining\u00a0the future of the country, if you're not interested in how your policy is going to diversely affect men and women, this is what you get.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Edmonton economy to improve only slightly in 2020, city's chief economist says", "description": "Capital city can expect \u2018very modest\u2019 growth, John Rose says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-economy-alberta-outlook-1.5412999", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5096383.1555097286!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/edmonton-downtown-skyline-night-drone-spring-2019.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 02, 2020 12:00 PM MT", "2020-01-02T19:00:00.511Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "After a year marked by stagnant growth and weak job numbers, Edmonton will see \"sluggish\" growth in 2020, says the city's chief economist.\n\"We're coming off a very difficult year in 2019 and we've seen significant weakness in several key areas,\" John Rose said in an interview Thursday with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM.\n\"I think people really have to manage their expectations. Growth rates are going to be very, very modest.\"\u00a0\nEdmonton's economy is comparatively diverse, said Rose. Less reliant on the energy sector than other Alberta cities, the provincial capital has been surprisingly resilient.\u00a0However, the prolonged slowdown is starting to bear down on Edmonton businesses, he said.\nGrowth in Edmonton's real gross domestic product (GDP) hovered around 0.5 per cent in 2019, the lowest it's been since 2015, soon after\u00a0oil prices started to plunge.\nThere will be some growth in the coming year, Rose said. But it will be slight and lopsided, favouring sectors less intertwined with the energy sector.\nHe expects Edmonton's GDP will increase by about 1.4 per cent in 2020 and 2.5\u00a0per cent in 2021.\nThe local economy is in recovery mode and the labour market continues to tighten, shaking consumer confidence and muting investment.\nIn November, as Alberta lost 18,000 jobs, the unemployment rate in Edmonton climbed to 7.7 per cent. Rose estimates 11,000 positions were lost in both full-time and part-time work in Edmonton during the year.\n\"What we'll see is a very modest acceleration in growth,\" he said. \"People will feel it but it will be very modest. We're talking about 1.3 or 1.5 per cent growth in 2020.\n\"Historically, that's rather low, but nonetheless it will be much better than 2019 where we were stuck at 0.5 during a very, very weak year.\"\nOil prices are likely to remain volatile and activity in the energy sector will be muted, undercutting growth in manufacturing, construction, logistics and professional services.\n\"We're not going to see a really robust consumer side of the economy. We're not going to see a very robust residential construction sector,\" Rose said.\u00a0\n\"It's going to be sluggish, unfortunately.\"\nThe latest report from ATB Financial, released in December, provides similarly stunted projections for the Alberta economy.\nAccording to ATB, provincial GDP growth in 2019 was 0.4 per cent \u2014 well below the 20-year average of 2.8 per cent.\nATB anticipates a slightly better 2020, with growth of 0.9 per cent leading to a better 2021, with GDP forecast to grow by 2.1 per cent.\nThe energy sector is stuck in \"slow mode,\" Rose said.\n\"I've been at this now 10 years and I've been waiting for the Trans Mountain Pipeline [expansion] and Line 3 and the Keystone XL to hit and none of that has happened,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"When I see it, I'll believe it. Right now, I'm not making any assumption about a sustained expansion on the energy side of the Alberta economy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We'll do reasonably well in Edmonton but there will be no boom.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "How the coronavirus has thrown interest rate plans out the window", "description": "40 banks around the world have already cut interest rates \u2014 and Canada could be next", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-rate-cuts-1.5478258", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5479882.1582910916!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/poloz-wilkins-smile.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 29, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-01T15:09:02.881Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Central bankers are waking up to dramatically overhauled expectations about interest rates, as the coronavirus that started in China and is now creeping around the world rewrites\u00a0their plans as quickly as the virus spreads.\nInvestors are betting that there's better than a two in three\u00a0chance of a rate cut from the Bank of Canada as soon as next Wednesday, when Canada's central bank is poised to reveal its next decision on interest rates. Not everyone believes it's a sure thing, but the probability goes up as the illness spreads.\nAt the start of the year, the odds of Canada cutting its rate\u00a0at the March meeting were barely one in 20. Even a\u00a0week ago, the odds of a cut were barely\u00a0one in six. But that was before the virus that causes COVID-19 started its spread around the world, infecting markets everywhere with something almost as dangerous as the pathogen itself: fear.\nBoth Canadian and U.S. stock markets are in correction territory, meaning declines of more than 10 per cent. Supply chains at technology companies like Apple\u00a0have been disrupted as Chinese factories shut down, making it impossible for manufacturers to get finished products to market.\u00a0\nAirlines have seen their ticket sales plunge\u00a0as consumers decide to stay home. Businesses around the world are cancelling conferences and other events that require people to meet face to face. And if coronavirus\u00a0becomes widespread here, many businesses will struggle with shortages of workers and supplies.\nAll things being equal, central banks raise interest rates when they want to cool down overheated economies. They cut when they want to stimulate an economy that needs a little warming up.\nFaced with the potential of a sickly economy because of coronavirus, central banks around the world are expected to try to flood the system with cheap\u00a0money in the hope that it's the shot in the arm the economy needs to get better.\u00a0\nChina, Brazil, Russia, the EU, Indonesia, India and Mexico have all cut in recent months.\nTypically in times of uncertainty, investors flock to the relative safety of the U.S. economy. But\u00a0the world's largest economy also is going to be dealing with the spread of coronavirus. And despite lowering rates three times in the past year, it's\u00a0not immune to the\u00a0trend toward lower rates.\u00a0\nTraders are pricing in effectively a 100\u00a0per cent chance of a U.S rate cut next month, and there's a 50/50 chance of up to two more cuts after that.\u00a0\nThose odds are three times\u00a0as high as they were as recently as Wednesday, before U.S. President Donald Trump appointed vice-president Mike Pence to head public health efforts to contain the virus' spread.\nThe U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve,\u00a0has been signalling for months that it thinks the\u00a0underlying numbers in the U.S. economy are strong, and telling investors not to expect any more rate cuts unless something drastic happens.\nReaction to the coronavirus suggests something certainly has. Even if the Fed is inclined to sit tight, it is under pressure to do something for the sake of looking like it is doing something.\n\"The Fed's desire to be data-dependent may capitulate to market sentiment,\" as Jon Hill, an interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets put it.\nThat goes for Canada, too. While most economists who study trends at the Bank of Canada expect the bank to stand pat next week, almost half of them think the bank should cut, according to a survey by rate comparison site Finder.com.\nBrett House at Scotiabank is among them. \"Our call\u00a0is for two cuts in 2020, which we've been saying since August of last year,\" he said in an interview. That call was based on underlying weaknesses in the economy, something that was borne out by Friday's GDP release that showed economic growth slowed to its slowest annual pace in almost four years at the end of 2019.\n\"And that was\u00a0all before the coronavirus,\" he said.\nSince that call, more than 40 major central banks around the world have moved to cut rates, he notes. \"If anything Canada has\u00a0been one of the tardiest to the [rate cut] party.\"\nOthers aren't sure the coronavirus will be enough to compel the bank to take action \u2014 yet. \"Although we think a certain degree of easing is warranted, two cuts priced by the end of 2020 seems somewhat unrealistic,\" CIBC's economics team said in a note this week.\u00a0\nThe bank thinks a cut is coming, but possibly not until the next meeting in\u00a0April.\n\"We are reluctant to pencil-in an additional cut as we don't know how long the associated uncertainty will last,\" CIBC said.\nSherry Cooper, chief economist with Dominion Lending Centres, says the panic in the stock market right now shows the central bank is under pressure to do something, even if it's just for the sake of doing something.\n\"None of this is good for psychology or the economy,\" she said.  \"The Bank of Canada meets next Wednesday, and clearly, their press release will address these issues. It's unlikely the bank will cut rates in response on March 4, but if the economic disruption continues, rate cuts could be coming by mid-year.\"\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Coronavirus could be the global shock that economists have feared: Don Pittis", "description": "But avoiding panic over the disease's economic impact will prevent a worse result", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-economy-canada-1.5458155", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5458662.1581367576!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/switzerland-china-outbreak.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 11, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-02-26T15:56:21.813Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "For those\u00a0who worry about the world's wealth and wellbeing, the term \"economic shock\" has a special meaning.\nAs defined by people like the Bank of Canada's governor Stephen Poloz, while economies are always in a state of flux, occasionally an outside force, usually\u00a0unforeseeable, or at least unexpected, will sweep in and put everything awry.\nIt seems increasingly certain that the outbreak of coronavirus\u00a0spreading from Wuhan, China, is such an unanticipated disturbance to the global, the North American and Canadian economies. And yesterday Canada's finance minister Bill Morneau\u00a0said Canada would inevitably be affected.\nAs the death toll\u00a0\u2014 mostly in China\u00a0\u2014 passes 1,000, the business press has begun to tally the effects on the country's gross domestic product and estimate what impact that will have on the wider global economy.\nThere is so much unknown about the virus and its potential that the numbers can only be educated guesses, but experts interviewed by credible sources such as the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal offer estimates that China's GDP growth will fall by two or more percentage points. That would\u00a0represent a decline in growth of more than one-third.\nMany of those calculations are based on extrapolating from the economic impact of SARS, which killed nearly 800 people during its eight-month run 17 years ago. The fact that the new, related\u00a0virus has killed more people in only three months is only one of the many differences.\nFor one thing, the Chinese economy is much bigger than it was in 2002 when the SARS outbreak began. The\u00a0\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0estimates that in 2020 that economy\u00a0represents nearly 17 percent of global activity compared to around four\u00a0per cent in the era of SARS. Thus the global\u00a0coronavirus effect will be much larger.\nIn an integrated global economy operating on the strategy of just-in-time\u00a0delivery, shortages of key parts caused by the shutdown of Chinese factories\u00a0have already stopped industrial production in the automotive and technology manufacturing sectors.\nAs the world discovered during the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, finding replacement parts when specialized factories go down can be impossible in the short term.\nTourism has already taken a hit as big-spending Chinese tourists stay home\u00a0and, as Morneau said yesterday in Calgary,\u00a0the outbreak\u00a0has already hit the Canadian oil business. And such spreading effects are insidious.\u00a0From Nova Scotia there are reports that lobster prices are down 20 per cent due to the collapse of the crucial Chinese market.\nThe U.S. economy that Canada depends upon is also feeling the effects in its currency as its dollar surges, making its products more expensive in overseas markets. The virus has pushed down the price of coffee and mortgages.\nIn the past the Bank of Canada governor has warned that economies can be like a cracked tree waiting for a shock to blow it down.\n\"Macroeconomic shocks happen all the time and economies adjust to them,\" Poloz once said in a briefing describing the hazards of an uncertain world. But a shock that is big enough or sudden enough\u00a0can reveal hidden cracks in an economy.\n\"If significant vulnerabilities are present, the effects of those shocks on the economy and the financial system can be magnified,\" said Poloz.\nAnd that is the danger here. The Canadian oil business, already suffering, may be shocked into a new perilous state as cheaper producers hog a bigger share of shrinking world demand.\nA global economy already close to recession\u00a0may be pushed over the line.\nPlaces like Europe, already glutted with monetary stimulus, may demand more with uncertain results. Already China has delayed\u00a0attempts to get borrowing under control, cutting rates to boost the sickened economy.\nAnd the shock may not be over. As we learn more about the new coronavirus, we are learning how much we don't know.\u00a0\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, warned that cases in France and the United Kingdom with no known contact history with\u00a0existing outbreaks may show our understanding of transmission is flawed.\n\"The detection of this small number of cases may be the spark that begins a bigger fire,\" he said.\nThere are worries about what will happen if that bigger fire begins to break out in places that do not have Canadian-style medical facilities such as North Korea that shares a large border with China, or places in Africa where Chinese business travellers continued to visit after the outbreak but before China threw up its cordon sanitaire.\nCertainly the fact that Wuhan authorities tried to suppress\u00a0Li Wenliang, the doctor who tried to warn authorities of the dangers before dying himself of the virus, does not reassure us that China has been as forthright as it claims. The age of some high-profile victims, including Li who was 35, does not support what we have been told so far.\nAs well as warning of the coronavirus\u00a0impact on Canada's economy yesterday, Morneau hinted that there may be more news to come and that we must be \"prepared for any eventualities.\"\nPart of those preparations must be to keep money flowing to\u00a0Canada's medical system that learned so much during the SARS\u00a0outbreak, including funding Canadian research, which will be money well spent whether or not this virus spreads in Canada.\u00a0\n\"Globally, volatility remains a key risk and obviously that has been illustrated vividly over the last couple of months,\" Morneau told the Calgary gathering of the Economic Club of Canada.\nAnd whether he was referring to the coronavirus, its impact on the global economy or the Alberta oil industry, the finance minister said that Canada must have the economic resiliency to face the unexpected.\n\"Challenges,\" he said, \"that we many not be able to see right now.\"\nFollow Don\u00a0on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Statistics are great unless they measure the wrong things: Don Pittis", "description": "Statistics Canada looks to Big Data to size up Canadians, but are the numbers biased?", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/statistics-canada-bias-1.5429156", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5431432.1579293068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-canada-trade-companies.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 20, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-01-20T09:00:32.906Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "If prices are rising by\u00a0about two\u00a0per cent, as\u00a0inflation\u00a0data is likely to show this week, why did one of my newspaper subscriptions just go up by 17\u00a0per cent?\nAnd if wages are rising at about four per cent, as recent jobs data has shown, why are some provincial governments insisting that\u00a0wage increases be held below one per cent?\nAs\u00a0house prices go through the roof, the fact that the price of the biggest purchase Canadians make in their lives is not included in our inflation statistics makes it easy to see why many young people have expressed doubts about the accuracy of those figures.\nIt is a struggle that Statistics Canada faces every day as it tries to sketch out with numbers an authentic\u00a0picture of the reality Canadians experience. But Oxford fellow and bestselling author of Age of Discovery\u00a0Chris Kutarna says the task is far more complicated than many statisticians like to admit.\nKutarna\u00a0worries that Statistics Canada's\u00a0plan\u00a0to plunge into the ocean\u00a0of \"Big Data\" so\u00a0beloved of\u00a0retailers and credit card companies \u2014 described last week by chief statistician Anil Arora\u00a0\u2014\u00a0will inevitably create bias in the results simply because we are measuring the wrong things.\u00a0\n\"One of the\u00a0terrifying and most fundamental sources of risk is that we only consider what we're now measuring as real,\" said Kutarna, on the phone from London, England.\nFor example, long-standing data sets built on debt, spending, prices and gross domestic product simply close the door on\u00a0values such as family, respect, happiness and species\u00a0extinction.\n\"There is far more that is real and not being measured than there is that is real and we are measuring it,\" said Kutarna.\nOne practical example from his book is the failure of modern statistics to measure the value of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia which, despite providing value to billions, adds less to GDP figures than the old Encyclopedia Britannica which reached far fewer people.\nIn a recent speech, Stephen Poloz, governor of the Bank of Canada, described an economy changing so fast that our statistical models fail to grasp it.\nPoloz paraphrased the Solow Paradox, the observation by economist Robert Solow that\u00a0computers had led to an increase in productivity everywhere but in the statistics. Poloz suggested GDP is\u00a0being understated by as much as two\u00a0per cent.\nOne example he offered was the\u00a0way so many companies are distributing computer services to the cloud, turning whole computer divisions into a budget line item.\n\"How does StatCan deal with that?\" asked Poloz.\nLast week,\u00a0Arora\u00a0boasted to a gathering of the Empire Club that Statistics Canada was respected everywhere as a global leader, but he acknowledges\u00a0it is constantly struggling to keep up with changing technology and the shifting understanding of\u00a0how the world works.\n\"Look, that's what statistics is, right? To take what are evolving concepts, nebulous concepts, things that haven't even taken a lot of shape and then quickly try to turn them into numerics,\" said Arora in an interview.\nThe statistics chief calls it a \"team sport\" where governments and individuals need to decide which of the millions and millions of things that could possibly be measured should\u00a0be addressed by the some 5,000 employees at Statistics Canada. Their job, he says, is to bring scientific rigour to the process, so that the numbers are as accurate as possible.\n\"This is always going to be a journey,\" said Arora, adding\u00a0that finding and incorporating into our figures\u00a0what have so far been labelled intangibles may be a never-ending task.\u00a0\nPart of that journey that those employees are now undertaking is the attempt to mine the immense bodies of information embedded in Big Data, those\u00a0traces of activity we leave behind when we do almost anything on the internet\u00a0from buying to searching. Not only are they readily available for quick analysis but they reduce the employee hours required in traditional surveys.\u00a0\n\"Alternate sources of data are increasing exponentially and we\u00a0have the technologies and the mechanisms to convert them to public good with high quality statistics,\" said Arora\u00a0in his speech.\nWhen it comes to the inadequacies of GDP, a big part of the problem has less to do with Statistics Canada than how we continue to use familiar indicators that may be out of date.\nArora says the University of Waterloo's Canadian Index of Wellbeing\u00a0includes 200 indicators \u2014 from crime and safety to sustainable growth \u2014 most of which come from Statistics Canada data.

Millions more have applied for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, or CERB.\nBusinesses are closed across the country;\u00a0almost no one is travelling.\nThere is a closed sign on Canada's economy.

[President Franklin D. Roosevelt]\u00a0got elected that there was really an aggressive policy response.\"\nDecades later in\u00a0Canada, the federal government and Bank of Canada moved quickly to respond to the impact of COVID-19,\u00a0pouring tens of billions into the economy, while slashing interest rates.\nWhile the stimulus will significantly add to Canada's debt load, the financial pain for Canadians could be much worse without it.\nIn terms of the longer term impact on the economy, the so-called \"Great Recession\" of 2008-2009 might be a better point of comparison, even though\u00a0on the surface, the numbers Canada faces\u00a0right now are much worse.\nCanada's economy went into recession in 2009, and contracted by 3.3 per cent over a nine month period.\nThat\u00a0number is a much smaller contraction than we are likely to\u00a0see this spring, but in 2009 it was stretched out over the course of nearly a year.\n\"A\u00a0lot of the reason these numbers look so bad on the surface is that we're compressing what would typically take eleven to twelve months to pull down on the economy into a much shorter period,\" said Frances Donald, chief economist at Manulife Investment Management.\n\"So the total extent of the damage on the economy might be similar to 2009 but we're going to go through it much more quickly and for that reason almost every economic figure that we've seen so far and we'll continue to see we'll be quite literally off the charts.\"\nWhatever phrase we use to describe our current downturn is far from the most important question. What does matter is how Canada's economy recovers.\nThe general expectation at the moment is for recovery in the summer, but how strong that recovery will be depends on health measures such as the level of physical distancing still required to fight the pandemic.\nThere is a lot of pent up demand in the economy already.\nFor example,\u00a0people will want to go for dinner or get a haircut after weeks of services being unavailable.\nBut\u00a0there are\u00a0also problems looming which are particular to Canada's economy.\n\"There's another important part of this story which is that Canada, unlike the United States in 2009, did not experience the same sort of pop in their housing bubble in 2009,\" said Manulife's Frances Donald.\nThat overhang of debt could make Canadians less likely to spend in the coming months.\nAs a result, people could\u00a0change their approach toward savings and spending after this crisis, according to researcher David Rosenberg.\n\"Because the one thing that we found out is that nobody had any cash on hand.\u00a0So the old saying about saving up for a rainy day.

We can do better. We need to do better. Because we are failing our parents, our grandparents, our elders \u2014 the greatest generation who built this country,\" Trudeau continued. \"Going forward in the weeks and months to come, we will all have to ask tough questions about how it came to this.\"\nIn terms of public policy, COVID-19 will leave behind a number of success stories. Thousands of public servants have worked to implement and deliver billions of dollars in relief. Federal and provincial leaders have collaborated across jurisdictions and party lines. The Canadian health care system has, so far, held up much better than the system in the United States.\nBut this pandemic also showed us where we're failing as a country \u2014 in particular,\u00a0how\u00a0we care for the oldest\u00a0and most vulnerable among us.\n\"I recognize the system is broken and we are going to fix the system,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said this week.\nOther issues have come to the fore over the last month and a half: the importance of child care, the need for better and faster health and economic data, the limited fiscal capacity of some provinces, the fragility of international supply lines.\u00a0But the most glaring problem to emerge is the one in our long-term care centres.\nIn Ontario, 573 residents of long-term care facilities\u00a0have died \u2014 that's 75 per cent of the province's death toll. In Quebec, 1,045 residents have died \u2014 nearly 80 per cent of the provincial total.\n\"I think the tragedy of COVID-19 is that it's exposed a number of the weaknesses that have been long-standing,\" said Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Mount Sinai hospital and the University Health Network Hospitals in Toronto.\nGovernments in Canada have responded to the immediate crisis with a number of short-term measures.\u00a0The government of British Columbia took over staffing for some nursing homes around Vancouver \u2014\u00a0in part\u00a0to track workers who may be employed at more than one facility\u00a0and can become vectors for the virus\u00a0as a result.\nCaregivers are often not well paid, Sinha says,\u00a0which can lead them to take jobs at more than one centre.\u00a0Both B.C. and Quebec have increased pay for front-line workers, a measure the federal government has said it is willing to support. Both Quebec and Ontario have asked the federal government to task the Canadian military to help with staffing shortages.\n\"But this is not a long-term solution,\" Trudeau said Thursday. \"In Canada, we shouldn't have soldiers taking care of seniors.\"\n\"We've never funded the system with the same consideration that we fund the hospital sector,\" Dr.\u00a0Sinha\u00a0said.\nDr. Sinha notes that COVID-19 is a new and fast-moving disease \u2014 a significant challenge under any circumstances \u2014 and containment measures have been implemented gradually.\nFiguring out\u00a0how so many residents of long-term care facilities lost their lives to the pandemic\u00a0will involve\u00a0examining many possible factors. But last fall, Dr. Sinha co-authored a report that identified a number of issues with the way care is delivered in this country \u2014 issues that now seem like ripe targets for reform.\nLong-term care was not enshrined in the Canada Health Act, the federal legislation\u00a0that sets out the parameters of public medicare. Existing long-term care services are a patchwork of public and private options.\nDemands on providers are increasing, but front-line workers have been, in the words of that report,\u00a0\"underappreciated, overworked\u00a0and underpaid.\" Unpaid caregivers \u2014 family members and friends who take care of loved ones \u2014 are struggling with their own burdens.\nAs a share of GDP, Canada's annual public spending on long-term care \u2014 approximately $24 billion \u2014 is below the average of 15 other\u00a0OECD countries that report long-term care expenditures. Countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Norway spend twice as much.\nCanada also devotes a much higher percentage of its spending to facilities like nursing homes than it does to community-based care: 87 per cent versus\u00a013 per cent. In Denmark, the ratio is almost the reverse: 64 per cent of public spending there goes to home care, while 36 per cent goes to designated facilities.\nHealth care delivery is a provincial responsibility, but the federal government plays a significant role in funding, assisting and overseeing those services.\nA report by the Canadian Institute for Health Information in 2017 estimated that 22 per cent of seniors in nursing homes might be able to live at home \u2014 and recent federal interventions have been aimed at making that easier.\nIn 2015, the Conservative government introduced a tax credit to provide as much as $1,500 toward renovations to make a home more accessible for seniors. In 2017, the Liberal government introduced a caregiver benefit through employment insurance and committed $6 billion over ten years to help provinces improve home-care services.\nBut overall health spending remains a point of friction between the federal and provincial governments. Between 2004 and 2016, the federal transfer for health care increased at an annual rate of 6 per cent. Since 2017, the annual increase has been tied to GDP, with a minimum rate of 3 per cent.\nIn 2018-2019, the Canada Health Transfer grew by 3.9 per cent. Last fall, the provinces renewed their demand that the annual increase be set at 5.2 per cent.\nThat debate likely will play a big part in any discussions about the future of long-term care in Canada. But Dr. Sinha said there's\u00a0an opportunity here for the federal government to provide leadership and direction.\nHealth crises in Canada have led to changes in public policy before. The federal Department of Health was created in the aftermath of the Spanish flu epidemic in 1919. This week, federal ministers at least seemed willing to acknowledge a need to do something.\n\"I think there should be a long term national project to examine long term care homes and how we can better support [them] at every level of government, to make sure people who are living there are protected and can live their lives in dignity and safety,\" Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Thursday.\nIn the wake of so much death, a renewed focus on long-term care \u2014 and public\u00a0demands for action \u2014 might force politicians to stick to such commitments.\n\"We've had [more than] a thousand older people die,\" Dr. Sinha said. \"And if that's not a call to action, to fundamentally reform the entire way our country provides long-term care, then I don't know what is.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian economy cooled off in 3rd quarter, Statistics Canada says", "description": "Bank of Canada expected to hold line on interest rates next week", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-canada-gdp-statistics-canada-1.5377919", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3515291.1459461583!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/irving-navy-shipbuillding-20160304.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 29, 2019 8:53 AM ET", "2019-11-29T18:07:29.512Z"], "source": null, "content": "The pace of economic growth in Canada slowed in the third quarter, boosted by higher business investment and increased household spending, but weighed down by a drop in exports, Statistics Canada said Friday.\nThe federal agency said real gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 1.3 per cent in the three-month period compared with a revised reading of 3.5 per cent for the second quarter.\nThe initial estimate had been a reading of 3.7 per cent released in August.\nEconomists had expected annualized growth of 1.2 per cent in the third quarter, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nThe latest reading on the economy comes ahead of the Bank of Canada's interest rate announcement next week. The central bank is expected to keep its key interest rate target on hold at 1.75 per cent.\nFrances Donald, chief economist and head of macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management, said the strength in business investment was a good sign for the Canadian economy.\nStatistics Canada said business investment rose 2.6 per cent in the third quarter, its fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\"It appears Canadian businesses are back into spending mode. That is absolutely critical to Canada's so-called resilience because as our consumer weakens over the course of 2020, we need businesses to pick up the slack,\" Donald said.\n\"Today's data point indicated to us that there is perhaps some reasons to be cautiously optimistic about business spending in Canada.\"\nDonald said the result for the quarter was in line with the Bank of Canada's forecast and the central bank will likely want to see a significant departure from its expectations before it makes a move to cut its key interest rate.\n\"My personal view is that the Bank of Canada will have to engage in rate cuts, but likely only in the second half of 2020,\" she said.\n\"Moreover, while we talk a lot about downside risks for the Canadian economy, we should also be considering the idea that there are upside risks as well.

The overall drop came as exports of non-metallic minerals fell 15.2 per cent and farm and fishing products dropped 4.5 per cent.

Those government scenarios examined how Alberta would fare:\n\"What they found is that there is healthy economic growth and healthy job creation under all of the scenarios from 2020 to 2030,\" Harrison said.\u00a0  And she said the data showed even with a carbon tax rising to $50 a tonne, the difference in effect on the province's GDP would be marginal.\n\"The difference in the average growth of GDP at the maximum is a difference between 2.57 per cent [growth]\u00a0per year and 2.5\u00a0per cent per year,\" said Harrison, who in addition to a doctorate in political science, holds a masters degree in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nBut job creation would be affected by a carbon tax, Harrison said. The government report said the Notley carbon tax would reduce the number of jobs created by between 10,000 and 16,000 a year.\nIn an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Alberta Environment Minister Jason Nixon did not address the government analysis filed as part of its court challenge.\u00a0\nInstead, she referenced the government report that said Alberta's average annual GDP growth, under the Climate Leadership Plan with a carbon tax rising to $50 per tonne, would be reduced by between 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points, which is about $2 billion to $3.9 billion a year.\u00a0\nThe statement also maintained the UCP government's position that the carbon tax imposed an unacceptable financial burden on individual households.\nSimon Dyer of the Pembina Institute said the reduction in GDP growth under the Notley government carbon tax was insignificant.\u00a0\n\"The carbon tax was misrepresented in the most recent provincial election in Alberta,\" Dyer said, adding that the tax \"hasn't had a significant impact either on consumers or on industry.\"\nDuring cross-examination in October as part of Alberta's challenge to the federal carbon tax, Alberta assistant deputy minister for energy Robert Savage seemed to admit the Alberta government chose Pembina's modelling knowing it produced emissions-reduction data that was better for the government's case.  \"So you had information that the Pembina Institute's modelling provided significantly smaller differences [in emissions reduction] because it had a more optimistic 'business as usual' approach?\" B.C. government lawyer Gareth Morley asked Savage.\n\"My understanding is that there were some differences in the forecast,\" Savage replied, adding that he believed Navius Research, the firm hired by the Alberta government to model the effects of a carbon tax, was working with the Pembina Institute on that issue.\nUnder questioning, Savage also conceded the general consensus among economists is that a carbon tax is one of the most economically efficient ways to curb emissions.\nSavage however, resisted a line of questioning that sought to establish that the Notley government's carbon tax had resulted in a significant reduction in emissions.\nThe environmental model Pembina used to forecast emissions reduction was developed by a San Francisco policy firm. The Alberta government used a draft version of that model to forecast that a $30-per-tonne carbon tax on building and transportation emissions would only reduce annual emissions by 1.4 megatonnes in 2020, and 2.7 megatonnes in 2030.\nAs part of the Paris climate agreement, Canada has committed to lowering its greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. That means lowering emissions to 513 megatonnes from 732 megatonnes.\nThe Alberta government's own environmental modelling data, produced in court after the government filed its initial legal documents, forecast the carbon tax would reduce annual emissions by one megatonne in 2020, and by five megatonnes in both 2025 and 2030.\nDyer said the Pembina model is a \"rigorous but simplified\" model that doesn't consider how carbon-tax revenues could be used to drive further emissions reductions, for example through investment in public transit.\nHe said while carbon pricing isn't the only solution to reducing emissions, it is a critical and relatively low-cost tool that has proven effective.\n\"Carbon pricing works. It works for consumers in terms of helping them make different choices, especially if you provide rebates to ensure that they're not out of pocket,\" Dyer said, adding it is also necessary for industry.\n\"If we don't have strong enough carbon pricing in place, this industry is never going to be able to innovate fast enough to compete in this global market that is demanding low-carbon oil,\" he said.\nUnder the former NDP government's climate leadership plan, about 60 per cent of households were eligible for carbon-tax rebates.\nUniversity of Calgary researchers found four out of 10 households received a rebate that was greater than their carbon-tax costs. The federal government has said that under its system, that figure would be eight out of\u00a010 households.\nNDP environment critic Marlin Schmidt said the Kenney government misled the public about the carbon tax.\n\"I think what we saw during the election campaign was an attempt to misdirect Albertans,\" Schmidt said.\n\"We know that Albertans have been going through a really tough economy over the past few years, and Kenney used the carbon tax as a simple but wrong explanation as to what was going on with Alberta's economy.\"\nIf you have any information for this story, or information for another story, please contact us in confidence at cbcinvestigates@cbc.ca\nFollow us on Twitter: @charlesrusnell @jennierussell_\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1614626371615", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Industry minister says she'll 'put the pressure on' feds after Dominion files for creditor protection", "description": "As for Dominion Diamond's future, the minister said she doesn't know much more than the public does", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-industry-minister-speaks-dominion-granted-creditor-protection-1.5543871", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5333658.1571934656!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/katrina-nokleby.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 24, 2020 10:34 AM CT", "2020-04-24T17:56:04.189Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Northwest Territories industry minister says she can't see further into the mining industry's future than most of the public can, but that this week's news that Dominion Diamond Mines filed for creditor protection is \"not the best thing for us, that's for sure.\"\nOn Friday, Katrina Nokleby told Loren McGinnis on CBC's The Trailbreaker\u00a0that Dominion is \"optimistic\" it will\u00a0bounce back from financial hardships brought on in part by COVID-19, and that the territorial government hopes that's what will happen.\n\"However ... we are preparing for how the economy is going to be, and not just with the [mining] industry, but for everything with the Northwest Territories post-COVID[-19],\" Nokleby added.\nAs the controlling owner of the Ekati Diamond Mine, and a 40 per cent partner in the territory's Diavik Diamond Mine, Dominion Diamond Mines is a major employer in the Northwest Territories.

According to its visitor exit survey, 62 per cent of visitors to the Yukon came from the U.S., about\u00a028 per cent were Canadian and the remaining 10 per cent came from countries other than the U.S.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Yukon Chamber of Mines\u00a0says\u00a0it's too early to know what impact COVID-19 will have on the mining industry, the territory's\u00a0largest private sector employer. In 2018, mining\u00a0and oil and gas development\u00a0made up 5.7 per cent of Yukon's GDP.\u00a0\n\"We could expect to see some slimming of that [mining revenue],\" said Samson Hartland, executive director of the\u00a0chamber. \"Just how much is anybody's guess.\"\u00a0\nYukon has two mines in operation. Victoria Gold, which poured the first gold bar from its Eagle Gold Mine near Mayo in September, said earlier this month it is\u00a0proceeding with its operational ramp-up. It said it expects\u00a0gold production to increase \"substantially\" over the coming months.\nSara McPhee-Knowles, an instructor at\u00a0Yukon College's School of Business and Leadership who holds a PhD in public policy, said the economic downturn\u00a0could have a positive impact on metal prices.\u00a0\n\"In the last recession, in 2008 and 2009, the price of gold went up because investors view it as a safe bet,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf that happens again, she said, it could benefit Yukon.\u00a0\nVictoria Gold continues operations despite a plea made last month by the\u00a0Na-Cho Nyak Dun First Nation in Mayo, asking the\u00a0Yukon government to put a stop to mining and staking in the territory during the COVID-19 pandemic. The First Nation said the\u00a0hundreds of workers rotating in and out of the nearby Eagle mine put the community at risk.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe company responded by saying it is\u00a0taking appropriate precautions\u00a0and following the Yukon government's requirement that all workers entering the territory self-isolate for 14 days at a place other than a mine or camp. Some of those workers are staying at hotels in Whitehorse.\u00a0\nHartland, with the Yukon Chamber of Mines, said keeping communities safe is a priority, but noted the 14-day quarantine requirement could be challenging for the \"dozens and dozens\" of smaller field and exploration programs that take place in the territory every summer.\nHe said work delays and added costs could be a deterrent for companies coming from out of the territory, especially if they were only planning to do a couple of weeks of work.\u00a0\nHartland said one thing that would\u00a0help the mining sector is a relaxation of regulatory requirements in the form of extensions on permitting and consultation deadlines.\u00a0He said the limited capacity of some government offices because of the pandemic could otherwise delay processes and result in a\u00a0slowdown of mining and exploration activities.\nWhen the Yukon government announced a business relief program earlier this month, Economic Development Minister Ranj Pillai, touted it as the\u00a0\"most comprehensive\"\u00a0business relief program in the country to date.\nThe program is for\u00a0businesses that have seen a\u00a0reduction in revenue of at least 30 per cent during the pandemic. It will cover up to $30,000 per month for fixed costs\u00a0including rent, water, sewage, electricity, internet, or insurance.\nThe program was announced after the Whitehorse Chamber of Commerce said only half of the businesses\u00a0it surveyed thought they'd be able to recover from the economic impact of the pandemic.\nAt this time last year, Yukon boasted the highest employment rate in the country. Now, the situation in the territory is anything but rosy, though the number of jobs lost as a result of the\u00a0COVID-19 crisis won't be known for several weeks.\nBecause of Yukon's small population, employment numbers are calculated\u00a0based on a three-month moving average, meaning numbers that reflect the full hit of the pandemic won't start coming out until June.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Retailers foresee holiday joy \u2014 even as Poloz looks to hold line on rates: Don Pittis", "description": "While the world cuts interest rates, the Bank of Canada likely won't if we keep shopping", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-poloz-retail-1.5381037", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5381165.1575312823!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winter-toronto-real-estate.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 03, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-03T09:00:00.543Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "South of the border, there was much hand-wringing that a shortened holiday spending season this year just wouldn't give our American cousins enough time to shop till they drop.\nAccording to some retail analysts, a late Thanksgiving meant a late Black Friday, viewed as the starting gun for the U.S. Christmas spending frenzy.\nOf course, Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving a month earlier and don't quite have that same special Friday to shop, shop,\u00a0shop.\u00a0But there is reason to think the season of retail therapy\u00a0that is also a phenomenon here will give Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz one less reason to cut interest rates.\nMost analysts expect Poloz to hold rates steady at 1.75 per cent tomorrow, and sturdy consumer spending is part of the rationale.\nFigures released last week\u00a0show\u00a0that despite an overall decline to 1.3 per cent in Canadian GDP,\u00a0housing, consumer activity, construction and business investment were all\u00a0holding up well.\nExports were down, but that could be partly blamed\u00a0on a leaky\u00a0pipeline that interrupted oil shipments and a General Motors\u00a0strike that reduced the need for Canadian parts.\nFinal holiday retail figures don't\u00a0come out till the new year, but there are several signs Canadians remain in a spending mood. And that's despite Retail\u00a0Council of Canada research that shows 18 per cent of Canadians plan to spend less\u00a0than they have in the past.\nClearly, what you say to someone taking a survey doesn't always pan out.\nFigures from last year show\u00a0more than one-quarter (27%) of those surveyed\u00a0ended up spending more in 2018\u00a0than they had planned. Only six per cent spent less.\nOverall spending is expected to rise substantially in 2019, says the council's Michael LeBlanc.\nAccording to\u00a0Statistics Canada, consumer spending picked up in the three-month period ending in October. We can't be certain that consumer optimism will continue, but a long run of job creation and growing wages seem to point in that direction.\nCertainly, analysis from Adobe Analytics\u00a0shows that fears of a short U.S. shopping season seems to have\u00a0only increased\u00a0appetite for a consumption binge, as shoppers spent record amounts online.\nIn the U.S.\u00a0too\u00a0consumer spending has been one of the mainstays of the economy, even as trade and business investment weakened.\nWhile frigid weather and storms\u00a0can drive people away from the shops, a layer of snow\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like what landed on parts of the country\u00a0this week\u00a0\u2014\u00a0seems to stimulate the holiday shopping impulse.\nA spendy holiday season is\u00a0important to retailers, those who invest in them, and to people who worry whether consumers can keep the economy afloat for a few more months as we wait for what some foresee as an economic revival. A\u00a0rule of thumb says that one-quarter of overall retail sales during\u00a0the entire year come in the days before Christmas as people splurge on themselves and others.\nThere are signs that so long as housing remains\u00a0on the rise and consumers keep spending,\u00a0Poloz will be in no mood to cut Canada's interest rates. As he and his deputy, Carolyn Wilkins, have warned in the past, lower rates\u00a0that make borrowing cheaper may not be good for Canadians,\u00a0who, as a group,\u00a0have already borrowed too much.\nIf the next round of stimulus must come from fiscal spending, as the OECD has suggested, Poloz may decide to delay rate cuts well into the new year to see what impact government spending will have. (Thursday's speech from the throne may give a better idea of fiscal spending to come.)\nSome economists have said that if Friday's unemployment numbers show us that the recent trend toward more jobs and fewer jobless is interrupted, it\u00a0may be the first sign that the Canadian economy really does need\u00a0a rate cut. So far, retail bank economists have offered wildly different predictions on whether the economy will gain or lose employment this time around.\u00a0\nAnd in the\u00a0way that economies are recognized as self-reinforcing, expectations of a bumper holiday retail season will help contribute to economic strength\u00a0\u2014\u00a0particularly as retailers shake the branches for extra staff in an economy where workers are, so far, still in short supply.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Janet French", "title": "Alberta finance minister authorized to borrow up to $25 billion", "description": "Budget planned for $6.8 billion in borrowing", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-finance-minister-travis-toews-borrow-1.5543342", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5333519.1571930537!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/alta-finance-toews-20190904.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 23, 2020 6:25 PM MT", "2020-04-24T02:04:02.901Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Alberta government has authorized Finance Minister Travis Toews to borrow up to $25 billion.\nThe sum is nearly four times the amount the government expected to borrow this year when it approved its 2020-21 budget in March.\n\"We expect the province's deficit to be significantly larger due to reduced revenues and additional COVID-19 related spending,\" Toews' press secretary, Jerrica Goodwin, said in a Thursday email.\nAlthough Toews may not need to borrow the full amount, he wants to be prepared,\u00a0given the volatile economic conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and an\u00a0oil price war, Goodwin said.\nLast month,\u00a0to\u00a0vociferous protest from the Opposition, the United Conservative Party government approved a $57-billion budget based on financial projections it knew were outdated.\nIt calculated oil royalties based on a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $58 US a barrel.

Earlier this week, the government said it would top up health-care aide wages by $2 an hour and recruit more workers for continuing care homes. Many assisted living facilities and long-term care homes have been hard hit by COVID-19.\nGoodwin said the government has launched numerous programs and payment deferrals for people and businesses to help them endure the pandemic's economic punch. They include a $500-million boost to health spending, expanded homeless shelters, funds for social service agencies, property tax and utility bill payment deferrals and a ban on evictions for non-payment of rent in the month of April.\nDuring its four years in power, the former NDP government gave its finance minister permission to borrow up to $68 billion. Phillips said the NDP ultimately borrowed about $50 billion for provincial spending, about 43 per cent of which paid for construction of schools, hospitals, roads and bridges.\nWith borrowing cheap at the time, Phillips said the government also borrowed $5 billion cash to have on hand for emergencies.

It's a strategy the UCP government should consider, she said.\n"}, {"author": "Sam Juric", "title": "P.E.I. announces $4.7M to tackle potato surplus related to COVID-19 market conditions", "description": "'This will help to ensure no product is lost so that farmers are in good position for the 2020 growing season'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-potato-surplus-supports-announced-covid-19-1.5542885", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5184953.1561131858!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pei-spring-planting-potato-farming-2019.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 23, 2020 5:46 PM AT", "2020-04-23T20:46:42.358Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Ahead of the growing season, the government of P.E.I. has announced it will provide $4.7 million to address the Island's potato surplus as a result of\u00a0COVID-19 market conditions.\u00a0\nIn a Thursday afternoon news briefing, Minister of Agriculture and Land Bloyce Thompson said the province will be helping producers and processors with the cost of\u00a0shipping\u00a0and storing\u00a0potatoes.\u00a0\n\"This will help to ensure no product is lost so that farmers are in good position for the 2020 growing season,\" Thompson said.\u00a0\n\"It will help resolve the substantial market issues to ensure these potatoes will now be a source of safe, quality food for our food security.\"\u00a0\nThompson acknowledged the approximately 4,600 employees in the agricultural industry on P.E.I.

That's because the economic result depends not just on the unpredictable unfolding medical situation, but also on the results of attempts by governments, businesses and the rest of us to cope.\nWe have repeatedly seen anger expressed at the fact that medical officials or political and economic leaders have got it wrong. But in a\u00a0health and economic crisis unlike anything we have experienced before, the landscape is constantly changing.\nWATCH | Modelling suggests we're in it for the long haul:\n\"The thing is, we're working with the best evidence that we have at the time,\" said infectious disease specialist Sumon Chakrabarty on CBC\u00a0Radio's The Current last week.\nOn Friday, recession arbiter, the C.D.Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council, declared that Canada is officially in a recession. Growth figures from February released last week showed the economy was already slowing even before the Canadian lockdown had begun.\nEchoing Chakrabarty's comments on the medical outlook, the newly appointed next head of Canada's central bank, Tiff Macklem, took a similar stance from the economic point of view.\n\"The bank has to be humble about what it doesn't know,\" he said, responding to reporters' questions on Friday in an empty auditorium.\nAnd as events unfold, Macklem warned that the Bank of Canada's economists will be forced to forecast based on a range of possible outcomes that will probably change over time.\n\"The Bank of Canada has tremendous analytic economic financial capacity to analyze what's going on in the economy, and I think an important role for the Bank of Canada is to provide Canadians with as much information as it can honestly provide,\" said Macklem, \"recognizing that\u00a0we're probably going to have to look at more than one scenario.\"\nJust as the World Health Organization and Canada's Chief Public Health Officer\u00a0Dr. Theresa Tam have been accused of getting it wrong at first and changing their prescriptions to fight the virus, economic policy is taking plenty of flack as well.\nEconomists at commercial and retail banks have been chided for underestimating the severity of the effect of the pandemic on the economy.\nThe federal government has had to update its policy of economic support as each new group complained that it had been left out or shortchanged. Even then, existing plans face new criticism, such as from employers concerned that the support package means workers would rather stay home than take the jobs they offer.\nAs governments expand borrowing to pour money into the economy, no one is sure what the long-term effects will be. Some worry about deflation; others, inflation.\nSimilar to the events of the Great Recession in 2008, some critics worry attempts by central banks to flood capital markets with cash to avoid systemic failures are employing public funds to artificially boost the price of stocks, adding to the wealth of stockholders who are already better off.\nBut even if the medium- and long-term uncertainty remains for both the illness and the economy, fresh data this week will give a firmer grip on what is happening in the present.\nTomorrow's trade figures are for March, so they will give a fresher perspective than last week's GDP numbers, likely revealing how a slowdown caused by our trade partners in Asia and Europe transformed into a domestic logjam as the virus hit home.\nBut Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey report for the month of April will be the freshest economic data of all.\nAlthough Friday jobs numbers are likely to be bad, representing the first full month of the lockdown, there's a bright side. As provincial economies experiment with reopening businesses and sending employees back to work, there is a chance that this week's lows will represent a nadir. Of course, all bets will be off if it turns out we have opened up too soon, or if frustrated Canadians cause a new outbreak by mingling too quickly.\nAs our next Bank of Canada governor pointed out, at a time like this optimism is good. So long as it is tempered by realism.\n\"There is certainly a fairly optimistic scenario, that when you think of this as a natural disaster \u2014\u00a0as we recover from the natural disaster, the economy bounces back fairly quickly,\" said Macklem, who is current dean of the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\n\"But clearly, there are downside risks against that scenario.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Economy flat in July as oil and gas sector down, Statistics Canada says", "description": "Economists had expected growth of 0.1 per cent, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-gdp-canada-july-1.5303938", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2567217.1405009376!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hibernia-platform.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 01, 2019 8:58 AM ET", "2019-10-01T13:39:32.486Z"], "source": null, "content": "Statistics Canada says the country's real gross domestic product was essentially unchanged in July as weakness in oil and gas extraction offset gains in service industries.\nEconomists had expected growth of 0.1 per cent, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nThe flat reading for the month came as goods-producing industries fell 0.7 per cent for the month.\nThe mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector pulled back 3.5 per cent in the month, the largest decrease in the sector since May 2016.\nOil and gas extraction fell 3.0 per cent in July due in large part to a shutdown of some of Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore production facilities for a large part of the month as a result of maintenance issues.\nMeanwhile, Stastics Canada says the services-producing industries rose 0.3 per cent.\nOne economist suggested not reading too much into the overall flat growth seen in July.\n\"Today's headline was definitely soft, but the underlying story was not,\" TD Bank senior\u00a0economist Brian DePratto said in a commentary.\u00a0\n\"If it weren't for the drag from the energy/mining sector, we'd have had a repeat of June's solid performance, even with the relative lack of growth breadth.\u00a0 If you're looking for generalized weakness in Canada's economy, today's report ain't it,' he wrote.\nDePratto also said the latest report on the economy isn't likely to produce movement by\u00a0Bank of Canada on interest rates.\n\"Governor [Stephen] Poloz and company are looking for signs of the global trade and manufacturing slowdown manifesting in the Canadian data.

Not $1,000\u00a0\u2014\u00a0zero. So this is how we are affected.\"\nSurveying the months and possibly the years ahead, at the moment, Stratulat says\u00a0he's depressed.\nHe's not alone.\nThe tourism sector is just one of the drivers of a B.C. economy that's been quickly\u00a0ravaged by the novel coronavirus, as the pandemic has shuttered borders, disrupted supply chains and thrown health-care systems into chaos as the entire world looks to clamp down on its spread.\nFrom forestry and\u00a0film, to mining and manufacturing, economists say it's hard to predict the depth of the damage or the length of the time it will take for the province to recover.\nThat's if it can be predicted at all.\n\"This is totally unprecedented, so thinking about it really requires opening one's mind and being creative and flexible,\" said\u00a0Ken Peacock, chief economist for the Business Council of British Columbia.\n\"Traditional models just are not calibrated to come up with estimates and to model what's going on.\"\nAccording to Statistics Canada, B.C.'s gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 the total value of goods and services produced in the province annually \u2014 was around $264\u00a0billion in 2018.\nExperts across the board say determining by just how much COVID-19 may shrink that figure is,\u00a0at this point, too difficult; no one can say for certain\u00a0how long the measures needed to combat the virus will be in place.\nProvincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has hinted that even when restrictions start lifting, some measure of physical distancing will still be needed to keep the disease in check.\nBut what will that mean in terms of going to the restaurants, bars and hotels that employed nearly 200,000 people in the province in 2018?\nWill universities still be able to open their doors to the international students who provide a good portion of their funding?\u00a0\nAnd will the borders be open for the export of the billions of dollars worth of forestry and industrial products that B.C. needs to sell?\nAs Peacock explains, the B.C. economy is primarily driven by the goods and services sold to markets outside the province. That brings money into B.C., with\u00a0other domestic businesses in turn providing\u00a0goods and services to those exporters.\nNatural resources \u2014 forestry, the mining sector and related products like aluminum \u2014 have traditionally been the keystone of the province's economy. But the real estate, housing and leasing markets are also huge generators of GDP, as is the construction industry.\nAnd in recent years, as the forestry sector in particular has lagged, other sectors, like tourism, have expanded.\nB.C.'s tourism industry generated $20.5 billion in revenue in 2018.\nAccording to WorkBC, the sector employs about 160,000 people, mostly through\u00a0locally owned small- and medium-sized businesses like the one Stratulat has been building since 2014.\nOriginally from Romania, Stratulat left a career as a mechanical engineer behind to become a tour guide. He has steadily developed a solid reputation through both his own company\u00a0and\u00a0ToursByLocals, a platform that connects tourists and guides, which was\u00a0rated one of B.C.'s top\u00a0employers last year.\nA lot of his business comes through cruise ship passengers wanting to spend a few hours \u2014 and a few hundred dollars\u00a0\u2014 in the Vancouver area.\nBut all that has\u00a0currently dried up, and with it, the money Stratulat needs to pay off the two Mercedes vans he uses to whisk travellers off to picturesque places, like Whistler, Banff, Victoria and Jasper.\n\"I have huge payments and, actually,\u00a0I cannot make the payments,\" said Stratulat.\u00a0\"Luckily, my wife works, so she pays the mortgage. But for me, I have zero income and it's very emotional for me. I might lose everything.\"\nPeacock and his business council have come up with predictions\u00a0around the impact of COVID-19\u00a0on the B.C. economy based on two different scenarios.\nThe first would see the economy contract by about seven per cent in 2020, based on a return to some kind of normal this summer. But the second would involve an 11 per cent decline based on longer closures, widespread job losses and a deep global recession.\nBy contrast, Bryan Yu, deputy chief economist with Central 1 Credit Union, says he's expecting B.C.'s economy to shrink by about 3.5\u00a0per cent for the year.\nThat's still a lot, but Yu says the province has some large-scale infrastructure projects\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like the Site C dam and the development of LNG Canada's liquefied natural gas project in Kitimat\u00a0\u2014 that could provide a buffer for some of the loss.\nHe also points to recent diversification of the economy that has seen growth in the high tech and agricultural industries.\nYu further expects unemployment to rise to between eight and 10 per cent in 2020. \"But in our view, a lot of this is expected to be temporary,\" he said.\nUnder both of Peacock's scenarios, the hardest hit sectors are expected to be arts, entertainment and recreation, and accommodation and food services. And construction, manufacturing and wholesale trade can all still expect to contract by double digits.\nSo why can't British Columbians \u2014 and Canadians in general \u2014 put the economy on some kind of a hold while they weather the COVID-19\u00a0storm?\nEven if the question sounds naive, both Peacock and Yu say it's one a lot of people have been asking.\nThey both say the federal and provincial governments have effectively been trying to hit the pause button by providing tens of billions of dollars in money to help out-of-work Canadians and businesses\u00a0bridge the gap.\nBut this is where a time element comes in.\n\"When you're talking timelines of pausing for a month or two months\u00a0\u2014\u00a0maybe three at the outside\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it's kind of doable,\" said\u00a0Peacock. \"It's another thing to pause for six or seven months: Governments cannot fill the hole that is created by the downturn. They just don't have enough resources.\"\nAnd the longer people are disconnected from their jobs, he says, the more difficult it will become\u00a0for them to re-enter the workforce.\n\"A lot of the businesses that people were hoping to return to may not exist,\" he said.\n\"Then there's the whole question of rent payments and mortgage payments. You can postpone them and delay them, but eventually, you have to pay them back.\"\nAnother part of the COVID-19 economic equation comes down to the way other countries handle the virus.\nAbout half of B.C.'s exports are to the United States, with the rest\u00a0divided\u00a0between China, Japan, the rest of Asia and some other countries. China is slowly reopening to business, but the U.S. faces an uncertain future as far as both its economy and the public health battle\u00a0are concerned.\nIf there's such a thing as a growth industry in this\u00a0pandemic, the Business Council of B.C. is projecting it to be government.\nPeacock's projections estimate the public administration portion of the province's GDP could grow by\u00a0six to nine per cent, depending on the length of the crisis.\nIglika Ivanova, a feminist economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, says she hopes that any tax hawks in favour of shrinking the government will remember the role the province and Ottawa have played in trying to salvage the economy.\nShe also believes British Columbians should ask themselves what kind of an economy they want to see on the other side of the pandemic.\nThat may include things like restructuring a long-term care system that has proven vulnerable to the virus. Or providing better pay to the janitors, health-care aides, delivery drivers, grocery store clerks and other front-line workers whose labour is proving itself priceless amid the storm.\nAnd Ivanova said she believes the province should\u00a0invest\u00a0in renewable energy and green industries intended to withstand future economic shock.\n\"We all know that we have to make an energy transition,\" she said. \"Over the medium to long run, why not kick-start it now that we're going to be likely providing a lot of support to business?\u00a0\u2026 Why not support the kind of business investment that we know is going to benefit us in the long run?\"\nIn the meantime, people like Stratulat can do little more than follow the ever-changing news\u00a0around COVID-19 and hope for the eventual return of their portion of the B.C. economy.\u00a0\n\"If this thing doesn't stop, with all the social distancing and all that, not [until]\u00a0October of this year will people book tours for the next summer,\" he predicts.\nAnd if longer?\n\"It could be\u00a0a year,\u00a0it could be more. I don't know.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jason Proctor", "title": "'We make zero': How COVID-19 is likely to impact B.C.'s economy", "description": "Extent of damage largely dependent on the time it takes to contain the virus, economists say", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/economy-british-columbia-covid-1.5527995", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5528046.1586455242!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/gabriel-stratulat.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 12, 2020 1:00 AM PT", "2020-04-12T08:00:00.145Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of The COVID Economy, a CBC News series looking at how the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic is affecting jobs, manufacturing and business in regions across Canada.\nThere are the statistics, graphs and charts that provide a snapshot of B.C.'s economy in the face of COVID-19.

He has steadily developed a solid reputation through both his own company\u00a0and\u00a0ToursByLocals, a platform that connects tourists and guides, which was\u00a0rated one of B.C.'s top\u00a0employers last year.\nA lot of his business comes through cruise ship passengers wanting to spend a few hours \u2014 and a few hundred dollars\u00a0\u2014 in the Vancouver area.\nBut all that has\u00a0currently dried up, and with it, the money Stratulat needs to pay off the two Mercedes vans he uses to whisk travellers off to picturesque places, like Whistler, Banff, Victoria and Jasper.\n\"I have huge payments and, actually,\u00a0I cannot make the payments,\" said Stratulat.\u00a0\"Luckily, my wife works, so she pays the mortgage. But for me, I have zero income and it's very emotional for me. I might lose everything.\"\nPeacock and his business council have come up with predictions\u00a0around the impact of COVID-19\u00a0on the B.C. economy based on two different scenarios.\nThe first would see the economy contract by about seven per cent in 2020, based on a return to some kind of normal this summer. But the second would involve an 11 per cent decline based on longer closures, widespread job losses and a deep global recession.\nBy contrast, Bryan Yu, deputy chief economist with Central 1 Credit Union, says he's expecting B.C.'s economy to shrink by about 3.5\u00a0per cent for the year.\nThat's still a lot, but Yu says the province has some large-scale infrastructure projects\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like the Site C dam and the development of LNG Canada's liquefied natural gas project in Kitimat\u00a0\u2014 that could provide a buffer for some of the loss.\nHe also points to recent diversification of the economy that has seen growth in the high tech and agricultural industries.\nYu further expects unemployment to rise to between eight and 10 per cent in 2020. \"But in our view, a lot of this is expected to be temporary,\" he said.\nUnder both of Peacock's scenarios, the hardest hit sectors are expected to be arts, entertainment and recreation, and accommodation and food services. And construction, manufacturing and wholesale trade can all still expect to contract by double digits.\nSo why can't British Columbians \u2014 and Canadians in general \u2014 put the economy on some kind of a hold while they weather the COVID-19\u00a0storm?\nEven if the question sounds naive, both Peacock and Yu say it's one a lot of people have been asking.\nThey both say the federal and provincial governments have effectively been trying to hit the pause button by providing tens of billions of dollars in money to help out-of-work Canadians and businesses\u00a0bridge the gap.\nBut this is where a time element comes in.\n\"When you're talking timelines of pausing for a month or two months\u00a0\u2014\u00a0maybe three at the outside\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it's kind of doable,\" said\u00a0Peacock. \"It's another thing to pause for six or seven months: Governments cannot fill the hole that is created by the downturn. They just don't have enough resources.\"\nAnd the longer people are disconnected from their jobs, he says, the more difficult it will become\u00a0for them to re-enter the workforce.\n\"A lot of the businesses that people were hoping to return to may not exist,\" he said.\n\"Then there's the whole question of rent payments and mortgage payments. You can postpone them and delay them, but eventually, you have to pay them back.\"\nAnother part of the COVID-19 economic equation comes down to the way other countries handle the virus.\nAbout half of B.C.'s exports are to the United States, with the rest\u00a0divided\u00a0between China, Japan, the rest of Asia and some other countries. China is slowly reopening to business, but the U.S. faces an uncertain future as far as both its economy and the public health battle\u00a0are concerned.\nIf there's such a thing as a growth industry in this\u00a0pandemic, the Business Council of B.C. is projecting it to be government.\nPeacock's projections estimate the public administration portion of the province's GDP could grow by\u00a0six to nine per cent, depending on the length of the crisis.\nIglika Ivanova, a feminist economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, says she hopes that any tax hawks in favour of shrinking the government will remember the role the province and Ottawa have played in trying to salvage the economy.\nShe also believes British Columbians should ask themselves what kind of an economy they want to see on the other side of the pandemic.\nThat may include things like restructuring a long-term care system that has proven vulnerable to the virus. Or providing better pay to the janitors, health-care aides, delivery drivers, grocery store clerks and other front-line workers whose labour is proving itself priceless amid the storm.\nAnd Ivanova said she believes the province should\u00a0invest\u00a0in renewable energy and green industries intended to withstand future economic shock.\n\"We all know that we have to make an energy transition,\" she said. \"Over the medium to long run, why not kick-start it now that we're going to be likely providing a lot of support to business?\u00a0\u2026 Why not support the kind of business investment that we know is going to benefit us in the long run?\"\nIn the meantime, people like Stratulat can do little more than follow the ever-changing news\u00a0around COVID-19 and hope for the eventual return of their portion of the B.C. economy.\u00a0\n\"If this thing doesn't stop, with all the social distancing and all that, not [until]\u00a0October of this year will people book tours for the next summer,\" he predicts.\nAnd if longer?\n\"It could be\u00a0a year,\u00a0it could be more. I don't know.\"\n"}, {"author": "Bartley Kives", "title": "Conference Board slashes Manitoba's 2019 economic growth projection ahead of election", "description": "Trade tensions, less robust consumer and government spending weigh down province's economy", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/conference-board-manitoba-election-1.5255287", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5255461.1566430281!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canola-field-manitoba-july-2019.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 22, 2019 5:00 AM CT", "2019-08-22T10:00:00.671Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Conference Board of Canada is painting a gloomier picture of Manitoba's economy only weeks before the\u00a0provincial election.\nOn Wednesday, the Conference Board slashed its economic growth forecast for the province by two-thirds.

According to the government's math, the average middle class family is better off by $2,000 compared to the situation in 2015.\nThe Conservatives, so far, remain unmollified.\nPart of the Conservative argument is that Trudeau's Liberals will surely raise taxes if they continue to govern after October. Conservatives remain adamant that the Trudeau government has engaged already in a confiscatory raid upon the public's wallets and bank accounts.\nBut Raitt and Poilievre \u2014 two former cabinet ministers from Stephen Harper's government\u00a0\u2014 might try to take more pride in the current situation. If anything, the tax system they left behind has proved fairly durable.\nThe relative \"burden\" of taxes can be assessed in a number of ways, but the federal government's official accounts offer a relatively straightforward measure that allows for comparisons across years: annual federal tax revenue as a share of Canada's Gross Domestic Product.\nFor 2014-2015\u00a0\u2014 the last full fiscal year of Stephen Harper's government\u00a0\u2014 tax revenue as a share of GDP was 11.5 per cent.\nFor 2018-2019\u00a0\u2014 after nearly four full years of Justin Trudeau's government\u00a0\u2014 tax revenue as a share of GDP is projected to be 12.7 per cent. In subsequent years, according to the government's own numbers, it's forecast to settle around 12.4 per cent.\nThat 0.9 -point increase is not nothing. But it's still below what the federal government was taking in when Harper's Conservatives came to office in 2006. It's even further below what the federal government was raising at the respective peaks of the Mulroney and Chr\u00e9tien\u00a0years.\nFor 1999-2000, for instance, total tax revenue reached 14.5 per cent of GDP\u00a0\u2014 the highest point of the last 35 years.\nWhat followed was a steady and significant decline. First, the Liberal government cut taxes. At the end of Paul Martin's time as prime minister,\u00a0total tax revenues stood at 13.2 per cent of GDP.\nThen the Conservative government cut taxes. Stephen Harper's Conservatives reduced the GST by two points and decreased the corporate tax rate from 21 per cent to 15 per cent. A half point was taken off the lowest bracket for personal income taxes, Tax Free Savings Accounts\u00a0were created\u00a0and a half dozen tax credits designed to appeal to potential Conservative voters.\nBetween 1983 and 2006, annual federal revenue averaged 13.3 per cent of GDP.\u00a0 But under Harper's government, federal tax revenues, measured as a share of GDP, reached a modern low of 11.4 per cent in the 2011-2012 fiscal year. This is what\u00a0recently led Alex Himelfarb, a former clerk of the Privy Council, to lament\u00a0the long-term trend toward austerity.\nAccording to an analysis conducted by the office of the parliamentary budget officer,\u00a0the changes of the Harper era resulted in\u00a0annual federal revenues being reduced by $30 billion.\u00a0For the sake of comparison, the total amount of funding committed to the Canada Child Benefit is currently $24 billion.\nThis was not unintentional. Stephen Harper's Conservatives were quite happy to reduce the federal government's capacity. And, as those numbers show, they were rather successful at it.\nKey to that goal was cutting taxes that a future government would be reluctant to restore\u00a0\u2014 the GST\u00a0in particular. Reducing that tax by two points cut annual federal revenues by $14 billion. But no major party leader has since proposed reversing that cut.\nTrudeau's Liberals campaigned on one specific increase\u00a0\u2014 a new bracket at the top of the income scale that raised taxes on the richest Canadians. After coming to office, they also repealed a handful of the Harper government's tax credits and\u00a0have since followed through on promises to restrict other tax advantages that mostly benefit wealthy households\u00a0\u2014 including income-splitting for couples,\u00a0an exemption for stock options and the use of private corporations. (You might remember the last of those changes\u00a0for the yelling that ensued.)\nThe Trudeau government did, of course, introduce a carbon levy, at least where provincial governments refused to introduce their own. But the revenue from that levy is being directly rebated to individuals and businesses.\nMeanwhile, the GST is still at five per cent, the corporate tax rate is still at 15 per cent and, as the Conservatives promised to do, the small business rate has been reduced to nine per cent. For good measure, the Liberals\u00a0also cut the second income tax bracket from 22 per cent to 20.5 per cent. (And the claim that the current deficit will necessitate future tax increases is\u00a0debatable.)\nBut at 12.4 per cent, the Liberals would end up almost exactly midway between Harper's historic low and the pre-Harper average.\nThat the Trudeau Liberals managed to preside over any increase in federal revenues is something of an accomplishment, given how much easier it is to cut taxes than to raise them. Even Jagmeet Singh's New Democrats aren't (yet?) calling for a dramatic hike.\nThe Conservatives, of course, will continue to condemn any deviation from their historic low. But all change is relative. There's at least as much room to wonder why federal taxes couldn't be higher.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada's economy expanded 0.2% in June despite manufacturing slowdown", "description": "For the second month in a row, Toronto Raptors playoff run helped boost spending to have impact on GDP", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-economy-gdp-june-1.5265447", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5265454.1567169192!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/basketball-nba-gsw-tor.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Aug 30, 2019 8:54 AM ET", "2019-08-30T16:15:31.965Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Statistics Canada reports that Canada's economy expanded for the fourth month in a row in June, as 17 of the 20 industries the data agency tracks expanded\nGDP grew by 0.2 per cent overall, as a 0.2 per cent decline in the goods-producing sector was more than offset by a 0.3 per cent gain in the much larger service sector.\nConstruction, wholesale and retail trade, mining, quarrying and oil and gas, and the finance and insurance industries all grew.\nManufacturing, meanwhile, shrank by 1.4 per cent.\nFor the second month in a row, Statistics Canada reported that the Toronto Raptors' run to the NBA championship had a big enough impact to change the course of the country's economy.\n\"The Raptors' playoff run coincided with the first signs of summer-like weather across many parts of the country, with increases at food services and drinking places ( up 0.5 per cent) and sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores up 3.5 per cent,\" Statistics Canada said.\u00a0\nThe impact on the\u00a0performing arts, spectator sports and heritage institutions industry, meanwhile, wasn't as large in June as it was in May, because most of the Raptors playoff run was in May.

A former lawyer, the Brazilian student began the international transportation and customs program at Toronto's Seneca College in 2019 and found a part-time job in the industry that was helping her pay expenses and save for her tuition.\u00a0\nThen COVID-19 hit.\nCosta's campus closed, classes moved online and she lost her part-time job. She said she doesn't qualify for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and, because she's neither a citizen nor a permanent resident, can't access student loan programs like the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP).\nThis month, the approximately $7,000 bill for her final, three-month semester in Toronto comes due.\n\"I want to finish my school and if I don't have money to pay, I can't,\" she said. \"Now what am I going to do here? I [will] have to go back to Brazil.\"\nIn the past decade, international students \u2014\u00a0typically charged at least double the tuition paid by domestic students \u2014 have become a vital part of Canada's post-secondary system. But with closed campuses and borders threatening new enrolment and schools anticipating significant budget cuts, Canadian universities and colleges are bracing for rough semesters ahead.\u00a0\n\"All universities\u00a0\u2014 like all Canadians \u2014 want to get back to normal as quickly as we can, but some of that is outside our control,\" said Universities Canada president Paul Davidson, whose association represents public and private universities across the country.\nWhat happens with international students is a definite concern, as they represent about 50 per cent, on average, of total tuition revenue, according to Davidson. In its recent international education strategy plan, the federal government reported foreign students contributed an estimated $21.6 billion to Canada's GDP in 2018 and that, between 2014 and 2018, the number of international students studying in Canada increased by 68 per cent.\n\"One of things that people have not noticed over the last decade or so is that governments, both federal and provincial, now fund less than 50 per cent of the cost of higher education,\" Davidson said.\nHe added that the economic impact of international students \u2014 not just tuition fees but also rent, groceries, transportation, entertainment and more \u2014 is as important to Canada as the contributions of industries like softwood lumber, wheat or auto parts.\u00a0\n\"This really matters to communities large and small across the country.\"\nThe loss of these students can be severe. Davidson pointed\u00a0to 2018, when Canada lost a cohort from Saudi Arabia amid a diplomatic dispute. After helping students return home, schools then faced the decision of which classes, labs and other resources to cut, he said, since it was the presence of these students that helped finance those offerings.\nThe federal government has made temporary provisions for foreign students, including exempting those previously approved for a study permit from travel restrictions into Canada, loosening some eligibility restrictions for the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program and allowing them to work more than 20 hours a week if providing essential services during the pandemic.\nCanada remains \"a hot target for international students,\" because of a high-quality education system, welcoming society, overall safety and favourable post-grad work permits,\u00a0Davidson said.\n\"Students very much want to come to Canada. If they can begin their studies online [while still at home], that will make a big difference even if they can't come immediately in September. It will open the doors and get them on the path to completing their studies,\" he said.\nAside from the ongoing work overhauling programs for a multitude of teaching scenarios this fall, many schools are anticipating a different landscape \u2014 especially institutions now used to welcoming students\u00a0from abroad.\nCape Breton University is one of them. In the last few years, it\u00a0has nearly doubled its student population from about 3,000 to 5,500, due to international students studying in programs such as business, hospitality and engineering.\nCBU is rare among Canadian universities in that\u00a065 per cent of its student population hails\u00a0from abroad. At larger schools that attract international students, for instance\u00a0University of British Columbia or Montreal's\u00a0McGill University, that percentage runs closer to 30 per cent of the total student population.\u00a0\n\"In the fall, if we can't run in-person classes at all, if we're only online, I suspect we will have a drop in domestic enrolment,\" said\u00a0Cape Breton University Prof.\u00a0Scott Stewart, who is also president of the Association of Nova Scotia University Teachers and former president of the Cape Breton University Faculty Association.\u00a0\nHe added that he believes there's \"no chance\"\u00a0borders will be opened up for international students.\nIn a recent letter to faculty, CBU officials suggested the school could have a $45-million shortfall because of COVID-19. Even if the figure is closer to $10 million or $20 million, \"it's a terrible hit that can't possibly be dealt with in any way but some fairly substantial job layoffs for faculty, academic support, maintenance, you name it. It would be quite devastating,\" Stewart said from North Sydney, N.S.\nWith many post-secondary institutions located in smaller towns, schools are major employers. Layoffs can be \"destructive not just to the universities themselves, but a huge economic hit for the communities,\" he said.\nStewart is part of a Nova Scotia coalition of faculty unions and student groups now calling for financial support from universities and governments.\nThey want:\nOther Canadian post-secondary faculty groups have similarly called for government aid.\n\"We're asking for universities themselves to accept that they may run deficits this year, just like the federal and provincial governments are doing, municipal governments are doing,\" Stewart said.\nBut it's an ask that could be more difficult for some schools to manage. Grappling with the pandemic this spring has already challenged Sudbury, Ont.'s Laurentian University, said\u00a0president Robert Hach\u00e9.\u00a0\n\"We've had residences that have closed early. We've had to refund fees. We have recreation facilities that are no longer generating revenue. Overall, that has put a strain on our finances,\" he said.\u00a0\nWith still so many unknowns about reopening this fall, school administrators are deep into planning different scenarios: a mix of approaches ranging from online-only learning to in-person sessions with limited numbers of students.\u00a0\nHowever, \"if we have fewer enrolments, we can expect to have fewer sections of each of our courses.\u2026 We may even have to reduce the total number of courses that we offer,\" Hach\u00e9 said.\u00a0\n\"We're working very hard to keep our university as whole as possible and that means maintaining employment levels as high as we possibly can, because we do see coming through the end of this\u2026. At the same, with the revenue shortfalls that we're seeing, we have started to cut back on things like part-time work, contract work,\" he said.\nHowever, the goal for all post-secondary institutions is to ensure safe, secure and flexible learning environments for students, said\u00a0Hach\u00e9, adding\u00a0that\u00a0he and his peers have been in discussion with provincial and federal authorities.\u00a0\n\"What can [governments] do to support us in encouraging students to come, to stay in school, to come back to school this fall? I think that's really what it's all about: how we can maintain the registrations, because really this is for the future of the province \u2014 for the future of the country \u2014 to have a strong population of university graduates.\"\n"}, {"author": "Peter Armstrong", "title": "Why are stock markets soaring amid so much uncertainty?", "description": "Despite gloomy forecasts and slow growth, it doesn't take much to spur investors", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-market-trump-uncertainty-1.5347006", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4795916.1535029348!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/frontpagenationalbullmarket.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 05, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-11-05T09:00:00.792Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "All three major U.S. stock market indexes hit record levels to start the week. Fuelled by trade optimism, strong corporate earnings and continued job growth, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hit new all-time highs.\nU.S. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to tout the records, saying: \"Stock Market hits RECORD HIGH. Spend your money well!\"\nBut there's something of a paradox at play. In spite of Trump's enthusiasm, most forecasts remain gloomy. Uncertainty still dominates the global landscape. Global growth has slowed.\nYet\u00a0it doesn't seem to take much more than a hint of good news to spur investors.\nFor example, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had said early on Monday that trade talks with China have \"come very far along.\"\u00a0It was\u00a0a vague statement and made no allusion that anything is final. It was\u00a0also not the first time investors have heard that sort of thing from either the U.S. administration or the Chinese. Still, that sliver of positivity helped drive\u00a0up markets around the world.\u00a0\n\"It is fascinating to see equity investors, like Pavlov's dog, respond over and over again to the same piece of news,\" David\u00a0Rosenberg, chief economist at the investment firm Gluskin Sheff\u00a0wrote in a letter to clients.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, one of the biggest forces in global economics right now is uncertainty \u2014 over the state of the U.S.-China trade war, over a slowing global economy. China recently posted its lowest\u00a0quarterly growth in 26 years. Europe is struggling too.\u00a0And some of the gloomiest signals are coming from bond markets around the world.\nBank of Nova Scotia's deputy chief economist Brett House says \"erratic policy from the White House\" has weighed on growth. So,\u00a0even a small step toward removing some of that uncertainty, like Ross's comment about China,\u00a0is bound to drive up stocks.\n\"While it doesn't roll back\u00a0much of the damage that's been done,\" he says. \"It takes some of the uncertainty on the forward outlook away.\"\nHouse says all those unknowns have\u00a0shaved as much as 0.75 per cent off U.S. GDP growth.\u00a0\nAnd it's weighed on stock market returns as well. The Dow and the S&P have made notorious\u00a0gains since Trump won the presidency. It's part of the longest bull run in history. But those gains levelled off over the past two years. At the beginning of October, the S&P stood about where it had in January\u00a02018. The more recent highs have broken through that plateau, but there just doesn't seem to be as much wind in the sails of optimism any more.\nRosenberg points out that indexes like the Dow and the S&P which trade in larger, more globally oriented companies are making gains. But indexes that cater to smaller companies aren't doing as well.\nRosenberg mused whether those bigger companies are doing better because they benefit from a perception of a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions, while indexes more tied to the domestic U.S. economy aren't gaining nearly as much.\u00a0He says the Russel\u00a02000 is still nine per cent\u00a0off its all-time high.\n\"The [smaller companies]\u00a0derive 79% of their revenue from the U.S. economy,\" he wrote. \"Q4 GDP estimates now show a US economy sputtering\u00a0and catching down\u00a0to the rest of the world.\"\nThe other major factor here is the cost of money.\u00a0\n\"The vast majority of the worlds' major central banks [are]\u00a0lowering interest rates and making money even cheaper,\" said House, at Scotiabank.\u00a0\"That provides a further lift to real economic activity\"\nBut, House adds, it also means the alternative to investing in\u00a0stocks doesn't\u00a0look terribly attractive to investors.\nUsually, the bond market acts as a sort of safe haven for investors worried about risk. In North America, bond yields are at historically low levels. Worldwide, the bond market is increasingly dominated by bonds with a negative yield. Instead of paying investors a small amount, negative yielding bonds actually charge investors for the privilege of investing.\u00a0\nRight now the amount of bonds with a negative yield has ballooned to a record $15 trillion worldwide. That's a whole lot of money very worried about the future.\nSo stock markets and bond markets are telling us dramatically different things about the economy right now. There's nothing inherently wrong with them sending different signals. But they won't remain at odds for ever. Eventually, either the optimistic stock market or the deeply troubled bond market will be proven right.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Trevor Tombe", "title": "For Alberta, the day of fiscal reckoning has arrived", "description": "Province\u2019s economy and budget can recover, but it will require hard choices", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/road-ahead-opinion-trevor-tombe-alberta-fiscal-reckoning-1.5546481", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5509857.1588024880!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/premier-jason-kenney-at-a-covid-19-newser-march-18-2020.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 28, 2020 5:00 AM MT", "2020-04-28T11:00:00.570Z"], "source": null, "content": "This column is an opinion from Trevor Tombe, an associate professor of economics at the University of Calgary.\nIn his televised address on April 7, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney did not mince words: Alberta is \"facing not one crisis, but three.\"\nThe health and economic shocks from COVID-19 are massive, but they are shared by many around the globe. The collapse of oil prices, however, presents a third crisis that is partly of our own making.\n\"Alberta's budget deficit this year may triple from $7 billion to almost $20 billion,\" the premier said, adding that we will soon face \"a great fiscal reckoning.\"\nThis isn't an exaggeration.\nWhile there remains a uniquely high degree of uncertainty right now, and both the premier's statement and my high-level analysis in this article should be seen in that light, there is no getting around the significant challenge that awaits.\nBut there are options. Alberta's economy and our budget can recover, but it will require hard choices and cross-party compromises that we too often resist.\nFirst, we should appreciate our current predicament. A $20-billion deficit is plausible.\nConsider three major sources of Alberta government revenue:\nIncome and Other Taxes: We were hoping for $23 billion this year. But a contracting economy and income losses from low oil prices together suggests nominal GDP may fall by 15 to 20 per cent. This means lower revenues \u2014 possibly $4 billion lower.\nInvestment Income: Alberta has large savings that generate returns. We were hoping for $2.6 billion this year, but\u00a0as anyone who has checked their RRSP recently knows, we're more likely to lose money this year. During the financial crisis we lost $1.9 billion. Today, losing $1 billion is possible, which would lower government revenue by $3- to $4-billion relative to our previous estimates. (Of course, how the market will perform\u00a0over the coming months is not known, and the government might book recent losses in 2019/20 instead.)\nResource Revenues: Alberta chooses to rely heavily on resource revenues to fund public services. And when energy prices fall, so do revenues. The government was hoping oil would fetch $58 per barrel this year; today it's less than $20. So instead of the $5.1 billion we were hoping for, we might see $2 billion (or less).\nWe could keep going, but these three items alone put us on track for a revenue hit of $11 billion. Add additional health-care spending of at least $500 million (possibly more) and other costs, and we're almost at a $20 billion deficit already, up from the original $6.8 billion.\nCombined with borrowing for capital projects and a smaller economy, we could be looking at a 20 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio \u2014 double our current level.\nThis short-term challenge is manageable, to be sure, and Alberta would remain the lowest-debt province.\u00a0\nThe trouble is, these fiscal challenges will continue for many years.\nOil prices are not projected to bounce back anytime soon.\nCurrent futures prices are roughly $20 to $30 per barrel lower than government forecasts by 2022-23. And to balance the books that year, the government was hoping for $8.5 billion in resource revenues. This is no longer in the cards. Not even close.\nBudget 2020 provides some clues of how bad it might be.\nThe budget reported \"high\" and \"low\" economic scenarios for 2022-23 that, roughly, corresponded to a $20 per barrel swing in oil prices (see page 73 of the budget). Such a swing may lower income tax and resource revenues by nearly $9 billion, they report.\u00a0\nThe shock we're facing today is slightly larger, so instead of a modest surplus by 2022, we may see a deficit of more than $9 billion.\nLet that sink in. After four years of significant spending restraint, we're on track for a larger deficit than the one we started with.\nThis is our fiscal reckoning. But, luckily, there are options.\nLet's start with the government's current policy: a freeze in program spending.\nWithout going into details, I updated\u00a0my own model of Alberta's budget to reflect most of what we know today from publicly available sources and display the results below.\nThe government's current fiscal policy suggests we'll balance four years later than planned: 2026 instead of 2022.\nThis is less than ideal.\u00a0\nAlberta would see $140 billion in taxpayer-supported debt, with interest costs of nearly $6 billion per year \u2014 or roughly triple our current amount. And, since prices and population will continue to grow, a freeze is effectively a nearly 30 per cent reduction in the inflation-adjusted per person level of spending. This would require a deeper reinvention of public services and is roughly double the government's previously planned restraint.\nBut there is\u00a0another side to the budget: Revenue.\nConsider a broad-based and efficient source of revenue like the sales tax. Alberta already has one, of course: it's called the GST. Except the federal government gets all of the revenue.\nAlberta could, if it wanted, raise the GST from its current five per cent and keep the incremental revenue (this is known as a harmonized sales tax, or \"HST\").\u00a0\nIf, starting next year, Alberta gradually phased in a four-point increase to the GST (which would be lower than any other province), then we'd be on track to balance the books by 2024. That would mean only two additional years of frozen spending, and would avoid roughly $20 billion in additional debt.\u00a0\nOf course, there are other revenue options.\nSome might prefer higher income taxes. Adding one point to all income tax brackets could add around $1.5 billion to revenues.\nSome might prefer pausing the corporate tax cut. This would add around $500 million.\nOthers might suggest Alberta take back carbon tax revenues from Ottawa. Once it reaches $50 per tonne, that would be $2.2 billion to Alberta \u2014 and if we kept rebates to lower income households, it might net $1.5 billion.\nWhatever the tool, to balance by 2024 with frozen spending requires we raise total revenue by roughly eight per cent. And if, after 2022, we allow spending to keep pace with population and inflation, revenue would have to rise by 15 per cent.\nEven with such increases, Alberta would still enjoy the lowest taxes in the country \u2014 by an extremely wide margin \u2014 but it would be challenging nonetheless.\nAll provinces are facing revenue shortfalls and spending pressures. And Ottawa will likely offer support. But it matters less than you might think.\nOttawa could cover some (or even most) of the direct COVID-19 related expenditures by extending the disaster assistance program to cover pandemics (it currently does not). If Canada supported provinces with funding in line with what the United States delivered for states, for example, Alberta might see over $2.5 billion this year.\nOttawa could also cover a share of revenue declines through a reformed Fiscal Stabilization Program (which Alberta has long demanded). If it fully acceded to Alberta's request for reform, Alberta might see $3 billion more this year.\nThere's a strong case to be made for such support, since it's cheaper and easier for the federal government to borrow and smooth out shocks like COVID-19 than it is for provinces. There are also many options for reform, from removing the current cap on payments to more fundamental reform.\u00a0\nBut even though these dollar amounts are large, and helpful for provincial balance sheets, such federal support would barely nudge Alberta's daunting longer-term trajectory.\nAlberta's fiscal reckoning is of our own making. We cannot look to Ottawa to fix it.\nThere are real political challenges with spending restraint and new taxes, to be sure. And there's no easy option. But cross-party compromise and a whole-of-budget approach to tackling this challenge is the best way forward.\nGovernment and opposition parties must both re-evaluate their approach to fiscal policy. And Albertans must give them space to do so.\u00a0\nAfter the dust from the health crisis settles, we'll need to have an open and honest discussion about our budget and our future. Our fiscal reckoning may look bleak, but we have options. We just need to choose wisely from among them.\nThis column is an opinion.

Also Wednesday, TD issued a new forecast for the Canadian economy, a 4.2 per cent retraction. RBC's latest forecast came on Tuesday, calling for a 2.5 per cent drop in Canada's GDP.\u00a0\nHere's the\u00a0problem for Ontario's budget: its revenue predictions are already based on outdated forecasts.\u00a0\nSome of the most optimistic assumptions in the fiscal plan are that COVID-19 will do relatively little to reduce government revenues in the coming year, compared with 2019-20.\nThe fiscal update forecasts a 0.8 per cent drop in personal income tax revenues, meaning just $300 million less in provincial coffers, despite the widespread layoffs announced in the past few weeks.\nThe government is predicting a 1.3 per cent drop in corporate tax revenue, just a $200 million hit to the treasury.\u00a0\nIf the economy does contract in 2020, those tax revenues could be billions less, making the deficit far higher than the $20 billion already forecast.\u00a0\nOntario is clearly hoping the economic hit from COVID-19 will be a very short, albeit sharp, shock, to be followed by a big rebound as non-essential businesses fire up again, driven by pent-up demand from consumers freed from the constraints of social distancing.\u00a0\nThere is also reason to believe that measures from the Bank of Canada, as well as Ottawa's $107\u00a0billion COVID-19 rescue package, will keep the bottom from falling out.\u00a0\nFinally, Ontario does have a strong, diversified economy when it isn't locked down by a virus, and it is well positioned to bounce back once the worst of the pandemic\u00a0is over. \u00a0\nBut the impact on provincial finances won't be clear for months. In the next two years, it will be fascinating to watch how the PC government deals with running a deficit that is far larger than Doug Ford likely ever dreamed would exist even under a spendthrift Liberal government.\u00a0\nOntario 2020-21 spending plan highlights\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/a-month-after-dorian-the-bahamas-still-needs-aid-but-officials-say-it-needs-tourists-even-more-1.5309524", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani", "title": "Trade war darkens economic forecasts for Canada", "description": "National Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut growth forecasts for 2019", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-gdp-banks-growth-1.5161849", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3209062.1518187080!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canada.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 04, 2019 4:21 PM ET", "2019-06-04T20:21:11.613Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Two big banks cut Canada's growth forecasts on rising trade tensions\u00a0this week, and others could follow suit if the new U.S. tariffs against Mexico are implemented next week.\nEconomists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch revised Canada's growth forecast from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent for this year, and made an even bigger cut to their growth estimate\u00a0for\u00a0next year from 1.8 per cent to 1.3 per cent.\n\"We had already marked downside risks to our GDP growth forecast for 2019 given lower oil prices and risks of trade war escalation,\" economists said in a note on Tuesday.\n\"With the U.S. threat of tariffs to Mexico, trade wars have effectively escalated, and uncertainty over global trade increases, which is negative for Canadian investment and exports.\"\nU.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed\u00a0in a news conference in London on Tuesday that he would likely order new tariffs on Mexican exports\u00a0next Monday, because of\u00a0a high number of Mexican migrants\u00a0entering the U.S.\nThe economists also said they believe that it is\u00a0now \"unlikely\" that the new trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico will be approved this year, because of the new tariffs.\n\"In our new numbers we are using our estimate that a 10 per cent\u00a0drop in Canadian exports would reduce Canada's GDP by 210 basis points,\" the report\u00a0said.\u00a0\n\"Strong domestic demand in the first quarter\u00a0shows that there is some upside risk to our forecasts.

But the escalation of the trade war between the U.S. and China presents new risks.\n\"The U.S.-China trade war can only be beneficial to Canada if it doesn't escalate beyond a certain point,\" said Rangasamy in a note.\n\"Such a large exposure to one trade partner (i.e. the U.S.) makes Canadian exporters more vulnerable to U.S. economic cycles \u2026The resulting hit to commodity prices and negative spillovers on the U.S. economy, won't be good for Canada.\"\nCanada's economy grew at annualized pace of\u00a00.4 per cent in the first three months\u00a0of this year \u2014\u00a0falling below expectations, and just slightly above the 0.3 per cent growth in the previous quarter. They were the country's weakest back-to-back quarters of growth since 2015.\nExport volumes dropped one per cent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0marking for their first quarterly decrease since 2017.\nMeanwhile, other Canadian banks are also keeping a close eye on developments on the global trade front as they review their forecasts.\nDoug\u00a0Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the bank's growth forecast for Canada is already at the lower end of market consensus at 1.4 per cent, but if U.S. tariffs on Mexico are imposed next week, they are set to \"retool\" the entire forecast.\nBrian DePratto, senior economist at TD Economics, said the bank was in the middle of reviewing its growth forecasts, and will publish the outlook next week.\n\"While I can't say too much about specific numbers this early in the process, certainly developments of late suggest the risks tilt towards less growth than might have otherwise been the case,\" said DePratto.\nMeanwhile, Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, also\u00a0said the bank was reviewing its North American forecasts as global risks like the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit moved closer to materializing in May.\n\"For a small open economy like Canada, these situations could be significant either via direct trading links, or indirectly through financial markets and confidence,\" said Mendes.\u00a0\"The increased uncertainty regarding these global risks likely more than offsets any positives from the removal of U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.\"\nHowever, he added that the latest economic data doesn't look \"particularly weak\" with growth likely to rebound in the second quarter from the weak start to the year.\n\"At this point, central bankers are satisfied staying on the sidelines. However, should the data deteriorate more than they expect, don't be surprised if they jump into the game and pull the trigger on rate cuts,\" Mendes said.\n\"Monetary policymakers are keenly aware that they lack downside room to offset a full recession, so are likely to err\u00a0on the side of providing too much stimulus rather than too little.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Sonia Furstenau announces she's running for leader of B.C.

But, as a group, the board was comfortable describing its 2019 forecast for Alberta as a \"mild recession,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"The whole year is a slight contraction and so, yes, we would define that as a recession.\"\nConstruction and drilling will be \"hit the hardest\" this year, the report says, with expected declines of 10.4 per cent and 30.3 per cent, respectively.\n\"Both declines are in large part due to the position of companies in the oil and gas sector regarding the uncertainty regarding pipelines,\" it adds.\nIn particular, the report highlights the latest obstacle for the Enbridge Line 3 pipeline. In June, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled that state regulators must conduct a further review of the project because its environmental impact statement didn't address the possibility of an oil spill into the Lake Superior watershed.\nThe \"only chance of additional capacity being built,\" the report says, depends on whether a $3.7-billion government rail contract \"is picked up by the private sector.\"\u00a0\nThe previous NDP government contracted CP and CN Rail to move crude by rail, in the absence of pipeline expansion, but the new UCP government has cancelled those deals and is working to move them to the private sector.\u00a0\nIf there's a silver lining to the province's economic forecast, the Conference Board says job growth will continue in 2019, albeit at a subdued pace.\n\"Labour markets will feel the impact of the contraction in real GDP growth, but there will still be job creation,\" the report says.\nThat's due in part to the construction of new petrochemical complexes, which the report says will add \"fire power to Alberta's economic engine despite its energy sector being clouded with uncertainty.\"\nBecause of job-cutting in the oil and gas sector during the 2015-16 recession, the Conference Board notes, many major companies are now lean and highly productive.\n\"With much of the turmoil concentrated in the energy sector,\u00a0where output per worker has sky-rocketed in recent years ... the number of layoffs in the energy sector [in 2019] will not be significant.\"\nOverall, Antunes expects little change in the province's unemployment rate through the end of 2019.\n\"We have seen a bit of a rebound in some areas in the province that has allowed, essentially, employment to stabilize,\" he said.\nThe report forecasts that Alberta's economy will return to growth in 2020, with a two per cent expansion of GDP. That's down from a forecast of 2.7 per cent in its Spring Outlook of three months earlier.\nNationally, the latest report forecasts the Canadian economy will grow by 1.4 per cent this year and 1.8 per cent in 2020.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U.S. Federal Reserve leaves rates near zero as COVID-19 savages U.S. economy", "description": "Economists forecast sharpest downturn in U.S. history this quarter", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fed-renew-pledge-1.5548953", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5549076.1588173017!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-economy.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 29, 2020 12:00 PM ET", "2020-04-29T21:16:53.765Z"], "source": null, "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve, which has pumped\u00a0trillions in emergency funding into U.S. financial markets to\u00a0stem the damage from the coronavirus pandemic, left interest rates near zero and\u00a0repeated a vow to do what it takes to shore up the economy.\u00a0\nThe central bank says the pandemic will \"weigh heavily\" on\u00a0the near-term outlook and poses \"considerable risks\" for the\u00a0medium term.\n\"The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of\u00a0tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time,\u00a0thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability\u00a0goals,\" the Fed said in a statement following a two-day policy meeting held via video conference.\nEarlier Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported the economy contracted in the first quarter at its sharpest\u00a0pace since the Great Recession, ending the longest economic\u00a0expansion in the nation's history.\nThat reflects a plunge in economic\u00a0activity in the last two weeks of March, which saw millions of\u00a0Americans seeking unemployment benefits.\nThe rapid decline in\u00a0GDP has\u00a0left economists bracing for a\u00a0record slump in output in the second quarter.\n\"If the economy fell this hard in the first quarter, with\u00a0less than a month of pandemic lockdown for most states, don't\u00a0ask how far it will crater in the second quarter, because it is\u00a0going to be a complete disaster,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief\u00a0economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in New York.\nPlunging consumer spending on the back of widespread\u00a0stay-at-home orders to curb the spread of the virus helped drive\u00a0a 4.8 per cent\u00a0decline on an annualized basis in first-quarter gross\u00a0domestic product.

India has not \"flattened the curve\" in the past three and a half weeks, with cases rising from around 600\u00a0to more than 16,000 in that time.\nThe number of new cases\u00a0continues to go up, as does the number of deaths, which rose from\u00a013 on March 25 to more than 520 currently.\nWhile over half the cases are in the\u00a0cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Indore and Bhopal, testing has shown that COVID-19 is present in almost all of India's 28 states and eight union territories.\u00a0\n\"The three-week lockdown was supposed to buy the government time to ramp up testing, increase surveillance and contact tracing, acquire PPE (personal protective equipment) kits in requisite numbers for frontline workers, train health personnel, prepare hospitals to receive COVID-19 patients, and draw up a comprehensive plan for controlling the spread of the virus,\" said Anant Bhan, a researcher in global health, bioethics and health policy.\u00a0\n\"There have been pockets of containment, but there is no indication that authorities have used this three-week window to address the big picture.\"\nThe Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which has been overseeing testing protocols and pandemic-related policy, did not respond to questions from CBC News.\nThe first COVID-19 case was reported in India on Jan. 30 in a student who returned to her home in Kerala from Wuhan, China, but\u00a0as late as March 13, a day after India's first coronavirus death and two days after the WHO declared a pandemic,\u00a0the government said the virus was not a\u00a0health emergency.\u00a0\nEleven days later, as deaths rose in parts of Europe and North America, Modi announced he was locking down the country.\n\"It was like taking a sledgehammer to the problem, with no clear explanation,\u00a0plan or a strategy to exit,\" said Vikram Patel, professor for global health at Harvard Medical School, who is currently under lockdown in the tiny western Indian state of Goa.\u00a0\n\"These three weeks have been completely wasted because in the absence of a systematic testing protocol across the nation, we do not have an understanding of the spread \u2026 and we have no way of evaluating the lockdown.\"\nNevertheless, as cases rise in the world's most densely populated country, a lockdown continues to be the favoured tool for federal and state governments.\u00a0\nA\u00a0day before\u00a0Modi's announcement, Maharashtra, the state with the largest number of cases, said it would\u00a0extend the lockdown until April 30 since \"there has been no reduction in cases.\"\u00a0\nMaharashtra has reported more than 3,600 cases so far, including more than 2,100 in Mumbai, a densely packed metropolis and the country's financial capital.\nThe eastern Indian state of Odisha, an overwhelmingly rural region that has reported just 60 cases and one death, has adopted the same approach, announcing a similar extension last week.\u00a0\n\"The one-size-fit-all lockdown has brought untold misery and suffering to millions of farmers, migrant labourers, daily wagers and business owners,\" opposition MP Rahul Gandhi tweeted a day before Modi\u00a0extended the lockdwon.\n\"It needs a 'smart' upgrade, using mass testing to isolate virus hotspots and allowing businesses in other areas to gradually reopen.\"\nThe government's plan to allow some parts of the economy to\u00a0reopen\u00a0in areas without COVID-19 outbreaks\u00a0starting Monday is an attempt to do that.\nThe government has\u00a0done a good job of raising public awareness of\u00a0COVID-19, says Partho Sarothi Ray, a molecular biologist at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, but has been slow to ramp\u00a0up testing.\nAbout\u00a0386,000 people have been tested in India so far, the ICMR said Sunday (with rates\u00a0varying\u00a0widely among states). That is about 280 tests for every million people \u2014 among the lowest rates in the world.\u00a0\nThe government has set the price of the test at 4,500 rupees (around $82) for all but the poor who have enrolled in a government health insurance scheme.\u00a0\n\"4,500 rupees is expensive,\" said Ray. \"And the test need not cost more than 800 rupees. Given there is a demand globally for testing kits, we also need to develop our own indigenous testing capacity.\"\nOn Friday, the southern Indian state of Karnataka cut the price by half to 2,250 rupees.\u00a0\nAn order for 650,000 test kits placed in late March by Indian authorities with China was finally dispatched on Thursday, according to Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndiaFightsCoronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IndiaFightsCoronavirus</a> A total of 650,000 kits, including Rapid Antibody Tests and RNA Extraction Kits have been despatched early today from Guangzhou Airport to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/India?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#India</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/2019nCoV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#2019nCoV</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StayHomeSaveLives?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StayHomeSaveLives</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MEAIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MEAIndia</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HarshShringla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@HarshShringla</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrSJaishankar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DrSJaishankar</a>\nEarlier this week, Dr. R.R. Gangakhedkar of the ICMR said the country had enough\u00a0kits \"for six weeks\" but did not specify how many.\u00a0\n\"We have issued detailed protocols for who should get tested,\" he said at a briefing Tuesday.\u00a0\"I cannot say why more people are not getting tested.\"\u00a0\nNeither the prime minister nor the health minister\u00a0has held a press conference since the lockdown began, but in daily briefings, Health Ministry officials have been optimistic, even insisting that the country is \"over-prepared\" when it comes, for example, to available PPE and hospital beds.\nIn his TV address this week, Modi struck a similar tone. \"The path that India has taken within our limited resources has become a topic of discussion in the entire world today,\" he said.\nBut the specifics of a nationwide policy to tackle the virus remain elusive, Patel says.\u00a0\nWhen asked, for example, why the Health Ministry has not made public the\u00a0list of dedicated hospitals for treating COVID-19 cases, ministry official Lav Agarwal said, \"We do not want people to unnecessarily feel panic and flood those hospitals.\"\u00a0\nHe said anyone with symptoms should call official helplines.\nOfficials have also not\u00a0disclosed how many health workers have been infected even amid reports\u00a0of doctors and nurses contracting the virus and some dying from it, and at least one private hospital having to be sealed off because of an outbreak among staff.\u00a0\nOn Wednesday, the United Nurses Association, one of the largest nurses' unions in the country, petitioned the Supreme Court, saying the government had not\u00a0addressed the risks faced by frontline workers.\u00a0\nThe government told the court it would set up a helpline and respond to any grievance raised by a nurse within two hours.\u00a0\n\"When the government says there is adequate PPE, they are perhaps limiting themselves to the COVID-19 dedicated hospitals, What about the rest?\" Joldin Francis, the general secretary of the union's Delhi branch, told CBC.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We have seen outbreaks in other hospitals. In the absence of mass testing, we do not know which patient might be carrying the virus, and we are working in conditions of great risk.\"\u00a0\nOne state that seems to have used testing effectively to contain the spread is Kerala.\u00a0\nThe coastal state of 35 million on the southern tip of India has the best human development indices and public health infrastructure in the country. As soon as its first case of COVID-19 was detected on Jan. 30, the state government moved swiftly to test and contact trace, set up quarantine facilities and institute containment measures in areas reporting multiple cases.\u00a0\nThe health measures have been backed by a welfare safety net, including financial support, food rations, community kitchens and special outreach for migrant labourers.\u00a0\nKerala's approach seems to be working, with the number of active cases coming down, and the disease curve starting to flatten, the state's finance minister, Thomas Isaac, tweeted this week.\u00a0\nCOVID-19 curve of Kerala has started to flatten. The active cases for the last one week has declined.

Hundreds of thousands of people die annually of preventable diseases, such as tuberculosis and malnutrition.\u00a0\n\"Malnutrition is a significant co-morbidity for the coronavirus. If the virus spreads to the poor, or to populations such as Adivasi (indigenous communities) areas, we will have a public health disaster on our hands,\" said Ray.\u00a0\nHe urged authorities to ramp up testing.\n\"The more you test, the more lives you will save, and the sooner you will bring the country out of the lockdown.\"\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Drew Anderson", "title": "Alberta government looking at low interest credit for struggling oil and gas companies", "description": "Jason Kenney says he's spoken with federal government about contributing funds", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/ucp-government-credit-low-interest-oil-gas-companies-1.5495774", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5493784.1583944185!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/kenney-calgary-airport-march-11.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 12, 2020 3:07 PM MT", "2020-03-12T21:07:55.847Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Alberta Premier Jason Kenney says his government is examining the possibility\u00a0of providing credit to cash-strapped oil and gas companies.\u00a0\n\"We are potentially looking at setting up a credit facility that would allow for access to credit at lower rates of interest for highly distressed companies,\" he said.\nKenney made the comment Thursday in Ottawa, where he was supposed to take part in the first ministers conference.

Drug costs are likely to go up because new medicines will be protected from generic competition for 10 years, instead of the eight under the old deal. Copyright will now extend for 70 years from the content creator's death, up from 50, meaning increased licensing costs for users.\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean that Canada got nothing in return. The all-important Chapter 19 dispute resolution mechanism\u00a0remains part of the new agreement;\u00a0the language of Canada's existing cultural exemption is preserved;\u00a0and the government remains free to block access to foreign digital content, or to create policies that support and benefit Canadian creators\u00a0\u2014 all things the Americans had been determined to do away with.\nAnd there is new language recognizing the treaty rights of Indigenous people\u00a0and the government's duty to fulfil its legal obligations toward\u00a0them \u2014 even if conflicts with the trade deal.\u00a0\nIt was less of a rout\u00a0than a hard-fought draw, says\u00a0Dan Ciuriak, lead author of the C.D Howe study.\n\"My conclusion is that Canada pushed back as hard as possible against a much larger and more ruthless opponent,\" he said. \"We had a very experienced and effective team.\"\nThe proof of competency can be found in comparing the outcome of CUSMA and a scenario in which NAFTA was allowed to die, said\u00a0Ciuriak, a former deputy chief economist for the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade\u00a0who now runs an Ottawa consultancy that specializes in modelling the effects of trade deals.\nThe hit to the Americans is pretty much the same either way:\u00a0A \u20130.1\u00a0per cent shrinking of their GDP.\nTo Ciuriak, that suggests\u00a0the U.S. agreed to deal that was basically a wash for them, even with the Canadian concessions. And definitely something less than the complete NAFTA overhaul Trump had promised.\nAnd while the predicted damage to the Canadian economy sounds large, Ciuriak said\u00a0it's the equivalent of about a single quarter of growth.\n(In July, the Bank of Canada updated its forecast for real GDP growth, to\u00a01.3 per cent for 2019\u00a0and about two per cent in both 2020 and 2021, citing escalating\u00a0trade conflicts as the biggest risk facing the Canadian and global economies.)\nIn Ciuriak's assessment, Trump's \"arbitrary unilateralism\" made the CUSMA negotiations less about gains\u00a0and more of an exercise in \"cost minimization\" for Canada.\nAnd he's slightly perplexed that the Conservatives are citing his work in their attempts to paint the deal as a failure.\n\"Scheer's interpretation of our study is not an accurate one,\" he said.\nThe Verdict: \nFalse, as\u00a0Scheer is basing his claim entirely on one study, which doesn't say what he says it does.\nSources: Andrew Scheer;\u00a0Quantifying CUSMA: The Economic Consequences of the New North American Trade Regime, the C.D.

Now Canadians are paying for his mistakes. <a href=\"https://t.co/wofCYDL0l8\">pic.twitter.com/wofCYDL0l8</a>\nWhat the economic think-tank actually predicts via its modelling is that the real GDPs of the U.S. and Mexico will shrink by 0.1\u00a0per cent and 0.79 per cent\u00a0respectively\u00a0due to the new deal, with an associated welfare loss of almost $15 billion US for Mexico\u00a0and $17.4 billion for the much larger American economy.\nThe\u00a0three-way drop is attributed to \"inefficiencies,\" like more restrictive rules of origin for vehicles that have been baked into Donald Trump's NAFTA 2.0.\nScheer is correct in saying that Canada made some important concessions at the bargaining table: The Americans are getting more access to our dairy, egg and other protected agricultural markets. Drug costs are likely to go up because new medicines will be protected from generic competition for 10 years, instead of the eight under the old deal. Copyright will now extend for 70 years from the content creator's death, up from 50, meaning increased licensing costs for users.\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean that Canada got nothing in return. The all-important Chapter 19 dispute resolution mechanism\u00a0remains part of the new agreement;\u00a0the language of Canada's existing cultural exemption is preserved;\u00a0and the government remains free to block access to foreign digital content, or to create policies that support and benefit Canadian creators\u00a0\u2014 all things the Americans had been determined to do away with.\nAnd there is new language recognizing the treaty rights of Indigenous people\u00a0and the government's duty to fulfil its legal obligations toward\u00a0them \u2014 even if conflicts with the trade deal.\u00a0\nIt was less of a rout\u00a0than a hard-fought draw, says\u00a0Dan Ciuriak, lead author of the C.D Howe study.\n\"My conclusion is that Canada pushed back as hard as possible against a much larger and more ruthless opponent,\" he said. \"We had a very experienced and effective team.\"\nThe proof of competency can be found in comparing the outcome of CUSMA and a scenario in which NAFTA was allowed to die, said\u00a0Ciuriak, a former deputy chief economist for the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade\u00a0who now runs an Ottawa consultancy that specializes in modelling the effects of trade deals.\nThe hit to the Americans is pretty much the same either way:\u00a0A \u20130.1\u00a0per cent shrinking of their GDP.\nTo Ciuriak, that suggests\u00a0the U.S. agreed to deal that was basically a wash for them, even with the Canadian concessions. And definitely something less than the complete NAFTA overhaul Trump had promised.\nAnd while the predicted damage to the Canadian economy sounds large, Ciuriak said\u00a0it's the equivalent of about a single quarter of growth.\n(In July, the Bank of Canada updated its forecast for real GDP growth, to\u00a01.3 per cent for 2019\u00a0and about two per cent in both 2020 and 2021, citing escalating\u00a0trade conflicts as the biggest risk facing the Canadian and global economies.)\nIn Ciuriak's assessment, Trump's \"arbitrary unilateralism\" made the CUSMA negotiations less about gains\u00a0and more of an exercise in \"cost minimization\" for Canada.\nAnd he's slightly perplexed that the Conservatives are citing his work in their attempts to paint the deal as a failure.\n\"Scheer's interpretation of our study is not an accurate one,\" he said.\nThe Verdict: \nFalse, as\u00a0Scheer is basing his claim entirely on one study, which doesn't say what he says it does.\nSources: Andrew Scheer;\u00a0Quantifying CUSMA: The Economic Consequences of the New North American Trade Regime, the C.D.

It is also something of a warning to Canadians considering burying themselves in long-term debt that cannot be easily shucked off.\nThe trigger for that worst case is simply a more-intense bout of\u00a0the current drag on\u00a0the global, American and Canadian economies, said Poloz. Effectively, he said, the problem is uncertainty over global trade relations, which has been paralyzing businesses that would otherwise have invested and expanded their output.\nRather than outlining the chances of gloom, Powell seemed bent on encouraging Americans to spend and businesses to invest, pointing to recent signs of improving U.S.-China trade relations and the defusing of a disruptive no-deal Brexit. While they are positive signs, he said, any real effect on business investment would only come after a long delay.\nThough it may follow the Fed's rate cuts in the future, the reason the Bank of Canada is not lowering rates right now is twofold.\nNo. 1 is that despite the real damage that has already been done to the global economy following Donald Trump's hostile trade-negotiating strategy, the Canadian economy largely remains\u00a0resilient.\nThat resilience is founded on the dual pillars of consumer spending and real estate prices, which, in turn, are being held up by record Canadian job and wage growth and a population boosted by a constant\u00a0drip of new immigrants.\nThe second reason for not cutting rates\u00a0is that with confidence strong and Canadian inflation on target at the bank's two per cent level, the economy remains close to full capacity.\nPoloz worries that lowering the price of lending at this stage\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a rate cut Powell referred to as \"insurance\" against a downturn \u2014\u00a0could spur a new round of Canadian borrowing and mortgage-funded bidding wars at\u00a0the wrong time.\n\"Such insurance may come at a cost in the form of higher financial vulnerabilities and possible consequences for the economy and inflation in the future,\" Poloz told reporters.\nWhile\u00a0the U.S. also boasts strong wages, even lower unemployment and a booming\u00a0consumer sector, one of Powell's biggest worries for the American\u00a0economy is inflation that has remained\u00a0below the two per cent target.\nThe worry in the U.S. is that people will begin expecting lower and lower rates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something Powell promises to resist.\nIn fact, the U.S. central banker gave broad hints he will be revealing mysterious new plans\u00a0by the middle of next year to help push price rises up to the target range, though he didn't elaborate.\nSomething that deputy\u00a0Wilkins\u00a0raised \u2014\u00a0and Powell did not \u2014 was the widely held belief that monetary policy has run out of power to fix the economy. Like many others around the world, she observed it is possible\u00a0fiscal spending could do much more, without stimulating a\u00a0frenzy of\u00a0borrowing.\nAnd while Poloz\u00a0was willing to face the possibility that things may get worse, in observing the advantages of having relatively strong economy in a troubled world, he could have been speaking for both Canada and the U.S.\n\"We are not immune to these\u00a0global developments, but we think we're in a good position to cope with what comes our way,\" said Poloz. \"Healthy and fit people can still get sick, but they recover more quickly.\"\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Robson Fletcher", "title": "Alberta ended 2019 with more job losses and 'mild recession': reports", "description": "Conference Board says province should return to economic growth in 2020 and 2021 ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-conference-board-2020-winter-and-seph-data-1.5478183", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4414250.1511373966!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/oil-consumer-economy.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 27, 2020 11:30 AM MT", "2020-02-27T22:34:18.233Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Alberta's economy ended 2019 on a sour note, according to two reports released Thursday.\nStatistics Canada said the number of payroll jobs in the province fell for the fourth straight month, dwindling to 2.029\u00a0million in December.\nThat's about 9,000 fewer jobs than in August, which was the high point for the year.\nThe numbers come from the latest\u00a0Survey of Employment, Payroll and Hours, which measures jobs from a variety of sources, including payroll-tax data.

Oil\u00a0production was limited under the government-imposed cap, and a number of oilsands facilities suspended operations for maintenance.\"\nIt all added up to what the Conference Board describes as a \"mild recession\" in 2019, but one that should be short-lived.\n\"Rebounding investment and production in the energy sector is the key factor underpinning the province's economic recovery,\"\u00a0the report says, with forecast growth of 2.2 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent next year.\nThe Conference Board cited improvements in midstream companies' pipeline efficiency and the continued raising of the provincial oil-production cap as reasons for the rosier outlook, as well as \"bigger milestones\" such as the looming replacement of Enbridge's Line 3 pipeline and the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.\n\"This all adds up to more growth opportunities in the oilsands. And\u00a0the opportunities should continue to improve,\" the report reads.\nThe report goes on to say that the economic rebound \"will be tempered by significant public sector restraint, which will weigh on growth over the next few years.\"\n\"Where the Alberta outlook is not so bright is in government spending,\" it reads. \"Its public sector is one of the largest employers and sources of job growth in the province.

The amount had been unchanged for 20 years.\nWith restaurants and other institutional food services closed, the dairy industry has been reeling from the collapse in demand for certain dairy products this spring.

So we're looking for solutions that are better than normal.\"\nThe\u00a0seven-page letter is\u00a0not so much a \"course correction\" as it is expanding upon\u00a0existing efforts, said Comeau.\nFor example, there are already calls from farmer organizations, farmer market operators, local food security advocates, and others that the province needs to bolster food security.\nThe conservation council agrees the province needs to \"increase dramatically\" the proportion of its food from homegrown sources.\nAs it stands, only about eight per cent of fruits and vegetables are grown locally.\n\"We need a balanced mix of New Brunswick-grown\u00a0and sustainably-managed community gardens, home gardens, hobby farms, and larger agriculture operations supplying not just produce, but most of the food we eat if we want to improve food security,\" the letter states.\nIt also recommends deploying land\u00a0suitable for growing food with programming targeting young people who want to start farming in 2020 and 2021.\nAs part of the focus on food security, the conservation council also wants to see increased wage subsidies for farm workers, as well as help for inshore fisheries and the fish-processing industry.\nTo build community and ecosystem resiliency, it's calling on the government to exceed its goal of protecting 10 per cent of natural areas by 2020 and instead develop a plan to protect 25 per cent of each of\u00a0the land and marine base by 2025.\n\"We need to learn from our recent history, including two back-to-back 100-year floods of the St. John River, Hurricane Dorian and Arthur and the 2017 ice storm and move rapidly to implement protection plans that ensure natural systems can protect us from extreme weather,\" the letter states.\nThis will also help create\u00a0jobs in protection and restoration, in building trades through infrastructure projects, and temporary work such as\u00a0beach debris cleanups.\nThe plan also deals with forestry, including better\u00a0protection of\u00a0Crown lands\u00a0by decreasing the average size of clear cuts\u00a0by about 80 per cent, and replacing aerial herbicide spraying with more labour-intensive silviculture practices, such as manual thinning and Acadian forest restoration.\nUnder electricity, the conservation council recommends an action plan that would include targets and timelines.\nIt suggests immediately retrofitting 100 per cent of New Brunswick\u00a0building stock over the next six years, which it says could result in a net increase of 3,460 jobs per year and a\u00a0net increase of $730 million in GDP per year.\nPremier Blaine Higgs said Thursday he\u00a0will share the province's COVID-19\u00a0recovery plan \"in the coming days.\"\nThe province will outline a series of phases similar to Saskatchewan's plan, where different levels of services are to begin to reopen while physical distancing is maintained, and there is a limit on how many people can gather at once.\n\"There's two factors. One is in relation to allowing people to get back to their normal way of life in the\u00a0new norm\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and then the phase of, how businesses recover and the economy,\" Higgs said.\nThursday marked the fifth day in a row of no new cases of COVID-19 in New Brunswick.\nThere are 14 active cases, including five people in hospital, one of whom is in intensive care.\nTo date, 104 people across the province have recovered from the disease.\nGoing back to the way things were before COVID-19 likely isn't an\u00a0option, said Comeau.\n\"Some things are not going to recover,\" she said. \"Changes in the energy sector may not be something you can just switch back onto.\"\nPolling also indicates a shift in attitudes, she said.\nPeople are more interested in\u00a0buying local\u00a0and\u00a0seed sales are \"skyrocketing.\"\nPeople are enjoying working from home and being closer\u00a0to family.\n\"I think these social changes that have emerged during the pandemic have the potential to create permanent change and opens a window to doing things differently,\" said Comeau.\nIn addition,\u00a0governments are co-operating, people are collaborating\u00a0are feeling empathy toward each other, she said.\n\"I\u00a0think we definitely have an opportunity.\u00a0Not only should we do better than normal, but people will want us to do better than normal.\"\n"}, {"author": "Nicholas Frew", "title": "Bowman backs cities' request to feds for up to $15B for COVID-19 budget relief", "description": "Winnipeg finances relatively OK, but mayor says 'we're not immune to the crisis facing municipalities'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-cities-federal-funding-covid-19-1.5543456", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3720306.1471143662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winnipeg-city-hall.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 23, 2020 10:40 PM CT", "2020-04-24T03:40:24.821Z"], "source": "CBC", "content": "Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman is backing a\u00a0request for billions of dollars from the\u00a0federal government made by a group of Canada's municipal leaders, so cities can stave off financial crises caused by\u00a0the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe\u00a0Federation of Canadian Municipalities has asked for\u00a0between $10 billion and $15 billion over the next six months for cities from coast to coast.\n\"Cities across Canada are incredibly important economic drivers for provinces, and in fact for the entire country,\" Bowman said Thursday.\n\"Residents are depending on municipal services more than ever before. Revenues are drying up across the country, while costs continue to rise. Combined with an inability to run deficits, cities are increasingly getting\u00a0anxious about the future.\"\nBowman has noted on several occasions that Winnipeg's financial state is relatively fine compared to other Canadian cities. But on Thursday he noted \"we're not immune to the crisis facing municipalities, as the length of the pandemic continues to grow.\"\nFunding would pay for services and fill in revenue gaps. Transit ridership and parking revenue is down as people stay home due to the pandemic, while recreation centres and arenas that would normally be bustling also remain closed.\nThe result has been staff layoffs to save money and spending reviews to help balance budgets.\nThe City of Winnipeg lost $12 million in the first month of the pandemic,\u00a0laid off nearly 700 seasonal workers last week, and on Monday it reduced Winnipeg Transit service and laid off 253 Transit staff.\nThere is no specific amount that would come to Winnipeg,\u00a0because it depends on the amount of money available, Bowman said, noting he would appreciate whatever help the city can get.\nThe main positive of the funding, Bowman said, is it comes directly from the federal government, as opposed to going through the province to the city.\n\"The opportunity and the possibility of direct funding for operational budgets for municipalities could go a long way to mitigating some of those layoffs, and some of those decisions down the road,\" said Bowman.\nAbsent federal help, the federation says local councils could be forced to cut spending further or approve large tax increases.\nAsked about the funding request, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau noted municipalities are constitutionally governed by the provinces, but added his government would work with provinces and \"directly with municipalities\" on issues.\nMunicipal officials have been making the case for weeks about the need for financial help as they suffer mounting revenue losses, and fear more coming if shuttered businesses fail to reopen once health restrictions are slowly lifted.\nLocal leaders argue provincial coffers may not be able to help out much more.

And we are the highest indebted province in Canada right now.\"\nBut the CIBC chart cited as evidence for that has\u00a0nothing to do with per capita debt, says CIBC economist\u00a0Maria Berlettano.\n\"When you adjust for [Manitoba Hydro] debt, which is self-supported by Manitoba Hydro, Manitoba's debt actually is high, but is sort of within the average,\" said Berlettano, who heads up the bank's\u00a0Canadian government credit-strategy department.\nThe chart was included in a workforce-management\u00a0presentation made\u00a0last week to Manitoba Crown corporations, universities and other government agencies\u00a0which are now facing pandemic-related staff and spending cuts.\nIn that presentation, the provincial Treasury Board secretariat\u00a0asked those agencies and Crowns\u00a0to prepare scenarios involving 10, 20 and 30 per cent workforce reductions.\nBerlettano says the chart is complex, but was intended for institutional investors who pay for sophisticated analyses. It shows what the bond-rating agency S&P has to say about Manitoba's financial situation.\n\"It is counterintuitive because the [bar] is so high for Manitoba,\" Berlettano said.\nManitoba's actual taxpayer-funded debt burden ratio \u2014 which excludes Manitoba Hydro debt \u2014 is indicated by the red horizontal line on the yellow Manitoba bar.\nUsing this measure, Manitoba comes in\u00a0behind Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and\u00a0Newfoundland and Labrador.\nBerlettano also notes this chart does not include $45.8 billion of debt incurred by Hydro Quebec, a Crown utility that does its own borrowing. That means the chart does not compare the rankings of provincial debt when hydro-electric utility borrowing is included across the board.\nBerlettano says the chart\u00a0actually shows Manitoba in a\u00a0middling position when it comes to debt.\nManitoba's \"high\" debt rating is better than Ontario's and\u00a0Newfoundland and Labrador's,\u00a0which are rated as \"very high.\"\nIt also shows Manitoba has a \"positive\" rating alongside its A+ rating, which means there is a one-in-three chance the province will receive a credit upgrade\u00a0during\u00a0the next year or two.\u00a0\n\"The worst in Canada is Newfoundland,\" Berlettano said.\u00a0\nBond rating agency S&P (formerly known as Standard & Poor's)\u00a0no longer treats Manitoba Hydro's $21.6-billion debt \u2014 which makes up over 40 per cent of the province's $51-billion debt total \u2014\u00a0 as taxpayer-supported, according to a report authored by Berlettano.\nLast October, S&P made the determination that Manitoba Hydro's debt is no longer taxpayer-supported because \"as a regulated, vertically integrated utility with an effective monopoly position, [it] has the capacity and demonstrated willingness to repay its debt obligations as they become due.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nManitoba Hydro pays its debt through revenue generated by billing its customers.\nA recently published report by RBC shows Manitoba has the fourth-highest per capita debt, after Newfoundland, Ontario and Quebec.\u00a0\nBut Berlettano says\u00a0per capita debt is not a useful measure of debt burden.\n\"There's really only two ways to calculate a debt burden, and that's debt-to-GDP, or debt-to-revenue,\" she said.\nManitoba was in a good financial position going into the COVID-19 pandemic because it was getting close to balancing its budget.\n\"If you look at Manitoba's ratings overall, they don't signal any kind of concern \u2026 because their ratings are somewhat in the middle of the road, relative to all the other provinces,\" Berlettano said.\nShe said this strong starting position bodes well for Manitoba's future credit ratings, because the province will be compared to other jurisdictions when COVID-19 spending is taken into account.\u00a0\n\"Rating agencies are not all of a sudden going to wholesale downgrade governments all around the world,\" she said.\n\"What they're going to do is identify those that were in a very weak starting position.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Cities ask Liberals for up to $15B in emergency funding to stave off COVID-19 budget crisis", "description": "'Buck stops with the federal government' to help municipalities", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/emergency-funding-needed-by-canadian-cities-federation-of-canadian-municipalities-1.5542697", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5542721.1587665593!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-cda-20200420.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 23, 2020 12:18 PM MT", "2020-04-24T13:31:28.461Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada's cities are on the brink of financial crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a group of municipal leaders say \u2014 unless the federal government urgently provides billions of dollars in help.\nThe hole in municipal budgets could be anywhere between $10 billion and $15 billion over the next six months, depending on the severity and duration of the pandemic-related shutdown, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities says.\nFunding would pay for services and fill in revenue gaps.

The figures show there have been 6.82 million unique applicants for the program.\nIt still has gaps in coverage, including for pregnant women who previously applied for employment insurance at the outset of the pandemic in March.\nAnd an analysis published Thursday by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said there were 1.4 million unemployed Canadians this month who couldn't access the benefit, and 1.4 million more who will likely try to cut their hours so their monthly earnings fall below the $1,000 now needed to qualify for the CERB.\n\"We never expected that we'd get it perfect from day one. Indeed, we knew we wouldn't, but we couldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\" Trudeau said in response to questions about holes in the government's aid programs.\nHow soon those workers can get back on the job will vary by jurisdiction as provinces and cities determine how quickly to loosen restrictions that have severely limited economic activity. The question was put repeatedly to Small Business Minister Mary Ng during an appearance before the House of Commons industry committee.\n\"Businesses need to reopen.

But perhaps nothing has affected our politics\u00a0exactly like the COVID-19 pandemic has.\n\"This is one of a kind,\" the Canadian historian\u00a0John English\u00a0said in a conversation on Friday, noting that the speed of current\u00a0events\u00a0seems to distinguish this moment even from the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918.\nThe past seven days offer any number of points from which we can measure how much has changed, and how fast.\nHere's one:\u00a0the effective closure of the unofficial crossing at Roxham Road in Quebec, through which thousands of people \u2014 so-called \"irregular migrants\" \u2014\u00a0have entered Canada over the last few years.\nAs of Friday,\u00a0Canadian officials are under orders to detain\u00a0those migrants and quickly turn them over to American authorities. That may not have been the most dramatic thing that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Friday. It may not have been even the second-most significant he said.\nBut at any other moment, it would have represented\u00a0a massive shift in the Trudeau government's policy\u00a0stance on irregular migrants.\nThe issue of people crossing into Canada at Roxham Road \u2014 and, earlier, in Manitoba \u2014\u00a0has been a political football in this country\u00a0since 2017. In the wake of Donald Trump's election, thousands made their way across the border and claimed asylum.\nConservatives cried out for those asylum seekers to be turned back and described\u00a0the situation as a \"crisis\". The Liberals, even as they discouraged people from coming, were reluctant to turn anyone away and instead treated the influx as something that could be managed.\nBut the Trudeau government had already decided this week to ban all non-essential movement across Canada's official border crossings with the United States. And now it apparently has\u00a0decided that the irregular arrival of hundreds of people at Roxham Road is not something that can be easily managed in the midst of a global pandemic.\nPublic Safety Minister Bill Blair said on Friday that anyone crossing the border would now normally be expected to self-isolate for 14 days. \"Accommodating and managing that is a difficult challenge,\" he said.\nThese are, Trudeau said, \"exceptional times.\"\nMaybe some progressive voters will be uncomfortable with what the government has done. But nobody's going to be awarding prizes right now for maintaining perfect ideological consistency.\nOn Wednesday, the government announced $82 billion in aid for individuals and businesses \u2014 and the only question anyone was asking was whether it was enough.\u00a0\nFor much of the past four years, the idea of the federal government running a $20 billion annual deficit was the subject of heated\u00a0political debate (even if most economists were unconcerned).\nTaking into account this week's spending and a significant downturn in the economy, the federal deficit is now projected to approach $80 billion. Assuming there will be a need for further federal aid, Scotiabank is projecting a deficit of $100 billion for the current year.\nBut few critics, if any, seem\u00a0willing to bat an eyelash at those eye-popping numbers. The case for spending these borrowed sums now\u00a0is obvious, of course, and the alternative \u2014 leaving households\u00a0and businesses to fend for themselves \u2014 is clearly worse.\nThe announcement about Roxham Road on Friday was overwhelmed\u00a0by two other items.\nFirst, Trudeau said that manufacturing facilities would soon be refitted to produce medical equipment \u2014\u00a0a step that was immediately compared to a \"wartime effort.\"\nSecond, Trudeau reported that the federal government has received more than 500,000 applications for employment insurance this week, compared to fewer than 27,000 such applications during the same period last year.\nThat's a breathtaking figure, the enormity of which was captured in a graph by Trevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary.\nOn Friday, Deputy Prime Minister\u00a0Chrystia Freeland also thought it necessary to talk about\u00a0how hard this moment must be for children.\n\"Speaking very personally, I would like to thank Canada's children and sympathize with them,\" said Freeland, a mother of three herself.\nA minister thinking it's\u00a0necessary to address the strain on the nation's children does more than any statistic\u00a0to underline the gravity of this moment.\n\"I know this past week has been hard on people for many reasons. Working from home while the kids are running around, not being able to visit your parents at their nursing home, not hanging out with your friends. It can take its toll,\" Trudeau said, standing again in front of Rideau Cottage, where he is both overseeing the government's response and making sure his youngest son's bathtime is still enforced.\u00a0\n\"But it is in these challenging times that we also see what we're made of.\"\nThe issues and concerns that dominated the political conversation in this country\u00a0before this\u00a0crisis erupted were not trivial ones. And those problems will still exist whenever we emerge from this dark hour. Once we make it through this, those problems might seem a little less dire than they seemed not too long ago.\n\"This past week,\" Trudeau said, \"no matter how difficult, was further proof that Canadians are generous, kind and compassionate and that should give us all hope.\"\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "All eyes on Canadian jobs numbers as election heads into 5th week: Don Pittis", "description": "Still few signs of Canadian recession, but this week's data may tell us more", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/jobs-economy-election-1.5298115", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309380.1570212742!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/now-hiring-cafe-at-st-lawrence-market-toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 07, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-10-08T16:40:39.065Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When Canada's jobs numbers come out on Friday there will only be 10 days before Canadians vote in the federal election.\nThose who are already a little sick of wall-to-wall election coverage may find that an encouraging milestone. But for politicians who have made the welfare of voters\u00a0a key plank in their platforms,\u00a0the fresh\u00a0data may give them new fodder to boast or complain about the state of the Canadian economy.\nQuite apart from the election, the latest\u00a0statistics come at a time of conflicting signals about the direction of Canadian, U.S.\u00a0and global growth.\nDire warnings from merely a few weeks ago that markets were about to\u00a0crash\u00a0and a feeling that the economy was heading into a recessionary tailspin have since dissipated, though a background wariness remains.\nLast Wednesday's market conniption was only the latest evidence of lingering worries that likely aren't over yet.\nCanadian gross domestic product numbers last week showed the economy was flat. That's a big change from the previous reading when the Canadian economy was still revelling in the impact of the Toronto Raptors win, and GDP indicated economic growth of\u00a03.7 per cent, a startlingly strong number in a low-growth world.\nAs I write about growth as a good thing, I feel a certain conflict after reporting recently\u00a0on Greta Thunberg and\u00a0the necessity of learning to live well in a low-growth world.\u00a0Evidently, like many others, I have not yet internalized that mental shift.\nFor good or ill, the economic growth figures for July offered\u00a0plenty of\u00a0signs that people were shopping more and gobbling up more in services. The hit to the economy came specifically in oil and gas, and within that sector the principal\u00a0blame fell on a sharp drop in production from the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore due to rig maintenance.\nOne confusing aspect of GDP figures \u2014 besides making us ponder\u00a0whether they are a sign of a planet in trouble \u2014 is that they are always out of date. Like seeing light from a distant planet, the data we are observing represents events that have already happened, and things\u00a0may have changed since.\nJust as the numbers that came out in August told us about the economy\u00a0Canadians were experiencing two months previous, last week's growth numbers reflect conditions in early summer before the mid-August gloom had arrived. As mentioned in the past, a little gloom can make people rein in spending, effectively compounding the effects of a slowing economy.\nCanada's deep connections to the U.S. economy\u00a0mean that chill winds there can blow north, and updated business investment figures released by the Commerce Department two weeks ago showed a sharper decline.\n\"The trade war is threatening the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year,\" reported the business wire service Reuters.\nBut since that report, the\u00a0picture has turned brighter, especially after Friday's trade data\u00a0and U.S. unemployment figures that hit a stunning new low.\nOn Friday we learned that the Canadian trade gap narrowed\u00a0and perhaps more important\u00a0the U.S. economy is still cranking out jobs.\u00a0The unemployment rate south of the border\u00a0hit a\u00a050-year low of 3.5 per cent last month as the economy created 136,000 new jobs.\u00a0\nThe advantage of the jobs figures\u00a0that came last\u00a0Friday in the U.S. and those coming Friday in Canada is that they don't feel quite so historical as many other measures. In that way they will offer the freshest indication of whether\u00a0Canada is losing steam.\nUnlike GDP, which is painstakingly collected from many sources and gradually assembled into increasingly accurate figures as more data is accumulated, the jobs number\u00a0is based on a series of telephone surveys in the weeks before the numbers are released. That make Labour Force Survey results up-to-date, but less accurate.\nStatisticians who watch those numbers often say the accuracy of the results in any month cannot be trusted. The chart above, which\u00a0begins after the\u00a0big weather-related\u00a0plunge in job creation in February\u00a02018,\u00a0swings widely from month to month. The trend over several months would be a more truthful reflection.\nThe other thing about employment data is that it is cumulative. While a single month's survey may indicate a fall in the number of jobs, over the past year periodic\u00a0job losses\u00a0\u2014 those points below the black line\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have been dwarfed by gains in other months.\nBut that is seldom how any month's numbers are perceived when they are released, especially during an election.\nInevitably a sharp rise in monthly job creation or a fall in the unemployed will be extrapolated to say\u00a0the economy remains on an upswing. The opposite will be read as a\u00a0warning of approaching gloom.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\nNeed help preparing for election day? We've got the information you need.

For the fiscal year of 2009-2010, the Harper government ran a deficit of $56.4 billion. Before they were done, the Conservatives ran six years of annual deficits, totalling $157.8 billion.\nStill, it was considered heresy when Justin Trudeau announced in 2015 that a Liberal government would run three years of deficits to boost a sluggish economy. One newspaper described the plan as \"political suicide.\" Shortly thereafter, Trudeau's Liberals won a majority.\nOnce in office, the Trudeau government pushed things further\u00a0\u2014 first because of economic circumstances, then because of its own choices and priorities\u00a0\u2014 resulting in deficits of $19 billion, $19 billion, $14 billion and $19.8 billion.\nHarper's deficits could be traced to his decisions to cut taxes\u00a0\u2014 the GST in particular. Trudeau's deficits had more to do with new spending on federal programs.\nWhile running for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2017, Andrew Scheer vowed to balance the budget within two years of forming government. But as the 2019 general election neared \u2014 and with budget cuts by Doug Ford's provincial government angering voters in Ontario \u2014 Scheer lost some of his enthusiasm for swift deficit elimination. In May, he announced that a Conservative government would instead take five years to balance the budget.\nThe Liberal platform released on Sunday nudges\u00a0the goalposts again. With promised new spending, a re-elected Liberal government would run larger deficits, starting at $27.4 billion in the first year and declining to $21 billion in the fourth.\nThe Conservative response was notable for what it lacked. Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre's primary argument was not that the deficits were themselves immoral or fundamentally unsound. Rather, he claimed the deficits inevitably would lead a Liberal government to increase taxes\u00a0\u2014 tax hikes the Conservatives claim\u00a0Trudeau is concealing now.\nThat attack might resonate more if the Harper government's deficits had triggered the same consequences.\nEconomists like Kevin Milligan\u00a0argue that the current deficit is not a matter for great concern\u00a0\u2014 that government debt is not like household debt, borrowing rates are low, the situation in 2019 is not what it was in 1995 and recent deficits have been relatively modest.\nThe debt-to-GDP ratio\u00a0\u2014 the debt as measured against the entirety of the national economy\u00a0\u2014 was 31.5 per cent in 2014-2015. The Liberals now project that, even after eight years of deficits, it will be 30.2 per cent of GDP in 2023-2024. (For the sake of comparison, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 66.8 per cent in 1996, when Jean Chr\u00e9tien\u00a0and Paul Martin were compelled to cut spending.)\nBut the bottom line still resonates in political news coverage and partisan debate. It's\u00a0an easy way to measure a budget or a platform, something that can be quickly understood\u00a0\u2014 unlike the relative value of the actual spending and tax commitments that a government or party makes. \"Is the budget balanced?\" is a much easier question to answer than, say, \"How much should the government be spending to help families?\"\nSpending into a deficit can be easily described as reckless. But it's not clear the public is much more concerned than the average economist.\nJust 13 per cent of respondents to an Ipsos Reid survey earlier this month said government debt was among their three most important election issues. An Angus Reid Institute poll found only three per cent of uncommitted voters considered it their top issue. In both polls, issues like climate change, the cost of living and health care rated much higher.\nThat combination of economic and public sentiment may have given Trudeau room to promise more. But it's also not clear how far the public's patience with red ink might last.\nThe most expensive item in the Liberal platform is the promise to raise the personal income tax deduction, but its new commitments also include a boost to the Canada Child Benefit for families with children under a year old, new breaks for post-secondary students, a boost to Old Age Security and new spending to mitigate climate change.\u00a0In all, the Liberals are effectively offering to push slightly harder in the direction they've set out over the last four years.\nScheer's Conservatives are still committed to a greater degree of frugality. That, along with a series of promised tax cuts, should compel them to present a different picture of what a federal government would do when they table their complete platform\u00a0\u2014 to present their own approach as a stark contrast with what the Liberals have planned.\nIn 2011, Harper's Conservatives promised $1.6 billion in new spending, while Michael Ignatieff's Liberals countered with a platform that included $5.5 billion in new initiatives, all of it covered by corresponding tax increases or spending cuts.\nIn 2019, instead of arguing within a box created by competing desires to both balance the budget and avoid broad-based tax increases, the platforms of the two main federal parties could be upwards of $20 billion apart.\nThat is not a small amount of money.\nIf the orthodoxy of the balanced budget has weakened, it has left room for a clearer choice.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Greta Thunberg was right: There is an alternative to 'eternal economic growth': Don Pittis", "description": "Climate activist called endless economic growth a 'fairy tale,' but it may depend on how you define growth", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/business-climate-strike-1.5293916", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5297204.1569440488!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/climate-change-un.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 26, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-26T22:15:22.815Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In a quote heard around the world this week a 16-year-old climate activist threw down the gauntlet.\nGreta Thunberg's passion reached deep into our hearts when she angrily called on our leaders to stop the suffering and dying, to stop entire ecosystems from collapsing.\nBut with the next sentence in that widely quoted appeal for action, Thunberg did something many of the most powerful people in the world will find harder to swallow: she thrust a knife into the beating heart of conventional economics.\n\"We are at the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!\"\nTo most economists, money and endless economic growth are no fairy tales, they are essential to how the world works, how lives are improved, how people earn their living.\nBut there is another way of understanding economics that comes under the general title of sustainable prosperity, and a Canadian economist is one of the world's principal exponents of how such a system would work.\nTomorrow, as students and many others participate in the strike for climate change, there are signs business would like to show support. Mountain Equipment Co-op will close its doors. Upmarket fashion brand Patagonia has offered space for sign-making. Amazon's Jeff Bezos has announced he will buy electric delivery vans once they become available. Canada's financial sector has expressed concern.\nAsked by host Laura Lynch on CBC Radio's The Current this week about talk of business contributions to the climate change fight, environmentalist Bill McKibben was skeptical.\n\"The talk is growing, but it's not about how the financial sector is fighting climate change,\" said McKibben, a founder of the group 350.org, \"It's about how the financial sector is continuing to propel climate change.\"\nMcKibben cited a list of the world's biggest banks that continue to invest in the carbon-intensive industries that are making climate change worse. Four of Canada's big banks \u2014 RBC, TD, Scotia and BMO \u2014 are in the global top 10.\nCanadian economist and author Peter Victor, who studied at UBC and taught at Toronto's York University, says that conflict between words and investment is the crux of the collision between the traditional way of thinking about business \u2014 the idea of investing for endless growth \u2014 that has to be overcome to stop climate change.\nAnd clearly, for most economic thinkers trapped in the long-held view that boosting GDP with industrial growth is the most important job for governments and business, Victor's newly revised second edition of his\u00a0book Managing Without Growth: Slower by Design, Not Disaster may be difficult reading.\n\"Most economists would really take the position that there is no choice: If you don't have growth, the system would collapse,\" said Victor this week from a cabin somewhere near Ontario's Algonquin Park.\nVictor has created a low-growth simulation model for the Canadian economy to demonstrate that there is a choice. Getting from here to there may be difficult, but in principle he says his work shows there are no economic reasons why Canada cannot be prosperous in the absence of traditional, industrial, GDP-style growth.\nAs he describes in a slightly out-of-date 2013 video lecture embedded below, the concept of economic growth is a relatively recent post-war invention. According to the 2016 book The Rise and Fall of American Growth, the growth era may be ending in any case.\nBut endless growth could be replaced by shifting growth.\n\"Even in an economy that is not growing, you can have a lot of dynamic change,\" said Victor. \"We need some sectors to grow if we're going to switch from fossil fuels to renewables, for instance.\"\nAnd we will still have to keep busy, not least in figuring out ways of making our economy keep ticking in the face of climate change. Building sea walls to protect a city does not increase output like building a new factory or increasing oil output, but it is useful.\nSo are many things that are not traditionally seen as helping the economy grow, including creating art, looking after friends and family, participating in political activity \u2014 things not properly captured in GDP and therefore not contributing to growth. Maybe economists can recalibrate our system to value those activities.\nStudies of well-being have indicated that faster growth does not give people more free time or make people happier. A low-growth economy could do that.\nRepeated analysis has shown that the current understanding of economic growth is using up the planet's resources at a rate that cannot be sustained. As the title of Victor's book implies, disaster would end growth one way or another, just more abruptly.\nAccording to Victor, adapting to a low-growth economy will be complex and demanding, but there will be many compensations, such as not destroying the planet and not driving the rest of the world's plants and animals into extinction. Of course, that was Thunberg's point.\nWATCH | Canadian economist Peter Victor explains his theory of ecological economics:\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Maryse Zeidler", "title": "'Stroller brigades' across B.C. make plea for national child-care strategy", "description": "All the major federal parties have committed to current levels of funding, but B.C. group wants more", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-affordable-child-care-rally-1.5310648", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5310693.1570309367!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bc-affordable-child-care.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 05, 2019 3:04 PM PT", "2019-10-05T22:04:43.710Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Parents and their supporters in 21 communities across British Columbia rallied on Saturday morning to call for a national child-care strategy.\u00a0\nThe protesters, many of them with strollers in tow, want the federal government\u00a0to provide affordable, universal child care for parents across the country.\u00a0\n\"Everybody depends on somebody who depends on child care,\" said Sharon Gregson at the rally in Vancouver.

Oil and gas are the country's most valuable\u00a0exports and the industry sent $132.2 billion worth of product to markets abroad in 2018, according to Natural Resources Canada.  The industry supported 530,000 jobs across the country in 2017 and provided roughly $8 billion in annual revenue to governments.\nCanada is the world's fourth\u00a0largest producer\u00a0of crude oil, and sits on one of the world's largest proven oil reserves.\nTim McMillan,\u00a0president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), said talk of ending oil production\u00a0is a \"fantasy\" because the world still depends\u00a0on oil products and natural gas for everything\u00a0from clothing to home heating.\nHe said May and Blanchet have abandoned a pragmatic approach to flighting climate change and are embracing ideas pushed by \"fringe\" elements that are not supported by most Canadians.\n\"I am someone who normally tries to be very respectful of our elected officials but this one has struck a chord with me,\" McMillan said.\n\"What was put out today [by May and Blanchet] wasn't a call to action for technology. It wasn't about Canada taking a leadership role. It was a blanket statement based on ideology that is really pushing us toward a pre-industrialized, Amish-type society.\"\nMcMillan pointed to pre-pandemic data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that suggested\u00a0demand for oil and gas will be strong over the next decade,\u00a0before that growth moderates as more renewable energy comes online.\nThe IEA projects that, if governments follow their\u00a0stated policies,\u00a0demand for oil will increase each year\u00a0until it plateaus in the mid-2030s.\nThe agency\u00a0also predicts that,\u00a0under the sustainable development scenario required to avoid the worst effects of climate change, that demand could drop off much sooner.\nThe IEA\u00a0has documented a dramatic decline in demand for oil and gas products in the midst of this pandemic, calling it the \"biggest shock since the Second World War.\"\nThe IEA said the virus has ravaged markets for fossil fuels \u2014 the collapse in energy demand is seven times greater than the slump caused by the global financial crisis. Renewable energy sources, meanwhile, have been comparatively resilient.\n\"It is still too early to determine the longer-term impacts, but the energy industry that emerges from this crisis will be significantly different from the one that came before,\" said Fatih Birol, the IEA executive director.\nThe IEA's April oil market report projected global demand for oil this year will\u00a0fall by 9.3 million barrels\u00a0per day compared to 2019.\nBecause of COVID-19 containment measures, demand for oil in April was estimated to be about 29 million barrels per day lower than it was a year ago \u2014 a level last seen in 1995, the report said.\nThe price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western Canadian Select (WCS) briefly turned negative last month as suppliers struggled to find buyers for their product.\nShannon Stubbs, the Conservative natural resources critic, said the pandemic might actually be good for oil production as low prices could make it more attractive than\u00a0renewables \u2014 especially if cash-strapped governments end subsidies for green technology.\n\"Canada should be the supplier of choice to the world, and the top destination for oil and gas investment and development, while securing energy self sufficiency,\" she said, adding oil gas are still the \"most abundant and affordable\" form of energy around.\nWatch: NDP's Jagmeet Singh calls for energy workers to get COVID-19 relief funds, not companies\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "'So much uncertainty': New data highlights global economic pain from COVID-19", "description": "France's economy shrank by 5.8%, the biggest quarterly drop since 1949, as Germany projects 6.3% GDP decline", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/so-much-uncertainty-new-data-highlights-global-economic-pain-from-covid-19-1.5550313", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5550320.1588243520!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/japan-financial-markets.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 30, 2020 8:16 AM ET", "2020-04-30T12:16:37.150Z"], "source": null, "content": "The world's economic pain was on full display Thursday as Europe and the United States were releasing more figures showing the devastating impact on jobs and companies of lockdown measures designed to battle the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn Europe, where over 132,000 people with the virus have died, the fear of renewed infection spikes that could again overwhelm hospital emergency wards was tempering hopes that economies on life-support will regain their vigour as workers return to factories, shops and offices.\nFigures released Thursday showed that France's economy shrank by an eye-popping 5.8 per cent\u00a0in the first quarter, the biggest quarterly drop since 1949 and mainly due to its strict stay-home measures that have been\u00a0in place since March 17.\nSpain says its economy shrunk five\u00a0per cent\u00a0in the first quarter of this year as the coronavirus pandemic hit.

That is nearly half the global workforce of 3.3 billion.\nIt expects the equivalent of 305 million full-time jobs to be wiped out in April-June.\nMoves toward reopening economies are progressing in fits and starts. China and South Korea, early epicentres of the pandemic, both reported only four new cases on Thursday.

They'll try to convince you they're just like you. They're worried about the same things you are and hopeful about the same things, too.\nBut how much do we Canadians really know about one another?\nIn an economy driven by resources and banking, it would be easy to think the most common jobs are working oil rigs or in finance.\nBut as the graphic below shows, retail salesperson\u00a0tops the list of most common jobs for women, and is second on the list for men, behind only truck driver.\nWe are a nation of consumers, after all.\nRetail salespeople, truck drivers and cashiers\u00a0are all jobs being targeted by automation. That may help explain why there's so much economic anxiety in Canada right now. Some of the most common jobs in the country are set to be replaced, or at least fundamentally altered, in the not-too-distant future.\u00a0\nAnd even if your job isn't under threat by automation, many people in Canada are pessimistic about\u00a0their long-term prospects. According to a recent CBC poll, the thing most Canadians are concerned about is the\u00a0cost of living.\u00a0\nAt a macro level, the Canadian economy is doing well. Perhaps not great, but certainly not bad. Jobs are being added in droves and GDP growth has come in well above expectations. But that economic expansion is patchy at best. GDP forecasts for\u00a0B.C. and Newfoundland and Labrador\u00a0are in a different stratosphere than those for\u00a0Alberta and New Brunswick.\nPerhaps our biggest concern is debt. Canadians owe record amounts of money. The national debt-to-income ratio is a staggering 177 per cent. For every dollar we earn, we owe $1.77. That debt keeps Canadians up at night and has a real impact on their quality of life.\u00a0\nOver the course of any election you will hear nearly endless appeals to the middle class. An\u00a0Environics poll from 2012\u00a0famously found that 93 per cent of Canadians believe they're in the middle class.\nThe median household income in Canada is\u00a0$70,675 (that's household, not individual).\nAnd yes, the economy is in the midst of a 10-year expansion. Since the end of the 2008 financial crisis, stock markets have rebounded considerably and corporate profits have bounced back.\nBut wages have remained stubbornly flat. So, the economic benefits have largely gone to\u00a0shareholders, not workers.\nWages are finally showing some signs of life. Canadian wage growth in July came in at 4.5 per cent\u00a0and remained high in August, at 3.7 per cent. But there's a big gap to close when looking at who has benefited since the financial crisis of 2008.\nElections are supposed to be a chance to bring the country together and decide how to proceed on the important issues of our day. But that's incredibly hard to do well when we're all wrapped up in our own little bubbles. Understanding how different we are \u2014 and how much we have in common \u2014\u00a0is essential to understanding the country and to deciding where we stand on critical issues.\nIn this vast country, we are bound to have different experiences and work different jobs and hold different ideas. It's natural to surround ourselves with people who agree with us, people who have similar backgrounds and\u00a0similar stances on the issues.\nThat's why it's all the more important to look across the country and across income groups and age groups and remember the things we\u00a0do have in common.\n"}, {"author": "John Paul Tasker", "title": "May and Blanchet declare the oilpatch 'dead,' warn Ottawa against financial supports", "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised financial aid for Alberta's beleaguered oil and gas industry", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/oil-is-dead-green-bloc-parties-1.5557725", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5557760.1588780031!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trans-mountain-decision-20190619.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 06, 2020 12:11 PM ET", "2020-05-06T21:23:55.354Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada's oil and gas sector is on the ropes as COVID-19 crushes demand and a global price war pushes domestic companies to the brink of bankruptcy \u2014 but two opposition leaders say Ottawa should simply let part of the industry wither and die.\nThe Green Party's parliamentary\u00a0leader Elizabeth May says governments around the world should use the pandemic, and the resulting economic fallout, as an opportunity to reorganize the energy mix and find other jobs for Albertans working in the sector.\nBloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet said Alberta's \"tar sands\" are \"condemned\" and federal funds should be directed at supporting renewable energy sources rather than projects like the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.\n\"My heart bleeds for people who believe the sector is going to come back.

Cenovus, for example, generated $2.2 billion in profits in 2019.\nAsked if he thinks the oil sector should be left to die, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was less definitive, saying there will be \"tough decisions\" to make in the years ahead.\n\"I know that the future is going to be renewable, that we need to have more investment in sustainable economies that lower our emissions,\" he said.\nWatch: Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois says investment in oil is 'a very bad idea'\nWhile Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pushed for a more 'green' economy and a carbon tax on emissions, his government has supported some oil and gas development.

Our job is to ensure that this is done responsibly, safely\u00a0and sustainably.\"\nTrudeau has promised sector-specific support for the oil and gas industry beyond the $1.7 billion his government has allocated to clean up orphan well sites.\u00a0He repeated that commitment at a press conference Tuesday.\nMay said governments have managed the ordered shutdown of major industries in the past, citing Quebec's decision to end the production of asbestos and the collapse of the cod fishery in Newfoundland and Labrador \u2014 and the current Liberal government can do it again with Alberta's oilsands.\n\"The pandemic, in a very real way, as horrific as this is at many, many levels, gives us an opportunity to stop and think about how we get this economy back on its feet,\" May said.\nThe collapse of the oil and gas sector would be devastating for the Canadian economy, and would have economic effects much greater than the end of asbestos production or the cod fishery.\nWatch: Help Alberta recover, but don't invest in oilsands, Blanchet says on CBC's Power & Politics\nIn 2018, the energy sector made up 10.6 per cent of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP), with oil and gas accounting for 5.6 per cent of that figure. Oil and gas are the country's most valuable\u00a0exports and the industry sent $132.2 billion worth of product to markets abroad in 2018, according to Natural Resources Canada.  The industry supported 530,000 jobs across the country in 2017 and provided roughly $8 billion in annual revenue to governments.\nCanada is the world's fourth\u00a0largest producer\u00a0of crude oil, and sits on one of the world's largest proven oil reserves.\nTim McMillan,\u00a0president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), said talk of ending oil production\u00a0is a \"fantasy\" because the world still depends\u00a0on oil products and natural gas for everything\u00a0from clothing to home heating.\nHe said May and Blanchet have abandoned a pragmatic approach to flighting climate change and are embracing ideas pushed by \"fringe\" elements that are not supported by most Canadians.\n\"I am someone who normally tries to be very respectful of our elected officials but this one has struck a chord with me,\" McMillan said.\n\"What was put out today [by May and Blanchet] wasn't a call to action for technology. It wasn't about Canada taking a leadership role. It was a blanket statement based on ideology that is really pushing us toward a pre-industrialized, Amish-type society.\"\nMcMillan pointed to pre-pandemic data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that suggested\u00a0demand for oil and gas will be strong over the next decade,\u00a0before that growth moderates as more renewable energy comes online.\nThe IEA projects that, if governments follow their\u00a0stated policies,\u00a0demand for oil will increase each year\u00a0until it plateaus in the mid-2030s.\nThe agency\u00a0also predicts that,\u00a0under the sustainable development scenario required to avoid the worst effects of climate change, that demand could drop off much sooner.\nThe IEA\u00a0has documented a dramatic decline in demand for oil and gas products in the midst of this pandemic, calling it the \"biggest shock since the Second World War.\"\nThe IEA said the virus has ravaged markets for fossil fuels \u2014 the collapse in energy demand is seven times greater than the slump caused by the global financial crisis. Renewable energy sources, meanwhile, have been comparatively resilient.\n\"It is still too early to determine the longer-term impacts, but the energy industry that emerges from this crisis will be significantly different from the one that came before,\" said Fatih Birol, the IEA executive director.\nThe IEA's April oil market report projected global demand for oil this year will\u00a0fall by 9.3 million barrels\u00a0per day compared to 2019.\nBecause of COVID-19 containment measures, demand for oil in April was estimated to be about 29 million barrels per day lower than it was a year ago \u2014 a level last seen in 1995, the report said.\nThe price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western Canadian Select (WCS) briefly turned negative last month as suppliers struggled to find buyers for their product.\nShannon Stubbs, the Conservative natural resources critic, said the pandemic might actually be good for oil production as low prices could make it more attractive than\u00a0renewables \u2014 especially if cash-strapped governments end subsidies for green technology.\n\"Canada should be the supplier of choice to the world, and the top destination for oil and gas investment and development, while securing energy self sufficiency,\" she said, adding oil gas are still the \"most abundant and affordable\" form of energy around.\nWatch: NDP's Jagmeet Singh calls for energy workers to get COVID-19 relief funds, not companies\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Stock markets lose ground again Monday despite U.S. central bank pledge to do 'whatever it takes'", "description": "Federal Reserve removes limits on how much debt it will take on from banks as collateral", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/markets-dollar-oil-1.5506470", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3785703.1475285375!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-fed.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 23, 2020 9:46 AM ET", "2020-03-23T22:02:15.383Z"], "source": null, "content": "The stock market slide deepened on Monday as the rapidly spreading coronavirus forced more U.S. states into lockdown, overshadowing unprecedented moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve to shore up credit across the economy.\nAfter recently cutting interest rates to near zero, the Fed will now lend against student loans and credit card loans, as well as back the purchase of corporate bonds and make direct loans to companies.\nAnnouncement of the extraordinary measures briefly lifted U.S. stock index futures before Monday's trading session began, but the mounting death toll from COVID-19 and a tide of lockdowns more U.S. states quickly sent the main indexes into the red, putting the S&P 500 on pace for its worst month since World War Two.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average closed down 582 points or three per cent while in Toronto, the TSX's main index lost 623 points, or more than five per cent.\n\"What the Fed did is important because it does help in the credit markets.

His fellow directors described him Monday as the right fit for CEO.\n\"With deep industry experience and a proven track record of performance, Dave is the right leader to navigate Boeing through this challenging time in our 104-year legacy,\" said Lawrence Kellner, a former United Airlines CEO who is replacing Calhoun as Boeing chairman. \"We're confident Dave will take Boeing forward with intense focus on our values, including safety, quality and integrity.\"\nBoeing is halting Max production until it knows when the Federal Aviation Administration will approve fixes that company engineers are making to the plane's software and other systems. While Boeing says it will find other work for idled employees, employees at major suppliers are not so lucky. Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for the Max, said Friday it will lay off 2,800 people.\nBoeing is so big that the loss of exports from the Max grounding is weighing on the entire U.S. economy.\n\"There is no question that the Boeing situation, it is going to slow down the GDP numbers,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday, referring to the measure of economic growth. \"Boeing is one of the largest exporters, and with the 737 Max, I think that could impact GDP as much as 50 basis points this year.\"\nFifty basis points is one-half of one percentage point. Mnuchin said on Fox News that Boeing could reduce U.S. economic growth in 2020 from around 3 per cent\u00a0(higher than many private economists forecast) to 2.5 per cent.\nIn the latest black eye for Boeing, a new batch of documents released last week appeared to show that employees hid safety problems from regulators and doubted the safety of the Max while it was in development.\n\"This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys,\" one employee wrote. In another exchange, two unidentified employees agreed that they would not put their families on a Max.\nIt is not clear when regulators will let the Max fly again. Officials who are investigating crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia have focused on flight control software that was not included on previous versions of the 737. Before both crashes, the software pushed down the plane's nose based on a faulty readings from a single sensor.\nMore recently, questions have arisen about other problems on the Max including wiring bundles that could be too close together, raising a potential risk of fire. Separately, the FAA has in recent weeks announced it wants to fine Boeing $9.3 million US for installing substandard parts on the wings of some Max jets and other 737s \u2014 more than 300 planes in all.\nBoeing's problems aren't limited to jetliners, either. Last month a Boeing spacecraft that was to dock with the International Space Station flunked its mission when it couldn't reach the right orbit above Earth.\nBoeing announced on Dec. 23 that it would replace Muilenburg. An interim CEO took over for three weeks while Calhoun, who was most recently a private-equity executive, cut ties to other companies.\nCalhoun, 62, will get a base salary of $1.4 million but potentially several million more in bonuses and stock awards, including $7 million if he gets the Max back in service.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "C.D.

Darby says many of them are struggling due to dwindling cash flow and disruptions to their supply chains.\n\"It's regrettable and it's caused a lot of damage,\" he told CBC News.\nDarby recognizes that productivity won't return to typical\u00a0levels until international trade returns to normal, trading partners begin to reopen their economies and consumers start buying things again. For some, it may never return.\nThe list of variables doesn't seem poised to stabilize for the foreseeable future.\n\"That's the great unknown right now,\" he said.\nThe blow to Ontario's manufacturing industry comes on the heels of a steady decline that had already weakened the sector, which accounts for more than 12 per cent of Ontario's GDP.\n\"Heading into the virus, [Ontario manufacturing] was in a little bit of a tough spot,\" said Rishi Sondhi, an economist at TD Bank.\nNationally, manufacturing sales had declined for five straight months leading to January, a stretch that included the closure of GM's Oshawa assembly plant in December 2019 and, later, rail blockades in support of the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs that hobbled freight train traffic.\nRead other stories in the series:\nRishi says manufacturing activity has \"severely\" contracted during the pandemic. TD Bank expects the sector to begin a recovery in the second half of 2020, though there are many questions still unanswered about what the process will look like.\n\"I think it's safe to say demand will remain muted for some time yet,\" Rishi said. \"It will be a bumpy road.\"\nThe province has pledged to help struggling businesses of all types recover, in part through its new Jobs and Recovery Committee, which has started work on a post-pandemic plan.\nPremier Doug Ford has also promised to \"ignite a fire\" and jump-start the provincial economy when it is safe to do so, but there are no details yet on how this will be achieved.\nThere is also a belief that Ontario's manufacturing sector could be irrevocably changed after the COVID-19 pandemic, and perhaps in some ways that will make the industry stronger.\nDarby said the crisis has revealed the extent to which Ontario relies on supplies and goods from other regions, and the possibility that we could start producing\u00a0some of\u00a0them in the province.\u00a0\nFor instance, in the face of shortages of medical equipment, some Ontario manufacturers altered their facilities to produce goods such as hand sanitizer\u00a0and medical scrubs, while others have pledged to start building ventilators.\nDarby said the quick mobilization of Ontario companies shows untapped potential that could be accessed through faster approvals and fewer regulations.\n\"If we can do it under crisis, maybe we should do it all the time,\" he said.\nSondhi warns that large structural changes may not extend to industries more reliant on international supply chains, such as the auto sector.\nHe also notes that manufacturers may have to enforce physical distancing rules in their plants for many more months, a restriction that will\u00a0weaken efforts at restoring productivity.\n"}, {"author": "Mike Crawley", "title": "How COVID-19 could hit the Doug Ford government's budget", "description": "Forecasting COVID-19 impact on Ontario's economic growth a challenge as budget looms on March 25", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-doug-ford-coronavirus-budget-economy-1.5491299", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5490900.1583764467!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ontario-premier-doug-ford-fireside-chat-communitech-kitchener.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 5:00 AM ET", "2020-03-10T15:42:29.365Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As COVID-19 sends\u00a0global stock markets and oil prices plunging,\u00a0the Doug Ford government is bracing for the effects on Ontario's economy and the impact on the provincial budget, to be delivered in just two weeks.\nThe spread of the new coronavirus\u00a0around the world has brought just 36\u00a0cases to Ontario so far, according to public health authorities, a far lower number than other more hard-hit jurisdictions.\nStill, the\u00a0premier is expressing worry about the potential economic fallout from COVID-19 as some countries restrict\u00a0movement of large parts of the population, travellers decide\u00a0against international trips, large gatherings such as conferences and sporting events are cancelled, and employees take precautionary sick days to avoid infection.\u00a0\n\"The area that I'm concerned is our economy with COVID-19,\" Ford said Monday in an unscripted comment\u00a0at an event in Kitchener.\n\"The worst thing to do is put a scare out there,\" Ford added. \"But we have to be cautious and we're all over this.\"\u00a0He did not offer details of his economic concerns and was not available to take questions from reporters after the event.\u00a0\n\"Clearly,\u00a0COVID-19 is having economic impacts in Ontario,\" Finance Minister Rod Phillips told reporters at the Legislature later Monday. \"We are working diligently to be aware of its impacts and respond to them as required.\"\u00a0\nPhillips is sticking with his timetable for delivering his first budget on March 25.

B.C.-based credit union Central 1 said the same thing about real estate in that province, predicting a 4 per cent drop in prices.\nSo why isn't the Canadian economy in free fall?\nCarolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor\u00a0of the Bank of Canada offered some clues among the conflicting signals in her speech to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce on Thursday.\nToday's GDP numbers offer more clues.\nBut those expecting to feel bucked up by Wilkins may have been disappointed. The talk\u00a0was not exactly a buoyant explanation of why the Canadian economy did not need interest rate cuts.\nPerhaps suffering contagion from Alberta's current gloom, Wilkins' speech was mostly a litany of reasons why the Canadian economy was in trouble.\n\"There was the drop in oil prices last autumn and there are ongoing transportation constraints, as you well know,\" she told the Calgary crowd. \"Escalating trade tariff actions by the U.S. and China\u00a0and\u00a0the related uncertainty\u00a0that's around that has undermined trade and business investment.\"\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough\u00a0for an Alberta audience that has\u00a0also been suffering\u00a0a real estate bust,\u00a0she was not exactly cheery on that subject either.\n\"Housing here at home\u00a0\u2014 the linchpin\u00a0in the recovery since the crisis\u00a0\u2014 has slowed sharply.\"\nAnd there was more. The population was aging. Spending wasn't so hot. The inverted yield curve threatens. Canadians are burdened with red tape. Canada trails competitors in R&D.\n\"Our read of the speech was still-cautious optimism,\" said Brian DePratto in a research note\u00a0from TD\u00a0Economics after Wilkins spoke.\u00a0\nThere was optimism there, but it had to be carefully picked out from amidst the misery.\nWilkins' main optimistic\u00a0point was that many of the worries the bank has are temporary. Despite the danger of continuing trade sniping between the U.S with both China and Europe, the lifting of tariffs between Canada and the U.S. over steel and aluminum is\u00a0a positive sign.\nSome of the best news was not necessarily great for an audience that sees so much of its bread and butter in the oil and gas sector that Wilkins saw fading in relative importance to the Canadian economy.\n\"Recent data\u00a0that we've seen so far suggests that investment\u00a0in the non-energy sector has started off the year in positive territory,\" said Wilkins. \"[Digital] economic activities now make up\u00a0the same share of nominal GDP in Canada as mining, oil and gas combined.\"\nA positive note for Alberta in that regard was that the province had the third biggest digital economy, including within the petroleum sector and in farming.\nAlso among the signs the Canadian economy is not going to hell in a handcart is\u00a0employment.\n\"The labour market has been strong, with solid growth in jobs and steady growth in wages,\" said Wilkins.\nShe said data shows that\u00a0in petroleum and construction, companies are not laying off workers even if they are not giving them as many hours. It is one more indicator to support the bank's contention that employers are expecting the economy to bounce back.\nWhat she did not say to the Calgary audience was that the oil and gas boom, while an enormous contributor to GDP, was not good for the larger Canadian industrial economy.

B.C.-based credit union Central 1 said the same thing about real estate in that province, predicting a 4 per cent drop in prices.\nSo why isn't the Canadian economy in free fall?\nCarolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor\u00a0of the Bank of Canada offered some clues among the conflicting signals in her speech to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce on Thursday.\nToday's GDP numbers offer more clues.\nBut those expecting to feel bucked up by Wilkins may have been disappointed. The talk\u00a0was not exactly a buoyant explanation of why the Canadian economy did not need interest rate cuts.\nPerhaps suffering contagion from Alberta's current gloom, Wilkins' speech was mostly a litany of reasons why the Canadian economy was in trouble.\n\"There was the drop in oil prices last autumn and there are ongoing transportation constraints, as you well know,\" she told the Calgary crowd. \"Escalating trade tariff actions by the U.S. and China\u00a0and\u00a0the related uncertainty\u00a0that's around that has undermined trade and business investment.\"\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough\u00a0for an Alberta audience that has\u00a0also been suffering\u00a0a real estate bust,\u00a0she was not exactly cheery on that subject either.\n\"Housing here at home\u00a0\u2014 the linchpin\u00a0in the recovery since the crisis\u00a0\u2014 has slowed sharply.\"\nAnd there was more. The population was aging. Spending wasn't so hot. The inverted yield curve threatens. Canadians are burdened with red tape. Canada trails competitors in R&D.\n\"Our read of the speech was still-cautious optimism,\" said Brian DePratto in a research note\u00a0from TD\u00a0Economics after Wilkins spoke.\u00a0\nThere was optimism there, but it had to be carefully picked out from amidst the misery.\nWilkins' main optimistic\u00a0point was that many of the worries the bank has are temporary. Despite the danger of continuing trade sniping between the U.S with both China and Europe, the lifting of tariffs between Canada and the U.S. over steel and aluminum is\u00a0a positive sign.\nSome of the best news was not necessarily great for an audience that sees so much of its bread and butter in the oil and gas sector that Wilkins saw fading in relative importance to the Canadian economy.\n\"Recent data\u00a0that we've seen so far suggests that investment\u00a0in the non-energy sector has started off the year in positive territory,\" said Wilkins. \"[Digital] economic activities now make up\u00a0the same share of nominal GDP in Canada as mining, oil and gas combined.\"\nA positive note for Alberta in that regard was that the province had the third biggest digital economy, including within the petroleum sector and in farming.\nAlso among the signs the Canadian economy is not going to hell in a handcart is\u00a0employment.\n\"The labour market has been strong, with solid growth in jobs and steady growth in wages,\" said Wilkins.\nShe said data shows that\u00a0in petroleum and construction, companies are not laying off workers even if they are not giving them as many hours. It is one more indicator to support the bank's contention that employers are expecting the economy to bounce back.\nWhat she did not say to the Calgary audience was that the oil and gas boom, while an enormous contributor to GDP, was not good for the larger Canadian industrial economy. As oil sales rose, so did the\u00a0loonie, pricing industrial producers out of their traditional export markets, leading to relocations and bankruptcies.\nBusinesses outside the main oil-producing regions would not see those heady days return.\nSimilarly Wilkins's boss, Stephen Poloz, himself has pointed out in the past that while house construction may stimulate\u00a0the economy, simply bidding up the prices of houses is not necessarily productive use of capital.\nOutside the West,\u00a0house prices may have stabilized.

Michael Higgins \u2014 one of North America's leading thinkers on Catholic theology and papal politics and the author of a biography of Vanier \u2014 and Colleen Dulle \u2014 a writer at the Jesuit magazine, America \u2014 join Michael Enright to discuss the struggle to reconcile the good works of Vanier with his apparent capacity for evil.\nA daycare in the forest: It's been said that children growing up in urban environments today don't get nearly enough Vitamin N \u2014 that would be nature. La Garderie Nature is doing something about that. It's a daycare centre in the Saguenay region of Quebec where the kids spend their days roaming a forest while their parents are at work. And if they ask for an apple, they'll get a red fruit, not a handheld device. David Gutnick's documentary is called \"At the Beginning, the Forest was a Stranger.\"\nThe surprising, untold stories of the victims of Jack the Ripper: Our culture has a rather grisly fascination with serial killers. They become the subject of fiction and true crime dramas \u2014 some even become a ghoulish kind of cult hero. But there's considerably less interest in the stories of their victims. Hallie Rubenhold flips the script in her award-winning new book \u2014 The Five \u2014 a gripping piece of social history that focuses on the complex lives of the five women murdered by the most notorious serial killer of all, Jack the Ripper.\nMusic for discerning adults \u2014 or Jazz for people who hate jazz: Not everyone shares Michael's passion for jazz, and that's okay. But University of Toronto linguistics professor, jazz expert and Miles Davis biographer Jack Chambers believes passionately that just about anyone could grow to love jazz if they listen with fresh ears and perhaps a little tutelage. Jack joins Michael for the first installment of \"Jazz for People Who Hate Jazz\" with a focus on some masterpieces that reveal the magic and breadth of jazz from Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, Oscar Peterson and others.\nMail: Standardized patients, housing solutions for the homeless\nMusic this week by: Philip Glass, Angele Dubeau, Mozart, Benny Goodman, The Boswell Sisters, John Estacio, Benny Carter, Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, Jane Bunnett, Miles Davis, Sydney Bechet and Oscar Peterson.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Some provinces face huge debt under current policies: PBO report", "description": "Aging population and rising health-care costs will put pressure on provincial budgets", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/provinces-face-huge-debt-pbo-1.5478912", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5138351.1558017262!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/yves-giroux-parliamentary-budget-officer.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 27, 2020 5:29 PM ET", "2020-02-27T22:29:16.284Z"], "source": null, "content": "Parliament's budget watchdog says Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador face huge increases in their long-term debt loads unless they make significant changes to their fiscal policies or get more money from Ottawa.\nParliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux says Saskatchewan and Manitoba, for example, would each need to enact more than $2 billion in spending cuts or tax increases \u2014 or a combination of both \u2014 to keep their debt-to-GDP ratios steady through to the end of the century.\nThat number is roughly eight times what the Manitoba government raised by increasing its provincial sales tax by one point in 2013.\n\"Status quo policies are not sustainable for many jurisdictions, so something's got to give at some point,\" Giroux said in an interview Thursday.\nHis 42-page report points to pressures facing all provinces in the coming decades \u2014 an aging population and rising health-care costs.\nManitoba and Saskatchewan, already running deficits, will face additional challenges because their overall population and economies will see fairly strong growth. The required increase in social spending will outpace federal transfers, the report says.\nIt predicts Manitoba could also get a smaller slice of equalization payments from Ottawa \u2014 money meant to help poorer provinces offer services similar to richer ones. Some eastern provinces might receive a larger share, and British Columbia is likely to start receiving equalization sometime around 2060 due to a slower economy.\nAs a result, Manitoba \"will progressively receive less and less equalization as a proportion of their economy.\"\nPrince Edward Island faces the largest percentage increase in health spending due to its older population, the report says, while Newfoundland and Labrador is expected to see its population decline and economy grow very slowly.\nThe report's projections about government finances are not a prediction of what is most likely to happen, Giroux stressed, but rather a look at what could happen if federal and provincial government policies remain unchanged over the long term.\nProvincial debt loads, which currently range as high as 34 per cent of provincial gross domestic product in the case of Newfoundland and Labrador, could increase dramatically, the report warns. By 2093, Manitoba's could jump to 342 per cent, Saskatchewan's to 253 per cent and Newfoundland and Labrador's to 463 per cent.\nGiroux suggests one alternative to provincial tax increases or spending cuts would be an increase in transfer payments from the federal government. Ottawa currently pays for 21 per cent of provincial health spending, but that number could slip to 17 per cent unless the funding formula is changed.\nAnother possible solution would be for Ottawa to cut its taxes and allow the provinces to raise theirs, Giroux adds.\nThe federal government has fiscal room over the long term despite its current string of deficits, he says, due partly to limits on how quickly federal expenses can rise. Some transfer payments to the provinces are capped by the rate of economic growth. Some payments to individuals, such as old age security, are tied to inflation.\n\"Most expenditures are constrained at the federal level, while at the provincial level, it's demand-driven.\"\n"}, {"author": "Haley Ryan", "title": "Province's employment numbers dropped 25,000 in first impact of COVID-19", "description": "'The health-care problem is one side of this.

Those on layoff and people who had a job starting in the near future are not considered employed.\nThe employment rate \u2014\u00a0the proportion of the population 15\u00a0and older who were employed \u2014 also fell to 53.2 per cent in March. That's the lowest level since\u00a02001.\nEmployment fell nationally by more than one million in March, or 5.3 per cent. The employment rate fell 3.3 percentage points to 58.5 per cent, the lowest rate since 1997.\n\"It was predictable,\" Jordi Morgan, Atlantic vice-president for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said Friday about the numbers. \"They're pretty ugly,\"\nThe reference week used in the national survey was a \"tipping point\" for many\u00a0businesses, Morgan said.\n\"The reality that we are going to see, I think, may be significantly worse when we get into April's results.\"\nMorgan said the CFIB has had \"tens of thousands\" of calls coming in from businesses small to large.\nThere won't be a sector left unaffected by the pandemic, he said.\n\"The stories are distressing,\" Morgan said. \"Even the people who are working, you know, our phones are impacted by this. You have people whose livelihoods\u2014they're seeing it going down the drain. They're afraid. They don't know where to look for help.\"\nAlthough there are many industry associations trying to find answers, Morgan said entrepreneurs need cash now, or other loan programs so they can hang on to their businesses.\nMorgan said the province's offer of rent deferral only pushes people's debt down the road. While he's pleased with the forgivable portion of federal loans, he's heard the province's new grant program is \"insufficient.\"\nHe said\u00a0it's going to take some \"extraordinary\" and innovative measures to make sure everyone pulls through.\n\"The health-care problem is one side of this,\" he said. \"The economic problem is going to have its own victims.\"\nUnemployment also rose in Nova Scotia by 4,800 people, about 10.9 per cent, up to 48,500.\u00a0\nThe unemployment rate \u2014 the percentage of unemployed people in the provincial labour force \u2014 jumped from 8.7 per cent in February to 10.1 per cent in March.\nThe survey also broke down job impacts by industry.\nAccommodation and food services saw employment numbers drop 22 per cent, more than 8,000 people, from 36,900 employees in February to 28,700 in March.\u00a0\nBut Luc Erjavec, Atlantic vice-president of Restaurants Canada, said Friday the reality now is much more bleak.\nThe organization's own survey, conducted March 25-29, shows 24,500 jobs in food service have been lost in Nova Scotia alone.\nThe province's $2.1-billion food-service industry represents 4.6 per cent of the province's GDP. Erjavec expects sales to be down $440 million for the second quarter of 2020.\n\"We're going to be decimated,\" Erjavec said, adding that many full-service restaurants haven't been able to make the jump to takeout or delivery that is now the\u00a0only option.\nErjavec said these job losses and closures have quite the \"ripple effect,\" since each dollar spent in the restaurant industry triggers $1.85 in spending in the rest of the community.\nWhen asked about the Labour Force Survey in the COVID-19 press conference Thursday, Premier Stephen McNeil agreed it has yet to capture the \"full impact\" of what's happening in the province.\nHowever, he thanked those people still out working and following the physical distancing protocols. He added the province is hoping to pull forward infrastructure projects in the coming months to help the economy rebound when restrictions are eased.\n\"I have every bit of confidence that once we see our way through this pandemic, Nova Scotia's entrepreneurs will do what they've always done \u2014 start to rebuild and their government will be there with them,\" McNeil said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U.S. businesses beg Trump not to escalate tariffs on China", "description": "Congress hears that tariffs on imports hurting family businesses, companies of all sizes", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hearings-tariffs-china-imports-1.5178526", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5178579.1560793715!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/us-china-tariffs-companies-voice-alarm.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 17, 2019 2:05 PM ET", "2019-06-17T18:05:14.806Z"], "source": null, "content": "U.S. businesses are imploring President Donald Trump not to expand his tariffs to $300 billion US in goods from China that have so far been spared in his trade war with Beijing.\nThese companies warn that the additional tariffs would drive up prices for consumers, squeeze profits and leave U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage to foreign rivals that aren't subject to higher taxes on the components they buy from China.\nAnd in a sign that commercial combat between the world's two biggest economies is hurting business on both sides of the Pacific, the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei warned that the hostilities with the Trump administration will shrink its expected revenue by $30 billion over the next two years.\nHuawei is at the heart of the trade war that Beijing is engaged in with the Trump administration, which has accused Chinese companies like Huawei of committing forced technology transfers from American companies and stealing their trade secrets. Last month, the U.S. placed Huawei on its \"Entity List,\" which effectively bars American companies from selling components to Huawei without government approval.\nIn the meantime, American businesses, trade groups and individuals are pleading with the administration to drop its threat to tax the remaining Chinese imports that Trump hasn't already hit with tariffs \u2014 or at least spare the particular imports that they and their customers rely on. Some are appearing in person to air their grievances in seven days of hearings in Washington that began Monday.\nA common theme in their pleas is that American businesses \u2014 not China, as Trump often asserts \u2014 must pay the import taxes the president is imposing on Chinese goods. And in the end, many of these companies will pass their higher costs on to their customers.\nTrump has already imposed 25 per cent tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports. The goal is to pressure Beijing to stop stealing American technology, forcing U.S. businesses to hand over trade secrets and unfairly subsidizing Chinese tech companies.\nEleven rounds of negotiations have failed to resolve the dispute over China's aggressive drive to surpass America's technological dominance. Businesses and investors say they hope the negotiations will gain momentum if Trump and President Xi Jinping hold a face-to-face meeting at a Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan in two weeks.\n\"Most businesses are almost praying for a solution,\" said Patrik Berglund, who tracks global trade as the CEO of Xeneta, an Oslo, Norway, a firm that provides data on the shipping industry. \"These things will have enormous consequences. We're so connected in this global world.\"\nThis week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is sure to hear more complaints when he goes to Capitol Hill. Lighthizer is to testify Tuesday to the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday to the House Ways and Means Committee. Lawmakers from both political parties have been increasingly inclined to speak out against Trump's aggressive use of tariffs.\nThey were especially alarmed last month when Trump unexpectedly threatened to impose crippling tariffs on Mexico in a push to stop the flow of Central American migrants into the United States. Trump dropped the tariff threat after Mexico agreed to do more to block the migrants.\nBut the combat with China continues. And Chinese companies are being bruised. Huawei's founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei, likened his company to a \"badly damaged plane\" because of the U.S. actions against it.\nRen said Huawei will reduce capacity and expects revenue of about $100 billion annually for the next two years, compared with $105 billion in 2018. In February, he had said the company was targeting $125 billion in 2019. Huawei's overseas cellphone sales will drop by 40%, Ren predicted.\nThe Trump administration asserts that Huawei poses a national security threat because it is beholden to China's ruling Communist Party. But American officials have presented no evidence of any Huawei equipment serving as intentional conduits for espionage by Beijing. Huawei's placement on the Entity List is widely seen as intended to persuade resistant U.S. allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G.\nThe action against Huawei marked an escalation in a yearlong dispute with China. Trump's earlier tariffs largely spared American consumers by focusing on industrial goods that don't show up directly in the mall or big-box stores. But the new round would inflict financial pain on ordinary households because it will affect many consumer goods, from cellphones and computers to shoes and silk scarves.\n\"There's certainly a lot of business pressure to resolve the China trade wars,\" said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade practice at the law firm Dechert and a former U.S. Commerce Department official.\nShe added: \"The president looks at all of this as a negotiation. As we have seen, sometimes these things have a way of working themselves out as they did with his tariffs on Mexico.\"\nIf Trump does expand his tariffs to all remaining goods from China, though, it could prove costly. A report commissioned by the National Retail Federation found that American consumers would pay an additional $4.4 billion a year for clothing, $2.5 billion more for shoes and $1.6 billion more for household appliances.\nMore broadly, economists say the tariffs could weaken a U.S. economy that appears to be on shakier footing. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said the higher import taxes would leave the United States with 900,000 fewer jobs than it would have had otherwise.\n\"The U.S. economy will be flirting with recession later this year and early next,\" Zandi said.\nJeffrey Pratt, leader of the supply chain practice at the accounting and consulting firm BDO, called the looming tariffs \"a bit of gamechanger\" for his clients. Many can't afford to absorb the taxes themselves and would pass along the higher costs to their customers.\nAtlas PyroVision Entertainment in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, relies on China for 90 per cent of the fireworks it sells.\n\"Simply imposing a 25 per cent tariff will ultimately cause significant harm to our family business,\" CEO Stephen Pelkey said in a filing with the U.S. Trade Representative. \"We would be forced to pass along the increase directly to our customers.\"\nNoting that community non-profits often use the fireworks for Independence Day celebrations, Pelkey wrote: \"In most cases, a 25 per cent hike in price will force their skies to go dark on the 4th of July.\"\nBracing for the new tariffs, Yedi Houseware, a Los Angeles family business, has postponed plans to hire and move into a bigger warehouse. Bobby Djavaheri, a company executive, echoed a common complaint: The administration is taxing products \u2014 in his case, things like air fryers \u2014 that aren't made by American companies. They must be imported. So no U.S. producer benefits from the tariffs; U.S. importers just get socked with a tax.\n\"It's really dumbfounding,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Alexandra Burza", "title": "Federal intellectual property strategy includes $30M to help green tech sector", "description": "Growth in green technology sector is a priority, Min.

In December 2019, the Conference Board of Canada published the \"Economic Impact of the Calgary Stampede,\" documenting that the 10-day Stampede accounts for about half \u2014 $283 million \u2014 of the Calgary Stampede's $541 million total impact on the economy. Year-round events contribute about $110.9 million to Calgary's GDP.)\nBut beyond the money and the bucking broncos, what a lot of people don't realize is that one of Canada's largest and most diverse arts festivals has also just been cancelled.\u00a0\u00a0\nYep, that's the Stampede,\u00a0too.\nWhile the rodeo and chuckwagon races get the majority of the national and international media attention (not always positive), the Stampede is more than a one-trick pony.\u00a0Don't believe me? Let's take a look.\nArt has been part of the Calgary Stampede since its inception in 1912.\nThree visual artists presented and sold their works at the very first Stampede. The most notable of them was Charlie Russell.\nOver the two-week period, 14 of his 20 pieces were sold and, due to overwhelming demand, the Russell exhibit was moved to the Royal Building downtown for a one week continuation at the conclusion of the Stampede.\nThe popularity of his work at the 1912 Stampede inspired him to start his famous RCMP series.\u00a0\nThe Stampede has four music venues and anywhere from 80 to 100 bands performing, creating what is essentially a 10-day music festival.\nThe Coca-Cola Stage showcases over 50 performers (local, national and international) that attract an audience estimated as high as 400,000. Last year, one of the headliners was Feist, not exactly your typical country and western singer-songwriter.\nNashville North attracted another 100,000 or so people in 2019 to listen to 19 different artists.\nThe Big Four Roadhouse, which opened in 2017, hosted 20 bands, attracting another 30,000 people last year.\nAnd the Scotiabank Saddledome hosted concerts by the likes of Sugarland, Tim McGraw and the Zac Brown Band, with a total attendance of 30,000.\nCollectively,\u00a0 the Stampede in 2019 offered over 100 performances, which attracted an estimated audience of more than 500,000 people.\u00a0\nBut wait, there is more.\nThe Window on the West has two stages at the Western Oasis that host 50 or so young local performers, attracting an audience estimated at 5,000. The Weadickville outdoor stage attracts more than 20,000 people to listen to another 30 musicians.\u00a0Throw in the 160-member Calgary Stampede Showband's 100 performances during Stampede, as well as the World Showband Championship, and the attendance at Stampede for music events swells to over 600,000 people.\nWhile some music connoisseurs may scoff at calling the Stampede a music festival, the variety of music and the attendance figures don't lie. It is by far Calgary's biggest music festival, and it showcases more local artists than most major urban music festivals.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it comes to the performing arts, the Stampede Grandstand show engages more than 200 performers in various genres for its two-hour long extravaganza. The show attracts an audience of 160,000 each year, equal to Theatre Calgary's 130,000 annual patrons and Decidedly Jazz's 20,000 patrons combined.\u00a0\nBut it doesn't stop there. The Stampede is also a major visual arts festival with its Western Art Showcase featuring 150 professional artists in a 100,000 square-foot gallery that attracts over 150,000 visitors. This is on par with the Glenbow Museum's attendance for the entire year \u2014 150,735 in 2018.\nIn addition, the Stampede's Maker Market,\u00a0with its 50-plus artisans, draws an audience estimated at more than 100,000 people over the 10 days of Stampede.\nThe Stampede's fun, mixed-media show of quilts, woodworking, drawings, fibre art and even cake decorating, showcases the work of over 150 community artists, and attracts more than 150,000 spectators.\u00a0\nAdd all that up and you have more than 300,000 Calgarians, Albertans, Canadians and international visitors enjoying a quality art experience.\nAgain, Calgary's high-brow culture executives might not see these as cutting-edge art experiences, but from the public's perspective\u00a0they are entertaining and enlightening.\u00a0And I expect for many young people, they are just as inspiring as academic art experiences.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile many of Calgary's arts groups are just now integrating Indigenous artists into their programming, the Calgary Stampede has been doing it for over 100 years.\nThe Elbow River Camp is home to hundreds of Indigenous performances, from drumming to dancing (hoop, jingle, fancy, traditional, grass, buckskin and cowboy special) by more than 1,500 performers.\nThere are five evenings of story-telling, and the Council Tipi has artists doing beadwork, leather work, parfleche and other traditional Indigenous artwork every day.\nIn addition to traditional artwork, in 2019 the Elbow River Camp also had a DJ performing techno music. It is estimated over 100,000 Stampede visitors experienced an Indigenous art performance or watched an art-making demonstration.\nThe Calgary Stampede is a leader when it comes to recognizing and celebrating the history and culture of our First Nation neighbours.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut the Stampede is more than just the 10 days in July.\nStampede Park has three venues that are year-round arts venues: Doherty Hall (capacity 130), BMO Amphitheatre (capacity 800) and the TransAlta Performing Arts Studio (capacity 712).\nThe Big Four Roadhouse is also a year-round music venue attracting about 40,000 patrons outside of the Stampede.\u00a0\nAs well, the TransAlta Studio is home to the Young Canadians, the Calgary Stampede Show Band, the Calgary Stetson Show Band, the Calgary Round-Up Band and the Band of Outriders.\nIt is a training facility for more than a thousand young Calgary musicians and dancers. Next to the Conservatory at Mount Royal University, it is the largest music education institution in Calgary, and one of the largest in Canada.\u00a0\u00a0\nCalgary Arts Academy School opened in 2017 with an enrolment of 300 students as part of the Stampede's Youth Campus initiative, which also included the TransAlta Performing Arts Studio.\u00a0 Plans are also in the works for the Calgary Opera Community Arts Centre to be located on the campus in the future.\nStampede Park is also home to the annual Calgary Expo that attracts over 100,000 people of all ages and backgrounds for four days of celebrating Calgary's vibrant cosplay culture. It is a fun mixture of performance, visual and literary arts.\nAnd Stampede Park is home to 17 significant public artworks \u2014 murals and sculptures, making it on a par with and complementary to the Beltline's Urban Mural Project.\nThere is an online Stampede Park Art Walk brochure, that makes it easy for anyone to explore the park and see the artworks any time.\u00a0\nThe Stampede is Calgary's largest arts organization and Stampede Park is our biggest arts centre, and its year-round operations depend very much on the profits earned during the 10 days of Stampede.\nSo, yes, this year's Stampede will be missed by Calgarians and Albertans of all ages, whether they like the chucks\u00a0or not.\nThis column is an opinion.

A total of\u00a0223 people have recovered.\u00a0\nOf the total number of cases,\u00a0281 people are in hospital with 109\u00a0in intensive care units. The new total represents an increase of 138 cases since Monday.\nDr. Eileen de Villa, the city's medical officer of health, told reporters at a daily news briefing that the city needs to ensure its health care system remains strong because the system\u00a0will have to manage the second wave.\n\"We know that we will experience another COVID-19 wave because we have yet to reach a high level of immunity in our community,\" she said.\n\"We will continue to see COVID-19 spreading in our community until we start to experience herd immunity. This will not happen until many people are infected with COVID-19 and recover and they build immunity that lasts, or we develop a vaccine.\"\nDe Villa, who presented a series of slides to show data about the disease in a larger context,\u00a0noted that the trajectory of COVID-19 cases\u00a0is lower in\u00a0Toronto, Ontario and Canada than it is for such\u00a0countries as Spain and the U.S., which\u00a0have seen a large number of cases\u00a0since outbreaks began.\n\"We believe, at this point, that the number of cases to date in Canada, Ontario and locally in Toronto is lower than originally forecasted. This is due in part to the strong public health measures that were put in place early in our outbreak and the fact that our residents took these measures seriously,\" she said.\n\"Thank you everyone for following the advice to stay home and practise physical distancing. I know it has been difficult but I hope you are now seeing the benefits of these actions.\"\nDe Villa added the city is currently in the \"peak period\" of its\u00a0community outbreak, but how long that period will last remains a question.\n\"I use the term 'peak period'\u00a0because a peak is really not just one day, nor is it one number, as the number of cases on any day during the peak will vary. The reality is that we will only know when we have hit our peak for COVID-19 cases after it has passed,\" she said.\nThe data shows the actual number of cases experienced in Toronto over time.\u00a0\nDe Villa said data\u00a0helps the city\u00a0understand how it has\u00a0used the resources of the\u00a0healthcare system resources during the outbreak.\u00a0The data also shows the curve currently flattening.\nShe added that the city can track\u00a0the impact of the collective work being done\u00a0to prevent the health care system from being overburdened. As the city moves down the curve, the data helps Toronto Public Health to plan and when to ease physical distancing measures, she said.\n\"It is critical that we ensure that we have healthcare resources and capacity in place to manage outbreaks we are seeing among vulnerable groups including our long-term care homes and shelter settings,\" she said.\nThe data shows\u00a0the number of hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and deaths to date.\nThe final slide, according to De Villa,\u00a0shows the\u00a0\"tale of the two outbreaks\" in the city.\nDe Villa noted that females represent about 60 per cent of the cases in long-term care homes, retirement homes, chronic care and hospital settings, a fact she attributed to females living on average longer than males and making up a larger proportion of the people in these settings. Women are also more likely to be employed in these places, she said.\nDe Villa said the city will continue to see COVID-19 spreading in its long-term care homes, which are experiencing their own distinct outbreaks.\n\"We should expect to see more cases in these settings,\" De Villa said.\nTwo institutions, in particular, are recording significant outbreaks. Eatonville Care Centre, a privately run long-term care home in Etobicoke, has 144 cases and has recorded 34\u00a0deaths. Meanwhile, Willowdale Welcome Centre, a shelter for refugees in North York, has 110 positive cases.\nMayor John Tory says the city has received a shipment of three million surgical masks that will be used primarily in long-term care homes and shelters for people experiencing homelessness.\nThe city ordered the masks from AMG Medical Inc., a distributor based in Montreal, and the masks\u00a0arrived in two shipments. The first shipment of one million\u00a0arrived on April 17, while the final shipment of two million\u00a0arrived on Tuesday.\n\"The new masks have been inspected and staff have confirmed masks are as ordered and have passed inspection,\" Tory said.\nBefore the city received the shipment, the city had enough surgical masks to last 52 days at the current consumption rate and 25 days in the worst case scenario. The new inventory means the city has about 127 days worth of stock at the current consumption rate and about 60 more days\u00a0in the worst case scenario.\nIn a news release, the city said it continuing to look for suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\"This new influx of PPE will ensure staff can continue to help the most vulnerable Torontonians in our shelters and long-term care facilities,\" the city said in a news release on Tuesday.\nIn a joint statement, the mayors of municipalities in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) said it is estimated that the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area alone is projected to lose 355,000 jobs because of COVID-19.\nThat number represents 28 per cent of GDP, along with with $894 million in lost wages and $3.7 billion in revenue losses for businesses.\n\"This will be felt right across the GTHA but it also threatens the provincial and national economies,\" the mayors said in the statement.\nTory said the mayors and chairs met by video conference on Tuesday to discuss the impacts of COVID-19 on the region and how they can work together to get the economy restarted when the time comes.\u00a0\nTory noted that the time will be determined not by politics, but by science and under the guidance of public health officials.\n\"A strong recovery right here in the GTHA is crucial to healing the economic damage done by COVID-19 and helping the families and businesses all governments have been working to protect throughout this emergency,\" the statement reads.\n\"Ontario's economy and Canada's economy need the GTHA to come back stronger than ever when the restart begins.\"\nToday I met by video conference with the Mayors and Regional Chairs of the GTHA to discuss the impacts of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> on the region and how our municipalities can work together on an a united regional economic restart and recovery. <a href=\"https://t.co/y5At92MHHk\">pic.twitter.com/y5At92MHHk</a>\nTory said the mayors and chairs agreed that they need to work together to reopen the economy, to share information about their respective financial positions and to explore\u00a0ways to obtain financial support from other governments.  \"A strong recovery needs strong cities and strong regions,\" Tory said.\nThe TTC and Toronto Paramedic Services, meanwhile, have repurposed five decommissioned TTC buses to transport ambulatory and stretcher-bound patients, including\u00a0those on ventilators.\nEach bus can transport three stretcher-bound patients, eight to ten ambulatory patients, depending on space needed for physical distancing, and three paramedics and a driver, the city said in a news release on Tuesday.\n\"The converted buses represent a key component of the city's contingency planning to support seamless, efficient, and timely patient care, while also providing important surge capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the city said.\nCrews completed modifications to three vehicles on Monday and the city said the emergency transport buses\u00a0will soon be on the road, responding to calls as needed. Modifications to two more buses are underway.\nTTC\u00a0bus drivers will drive the vehicles, while paramedics will tend to the needs of patients.\n\"I am extremely proud of the innovation and cooperation across our city government to fight COVID-19,\" Tory said.\n"}, {"author": "Ian Froese", "title": "Why Manitoba's middle-of-the-road economy cannot weather a pandemic on its own", "description": "Premier Brian Pallister wants Manitoba to be the 1st province to reopen", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-middle-of-the-road-economy-pandemic-diversified-1.5539574", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5529526.1586554773!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/empty-downtown-winnipeg.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 22, 2020 3:00 AM CT", "2020-04-22T08:00:00.872Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of\u00a0The COVID Economy,\u00a0a CBC News series looking at how the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic is affecting jobs, manufacturing and business in regions across Canada.\nIt's become clich\u00e9 to describe Manitoba's economy as diverse, but that's what is giving\u00a0Manitobans\u00a0solace as the province's economy is put through the wringer in a global pandemic\nAn assorted blend of industries from agriculture to manufacturing and transportation have previously cushioned the middle province from the economic blows of provinces more vulnerable to the whims of single industries, such as oil.\nAnd that economic track record has given officials the belief they can weather the financial toll of COVID-19.\nPremier Brian Pallister has clung to economic forecasts carrying the same optimism, citing one model last week from RBC that predicted Manitoba's gross domestic product would collapse\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but not as badly as any other province.\n\"We are projected by most of the analysts, whether in banks or bond rating companies, to be the province that is best positioned to come back from this pandemic, and we are going to make that happen,\" Pallister said on Tuesday.\nOne economist behind the RBC forecast, however, suggests that provincial rankings are nearly meaningless.\n\"I think we're starting to split hairs here,\" said senior economist Robert Hogue, whose report pegs Manitoba's GDP as dropping 3.7 per cent this year, compared to a 1.1 per cent increase in 2019. Still, he projects Manitoba's economy will perform\u00a0better relative to other provinces\u00a0due to its diversification.\nHogue said the grim picture demonstrates how quickly\u00a0the economy collapsed in the month since officials urged isolation to quell the spread of COVID-19.\nAll non-essential businesses have been closed for\u00a0three weeks and counting, while 60,000 people are believed to have filed for employment insurance, finance minister Scott Fielding said. The province said in a background document last week 26.7 per cent of the labour market is either temporarily laid off or unemployed.\nThe question now is whether Manitoba's previously steady-as-she-goes economy can withstand an economic shock more unsettling than any downturn since the Great Depression.\nIt can in the short term, says University of Winnipeg economics professor Phil Cyrenne, while the province has a higher proportion of employees in goods-producing businesses and the public sector.\n\"But in the long-term, you need to have a vibrant private sector.\"\nManitoba's economy began to slow down in mid-March, shortly after the\u00a0first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 12.\nRead other stories in the series:\nBuoyed by lower case numbers than less populated provinces like Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia, Pallister says he wants to be the first province to safely reopen the economy.\u00a0\nBut the toll of the shutdown will be significant even if it is short,\u00a0Cyrenne said.\nHe wonders if private businesses, especially in the battered restaurant and hospitality industries, can survive, and worries whether\u00a0civil servants will lose work as an austerity-minded province teases layoffs.\nAnd he questions if a have-not province like Manitoba will face shrinking transfer payments from the federal government. Cyrenne mused Ottawa may cut transfers,\u00a0the way it did in the 1990s, to control spiralling costs.\n\"That whole system, I think, is going to be in jeopardy\u00a0\u2014 or at least there's going to be lots of strains on it going forward.\"\nThe Progressive Conservative government under Pallister spent its initial four years in government striving to whittle down its deficit from $850 million to an estimated $220 million by the end of this fiscal year.\nIt has pushed austerity during the pandemic, as well, relying on the federal government to provide financial aid for struggling individuals and businesses, while calling on provincial departments and public-funded bodies to cut non-essential costs.\nThe province is now expecting a year-end deficit as high as $5 billion\u00a0due to a combination of soaring health-care costs and slumping revenues amid the pandemic.\u00a0\nStefan\u00a0Dodds, another economist from the University of Winnipeg, said a diverse economy alone doesn't make Manitoba immune to financial woes.\n\"We're going to need support from different levels of government, specifically the federal government, to allow us to do the borrowing we need to do to support our public services and get us through this crisis in the short term,\" he said.\nThe province, though, has been reluctant to borrow, with Pallister saying on Monday, \"We can't just borrow our way out of this mess.\"\u00a0\nHis government has threatened layoffs if Ottawa doesn't agree to let civil servants on reduced hours collect employment insurance. So far, the federal government isn't willing to pick up that\u00a0tab.\n\"I think Manitoba does face some pretty serious kind of short-term fiscal pressures,\" Dodds said.\nThe Conference Board of Canada, which forecasts Manitoba's economy will contract by 3.9 per cent this year, attributes the province's economy downgrade, in part, to declines in transportation equipment manufacturing.\nAs one example, Dodds referenced bus manufacturer NFI Group Inc. permanently laying off 300 employees and temporarily halting production at its facilities, leaving\u00a0at least hundreds more people without work for the time being.\nOther big Manitoba employers have cut staff:\u00a0Winnipeg-based Dufresne\u00a0Furniture and Appliances has temporarily laid off 1,000 employees across several provinces, and Palliser Furniture let go of 500 Winnipeg staff in the short-term.\n\"Whether you serve your domestic market or an international market, we've seen demand really drop off a cliff,\" said Conference Board of Canada economist Alicia Macdonald.\nRon Koslowsky, vice-president of the Manitoba division of the Canadian Manufacturers and\u00a0Exporters, said the manufacturing sector is \"surprisingly still holding its own.\"\u00a0\nFood production is booming, and dozens of manufacturers have pivoted to making personal protective equipment for the health care field, he said, but depressed demand for transport and aerospace manufacturing is unmistakable.\n\"There's no question that some [companies] will be altered,\" Koslowsky said. \"Some may not be around, although I don't think they'll be that many, unless things really tank.\"\nManitoba Finance Minister Scott Fielding said he's encouraged the province is moving toward loosening\u00a0business restrictions after repeated days of few, or

coronavirus infections in the city.\nThe city now has a total of 3,820 cases, which includes\u00a03,462 confirmed and\u00a0358 classified as probable. A total of\u00a0223 people have recovered.\u00a0\nOf the total number of cases,\u00a0281 people are in hospital with 109\u00a0in intensive care units. The new total represents an increase of 138 cases since Monday.\nDr. Eileen de Villa, the city's medical officer of health, told reporters at a daily news briefing that the city needs to ensure its health care system remains strong because the system\u00a0will have to manage the second wave.\n\"We know that we will experience another COVID-19 wave because we have yet to reach a high level of immunity in our community,\" she said.\n\"We will continue to see COVID-19 spreading in our community until we start to experience herd immunity. This will not happen until many people are infected with COVID-19 and recover and they build immunity that lasts, or we develop a vaccine.\"\nDe Villa, who presented a series of slides to show data about the disease in a larger context,\u00a0noted that the trajectory of COVID-19 cases\u00a0is lower in\u00a0Toronto, Ontario and Canada than it is for such\u00a0countries as Spain and the U.S., which\u00a0have seen a large number of cases\u00a0since outbreaks began.\n\"We believe, at this point, that the number of cases to date in Canada, Ontario and locally in Toronto is lower than originally forecasted. This is due in part to the strong public health measures that were put in place early in our outbreak and the fact that our residents took these measures seriously,\" she said.\n\"Thank you everyone for following the advice to stay home and practise physical distancing. I know it has been difficult but I hope you are now seeing the benefits of these actions.\"\nDe Villa added the city is currently in the \"peak period\" of its\u00a0community outbreak, but how long that period will last remains a question.\n\"I use the term 'peak period'\u00a0because a peak is really not just one day, nor is it one number, as the number of cases on any day during the peak will vary. The reality is that we will only know when we have hit our peak for COVID-19 cases after it has passed,\" she said.\nThe data shows the actual number of cases experienced in Toronto over time.\u00a0\nDe Villa said data\u00a0helps the city\u00a0understand how it has\u00a0used the resources of the\u00a0healthcare system resources during the outbreak.\u00a0The data also shows the curve currently flattening.\nShe added that the city can track\u00a0the impact of the collective work being done\u00a0to prevent the health care system from being overburdened. As the city moves down the curve, the data helps Toronto Public Health to plan and when to ease physical distancing measures, she said.\n\"It is critical that we ensure that we have healthcare resources and capacity in place to manage outbreaks we are seeing among vulnerable groups including our long-term care homes and shelter settings,\" she said.\nThe data shows\u00a0the number of hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and deaths to date.\nThe final slide, according to De Villa,\u00a0shows the\u00a0\"tale of the two outbreaks\" in the city.\nDe Villa noted that females represent about 60 per cent of the cases in long-term care homes, retirement homes, chronic care and hospital settings, a fact she attributed to females living on average longer than males and making up a larger proportion of the people in these settings. Women are also more likely to be employed in these places, she said.\nDe Villa said the city will continue to see COVID-19 spreading in its long-term care homes, which are experiencing their own distinct outbreaks.\n\"We should expect to see more cases in these settings,\" De Villa said.\nTwo institutions, in particular, are recording significant outbreaks. Eatonville Care Centre, a privately run long-term care home in Etobicoke, has 144 cases and has recorded 34\u00a0deaths. Meanwhile, Willowdale Welcome Centre, a shelter for refugees in North York, has 110 positive cases.\nMayor John Tory says the city has received a shipment of three million surgical masks that will be used primarily in long-term care homes and shelters for people experiencing homelessness.\nThe city ordered the masks from AMG Medical Inc., a distributor based in Montreal, and the masks\u00a0arrived in two shipments. The first shipment of one million\u00a0arrived on April 17, while the final shipment of two million\u00a0arrived on Tuesday.\n\"The new masks have been inspected and staff have confirmed masks are as ordered and have passed inspection,\" Tory said.\nBefore the city received the shipment, the city had enough surgical masks to last 52 days at the current consumption rate and 25 days in the worst case scenario. The new inventory means the city has about 127 days worth of stock at the current consumption rate and about 60 more days\u00a0in the worst case scenario.\nIn a news release, the city said it continuing to look for suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\"This new influx of PPE will ensure staff can continue to help the most vulnerable Torontonians in our shelters and long-term care facilities,\" the city said in a news release on Tuesday.\nIn a joint statement, the mayors of municipalities in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) said it is estimated that the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area alone is projected to lose 355,000 jobs because of COVID-19.\nThat number represents 28 per cent of GDP, along with with $894 million in lost wages and $3.7 billion in revenue losses for businesses.\n\"This will be felt right across the GTHA but it also threatens the provincial and national economies,\" the mayors said in the statement.\nTory said the mayors and chairs met by video conference on Tuesday to discuss the impacts of COVID-19 on the region and how they can work together to get the economy restarted when the time comes.\u00a0\nTory noted that the time will be determined not by politics, but by science and under the guidance of public health officials.\n\"A strong recovery right here in the GTHA is crucial to healing the economic damage done by COVID-19 and helping the families and businesses all governments have been working to protect throughout this emergency,\" the statement reads.\n\"Ontario's economy and Canada's economy need the GTHA to come back stronger than ever when the restart begins.\"\nToday I met by video conference with the Mayors and Regional Chairs of the GTHA to discuss the impacts of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> on the region and how our municipalities can work together on an a united regional economic restart and recovery. <a href=\"https://t.co/y5At92MHHk\">pic.twitter.com/y5At92MHHk</a>\nTory said the mayors and chairs agreed that they need to work together to reopen the economy, to share information about their respective financial positions and to explore\u00a0ways to obtain financial support from other governments.  \"A strong recovery needs strong cities and strong regions,\" Tory said.\nThe TTC and Toronto Paramedic Services, meanwhile, have repurposed five decommissioned TTC buses to transport ambulatory and stretcher-bound patients, including\u00a0those on ventilators.\nEach bus can transport three stretcher-bound patients, eight to ten ambulatory patients, depending on space needed for physical distancing, and three paramedics and a driver, the city said in a news release on Tuesday.\n\"The converted buses represent a key component of the city's contingency planning to support seamless, efficient, and timely patient care, while also providing important surge capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the city said.\nCrews completed modifications to three vehicles on Monday and the city said the emergency transport buses\u00a0will soon be on the road, responding to calls as needed. Modifications to two more buses are underway.\nTTC\u00a0bus drivers will drive the vehicles, while paramedics will tend to the needs of patients.\n\"I am extremely proud of the innovation and cooperation across our city government to fight COVID-19,\" Tory said.\n"}, {"author": "Ian Froese", "title": "Why Manitoba's middle-of-the-road economy cannot weather a pandemic on its own", "description": "Premier Brian Pallister wants Manitoba to be the 1st province to reopen", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-middle-of-the-road-economy-pandemic-diversified-1.5539574", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5529526.1586554773!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/empty-downtown-winnipeg.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 22, 2020 3:00 AM CT", "2020-04-22T08:00:00.872Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of\u00a0The COVID Economy,\u00a0a CBC News series looking at how the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic is affecting jobs, manufacturing and business in regions across Canada.\nIt's become clich\u00e9 to describe Manitoba's economy as diverse, but that's what is giving\u00a0Manitobans\u00a0solace as the province's economy is put through the wringer in a global pandemic\nAn assorted blend of industries from agriculture to manufacturing and transportation have previously cushioned the middle province from the economic blows of provinces more vulnerable to the whims of single industries, such as oil.\nAnd that economic track record has given officials the belief they can weather the financial toll of COVID-19.\nPremier Brian Pallister has clung to economic forecasts carrying the same optimism, citing one model last week from RBC that predicted Manitoba's gross domestic product would collapse\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but not as badly as any other province.\n\"We are projected by most of the analysts, whether in banks or bond rating companies, to be the province that is best positioned to come back from this pandemic, and we are going to make that happen,\" Pallister said on Tuesday.\nOne economist behind the RBC forecast, however, suggests that provincial rankings are nearly meaningless.\n\"I think we're starting to split hairs here,\" said senior economist Robert Hogue, whose report pegs Manitoba's GDP as dropping 3.7 per cent this year, compared to a 1.1 per cent increase in 2019. Still, he projects Manitoba's economy will perform\u00a0better relative to other provinces\u00a0due to its diversification.\nHogue said the grim picture demonstrates how quickly\u00a0the economy collapsed in the month since officials urged isolation to quell the spread of COVID-19.\nAll non-essential businesses have been closed for\u00a0three weeks and counting, while 60,000 people are believed to have filed for employment insurance, finance minister Scott Fielding said. The province said in a background document last week 26.7 per cent of the labour market is either temporarily laid off or unemployed.\nThe question now is whether Manitoba's previously steady-as-she-goes economy can withstand an economic shock more unsettling than any downturn since the Great Depression.\nIt can in the short term, says University of Winnipeg economics professor Phil Cyrenne, while the province has a higher proportion of employees in goods-producing businesses and the public sector.\n\"But in the long-term, you need to have a vibrant private sector.\"\nManitoba's economy began to slow down in mid-March, shortly after the\u00a0first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 12.\nRead other stories in the series:\nBuoyed by lower case numbers than less populated provinces like Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia, Pallister says he wants to be the first province to safely reopen the economy.\u00a0\nBut the toll of the shutdown will be significant even if it is short,\u00a0Cyrenne said.\nHe wonders if private businesses, especially in the battered restaurant and hospitality industries, can survive, and worries whether\u00a0civil servants will lose work as an austerity-minded province teases layoffs.\nAnd he questions if a have-not province like Manitoba will face shrinking transfer payments from the federal government. Cyrenne mused Ottawa may cut transfers,\u00a0the way it did in the 1990s, to control spiralling costs.\n\"That whole system, I think, is going to be in jeopardy\u00a0\u2014 or at least there's going to be lots of strains on it going forward.\"\nThe Progressive Conservative government under Pallister spent its initial four years in government striving to whittle down its deficit from $850 million to an estimated $220 million by the end of this fiscal year.\nIt has pushed austerity during the pandemic, as well, relying on the federal government to provide financial aid for struggling individuals and businesses, while calling on provincial departments and public-funded bodies to cut non-essential costs.\nThe province is now expecting a year-end deficit as high as $5 billion\u00a0due to a combination of soaring health-care costs and slumping revenues amid the pandemic.\u00a0\nStefan\u00a0Dodds, another economist from the University of Winnipeg, said a diverse economy alone doesn't make Manitoba immune to financial woes.\n\"We're going to need support from different levels of government, specifically the federal government, to allow us to do the borrowing we need to do to support our public services and get us through this crisis in the short term,\" he said.\nThe province, though, has been reluctant to borrow, with Pallister saying on Monday, \"We can't just borrow our way out of this mess.\"\u00a0\nHis government has threatened layoffs if Ottawa doesn't agree to let civil servants on reduced hours collect employment insurance. So far, the federal government isn't willing to pick up that\u00a0tab.\n\"I think Manitoba does face some pretty serious kind of short-term fiscal pressures,\" Dodds said.\nThe Conference Board of Canada, which forecasts Manitoba's economy will contract by 3.9 per cent this year, attributes the province's economy downgrade, in part, to declines in transportation equipment manufacturing.\nAs one example, Dodds referenced bus manufacturer NFI Group Inc. permanently laying off 300 employees and temporarily halting production at its facilities, leaving\u00a0at least hundreds more people without work for the time being.\nOther big Manitoba employers have cut staff:\u00a0Winnipeg-based Dufresne\u00a0Furniture and Appliances has temporarily laid off 1,000 employees across several provinces, and Palliser Furniture let go of 500 Winnipeg staff in the short-term.\n\"Whether you serve your domestic market or an international market, we've seen demand really drop off a cliff,\" said Conference Board of Canada economist Alicia Macdonald.\nRon Koslowsky, vice-president of the Manitoba division of the Canadian Manufacturers and\u00a0Exporters, said the manufacturing sector is \"surprisingly still holding its own.\"\u00a0\nFood production is booming, and dozens of manufacturers have pivoted to making personal protective equipment for the health care field, he said, but depressed demand for transport and aerospace manufacturing is unmistakable.\n\"There's no question that some [companies] will be altered,\" Koslowsky said. \"Some may not be around, although I don't think they'll be that many, unless things really tank.\"\nManitoba Finance Minister Scott Fielding said he's encouraged the province is moving toward loosening\u00a0business restrictions after repeated days of few, or no, new cases of COVID-19.\nIt doesn't mean the recovery, or the road to get there, will be painless, he said.\n\"Listen, I don't want to sugar-coat this and say somehow this is going to be easy for anyone,\" Fielding said in an interview.\n\"When you have the amount of people, the businesses that are completely shut down or partially shut down, the unemployment rate ... it's going to be some tough times for Manitobans, and really all Canadians,\" he said.\nFielding also mentioned Manitoba's diversified economy, and his hope in a financial system that has evaded the economic busts, but also the booms.\n"}, {"author": "Kevin Yarr", "title": "P.E.I. has yet to have a COVID-19 hospitalization but hasn't dodged the economic impact of pandemic", "description": "Province's agriculture, fisheries and tourism have been hurt during crisis", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-economy-covid-19-pandemic-1.5550456", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4199908.1499800209!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/parks-canada-pei-beach-summer.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["May 01, 2020 5:00 AM AT", "2020-05-01T08:00:00.730Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of The COVID Economy, a CBC News series looking at how the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic is affecting jobs, manufacturing and business in regions across Canada.\nPrince Edward Island\u00a0has so far gotten off lightly on the public health front of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it's anticipated that\u00a0the province will suffer along with other Canadian provinces economically.\nAt the end of April,\u00a0the province had\u00a0seen just 27 cases of COVID-19, with no hospitalizations. Bank economists, generally, are forecasting the island's GDP will drop less than the Canadian average this year, but the corresponding recovery will not be as strong in 2021, either.\nFigures from Statistics Canada showed a big drop in employment in March, and provincial projections suggest it'll be worse in April. Those projections\u00a0estimated lockdown restrictions\u00a0to control the coronavirus will mean one in four people working at the beginning of March would have lost those jobs some time in April.\nThe provincial economy is cushioned somewhat by a large public service, not just with local\u00a0governments but also the Department of Veterans Affairs in Charlottetown and a federal tax centre in Summerside, P.E.I.\nThree of the four main private industries faced significant issues immediately. The fourth, aerospace, has reported it is still busy, with its biggest problem being accommodating physical distancing in the workplace.\nThe province's three traditional economic pillars \u2014\u00a0agriculture, fisheries and tourism \u2014 have not fared so well.\nWith restaurant dining rooms closed across the continent, demand for french fries has collapsed. That leaves Cavendish Farms, P.E.I.'s biggest private employer, short on markets for its products, and it's telling farmers it will not be buying so many potatoes this year.\nThree of the Island's biggest exports \u2014 lobster, oysters\u00a0and mussels \u2014 also rely heavily on the restaurant market. Season starts have been delayed in hopes that markets will recover.\nWhile the downturn in those markets\u00a0is dramatic, it is likely short term. For tourism, not only will the dip likely be deeper, the questions about recovery are more complicated.\nTourism has been hot on the Island since 2014. The industry posted records in total overnight stays in five of the six years. It was expecting another record this year.\n\"There was all kinds of great plans in place based on what was going to happen this year,\" said Kirk Nicholson, president of the Tourism Industry Association of Prince Edward Island.\n\"Airport seat capacity was going to be up. All indications were rubber tire traffic was going to be strong. Everything was looking good. So, we had a plan based on that. And now it's\u00a0a plan\u00a0based on, 'We don't know.'\"\nEven in the deep off-season of January and February that optimism was apparent. Job numbers in accommodations and food service were up more than seven per cent over the same period in\u00a02019, according to Statistics Canada. The crash in March took them 17 per cent lower than the previous year.\nUnlike potatoes and fisheries, which can scan around for other markets, tourism is stuck. The province is closed. Non-essential travellers are banned by a state-of-emergency order. An infrastructure that served 1.6 million visitors\u00a0in 2019 has only the 158,000 Island residents to rely on.\nOn Tuesday, the province released a plan for easing restrictions. It did not include any relaxing of border controls until at least early July.\nCurrently, even the small local customer base is highly constrained. With restaurants relying on pickup and delivery only, the P.E.I. Restaurant Association estimates the sector is running between five and 10 per cent capacity.\nAssociation president Carl Nicholson (no relation to Kirk) said it is probably just as well that some restaurants have just chosen to close down temporarily, rather than eke what they can out of the market.\n\"If everybody was in the marketplace right now that had been open,\" he said, \"I would think that not a lot of them would survive.\"\nEven when dining rooms do open, Nicholson said, with many Islanders having lost income in the pandemic eating out may not be a priority.\nWhile international borders may not open in time for this tourist season, several provinces have begun to discuss easing restrictions.\nInternational markets have been an important source of growth for P.E.I. tourism in the last six years, but Canadian travellers remain the bread and butter of the industry. In 2019, visitors from Canada accounted for 89 per cent of total overnight stays.\nThere are several hurdles to getting people from other provinces to visit the Island this summer. First, and perhaps most importantly, is it a good idea to even allow it?\nEpidemiologists interviewed by CBC News said the Island's ability to control borders is a huge advantage in keeping infections down, and one the province should not give up lightly.\nSecond, if the borders are open, will people come?\nA poll this month by Angus Reid found that pandemic restrictions have people missing more homey things than travel.\n\"We had presumed that lots of folks would be eager and keen to maybe book\u00a0a\u00a0vacation, book a trip,\" said Sachi Kurl, executive director of\u00a0Angus Reid Institute.\n\"But that's fairly low on the list relative to going back to work, hugging friends and family members, going to a restaurant. So the lifting of restrictions with the so-called return-to-normal is something that is predicated very much, I think, on initially for Canadians a fairly small circle of movement.\"\nPart of the difficulty, Kurl\u00a0says, is that governments in Canada have done such a good job of convincing Canadians that the restrictions are necessary.\nIt was not a lesson that took immediately. Early polls found Canadians skeptical about the restrictions, but within weeks public opinion had turned around to support them.\n\"Canadians got the message very thoroughly from their public health officials. They've been scared straight, and it will take some time to unwind them from that,\" said Kurl.\n\"Don't travel. Don't even leave your house. [Consider] the steps involved in taking a trip and trying to preserve hygiene. So leaving your house, standing on a plane, sitting next to somebody on a plane, staying in a hotel. These are all things that are quite antithetical to what we have made the new normal.\"\nGovernments will have to be as convincing that it is now safe to go out in public as they were in telling people they had to stay home, she said.\nCarl Nicholson says\u00a0he believes most\u00a0restaurant\u00a0operators will be in survival mode in 2020, just trying to get through the year and hoping for better in 2021.\n\"Cover off your rent and your insurance and your wages and your food costs and, you know, all of those fixed things. There's no excess in the marketplace,\" he said.\nThe provincial government is providing assistance to small businesses in the form of low-interest loans. Fred Bergman at the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council said business owners will have to think carefully before they take advantage of that offer.\n\"Let's say in 18 months everything does go back to normal, somehow, and we all will be back to 100 per cent. Even in that world, they normally have to borrow working capital,\" said Bergman.\n\"Now they're loaded up with more debt. You see the financial issue that that can create for some businesses\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the ones that aren't fortunate enough to have some sales over the coming year.\"\nKirk Nicholson at the tourism industry association is certain some businesses will not survive to see the 2021 tourist season.\nAnd, if travellers remain nervous, even success next year is not a given. University of Prince Edward Island economist Jim Sentance\u00a0said\u00a0P.E.I. may be well positioned to take advantage of what market for tourism does exist.\n\"Given that places like the United States are not going to be attractive destinations, the way things are going down there, you might get more Canadians diverted from going somewhere else to coming here,\" said Sentance.\n\"In particular, if P.EI. weathers this fairly well and can have a reputation as being a relatively safe place.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada Pension Plan board president says the retirement fund is safe, despite economic downturn", "description": "\u2018This is one thing they should take off their list to worry about,\u2019 says Mark Machin", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-april-3-2020-1.5520333/canada-pension-plan-board-president-says-the-retirement-fund-is-safe-despite-economic-downturn-1.5520544", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5521335.1585945019!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cppib-canada-pension-20200214.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 03, 2020 5:41 PM ET", "2020-04-06T13:44:00.561Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Read Story Transcript\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the global economy, the president of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board says Canadians' CPP contributions are safe.\n\"This is one thing they should take off their list to worry about,\" said Mark Machin.\u00a0\n\"The fund is in strong shape.

So how is it that the CPPIB would be insulated by that?\nThe money we manage isn't completely insulated. So obviously as markets go down, it's likely that the funds that we have will go down. But we do a number of things.\u00a0\nFirst of all, we diversified the monies. We haven't got all our eggs in one particular market or one particular type of investment, and that provides some cushion.\u00a0\nFor example, generally when the stock market goes down, the government bond market will strengthen. That provides some offsets.\u00a0\nHow much of our money is invested in oil and gas? Because we've seen the price of oil, again, drop lower and lower and lower. The gas sector taking a huge hit as well.\u00a0\nNot so much. About 3 per cent of the fund overall is exposed to that sector. So it's not a huge amount.\u00a0\nWhere are you investing the pension money of Canadians?\nSo it's invested broadly around the world, which helps.\u2026 We're invested in the rest of North America, Russia, South America, Europe and we're invested in Asia. We're invested in bonds and we're also invested in private assets like infrastructure \u2014 relatively safe things, generally on the infrastructure front, like roads and ports and electricity and those types of things.\nWhat are [the] industries that are doing better now than others? Because it seems as though, from a distance, that everybody is taking this hit.\nThere are industries that are doing fine.

So how is it that the CPPIB would be insulated by that?\nThe money we manage isn't completely insulated. So obviously as markets go down, it's likely that the funds that we have will go down. But we do a number of things.\u00a0\nFirst of all, we diversified the monies. We haven't got all our eggs in one particular market or one particular type of investment, and that provides some cushion.\u00a0\nFor example, generally when the stock market goes down, the government bond market will strengthen. That provides some offsets.\u00a0\nHow much of our money is invested in oil and gas? Because we've seen the price of oil, again, drop lower and lower and lower. The gas sector taking a huge hit as well.\u00a0\nNot so much. About 3 per cent of the fund overall is exposed to that sector. So it's not a huge amount.\u00a0\nWhere are you investing the pension money of Canadians?\nSo it's invested broadly around the world, which helps.\u2026 We're invested in the rest of North America, Russia, South America, Europe and we're invested in Asia. We're invested in bonds and we're also invested in private assets like infrastructure \u2014 relatively safe things, generally on the infrastructure front, like roads and ports and electricity and those types of things.\nWhat are [the] industries that are doing better now than others?

It's projected to fall to $11.6 billion by 2024-2025, with the size of the debt relative to the economy remaining flat for the next few years.\nIn a news conference on Parliament Hill, Morneau\u00a0defended the plan to carry ongoing deficits, saying it's necessary to ensure Canadians reap the benefits of a strong economy, including the residents of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador who are experiencing economic anxieties.\n\"We know that in order to ensure we continue on this positive trajectory, the strong economy that we've seen, the very strong employment numbers, that we should be continuing to invest at an appropriate level, and that's what we are doing with this economic and fiscal update and with the campaign that we ran on,\" he said.\nThe update shows an increase of nearly $10 billion in spending since the spring budget, including nearly $5 billion for employee pension and benefits adjustments, nearly $2 billion for a new revenue agreement on the Hibernia oil project in Newfoundland and Labrador\u00a0and\u00a0millions in compensation for dairy farmers harmed by new trade deals.\nThe government announced a $1.75-billion compensation package for dairy farmers in August, of which $345 million was to be paid out in the first year.\nSome of the government's spending is offset by $1.7 billion in increased tax revenue.\nNearly 400,000 new jobs have been created so far in 2019 \u2014 Canada's\u00a0strongest rate of growth since 2007, according to the Department of Finance.\nBut not all parts of the country are experiencing the benefits of that growth;\u00a0Canada's oil-producing provinces are\u00a0still feeling the pinch.\n\"Insufficient export pipeline infrastructure is reducing Canadian crude oil and natural gas prices, meaning lower profits for producers, reduced investment within the industry, fewer good, well-paying jobs for Canadian workers and lost revenues at all levels of government,\" the report reads.\n\"These challenges are expected to persist until major projects, such as the Trans Mountain and LNG Canada (pipelines), are completed.\"\nThe economic update also earmarks an extra $69 million for compensation payments to provinces for costs associated with asylum seekers entering the country outside of official border points, such as interim housing, social assistance and education.\nThe update also points to the positive impact of immigration on the country's economy. Since 2015, immigrants have accounted for three-quarters of population growth, resulting in Canada's population growing at its fastest pace in 20 years, and much faster than that of the other G7 economies.\nAsked if the government is prepared to respond to a possible recession, Morneau said it is prepared \"for all eventualities.\"\n\"We already have the strongest balance sheet among G7 countries, we have the lowest level of debt as a function of our economy and what we're projecting is that we're going to be able to reduce that level of debt as a function of our economy, down to 29 per cent during the forecast horizon,\" he said.\nConservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre rejected Morneau's positive outlook, saying that Canada's economic performance lags behind other G7 countries. He said the government is responding to economic challenges by piling up debt, adding \"devastating\" red tape and creating obstacles to building major projects.\n\"What we're facing now is the prospect of a made-in-Canada recession,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"When we went into the last downturn in 2008, Canada led the pack. We were the last into the recession\u00a0and the first out.

It's projected to fall to $11.6 billion by 2024-2025, with the size of the debt relative to the economy remaining flat for the next few years.\nIn a news conference on Parliament Hill, Morneau\u00a0defended the plan to carry ongoing deficits, saying it's necessary to ensure Canadians reap the benefits of a strong economy, including the residents of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador who are experiencing economic anxieties.\n\"We know that in order to ensure we continue on this positive trajectory, the strong economy that we've seen, the very strong employment numbers, that we should be continuing to invest at an appropriate level, and that's what we are doing with this economic and fiscal update and with the campaign that we ran on,\" he said.\nThe update shows an increase of nearly $10 billion in spending since the spring budget, including nearly $5 billion for employee pension and benefits adjustments, nearly $2 billion for a new revenue agreement on the Hibernia oil project in Newfoundland and Labrador\u00a0and\u00a0millions in compensation for dairy farmers harmed by new trade deals.\nThe government announced a $1.75-billion compensation package for dairy farmers in August, of which $345 million was to be paid out in the first year.\nSome of the government's spending is offset by $1.7 billion in increased tax revenue.\nNearly 400,000 new jobs have been created so far in 2019 \u2014 Canada's\u00a0strongest rate of growth since 2007, according to the Department of Finance.\nBut not all parts of the country are experiencing the benefits of that growth;\u00a0Canada's oil-producing provinces are\u00a0still feeling the pinch.\n\"Insufficient export pipeline infrastructure is reducing Canadian crude oil and natural gas prices, meaning lower profits for producers, reduced investment within the industry, fewer good, well-paying jobs for Canadian workers and lost revenues at all levels of government,\" the report reads.\n\"These challenges are expected to persist until major projects, such as the Trans Mountain and LNG Canada (pipelines), are completed.\"\nThe economic update also earmarks an extra $69 million for compensation payments to provinces for costs associated with asylum seekers entering the country outside of official border points, such as interim housing, social assistance and education.\nThe update also points to the positive impact of immigration on the country's economy. Since 2015, immigrants have accounted for three-quarters of population growth, resulting in Canada's population growing at its fastest pace in 20 years, and much faster than that of the other G7 economies.\nAsked if the government is prepared to respond to a possible recession, Morneau said it is prepared \"for all eventualities.\"\n\"We already have the strongest balance sheet among G7 countries, we have the lowest level of debt as a function of our economy and what we're projecting is that we're going to be able to reduce that level of debt as a function of our economy, down to 29 per cent during the forecast horizon,\" he said.\nConservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre rejected Morneau's positive outlook, saying that Canada's economic performance lags behind other G7 countries. He said the government is responding to economic challenges by piling up debt, adding \"devastating\" red tape and creating obstacles to building major projects.\n\"What we're facing now is the prospect of a made-in-Canada recession,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"When we went into the last downturn in 2008, Canada led the pack. We were the last into the recession\u00a0and the first out.

GM Canada did not say how soon Canadian plants might be affected.\nBut it could happen quickly. GM uses \"just-in-time\" delivery, which means hundreds of parts are moving across the border every day.\u00a0\nAbout 80 per cent of the engines\u00a0St. Catharines is building are destined for cars assembled in the U.S., says Jerry Dias, president of Canadian union Unifor. Workers there\u00a0could face layoffs within days, he told CBC News.\nAt the Ingersoll assembly plant, about half the engines they put in cars come from the U.S. Dias estimates they\u00a0may have to halt operations within 10 days.\nGM has not said how many days of parts it has in reserve.\nIt would\u00a0be about two months before auto dealerships are affected by a shortage of product, according to the parent company.\nCanadian workers are represented by a separate union, Unifor, and its contract schedule is different from the U.S. Contracts do not expire until September 2020 and September 2021.\nBut Unifor issued a statement on Sunday saying\u00a0it \"supports the UAW in negotiations for a fair contract settlement with General Motors.\"\nDias says one of the big issues is how many jobs are being lost to Mexico with its very low wages.\n\"We had a dispute with GM in 2017 at the CAMI\u00a0plant. We thought it would be quick, but it went on for almost a month.\n\"The issue was about General Motors' decision to build\u00a0the Equinox in Mexico. That is what is taking place in the U.S. GM announced the closure of four plants. They're beefing up investment in Mexico and the workers in the U.S., like in Canada, have had enough.\"\nGM's Oshawa assembly plant is set to close at the end of the year, one of five plants in North America that the auto giant is closing.\nThat is one of the key issues for the UAW in the U.S., which is pressing GM to schedule new models for the four U.S. plants it is closing.\nUnifor has pressed GM Canada unsuccessfully to extend the life of the Oshawa plant, arguing the automaker made a commitment to at least 2020 when it accepted the 2008 government bailout.\nGM is negotiating a shift toward more electric cars and investing heavily in automation, considered among the key trends in the auto industry.\nNorth American car sales have boomed in the past three years, but are stagnating this year as young consumers put off owning vehicles.\nBut GM made $8 billion in\u00a0profit in 2018 and the UAW is arguing it deserves a wage hike and better benefits to share in the good fortune.\nIt's not just GM plants here in Canada, but also other auto-parts makers that could be affected.\nThat's one reason\u00a0Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, hopes the dispute will be quickly resolved.\nWithin three or four days, it starts affecting people's shifts, Volpe told Bloomberg.\nThe last strike by the UAW was in 2007, and it only lasted 17 hours, so there was not much impact on Canadian operations.\nBefore that a strike at just two major parts plants in Flint, Mich., in 1998 that lasted 54 days eventually shut down much of GM's North American operations.\nA long strike could have a big impact on Canadian workers.\u00a0But it might not significantly affect the Canadian and U.S. economy.\nIf the strike lasts\u00a0to the end of September, it would take\u00a0only 0.1 per cent off annualized U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter, according to CIBC economist\u00a0Avery Shenfeld.\n\"Impacts on Canada would be even more modest.\u00a0Just to give a sense of scale, in the unlikely case where the strike lasts\u00a0through [the fourth quarter] in its entirety, it would subtract a more meaningful 0.7 per cent off that quarter's annualized pace in the U.S., and take a bit of a shine off Canada as well.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "IMF says coronavirus recession will be worse than 2008, as UN appeals for aid for poorest economies", "description": "UN chief also calling for worldwide ceasefire and focus on 'true fight of our lives'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-economy-imf-un-1.5506937", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5506967.1584987362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cda-coronavirus-20200323.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 23, 2020 2:36 PM ET", "2020-03-23T19:09:47.394Z"], "source": null, "content": "The coronavirus pandemic will cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than that seen during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, but the world's economic output should recover in 2021, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Monday.\nIMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva welcomed extraordinary fiscal actions already taken by many countries to boost health systems and protect affected companies and workers, and steps by central banks to ease monetary policy, adding, \"even more will be needed, especially on the fiscal front.\"\nGeorgieva issued the new outlook after a conference call of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 of the world's largest economies, who she said agreed on the need for solidarity across the globe.\n\"The human costs of the coronavirus pandemic are already immeasurable, and all countries need to work together to protect people and limit the economic damage,\" Georgieva said.\nMore countries are imposing lockdown measures to contain the rapidly spreading virus.\nGeorgieva said the outlook for global growth was negative, and the IMF now expected \"a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis or worse.\"\nEarlier this month, Georgieva had warned that 2020 world growth would be below the 2.9 per cent rate seen in 2019, but stopped short of predicting a recession.

Belarus's\u00a0two main refineries were operating at low capacity, running on reserves.\nRussian oil company Transneft confirmed the suspension, which does not affect oil transit to Europe or the supply of natural gas.\nLater on Friday Belarus suspended its oil exports, which contribute up to 20 per cent\u00a0of annual GDP.

About 10 per cent of Western Europe's oil supplies come from Russia, via a pipeline transiting Belarus.\nThe Kremlin has recently increased pressure on its ally, raising energy prices and cutting subsidies. It argues that Belarus should accept closer economic integration if it wants to continue receiving energy resources at Russia's domestic prices.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusan President Alexander Lukashenko held two rounds of talks in December, but failed to reach an agreement on deeper integration and on\u00a0oil and gas prices.\nPutin said Russia was not ready to \"subsidize\" energy supplies without a closer economic integration with Belarus, and Lukashenko insisted he would not sign off on the integration until the issues with oil and gas supplies were resolved.\nIn late December, Lukashenko ordered his government to look for alternative oil suppliers, though in practice that will be difficult considering the country's near-total reliance on Russia.\nThere are concerns in Belarus that the economic discussions are a plot by Russia to swallow up Belarus. Those concerns have been fuelled by Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its support for separatist insurgents in eastern Ukraine.\nBefore relations soured completely with Ukraine, Russia had likewise used energy supplies as political leverage to keep the country in its economic orbit and from developing closer ties with Europe.\nThere also has been speculation that Putin, who has been in power for nearly two decades, could contemplate a merger with Belarus as a way to stay at the helm of the new union state of Russia and Belarus after his current Russian presidential term expires in 2024.\nLukashenko repeatedly rejected the idea, vowing that his country would never become part of Russia.\n\"Russia has started to strong-arm Minsk by trying to get Belarus's Soviet-style economy off its oil needle, but Lukashenko is fighting really hard, as he doesn't want to become a Russian governor,\" said Alexander Klaskovsky, a Minsk-based political analyst.\n"}, {"author": "Murray Brewster", "title": "Canada 'slightly delinquent' on defence spending, Trump says at NATO gathering", "description": "Trudeau met with Latvian President Egils Levits, Prince Charles earlier Tuesday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-nato-1.5382044", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5382365.1575391169!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/britain-nato-trump.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 03, 2019 8:31 AM ET", "2019-12-04T00:40:30.122Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada is \"slightly delinquent\" when it comes to meeting NATO's target for spending on defence, U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday on the eve of the military alliance's 70th anniversary celebrations.\nHe seemed ready to go easy on Ottawa, however \u2014 telling journalists in a wide-ranging news conference with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this morning that he's confident Canada will boost its military spending.\nTrump has demanded that all NATO allies meet the benchmark of spending two per cent of their gross domestic product on the military.\nAt one point during his media event with Trudeau this morning, Trump asked the prime minister directly how close Canada is to meeting that goal. The prime minister initially deflected the question before Trump asked a second time.\nThat led to an awkward exchange among the Canadian officials in attendance, who rattled off numbers until Trudeau settled on 1.4 per cent of GDP \u2014 the goal the Liberal government hopes to reach in 2024-25.\nDespite the fuzzy math, Trump seemed satisfied.\n\"They're getting up to a level that's quite acceptable,\" he said. \"They're under two per cent obviously, but they're going up.\"\nThe last batch of NATO figures put Canada's contribution at 1.27 per cent of GDP, but federal officials say the calculation was recently revised and now sits at 1.31 per cent.\nTrump once again raised the spectre of the United States not defending allies who don't meet the benchmark, but later said he might instead retaliate against the countries he described as \"delinquent\" through trade measures.\nWhen asked to characterize Canada's position, Trump said it was \"slightly delinquent, but they'll be OK.

The two discussed the deployment of nearly 600 Canadian troops in the Baltic State, part of a NATO mission meant to deter Russian aggression.\nSome NATO leaders have openly questioned the future of the 70-year-old military alliance, with Macron saying it is suffering \"brain death.\"\n\"This alliance at 70 is extremely important to Canada and to people around the world, and we're going to continue to be dedicated to it,\" said Trudeau.\nLevits was even more determined to shore up the alliance in the face of criticism.\n\"For Latvia, I can say the transatlantic bond \u2014 that means Europe and Canada and the U.S. \u2014 are the cornerstones of our defence politics and of our foreign politics,\" he said.\n\"Because NATO is comprised of member states which share the same values, rule of law, democracy. And these values are to be defended.

They come to see the cave where he slept, following the centuries-old living traditions in this part of China.\nAnd they read the slogans representing life lessons the military tour guides say Xi learned, such as \"struggle hard and be self-reliant\" \u2014 the same imperatives the party now preaches to 1.4 billion Chinese.\nXi arrived in Liangjiahe half a century ago from Beijing as a bewildered 15-year-old. Like other young city dwellers, he had been sent \"down to the countryside\" \u2014 as Chinese leader Mao Zedong ordered at the time \u2014 in order to toughen his comfortable urban roots.\nXi's father, once a party propaganda chief and then vice-premier, had been purged during Mao's Cultural Revolution in the 1960s. He was in prison when Xi was shipped off alone to Liangjiahe. Xi spent five years in the countryside before starting university back in Beijing\u00a0and then beginning his climb up the party ladder.\nThese days, political lectures are held throughout Liangjiahe for party members, including committees that exist in most Chinese companies. What is said during these talks, we were told on the tour, must remain secret, as we were followed closely by police and warned not to interview anyone.\nSuch is the sensitivity surrounding Xi's image, policies and even his persona that today's China has adopted.\n\"To believe in this [Chinese] flag,\" said Liu Ming Fu, \"is to believe in President Xi.\"\nLiu is a former instructor of political thought at China's military college and one of 90 million members of the Communist Party. He lives in Beijing, and has carefully arranged tributes to Xi \u2014 mementoes and books of his thoughts \u2014 on a table in his apartment.\n\"As soon as he came to power, he promoted the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of our nation,\" Liu said. \"He seized the hearts of all of us.\"\nXi assumed the role of \"Paramount Leader\" in 2012, which involved first becoming chairman of the Communist Party, then the Central Military Commission, and finally a president who did away with term limits so he could rule as long as he wants. And he made national pride his rallying cry.\nAs the official story goes, Xi's path from the village to the centre of power echoes China's struggle to overcome poverty and humiliation to become a global force.\nWhile tanks and nuclear missiles rolled through the streets of Beijing last month in a parade marking the 70th anniversary of the Communist Revolution, Xi stood in front of the Forbidden City to declare, \"No force can ever shake the status of China, or stop the Chinese people and nation.\"\nChina's \"miserable fate of being poor and weak and being bullied and humiliated in over 100 years\" is over, he said, referring to occupations and military losses to Japan, Britain and others.\nIndeed, the lines of soldiers who stood in front of him \u2013 with their high-tech weaponry \u2013 were a force no one had ever seen before in China.\nIt's one Beijing has been determined to use, for example, to reclaim the entire South China Sea on the basis of \"historical precedent,\" ignoring protests and counter-claims from China's neighbours. The government has also ignored the ruling of an international tribunal in The Hague calling Beijing's actions \"unlawful,\" prompting accusations that it is \"bullying\" smaller nations.\nXi's aim is to reintegrate lost territories like Hong Kong, despite any local resistance, and to retake the self-ruled, democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward Chinese province \u2014 possibly by force.\nWATCH: Sa\u0161a Petricic\u00a0tours the village that shaped Xi\u00a0Jinping:\nHe also wants to make China the world's undisputed economic power. After years of incredible growth, World Bank figures show the country is on the cusp of overtaking the U.S. economically. China's nominal gross domestic product (GDP) is $13.41 trillion US\u00a0while the United States sits at $20.49 trillion. But if you measure GDP using purchasing power parity, China's economy has already hit $25.27 trillion, surpassing the U.S.\nThis remains a challenge because China's growth rate \u2013 about six per cent annually \u2013 is half of what it was in the early 2000s.\nXi's ambitious project to build a half-trillion-dollar global network of roads, railways and sea links throughout Asia to Africa and Europe would allow Chinese exports to flow to even more places, more efficiently.\nThis so-called Belt and Road Initiative would also spread Chinese influence \u2014 and potentially control \u2014around the world. In short, China aspires to equal or better the U.S. in every way.\nXi's personal rise took him through the party apparatus, step by step through different regions and posts, as he positioned himself for the top job. Once there, he consolidated power, initially cultivating a friendly \"Uncle Xi\" image (or \"Xi dada\" in Mandarin), but turning progressively tough and dictatorial.\nHe has moved harshly to rein in any possible dissent from Muslim Uighurs by jailing more than a million in so-called work camps. He has shut down churches and locked up human rights activists.\nThat has made him enemies within his own party, \"factions that may be ready to challenge him,\" said historian Zhang Lifan, a former member of China's prestigious Academy of Social Sciences and a rare voice in the country willing to criticize Xi publicly.\n\"China's one-party dictatorship is very difficult to sustain,\" Zhang said. \"While people all over the world are working toward freedom and democracy, he's calling for dictatorship and despotism. This has no future.\"\nWhile Xi has purged opposing voices inside and outside the Communist Party, there are some who still challenge his vision.\n\"Xi is full of fantasies,\" Zhang said. \"He lives in the illusion of building a great world empire and replacing the U.S. This is the so-called Chinese dream, but it's too huge and unrealistic. It's just a dream.\"\nNot so, China's leaders have insisted. They point to their country's rise, which has been as dramatic as Xi's own from his days in the village.\nAnd yet, the permanence of all this prosperity is not guaranteed. China's economy is slowing and its military is largely untested.\nThe ambitious climb to great power status also faces growing international resistance \u2013 a trade war with the U.S., charges of espionage and technology theft, diplomatic disputes with countries (including Canada) that have led to accusations of \"hostage diplomacy\" as China arrests foreigners in retaliation for perceived unfairness.\nBut Xi has convinced his people that, like his sacrifices in the village, all of this is necessary for China to take the place it deserves on the world stage, to fulfill the Chinese dream.\n\"China may not be the United States,\" said Communist Party member Liu, \"but we are competing hard and catching up.\"\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "As COVID-19 hits the economy, bailouts are a fresh reminder why governments matter: Don Pittis", "description": "When this is all over, will penny-pinchers remember the value of governments?", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/covid-coronavirus-economy-bailouts-pittis-1.5503811", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5503886.1584663489!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-stocks.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 20, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-20T18:25:32.597Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "\"There is no such thing as society,\" British prime minister Margaret Thatcher said in 1987, in what came to represent a declaration of the growing push for smaller government.\nAs with many such pithy and oft-repeated phrases, there were complaints that the famous quote was misused, in this case\u00a0as a stick to beat the neoconservative movement\u00a0championed by Thatcher and U.S. President Ronald Reagan.\nReagan's famous quip on the subject was that the most terrifying thing you could ever hear was \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\"\nBut today, as governments around the world offer up help with vital health care, organization and financial support for the crumbling free\u00a0markets as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads, objections have gone a little more quiet. Instead, a private sector that usually clamours for lower taxes is now asking\u00a0governments to spend more.\nBut even as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau injects what amounts to an estimated four\u00a0to five\u00a0per cent of GDP in government stimulus, there is simply no way state support can replace the massive amounts of money that normally flood\u00a0through a healthy economy, says Craig Alexander,\u00a0Deloitte Canada's chief economist.\n\"They can't offset all the weakness, but they're a very important part of mitigating how weak things actually become,\" said Alexander, who had grown hoarse from giving web seminars trying to convince business leaders that the current economic and market gloom was only temporary.\nHe said one of the most crucial things governments can do\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that business really can't\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is inspire confidence that massive resources will be used to prevent the economic system from going into a tailspin.\nIn a strange twist, he said, market gloom has pushed interest rates on federal debt so low that governments can borrow \"almost\u00a0for nothing\" and spend in a way that would have been impossible in the high-inflation, high-interest era\u00a0of Reagan and Thatcher.\nUniversity of Ottawa political economist Jacqueline Best researches the political crisis caused by the high inflation of the 1970s and 1980s that\u00a0helped convince cash-strapped governments to reject state spending as a solution.\nIn the years since, she says, with\u00a0the private sector celebrated as the solution to all our ills, gaps have formed in social support networks, especially for low-wage earners in the gig economy, and are only being noticed now that\u00a0we're in a crisis.\nAll at once, the COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0is acting as a reminder of the essential role governments and society play in providing social support, from adequate health care to emergency financial help\u00a0for those thrown out of work. Best says the more we work together to prevent the disease's spread, the more people may notice\u00a0that, contrary to Thatcher's famous maxim, society not only exists but is essential to our collective well-being.\n\"It's so clear that what each of us does affects other people,\" she said.\nIn talking to her students, she sometimes gets the feeling the concept of collective welfare that predominated during the Great Depression and the World Wars, the time of the\u00a0Greatest Generation,\u00a0may be coming back into fashion.\n\"A crisis like this makes us aware how vulnerable we are,\" she said.\nThat feeling of potential crisis in business and financial markets\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like the\u00a0worst-case scenario imagined by Francis Fong, the chief economist with the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada, where markets and businesses fail, \"permanently destroying economic capacity\"\u00a0\u2014 has convinced those who might normally oppose government spending to favour loosening the purse strings.\n\"The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada have long advocated for, during good times, ensuring fiscal balance and fiscal responsibility,\" said Fong. \"Now is not the time for that.\"\nOf course, as critics said after governments bailed out markets in 2008, this may be one more case of\u00a0privatizing profits while socializing losses.\nDespite complaints that it is never enough and that it will take time for money to flow into the economy,\u00a0Armine Yalnizyan, economist and fellow with the\u00a0Atkinson Foundation, lauds the Liberal government and opposition for their quick action.\nShe says the economic magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0may represent an inflection point that begins to take us away from Thatcher and Reagan.\n\"I think this crisis is going to absolutely be the last nail in the coffin for trickle-down economics as being any kind of boost to the economy,\" she said, referring to the idea that helping the wealthy will also eventually help those with less.\nIn the aftermath of the coronavirus\u00a0slump, she says, it will become increasingly evident that government involvement is essential in a no-growth economy, and not just to ensure adequate health care and a social safety net.\n\"After 40 years of being told that the best economic formula is more market and less government, we have our nose pressed up against the glass, seeing that we need more government,\" she said. \"And, of course, that will mean less business.\"\nBut once the private sector economy begins to recover from the effects of the virus, perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised that when the time comes to pay the bill, the current consensus in favour of government intervention in the economy will have fewer champions.\nFollow Don on Twitter\u00a0@don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Jamaica's central bank using reggae to 'edutain' about nation's economic recovery", "description": "Music a natural way to teach Jamaicans about inflation and monetary policy", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/jamaica-central-bank-reggae-1.5180119", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180127.1560881609!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jamaica-reggae-recovery.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 18, 2019 2:58 PM ET", "2019-06-18T18:58:12.385Z"], "source": null, "content": "Jamaica's central bank thinks the country's economy is doing very well, and it is using an instantly recognizable symbol of the island to get this message to the people: reggae music.\nIn the bank's latest video, reggae artist Tarrus Riley uses his throaty vocals to praise low, stable and predictable inflation as being what the bass-line is to reggae music.\n\"Gimme little one drop, let the bass-line roll and kotch, reggae music run the country,\" Riley sings.\nThis and other Bank of Jamaica-produced videos have gone viral, with hundreds of thousands of views from around the world.\n\"The idea is to communicate in the best way possible, and in Jamaica, nothing aids communication as much as music,\" Nigel Clarke, the minister of finance and public service, said in an interview in his office overlooking Kingston's harbour. \"Music aids in advocacy, and the same is true for complex monetary policy.\"\nJust over seven years ago, the government's debt was close to 150 per cent\u00a0of the country's GDP, unemployment was over 15 per cent, and economic growth was just under 1 per cent\u00a0annually. Now, the debt-to-GDP ratio is set to fall below 100 per cent\u00a0in this year's budget, more people are employed than at any time in the country's history, with unemployment at 8 per cent, and there have been 18 consecutive quarters of growth.\n\"In the context of Jamaica's history, superlatives are appropriate,\" Clarke said. \"It is, in my view, a remarkable achievement of the Jamaican people.\"\nBut the fruits of the recovery are still slow in trickling down to many Jamaicans, and many people have doubts. So the Bank of Jamaica decided to use of reggae to spread the government's message that the country is experiencing an economic turnaround.\nDr. Sonjah Stanley Niaah, director of the Institute of Caribbean Studies at the University of the West Indies, said music is a natural way to reach Jamaicans.\n\"It's a no brainer, using culture to educate and simultaneously entertain \u2014 or 'edutain.'

It was plagued with low productivity, long-term stagnation and crippling debt. Now, the government has dramatically turned the economy around, he said, but people still need to be convinced that enduring a bit of pain to achieve overall economic growth is worth it.\nOne of the pillars of the economic recovery has been moving away from the currency exchange rate as a primary tool of monetary policy toward an inflation objective of between 4 per cent\u00a0and 6 per cent, Clarke said.\nPreviously, the central bank focused on using exchange rate adjustments to keep prices of goods and services neither too low nor too high, but that resulted in swings that made it difficult for businesses to plan. The bank now makes monetary decisions based on inflation, seeking a moderate but steady rise in prices. The current 2 per cent\u00a0rate remains under the target, and the bank says that signals weakness in the economy.\nStable, predictable inflation helps people plan and budget, said Peter Blair Henry, the Jamaican-born dean emeritus at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business.\n\"This affects the market lady trying to sell fruits and vegetables, and if the price of fuel is going up, she wants to know how much. If it's going up too fast, it costs more to get the fruits and vegetables to the market,\" he said.\nWhile things are looking up, there is still much work to be done.\nMark Golding, an opposition member of Parliament and shadow critic for finance, says that while Jamaica's economic turnaround cannot be denied, there are still areas that need improvement.\n\"It is a very significant turnaround, but the levels of growth are not where we would like to see them,\" he said.\nJamaican economist Dennis Jones said there are obstacles that must be removed in order to meet targets.\n\"We still appear to be languishing in the one to two per cent range, and that's not a rate that is going to do a lot for us going forward as a society,\" Jones said, citing crime and aging infrastructure as obstacles.\nIn poor communities, there is skepticism about the recovery.\n\"I realize that sometimes these things are superficial,\" said Luke-George Cooke, a worker from the capital's Trench Town neighbourhood. \"A woman should not have to stab a woman over a $2 eyelash.

But in many important ways, it's widely misunderstood.\nLike any budget, it contains thousands of individual decisions. Each comes with tradeoffs, and each should be subject to examination and debate.\nUnlike other budgets, there's disagreement over what exactly just happened. Some say benefit programs were slashed; others say no. Some say income taxes went up; others say no. Some label it an austerity budget, others a compassionate one.\nAnd there were even some significant changes in Budget 2019 that went completely unnoticed \u2014 even, it seems, by the government.\nBudget 2019 is, if nothing else, a budget of contradictions.\nWith the benefit of time to reflect on the changes, it's possible to sift through competing claims and, hopefully, open the door to a more productive discussion.\nLet's start with income support programs. They've been cut. Here's why.\nCurrently, benefits increase as prices increase, so the \"real\" value of benefits remains stable. The goal \u2014 an entirely sensibly one \u2014 is to ensure recipients can buy next year what they could this year.\nThe government chose to \"de-index\" benefits from inflation. This fixes the dollar value of benefits, but what those dollars can buy will now fall over time.\nConsider a concrete example: \"de-indexing\" benefits to Albertans with permanent disabilities, through the \"Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped\" program, AISH for short.\nThe move shrinks the purchasing power of AISH monthly benefits by roughly $35 next year (depending on inflation), by $65 the year after, by $100 the year after that, and so on until indexing resumes.\nIt's a puzzling move by the government, since the savings are minuscule; at first, only $10 million. But this places very real burdens on individual living standards. There may be merits to the choice, and if so the government should make the case openly and honestly.\u00a0\nPretending the choice was not made at all is not helpful.\nBudget 2019 increases income taxes, but in a very subtle way. Like benefit payments, the government is \"de-indexing\" tax credits and tax brackets.\nEffectively, the value of tax credits are frozen at their 2019 levels. The dollar value remains unchanged, but their real value to families was cut because they will no longer keep pace with the rising cost of living.\u00a0\nIn addition, these changes make it easier to fall into higher tax brackets even if you and your family's standard of living has not changed. So-called \"bracket creep\" is back in Alberta, costing taxpayers nearly $200 million per year.\nCombined with other changes to tax credits, the cost is roughly $150 per year for the average family. (Which, I can't resist saying, is essentially the same as the\u00a0average cost of the $30-per-tonne carbon tax, net of rebates. Although the rage-factor-per-dollar differs widely between the two.)\nTo be sure, it's fair enough to increase revenue to help lower the deficit. There are two sides to the budget, after all. But there are other ways.\nRaising the GST to 5.3 per cent, for example, would generate the same revenue as the personal income tax increases will. Either way, Alberta is (by far) the lowest tax jurisdiction in the country, so there is room to increase taxes as the government did.\nTo debate the pros and cons of this choice requires we first recognize the choice was made. The government's advertisements suggesting no taxes were raised are disingenuous at best and Orwellian at worst.\nTurning to the big picture, Budget 2019 proposes to shrink the size of Alberta's government by roughly $1.5 billion \u2014 or 2.8 per cent \u2014 over four years. That's roughly equivalent to 0.5 per cent of Alberta's economy. This is modest, and far from austerity.\nTrue austerity budgets, of which we have seen many examples, are massively more restrictive than this.\nAmong the major OECD countries, average spending reductions and tax increases in periods of austerity are over four per cent of GDP. After the financial crisis, some went even further.\nPortugal and Ireland, for example, went through restraint totalling four per cent of GDP per year for four years. In Alberta, that would be nearly $15 billion per year in spending reductions and tax increases each year for four years. That's austerity.\nOr compare Budget 2019 to Alberta's own history. Premier Ralph Klein reduced program spending by more than 21 per cent over four years in the early and mid-1990s. Today, that would be equivalent to a $12-billion reduction. Nowhere close to the $1.5 billion reduction the government proposes.\nWe should reserve extreme language for extreme situations. And a 2.8-per-cent reduction is not extreme.\nOf course this doesn't imply the budget was \"good\" \u2014 that's a value judgment we each need to make for ourselves. And yes a 2.8-per-cent spending reduction, in the face of rising prices and population growth, is not trivial. But we should focus on the specific decisions taken, and not be distracted by sweeping and inaccurate generalizations like \"austerity\".\u00a0\nFinally, Budget 2019 contains an important decision that no one seems to have noticed. It is gradually \u2014 but clearly \u2014 easing Alberta off the resource royalty roller-coaster.\u00a0\nOver the past few years, Alberta needed over one quarter of the budget to come from resource revenues in order to balance. By 2022, that reliance will fall to just 12 per cent. The previous government's \"Path to Balance,\"\u00a0for comparison, required nearly 19 per cent of the budget to come from resources.\nGetting off our addiction to resource revenues is important.\nRoyalties are risky. Oil prices rise and fall, and so too do our provincial revenues. Less reliance means less volatility. And while there is still work to do after we balance, that's a significant start.\nNone of the above implies the budget is either good or bad. One should look at each individual decision and evaluate them on their merits. If you disagree, be clear why and then propose alternatives.\nIn my view, Budget 2019 is a clear and credible path to balance.\nIt's clear because there is detail behind the choices made. It's credible because it does not rely on unreasonable assumptions.\nSome choices I oppose \u2014 such as cutting AISH benefits \u2014 and some choices I support \u2014 such as increasing taxes and restraining spending growth. But that's just me. We must each weigh the pros and cons for ourselves.\nThis budget is an opportunity to think deeply, clearly, and responsibly about the options before us. There are hard choices here, whether we admit they exist or not.\nThis column is an opinion.

But all of those factors have now been dwarfed by COVID-19.\n\"Due to the social distancing requirements put in place to attempt to halt the progression of the virus, there has been a staggering decline in employment, as businesses are forced to shutter, and in wealth, as stock markets dip lower,\" the document states, speaking of the global situation.\nOn P.E.I., the employment sectors expected to bear the brunt of the job losses are tourism, retail and construction.\n(Source: P.E.I. government)\n\"As businesses and employees respond to the restrictions and additional tightening of social distancing, the impact on employment could reach 17,500 people in April and peak at 20,200 people in May,\" the document states.\u00a0\n\"These figures include people facing reduced hours, layoff, or temporary furlough. The ultimate severity and duration of the closures and social distancing restrictions are unknown and will depend on evidence of community transmission of the virus.\"\nBased on figures from May 2019, when 80,300 Islanders were employed according to Statistics Canada, the losses the province is considering could represent up to one quarter of all employment on P.E.I.\nWhat's not clear is whether the forecast\u00a0anticipates the potential impact from programs like the federal government's revised wage subsidy program, which will pay 75 per cent of a worker's salary for businesses that qualify, encouraging them to bring laid-off workers back on the payroll.\nOn Thursday, Statistics Canada will release its job numbers for March, providing the first official figures to show how employment in the country has been affected by the pandemic.\nAt a media briefing Tuesday, Premier Dennis King explained, not for the first time, that P.E.I.'s \"three core industries\"\u00a0of agriculture, fishing and tourism, all seasonal industries which would normally be gearing up this time of year, \"have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis.\"\n\"As we've come to know these past few weeks, this is anything but a normal year.\"\nCavendish Farms, the province's biggest private employer, is facing reduced demand for french fries as a result of the pandemic, while there are questions as to whether P.E.I. lobster fishermen will take to the water this spring, and what a depressed market would mean for the value of catches if they do.\nOn Tuesday, King said if the lucrative spring lobster fishery doesn't go ahead, \"we would need a very significant package from the federal government to compensate those who would be, I would have to say would be devastated by not having that ability to fish here, but I don't think that we're there yet.\"\nBanks have begun revising their economic forecasts, and some are predicting the P.E.I. economy will shrink in 2020.\nThat comes after years where P.E.I. had one of the fastest-growing economies in the country, largely buoyed by immigration through the province's provincial nominee program, also put on hold by the pandemic.\n(Source: P.E.I. government)\nThe province says \"the longer social distancing measures are in place, the greater the negative effect will be on the economy.\"\nMeanwhile, cabinet has authorized new borrowing for the province, including a provision allowing up to $900 million in treasury notes to be issued, the first time those have been authorized by the province since 2012.\nThat's a short-term financing measure meant to help the government bridge anticipated shortfalls between revenues and expenditures.\n\"During these uncertain times with government deferring payments and providing many short-term funding programs, the Department of Finance deemed it prudent to raise the limit for short-term borrowings to ensure that there was sufficient cash available,\" a spokesperson from the department\u00a0explained.\nOn March 21, cabinet authorized a further $250 million in borrowing, which government said was to re-finance existing debt coming due this fall at favourable rates, and secure financing for capital projects over the next two construction seasons.\nOn Friday, the province provided a revised estimate for the 2019-20 fiscal year, which closed March 31, projecting an operating deficit of $3.8 million. The province's budget, passed in the legislature last July, had predicted a surplus of $1.8 million.\nAs UPEI economics Prof. Jim Sentance explained the situation for P.E.I., it isn't good but could be worse.\n\"Like everybody, we're taking a hit economically because a lot of things are shut down. I think in some ways P.E.I. is maybe a little better off than some provinces,\" he said.\nOne plus Sentance sees for the Island: the preponderance of government jobs, where workers are largely still being paid, even if they're not always able to actually do their work.\nHe said provincial revenues from things like income tax and HST will suffer, but said the province comes into this from a strong fiscal situation, posting recent budget surpluses in the tens of millions and with a favourable debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\"We can run up a fair deficit, and really I don't see any issue with that. Things will recover in the longer term [if we] behave ourselves.\"\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\nCommon symptoms include:\nBut more serious symptoms can develop, including difficulty breathing and pneumonia, which can lead to death.\nHealth Canada has built a\u00a0self-assessment tool.\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\nIsolate yourself and call 811.

Ragan said they'd also demand personal or corporate tax increases to pay for them.\n\"The punchline really is, the more hidden your policy choices, the more expensive they are,\" he said.\nThe report's data show\u00a0a scenario combining stricter regulations (requiring companies to cut the intensity of their emissions in half, for example) and\u00a0substantial subsidies for electric vehicle purchases\u00a0could end up forcing an income tax hike of roughly 1.5 to 2 per cent\u00a0for Canadians and corporations, depending on the province.\nThe report also says a scenario relying on regulations and subsidies for industries alone would cost even more \u2014 roughly a 4 to 6 per cent spike\u00a0in income taxes. The commission concluded that a industry-focused regulation-only\u00a0model would end up depressing Canada's GDP \u2014\u00a0and likely would fail to allow Canada to meet its current Paris target\u00a0of a 30 per cent reduction in emissions below 2005 levels by 2030.\nRagan acknowledged that the modelling system does not take into account companies shifting toward more sustainable methods without government intervention, but said the report offers governments a realistic \"menu of choice.\"\n\"The menu items have a price tag,\" he said.\nRagan said the carbon tax hike scenario laid out in the Ecofiscal Commission report would not lead to a \"dramatic\" rise in gasoline prices.\n\"That still puts prices below where they were in the summer of 2014, before the price of oil fell, and keeps prices well below where they are in France,\" he said, adding that the debate over the carbon tax needs to take into account the rebates meant to offset the household effects.\n"}, {"author": "Jonathan Montpetit", "title": "With little to say on coronavirus, is Quebec's budget 'of the future' out of sync with the present?", "description": "Finance minister\u2019s budget bets outbreak is more public health than economic problem", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/budget-quebec-coronavirus-climate-change-1.5493300", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5493304.1583888489!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/quebec-budget-20200310.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 11, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-11T18:54:04.903Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As he rose in the National Assembly on Tuesday afternoon to table the provincial budget, Finance Minister Eric Girard declared \"we have confidence in the future.\"\nIt's the sort of pat statement you can expect from a finance minister on budget day, or any politician, frankly, on days that end in y.\nBut these are not normal times. The COVID-19\u00a0outbreak, combined with an emerging oil price war, sent markets tumbling on Monday.\nThough they recovered somewhat on Tuesday, the volatility only increased expectations that the big economies will see slower growths in the months ahead, if not an outright recession.\u00a0\nGirard's confidence in the future \u2014 reflected in a budget based on GDP growth projected at two per cent \u2014\u00a0makes him a somewhat lonely figure at the moment.\nHis budget speech made all of one reference to coronavirus, and the budget itself contained no specific measures to deal with the outbreak\u00a0or its economic consequences.\nIn Ottawa, by contrast, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on Tuesday that the virus will \u00a0have \"significant economic impacts for Canadians.\" Trudeau is expected to announce mitigation measures later today.\nEven U.S. President Donald Trump, who spent weeks downplaying the risks of COVID-19, is now preparing a stimulus package.\nThis is not to say the Quebec government is sitting on its hands as the number of cases mount slowly in the province.\u00a0\nThe government is readying clinics to speed up testing and ensuring hospitals have the\u00a0 resources in place to treat patients safely.\nBut in Girard's eyes, coronavirus appears to be primarily a public health problem for the moment.\nWATCH: Finance minister explains the numbers behind the budget\u00a0\nThe Quebec economy is structurally sound enough, he said, to withstand whatever blows it will suffer over the coming months, be it oil shocks or tightened consumer spending.\nCarlos Leit\u00e3o, the finance critic for the Opposition Liberals, suggested otherwise. He's calling for contingency funds and further budget updates to respond to an evolving situation.\nIn claiming Girard's budget \"lacked prudence,\" Leit\u00e3o is hoping to demonstrate the government is out of touch with public anxieties.\nThe ambivalent response to global economic uncertainty is not the only way Girard's budget \"of the future\" appears out of sync with the present.\nWith great fanfare, Girard unveiled a plan to spend $6.7 billion over the next six years on measures to deal with climate change.\nOn closer inspection, though, this too comes across as a timid response to the climate crisis, due to cause a host of economic problems of its own.\nOf the $6.7 billion, only $322 million will be spent this year (though spending is set to rise to $1 billion in 2021-2022).\nAnd of that $322 million, only $118 million will go into tackling emissions in the transport sector, which is responsible for the bulk of Quebec's emissions.\nA chief cause of those emissions, as the budget documents readily acknowledge, is the perennial popularity of SUVs and other light trucks.\nQuebec, to its credit, decided to maintain a generous tax rebate on purchases of electric vehicles.\nBut it ignored a suggestion made by several environmental groups, in the pre-budget consultations, to bring in a feebate system.\nThis is a policy tool, lauded by the International Monetary Fund among others, that would impose fees on consumers who buy polluting vehicles, in order to offer rebates to those who buy more fuel-efficient ones.\nAs it stands, more Quebecers are buying way more gas-guzzlers than plug-ins. And as long as that's the case, it will be very difficult for the province to meet its emission targets.\nThose targets, by the way, are out-of-date.\nPremier Fran\u00e7ois Legault's government has committed itself to bringing Quebec's emissions 37.5 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030.\nThat target was set by Philippe Couillard's Liberal government in 2015, in the run-up to what became known as the Paris Agreement.\nAt the time, it was a fairly ambitious target. The problem, though, is that the science on climate change has since evolved.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the group of researchers whose work informs the Paris targets, now says that reductions of 45 per cent below 2010 levels are required by 2030 to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees.\nFor Quebec, that means annual emissions should be around\u00a045 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (Mt of CO\u2082e), if it wants to be doing its fair share in the fight against climate change.\u00a0\nBut the government's goal is only to get to 54 Mt of CO\u2082e by 2030. Meanwhile, the latest figures available suggest the province was responsible for 79\u00a0Mt of CO\u2082e in 2017.\u00a0\nIn other words, Quebec is giving itself an easier emissions target and\u00a0taking a go-slow approach to meeting it. That's a luxury we can no longer afford, according to climate scientists.\u00a0\nOn Tuesday, not long before Girard tabled his budget, UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres presented a report of his own.\nHis dealt with the latest evidence on climate change. \"We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5\u00a0or 2 degree\u00a0targets that the Paris agreement calls for,\" Guterres said.\nGirard's budget may be dressed in the rhetorical finery of the future, but in many ways it's out of touch with the emergencies of the present.\n"}, {"author": "Murray Brewster", "title": "Canada facing renewed pressure from U.S. to meet NATO defence spending benchmark", "description": "'Canada has got a lot of real estate to defend,' new U.S. national security adviser says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-pressure-us-defence-spending-1.5371352", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5371356.1574571024!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/security-forum-20191123.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 23, 2019 11:58 PM ET", "2019-11-24T14:48:14.556Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Liberal government is facing renewed political pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to increase defence spending to meet the benchmark established by NATO.\nRobert O'Brien, the new U.S. national security adviser, said it is an \"urgent priority\" to get allies across the board to set aside military budgets that are equal to two per cent of the individual country's gross domestic product.\nSpeaking with journalists at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday, O'Brien rattled off a list of the world's flashpoints, including Iran and Venezuela, as well as traditional adversaries such as Russia and China.\n\"There are very serious threats to our freedom and our security,\" he said. \"Canada made a pledge at [the 2014 NATO Summit in] Wales to spend two per cent. We expect our friends and our colleagues to live up to their commitments, and Canada is an honourable country; it's a great country.\"\nO'Brien was a lawyer and former U.S. State Department hostage negotiator before being appointed this summer to the top security job. He noted the construction of the Canadian navy's new Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships, the first of which was on sea trials during the security forum, but said it could use some heavier armament given the potential warships and submarines it could face in the North.\n\"Canada has got a lot of real estate to defend,\" he said, noting that the Arctic is an area of interest for not only Russia, but China.\n\"As nice as it is to say we don't want to militarize the Arctic, other people are going to make that decision for Canada. And Canada needs to be in a position to defend itself, defend its values.\"\nEvery time Trump has complained allies are not paying their fair share of the security of the West, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has countered with its defence policy, which committed to a 73 per cent budget increase by 2026-27.\nThat would bring Canada's defence spending to 1.4 per cent of GDP. It currently sits around 1.27 per cent, according to NATO figures released last June.\nResponding to O'Brien on Saturday, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan insisted the Liberal government is working towards what was promised in Wales.\n\"You can't just do this overnight,\" he said. \"It's a buildup. And the decisions we've made as a government are building towards that.\"\nSajjan also noted that Canada delivers high quality troops and equipment whenever NATO asks, including taking up two leaderships roles under the alliance banner in Latvia and Iraq.\nHowever, an internal defence department slide deck briefing\u00a0obtained by CBC News and dated from February 2019 shows how defence spending will rise until 2026-27, but then begin to fall again once several major capital purchases are underway and booked.\nIn addition to NATO, the Trump administration has been leaning on allies in the Far East to shoulder more of the collective defence costs.\nThe U.S. president has asked Tokyo to quadruple payments for U.S. troops in Japan and is currently negotiating a new deal with South Korea. O'Brien said rich countries with healthy economies should be paying more to defend themselves.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/confronting-carbon2/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Lori Lee Oates", "title": "This election, ask politicians how they will improve your quality of life", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/pov-lori-lee-oates-this-election-ask-politicians-improve-quality-of-life-1.5308773", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Oct 06, 2019 6:00 AM NT", "2019-10-06T15:33:11.312Z"], "source": null, "content": "During election season, politicians traditionally tell us about the excellent work they've done in growing the economy, or about all the programs they've created.\nGoverning parties focus on telling us about the dollars they've spent, rather than the outcomes of those programs.\nA common talking point for the Trudeau government has been that over a million jobs were added to the Canadian economy on their watch. They have also frequently pointed out that Canada had the fastest gross domestic product\u00a0growth among the G7 nations. They frequently refer to using the Canada Child Benefit program to lift 287,000 families above the poverty level.\nThe last point is important \u2014 because it's\u00a0a growing practice for governments to focus on quality of life indicators, in addition to growing the national economy.\nIn 2018, Scotland, New Zealand and Iceland came together to form the Wellbeing Economy\u00a0Governments group. These countries have decided that economic growth should not be pursued at any cost and that they are going to be accountable to their citizens for quality of life outcomes.\nThis is an approach to governing that addresses the major issues of the day such as climate change, globalization, and inequality.\nHere in Canada, it's election time, and we should absolutely pose hard questions to our political leaders on what they are doing \u2014 or what they will do \u2014 to make day-to-day life better for Canadian citizens.\nAsking candidates about what social and environmental outcomes they intend to produce is a good way to move the political discourse beyond economic growth. After all, GDP is largely an indicator of how well high-income people and businesses are doing.\nNational GDP numbers also tell us very little about provincial or regional outcomes.\nA recent Statistics Canada study found that population in Newfoundland and Labrador could drop by as much as 90,000 people by 2043. We have an aging population, low birth rates and stagnant immigration.\nWe must ask our candidates what they're\u00a0going to do to improve those indicators.\nDid you know that the Conference Board of Canada has found that Newfoundland and Labrador has the lowest health outcomes of all provinces, and that we rank below the United States and many other Western countries?\nThe federal government puts massive amounts of money into health care at the provincial level \u2014 but has no mechanisms to hold provinces accountable for how that money is spent \u2014 or the outcomes those dollars achieve.\nWhen the federal government speaks of post-secondary education, rarely do they speak of the impact of the increasing costs of living on student debt or how this will impact the economy of the future.\nTuition fees are only a fraction of the cost of an education.\nHousing costs in St. John's have doubled in the last 20 years, and wages have not. New graduates have said that the changes to Canada Student Loans have been a tiny Band-Aid on a gushing wound.\nWhile the Trudeau government has spent almost four years developing a carbon tax program, have our environmental outcomes improved during their four years in office? What outcomes do the other parties say their climate change policies will achieve?\nMost of the initiatives undertaken will benefit us over the long term and will be in peril if the ruling party changes. It is reasonable to ask candidates how they're\u00a0going to ensure climate change continues to be addressed if government changes. This is clearly an issue that requires putting partisanship aside.\nThe Trudeau government has committed to reducing methane emissions by 40 to 45 per cent below 2012 levels by 2025. There is a good chance government will change before we reach that date.\nThey also introduced the Just Transition Task Force on coal, designed to reach 90 per cent non-emitting power by 2030. The federal government has also put in place a rebate for electrical vehicles, designed to reach 100 per cent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2040.\nThese are also long-term measures that will have to pass through the hands of multiple governments.\nFrom a Newfoundland and Labrador perspective, they have protected only 13 per cent of oceans and 2.5 per cent of our land, notably up from 0.9 per cent and 1.05 per cent, respectively.\nIs this enough or do we deserve more? What are the other parties going to do in these areas?\nAre incidents of violence against women increasing or declining?\nThe best indicators tell us it has increased slightly during the last four years. The Trudeau government has implemented a Gender Based Violence Knowledge Centre that will hopefully enable us to better address prevention. Will the other parties commit to maintaining it?\nThe national gender pay gap has closed marginally during the last four years. Canadian women still make only 87 cents for every dollar that men make, on a national basis, as opposed to the 86 cents they made four years ago.\nNewfoundland and Labrador has the highest gender pay gap of any province in the country with women making 69 cents for every dollar a man makes. When can we expect to see improvements in this area? The Trudeau government has offered pay equity, pay transparency, paternity leave, and daycare spaces. What are the other parties offering?\nIt is hardly a secret that the growing service economy has created more minimum wage positions. Job growth numbers do not tell us how many jobs people need to earn enough money to live on or to make it through university.\nMany Canadians need desperately to see the minimum wage raised. Many want to see much higher taxes on high income earners and corporations. They want to see solutions for taxing the wealth that now goes offshore untaxed.\nWhen politicians talk about job numbers, we need to ask them:\nIn short, Canadians want to see structural change that will address\u00a0the major challenges of our time. Many also feel that the major political parties are not up to addressing these challenges in any substantive way.\u00a0\nThe major parties have spent much of this election, and indeed the last four\u00a0years, focused on \"gotcha\" politics.\nThe problem with that is when we are\u00a0debating who is perfect enough to be prime minister, we are not talking about the policy changes that need to be made.\u00a0\nWe have reached a critical turning point in our history.\nWe owe it to the next generation to manage our shifting global environment in an effective and responsible manner. We owe it to them to put partisanship aside.\nWe also owe it to them to ask the hard questions of our leaders right now.\u00a0\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "PBO forecasts slower growth and deeper federal deficits", "description": "PBO cites weaker exports because of trade disputes and protectionism", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pbo-federal-deficit-1.5359707", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5333279.1571922057!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trans-mountain-20191023.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 14, 2019 2:29 PM ET", "2019-11-14T20:12:05.143Z"], "source": null, "content": "Parliament's budget watchdog warns that rougher economic waters will mean a deeper federal deficit, with no certainty on how much deeper.\nIn a report Thursday, the parliamentary budget office downgraded its outlook for the country's economy compared to its projections from June, citing weaker exports because of an ongoing trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies \u2014 the United States and China \u2014 and increasing protectionism around the world.\nAlso factored into the downward economic outlook are spending cuts by Premier Jason Kenney's government in Alberta amid lower spending across all governments in Canada, which the PBO expects will hit some of the lowest levels since 2008, in the worst of the global financial crisis.\nThe budget office's report predicts the economic slowing will deepen the annual deficit by $1.6 billion, on average, through to 2025, creating a deficit of $21.1 billion when the current fiscal year wraps up in March 2020, and $23.3 billion in the ensuing 12-month period. The office expects the deficit will shrink to $11.1 billion in 2024-2025.\nThe worsened shortfall is the result, the budget office says, of lower tax revenues and higher operating expenses for the federal government than had been expected. When the economy is whirring along, the government collects more taxes and people generally call less on public services.\nBut all those numbers don't reflect any new policy decisions, or promises made during this fall's election campaign. Nor do they include future changes in spending by provincial governments, or a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling that ordered the federal government to compensate Indigenous children and some family members harmed by failings in the child-welfare system \u2014 a package that could run into the billions of dollars.\nAdd it all up and actual deficits over the coming years are expected to be bigger than the report projects based on currently known numbers making it \"unlikely\" the budget will be balanced by the 2024-2025 fiscal year.\nThe Liberals campaigned in 2015 on running deficits of about $10 billion before balancing the budget by the end of their four-year mandate. But they jettisoned that promise in favour of a consistent decline in the federal debt-to-GDP ratio, which compares government debt to the size of the overall economy.\nThe PBO report suggests warns that any new spending or changes in tax revenues could mean the ratio doesn't decline as the government hopes. It also notes that the government hasn't set any date for when it hopes to get back to balance.\nThe party's 2019 platform forecast a deficit next fiscal year of almost $27.4 billion and $23.7 billion the year after, relying on the PBO's forecasts from June.\nThe updated forecast wouldn't shift the Liberals' deficit projections too much in 2020-2021, but the PBO's new numbers would add $4 billion to the deficit the year after \u2014 making it closer to $27.3 billion.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The fascinating ways airports compete for your business", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/the-fascinating-ways-airports-compete-for-your-business-1.5486558", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5435537.1579652655!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/generic-airplane-taking-off.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 05, 2020 9:55 AM ET", "2020-03-05T14:55:12.849Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "These days, airport terminals are no longer grey, drab industrial buildings. They are vibrant, colourful and unique.\nAnd with airline travel set to double in a few short years, airports are employing some bold, non-stop marketing ideas.\nMost of us walk through airports like we're on a mission.\nChecking luggage, impatiently inching through security lines, finding the gate, waiting for the crunch of the boarding call. Hoping everything is on time.\nBut have you stopped to actually look at airports lately? They are undergoing big changes.\nIt may surprise you to know that airports compete for business with other airports.\nYes, airports are highly competitive brands.\nThey compete for passengers, hoping travellers will choose their airport as a hub or a connection. The more passengers that pass through its gates, the more revenue an airport makes.\nMore flights mean more income, more retail sales, and more duty-free revenue, more parking fees, and so on.\nAirports compete to attract airlines because airlines bring passengers along with lucrative landing and departure fees. Airlines choose which airports to use as hubs and connecting flights.\nAirports compete to attract and retain the best retailers and restaurants. In the new world of airport design, the highest-rated airports have the best retail stores, spas and restaurants. Happy travellers attract airlines. And, airports compete for big cargo contracts and warehouse fees.\nSo if you don't think airports are competitive brands, think again. The airports of today are mini cities.\nToronto's Pearson Airport, for example, facilitates over 50,000 jobs. It is the second biggest employment zone in Canada. Pearson hosted 45 million passengers and over 430,000 flights last year. It contributed over $42 billion\u00a0in economic activity or 6.3 per cent of Ontario's GDP.\nOver 63,000 work at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. It handled close to 900,000 flights last year. It features 300 retailers and restaurants and the airport generates $34 billion\u00a0in economic impact for metro Atlanta. It is one of the busiest airports in the world.\nOver 76,000 people work at Heathrow\u00a0Airport in London. It handles 1,300 flights every day and 80 million passengers every year.\nWith that much revenue at stake, it's no wonder airports have strategically redesigned themselves completely.\nThe new era of airport design began after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Suddenly, we all found ourselves spending more downtime at the airport than ever before. Prior to Sept. 11, you could catch a flight even if you got there at the last minute. Running to the gate was an airport clich\u00e9. But after the attack (and the shoe bomber) airport security became a major issue.\nPassengers now have to check in 90 minutes before domestic flights,\u00a0and two hours ahead of departure time when flying internationally. That means \u2014 for the first time in aviation history \u2014 we are now spending most of our time on the post-security side of the terminal.\nWith that seismic change,\u00a0airports needed to be redesigned.\nMost major airports are now bustling retail centres. They boast hundreds of retail stores and restaurants. They offer spas and sleeping pods. Pearson has a gigantic fitness gym on the main floor. Sales from retail, duty-free and food and\u00a0beverage accounts for over 54 per cent of an airport's revenues.\nWith that much potential revenue, airports are becoming destinations themselves.\nThe remarkable Changi airport in Singapore, for example, features a 40-metre-high indoor waterfall flanked by tropical plants and a forest of over 2,000 trees. It also has a butterfly garden, a rooftop pool and you can walk above it all on a 24-metre-high Sky-net. Travellers have voted Changi the best airport in the world for seven years in a row.\nIncheon International Airport in South Korea has a golf course and a skating rink.\nThe Munich Airport has a cinema, a minigolf course and its own brewery.\nThe Kansai\u00a0International Airport in Osaka, Japan, offers a dentist's office and a pet hotel.\nThe Amsterdam airport has a library.\nClearly, creating a unique experience is a critical aspect of branding an airport.\nFor more stories about Airports As Brands, click or tap the \"Listen\" button above to hear the full Under the Influence episode.

I can say without a doubt that this place is a far better place in 2019 than it was in 2015.\"\nBall pointed to the promise of a Waterford hospital replacement and the province's\u00a0commitment\u00a0to support the changing face of mental health and addiction services.\n\"We are investing strategically and delivering social and economic programs that people need and expect,\" he said. \"We are listening.\"\nBall then turned his attention\u00a0to the oil and gas sector, telling the gathered audience that the industry has\u00a0brought in $22 billion in royalties since 1997.\nPointing to a statistic from 2017, he said that oil and gas made up 17 per cent\u00a0of the province's GDP.\nBut just one\u00a0day after St. John's city council voted to declare climate change an emergency,\u00a0the premier was quick to repeat his claim this province's oil is cleaner than other global oil sources.\n\"A barrel of oil in our province emits, on average, 12 kilograms of carbon dioxide. If you compare that to the world average, 18 kilograms per barrel, that leaves at 50 percent less carbon per barrel,\" he said. Twelve kilograms per barrel is actually 33 per cent less than 18 kilograms per barrel.\nCiting the growing mining industry and forestry sector, Ball said, \"Newfoundland and Labrador will be the energy capital of Canada by 2030.\"\n\"Why not?\" he said to the media following the event.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The fascinating ways airports compete for your business", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/the-fascinating-ways-airports-compete-for-your-business-1.5486558", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5435537.1579652655!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/generic-airplane-taking-off.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 05, 2020 9:55 AM ET", "2020-03-05T14:55:12.849Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "These days, airport terminals are no longer grey, drab industrial buildings. They are vibrant, colourful and unique.\nAnd with airline travel set to double in a few short years, airports are employing some bold, non-stop marketing ideas.\nMost of us walk through airports like we're on a mission.\nChecking luggage, impatiently inching through security lines, finding the gate, waiting for the crunch of the boarding call. Hoping everything is on time.\nBut have you stopped to actually look at airports lately? They are undergoing big changes.\nIt may surprise you to know that airports compete for business with other airports.\nYes, airports are highly competitive brands.\nThey compete for passengers, hoping travellers will choose their airport as a hub or a connection. The more passengers that pass through its gates, the more revenue an airport makes.\nMore flights mean more income, more retail sales, and more duty-free revenue, more parking fees, and so on.\nAirports compete to attract airlines because airlines bring passengers along with lucrative landing and departure fees. Airlines choose which airports to use as hubs and connecting flights.\nAirports compete to attract and retain the best retailers and restaurants. In the new world of airport design, the highest-rated airports have the best retail stores, spas and restaurants. Happy travellers attract airlines. And, airports compete for big cargo contracts and warehouse fees.\nSo if you don't think airports are competitive brands, think again. The airports of today are mini cities.\nToronto's Pearson Airport, for example, facilitates over 50,000 jobs. It is the second biggest employment zone in Canada. Pearson hosted 45 million passengers and over 430,000 flights last year. It contributed over $42 billion\u00a0in economic activity or 6.3 per cent of Ontario's GDP.\nOver 63,000 work at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. It handled close to 900,000 flights last year. It features 300 retailers and restaurants and the airport generates $34 billion\u00a0in economic impact for metro Atlanta. It is one of the busiest airports in the world.\nOver 76,000 people work at Heathrow\u00a0Airport in London. It handles 1,300 flights every day and 80 million passengers every year.\nWith that much revenue at stake, it's no wonder airports have strategically redesigned themselves completely.\nThe new era of airport design began after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Suddenly, we all found ourselves spending more downtime at the airport than ever before. Prior to Sept. 11, you could catch a flight even if you got there at the last minute. Running to the gate was an airport clich\u00e9. But after the attack (and the shoe bomber) airport security became a major issue.\nPassengers now have to check in 90 minutes before domestic flights,\u00a0and two hours ahead of departure time when flying internationally. That means \u2014 for the first time in aviation history \u2014 we are now spending most of our time on the post-security side of the terminal.\nWith that seismic change,\u00a0airports needed to be redesigned.\nMost major airports are now bustling retail centres. They boast hundreds of retail stores and restaurants. They offer spas and sleeping pods. Pearson has a gigantic fitness gym on the main floor. Sales from retail, duty-free and food and\u00a0beverage accounts for over 54 per cent of an airport's revenues.\nWith that much potential revenue, airports are becoming destinations themselves.\nThe remarkable Changi airport in Singapore, for example, features a 40-metre-high indoor waterfall flanked by tropical plants and a forest of over 2,000 trees. It also has a butterfly garden, a rooftop pool and you can walk above it all on a 24-metre-high Sky-net. Travellers have voted Changi the best airport in the world for seven years in a row.\nIncheon International Airport in South Korea has a golf course and a skating rink.\nThe Munich Airport has a cinema, a minigolf course and its own brewery.\nThe Kansai\u00a0International Airport in Osaka, Japan, offers a dentist's office and a pet hotel.\nThe Amsterdam airport has a library.\nClearly, creating a unique experience is a critical aspect of branding an airport.\nFor more stories about Airports As Brands, click or tap the \"Listen\" button above to hear the full Under the Influence episode.

As workers head home and young people gather for the evening, there's plenty of socializing and little social distancing.\nIn fact, except for a few extra masked faces, closed schools and subways that are less crowded than usual, there are few sign of panic or pandemic. Stores and restaurants are mostly open and office hours have been largely maintained.\n\"That's Japanese culture,\" said financial worker Riku Tanaka with a shrug. \"It's our culture to never take a break from work, no matter what.\"\nIt's only in the last week that pubs, karaoke bars and pachinko gaming parlours were officially encouraged to close, and police and barbed wire were posted to keep crowds from Japan's iconic Sakura festival, when the cherry trees blossom and Tokyo turns pink. Parties are common in parks under the flowering branches.\n\"Move along,\" a police officer told groups of gawkers this week. \"You can see it next year.\"\nIf Japan seems complacent about the threat of coronavirus in a world that's been crippled by it, that's partly because the number of infections here has been relatively low. Japan has had fewer than 3,000 confirmed cases and 80 deaths in a country with 126 million people \u2015 more than three times the population of Canada.\nRegional outbreaks in the northern island of Hokkaido, Osaka and elsewhere were given special attention, but declared resolved relatively quickly.\nMany consider Japan's tidy streets and personal hygiene as its protective shield.\n\"Japanese people are quite careful about being clean,\" said student Shunpei Kanai on a busy Tokyo street corner. He pointed to frequent hand washing and a culture of cleanliness.\nStill, the country is getting nervous.\nTokyo governor Yuriko Koike has declared \"high concern,\" issuing increasingly anxious warnings for people to avoid going outside. The number of cases in the megacity is rising now by almost a hundred per day, shocking many.\nHospitals have been told to reserve beds only for the severely ill and to tell others who test positive to stay at home. With the Tokyo Olympics now postponed from this summer to July 2021, the government is considering using some sports facilities to house the sick.\n\"We're just barely holding it together,\" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said this week. \"If we loosen our grip even a little, it wouldn't be surprising to see a sudden surge.\"\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe has conceded Japan is \"barely holding the line,\" but he's been reluctant to declare a state of emergency, much less order a lockdown. Even if he did, Japanese law doesn't give officials the kind of sweeping powers of enforcement other countries have to force people to stay home or impose fines on those who disobey.\nHis government is worried about the impact on an economy that was already faltering before the crisis hit. Japan's GDP is on track to shrink by 7.1 per cent, based on figures from the first quarter of the year, raising the spectre of a recession even worse than the last big one in 2008.\nAll of Japan's auto makers, engines of the country's economy, have stopped production because of falling demand worldwide. The cost of postponing the Olympics has been pegged at $6 billion US. The country's tourism industry is in freefall.\nInstead of calling the epidemic an emergency, Abe offered something a little less: a supply of two cloth facemasks per household, to address a national shortage.\n\"You can use soap to wash and re-use them, so this should be a good response,\" he said.\nJapanese Twitter users exploded with criticism of the government's tepid response.\n\"Is the Japanese government for real? This is a total waste of tax money,\" said a user named Usube. As with many commentators, the message was that Tokyo should be doing more.\n\"If too much consideration is put on the economy, there will be cases where we can't protect lives,\" said SatoMasahisa. \"Life is the top priority.\"\nExperts are watching Japan closely to see if it can keep the coronavirus under control without resorting to lockdowns or extensive testing, and without crippling the economy. No major nation has been able to do that, though Sweden is trying something similar, with mixed results.\nKenji Shibuya, a public health expert at King's College in London and a former chief of health policy at the World Health Organization, is skeptical that his home country can pull it off.\nHe said either Japan has successfully been able to ferret out clusters of the disease and stop it from spreading through detective work, or \"outbreaks are still to be found.\"\n\"My guess is that Japan is about to see an explosion of transmission,\" he said, \"so we have to be very careful.\"\nBy one measure, Japan may be especially in danger. It has the oldest population in the world, with 28 per cent of people over the age of 65. Based on fatalities from the coronavirus globally, that's the group with the highest risk of dying.\nSo far in Japan, all but a couple of deaths have been among patients over 70.\nWATCH | How Taiwan is fighting the COVID-19 outbreak\nIt's exactly why Toshio Baba has barely been out of his house in more than a month \u2014 though this week, urgent errands took him down a crowded street in Tokyo's Shinjuku commercial district.

And it's led many of us to reflect not only on the current moment but also on what comes next. If there will be an \"after\" COVID-19, the world will be fundamentally changed. (Yes, I said \"if.\")\u00a0\nThere's a\u00a0question that I've noticed coming up a lot lately: what kind of new world do we want to build? Part of the answer lies in reflecting on what we don't want to continue. I suggest that in this new iteration, we stop devaluing artists' worth.\nIf you told me a month ago that I would be spending my evenings re-watching the pilot episode of The Walking Dead, jotting down tips for non-violent survival tools (transistor radio, walkie talkies, bolt cutters?), I would have laughed \u2014 a lot. But the world looks different today than it did just a few weeks earlier.\u00a0\nThe things we once took for granted seem more fragile and fleeting than ever before. I've only been able to stop myself from descending into a rabbit hole of existential despair and irrational paranoia by basking in live duets between Deborah Cox and Tamia, or watching Christopher Paunil create ridiculously stylish COVID-19 masks. I've spent mornings reading the words of M. NourbeSe Philip, evenings struggling to keep up with Esie Mensah's dance moves and nights jamming down to sets by some of Toronto's finest DJs.\u00a0\nAnd I'm not the only one. Everyone I talk to seems to be coping with social isolation through engagement with art and culture. Our calendars are now populated by appointments for virtual theatre readings, Instagram Live paint-alongs and Stay-at-Home Cinema nights. At a time when social distancing has become a matter of life and death, it is the creatives who have largely made it possible to endure this new way of life.\nLet's not forget that this isn't an easy time for anyone in the creative industries. Lockdowns around the world have forced tours, performances, book launches, festivals and film productions to cancel. Entire creative industries that are already highly vulnerable have been put on pause.\u00a0It is too early to say how much this virus has economically affected Canada's cultural industries, but artists felt the hit almost immediately.\nThe thing is, before this lockdown even began, artists in Canada were already facing a multitude of challenges. Last year in Ontario, funding to the Ontario Arts Council was cut by $10 million, a $5 million Indigenous Culture Fund was cancelled and the Ontario Music Fund was cut by $8 million. Similar decisions were made in Alberta in 2019, with cuts to video game industries, the Alberta Foundation of the Arts and The Banff Centre.\nIn Winnipeg, proposed cuts to the arts made headlines earlier this month. In February, Nova Scotia arts groups challenged the province's decade-long funding freeze. These recent cuts follow a national trend where support for the arts is largely deemed elective. It is often one of the first areas on the chopping block when governments want to balance budgets. Artists are constantly forced to prove their value and worth to governments and voters. This lockdown should be a wake-up call to all of us who are leaning on these creatives now: arts and culture needs to be an unwavering national priority.\nBut if you're tired of me tugging on your heart strings and need things broken down into dollars and cents, artists are consistently bringing this country cold hard cash.\nNumbers released by Statistics Canada last year revealed that the economic impact of culture industries in 2017 was approximately $59 billion. That's eight times more than sports and is larger than the combined value of utilities; agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting; and accommodation and food services.\nIn 2014, Toronto spent far less per capita on arts, culture and heritage than cities like Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary and Ottawa, but creative industries in Toronto still contributed $11.3 billion to the city's GDP. Artists bring in money, and perhaps more importantly, they also help to build Canadian identity.\u00a0According to a fact sheet put out by the Toronto Arts Council, 95 per cent of Ontario residents believe that the success of Canadian artists gives people a sense of national pride.\nDespite all of this, our culture constantly belittles artists' worth, but remains happy to parade their talent for ceremony. Remember when former Prime Minister Stephen Harper said that \"ordinary working people\" don't care about the arts \u2014 that they don't want to turn on their TVs to see artists whining about funding at \"a rich gala\"?\u00a0\nIn Harper's estimation, artists aren't working people. (And an important note about those \"galas\"\u00a0\u2014 they're a rare opportunity for artists\u00a0to celebrate their work and make important connections. They can also lead to more recognition and resources for their work). Harper's\u00a0astonishing ignorance about the average life of Canadian artists would have been hilarious if the reality weren't so sad.\u00a0\nAccording to a recent Canada Council study, the median individual income for Canadian artists is $24,300, which is well below the poverty line. The lowest rung is reserved for dancers, who make $15,800 a year, on average. Musicians and singers follow them ($17,900/year) and then actors and comedians ($18,500/year). People in these creative fields have been hit particularly hard by the lockdown. The tours and live shows that make up a substantial part of their income have all been cancelled. And contrary to Harper's assessment of artists, the Toronto Arts Foundation's 2019 Art Stats report revealed that Toronto-based artists work an average 51.4 hours a week, which is more than the average full-time Canadian worker.\u00a0\nIn spite of that hustle and grind, the majority of artists in the city cannot make enough to continue living here. A recent cost of living index estimated that a resident would need to earn $55,500 a year to afford rent and take public transit in Toronto. With so many artists now unable to earn their wages, the future looks bleaker, even with the various avenues of support that have emerged in the midst of COVID-19.\u00a0\nNot all artists are in the same boat, however. I would be remiss if I didn't also mention Black artists' difficulties in accessing arts funding. Historically, it has been an upward climb, regardless of government-enforced cuts. Andrea Monike Fatona's critical study on equity at the Canada Council of the Arts illustrates how in the '80s and '90s, Indigenous, POC and Black artists had to work together to lobby various cultural institutions to address the systemic exclusion of their art and the way that work was positioned and categorized. There is a systemic reason why racialized Canadians are underrepresented in the arts community. It is scary to think how much more those numbers will decrease as we feel the after-effects of this moment.\u00a0\nAs we sit at home in isolation bingeing movies created by artists,\u00a0watching Instagram Lives hosted by artists and\u00a0singing along to music created by artists, I hope an awakening happens. What kind of world do we want to build? I hope it's one where the same creatives who have kept us entertained and sane during this time are no longer taken for granted. I want a world where artists are respected and valued for their work and their worth.\nCBC Arts understands that this is an incredibly difficult time for artists and arts organizations across this country.

And craft breweries have been permitted to sell their products curbside as well.\n\"We explored the option of allowing alcohol sales via delivery from restaurants, and brought the issue to the joint committee dealing with COVID-19 response,\" said Finance Minister Tom Osborne.\u00a0\n\"While we had a good discussion, these changes would require introduction of legislation to accomplish. There are many considerations for such a shift, including how age verification is confirmed.\"\u00a0\nOsborne said implementing such a change without due consideration of these issues would be irresponsible.\nChef Todd Perrin knows the struggles of the restaurant industry.\n\"We're particularly vulnerable in our business, because we're so reliant on that daily cash flow and anything that disrupts missing a Thursday, or a Friday, or a Saturday \u2014 it just has a very direct effect on your ability to proceed,\" he said.\n\"The closure \u2014 be it a Snowmageddon event or a global pandemic \u2014 these holes that get blown in our revenue are gone forever.\"\nAs a co-owner, Perrin said he felt the effects of the pandemic right away. Mallard Cottage in Quidi Vidi was closed (as well as its related inn next door); Waterwest Kitchen and Meats in St. John's changed its service to takeout only.\nAcross those three businesses, Perrin said, they had to lay off almost 70 employees. There are now only a dozen people on the job.\nWith changing safety measures, Waterwest later shifted to curbside pickup \u2014 which has led to a drop in sales.\nPerrin said he's unhappy with what he's heard out of Ottawa to date, noting that waiting six weeks for money is not sustainable for their current operating model.\n\"It's not enough to pay the bills, really, but in the interest of trying to kind of wait out until we see what level of [federal government] support is going to be there,\" he said.\n\"It's really just an exercise in keeping some of our staff operational and not having to go through the process of closing the business [which also has associated costs].\"\nPerrin said the near-term future of Waterwest will depend on this week \u2014 how well the business does, and what new challenges come with the evolving COVID-19 situation.\n\"[It's] going to be a big teller in terms of what we're going to be able to do for the next number of months,\" he said.\nBut through it all, Perrin said he remains hopeful.\n\"I've been joking that it's bobbing and weaving, but it's certainly the most trying thing that we've ever gone through,\" he said.\n\"Our goal is always to keep rolling, and we'll do whatever we can, personally and businesswise, to do that.\"\nThe team will hold strategy meetings early next week to try to figure out a path forward.\n\"[It's a] combination of how the level of business is \u2026 how our staff is feeling, how we're able to maintain a safe environment for our staff to work in, and maintain a safe environment for ourselves and our customers,\" he said.\n\"[We're] dedicated to make it happen, if we can.\"\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Portugal's ruling Socialists top general election", "description": "Not yet clear if PM Antonio Costa's party gained enough seats for majority", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/portugal-election-1.5311195", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311205.1570396366!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/portugal-election.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 06, 2019 5:45 PM ET", "2019-10-06T23:33:10.457Z"], "source": null, "content": "The centre-left Socialist Party collected the most votes in Portugal's general election Sunday, leaving it poised to continue leading the government for another four years.\nWith 208 seats in the 230-seat parliament awarded in the official count, the Socialists reached 99 seats, compared with 74 for the second-place Social Democratic Party. Social Democrat leader Rui Rio conceded defeat.\nThe parliament chooses a government, usually taken from the party that has the most lawmakers.\nIt remained unclear, however, whether the Socialists would get a parliamentary majority, with votes from abroad being counted late.\nThat could mean the Socialists take power as a minority government or pursue alliances with other left-of-centre parties to pass legislation \u2014 as they did in their last term with the Portuguese Communist Party and the radical Left Bloc.\nThe Left Bloc, which had won 17 seats in the incomplete count, said it was ready to open negotiations with the Socialists on a government program. The Portuguese Communist Party had 10 seats and the Christian Democrats five.\nAntonio Costa, the Socialist leader and incumbent prime minister, took power four years ago on a promise to undo austerity measures introduced during Europe's financial crisis, when Portugal needed an international bailout.\nNow his Socialists reaped the rewards of Portugal's economic rebound in recent years. Annual growth climbed from 0.2 per cent\u00a0in 2014 to 2.1 per cent\u00a0in 2018, and unemployment dropped by around half, to six\u00a0per cent, over that period.\nAs other Socialist parties have lost ground across Europe in recent years, Costa's administration has proved wrong the doubters who said it would overspend and endeared itself to its European Union partners by straightening out Portugal's ill-managed public finances.\nThe budget deficit \u2014 long a torment for Portugal as governments routinely overspent \u2014 is now close to zero under the financial stewardship of Finance Minister Mario Centeno, who also chairs the meetings of finance ministers from the 19 European nations that used the shared euro currency. Centeno is expected to continue in the post.\nThe Social Democrats are still associated in the public mind with deep cutbacks and a three-year recession that ended in 2014, when they were in government. Also, party leader Rui Rio has struggled to contain disagreements between factions of his party.\nSmaller, fringe parties may also gain a handful of seats in the 230-seat Republican Assembly, the country's parliament, which will elect the next government. The country's president is mostly a figurehead.\nPortugal hasn't witnessed the rise of populist or far-right parties which have risen to prominence elsewhere in the EU. Protests in Portugal are traditionally channeled into a low turnout \u2014 the exit poll said it could be a new low of around only half the country's 10.8 million eligible voters.\nThe next government faces plenty of challenges, including the United Kingdom's impending departure from the EU. The U.K. is one of Portugal's main export markets.\nWhile government spending is now more in line with revenues, Portugal's government debt is equivalent to more than 120 per cent\u00a0of gross domestic product \u2014 the third highest in the EU. And the combined government, private and corporate debt is more than three times the country's GDP, the Bank of Portugal says. If European interest rates rise, the Portuguese could find themselves in big trouble.\nOther challenges include climate change, as rainfall in the southern half of the country dwindles, and an aging population that threatens the financing of the welfare system. The EU says that at current fertility rates the number of Portuguese will decline from 10.3 million this year to 6.6 million in 2100.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Rail blockades causing containers to pile up at Canadian ports", "description": "Containers sitting idle at major import hubs of Vancouver, Montreal and Halifax", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/rail-blockade-ports-1.5471312", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5471347.1582303625!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/halifax-port-containers.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 21, 2020 11:48 AM ET", "2020-02-21T20:25:43.187Z"], "source": null, "content": "A rail blockade in eastern Ontario has led to backlogs at Canada's three biggest ports, prompting some shippers to take their business elsewhere as cargo piles up and dockworkers' paycheques shrink.\nThe protest along Canadian National Railway tracks east of Belleville, Ont., has halted CN's eastern network \u2014 about one-quarter of its operations \u2014 and choked shipments from coast to coast.\nAtlantic Container Line (ACL), a major U.S. shipping line, is diverting from the Port of Halifax in favour of U.S. harbours. The company, which typically berths two ships a week, is now docking in New York and Baltimore to run cargo inland on American railroads, chief executive Andrew Abbott said.\n\"It's our gateway port for North America. So if you take out the rail, it knocks out 90 per cent of the cargo that we were putting on the ship,\" said Abbott, whose company has been calling on the Halifax port for more than 50 years.\nACL typically handles the equivalent of about 2,000 20-foot containers a week in Halifax that carry everything from Ontario auto parts to French cheese.\n\"It's commercial damage to Canadian manufacturers. It's financial damage to the guys who are bringing in French wine or Walkers butter cookies, because they're not going on the shelves,\" Abbott said. \"Everybody's paying a piece.\"\nWATCH | Businesses try to wait it out:\nHalifax longshoremen are also working \u2014 and earning \u2014 less, as more than 60 per cent of freight that passes through the port is bound for trains that can no longer be loaded, port authority spokesman Lane Farguson said.\nThe blockade disrupts business for everyone from stevedores to truckers, packers, importers, exporters and the ports and railways themselves.\n\"It is certainly a challenging situation for everyone involved.\"\nIn Montreal, some 4,000 containers sit immobilized on the docks and Prairie bulk products like grain can no longer reach the port.\n\"We are obviously concerned about this situation, which has significant impacts on the economy and the transport logistics chain serving the port,\" spokeswoman Melanie Nadeau said in an email.\nMeanwhile, the number of ships waiting at anchor to enter Vancouver-area terminals has more than doubled to 50 due to the clogged transportation system, though no vessels are opting for U.S. ports as a result, said Vancouver Fraser Port Authority spokeswoman Melanie Nadeau.\nNearly two weeks ago, protesters barred road access to Canada's biggest freight hub for several days, one of many pop-up blockades at ports, rail lines and roads across the country.\nCN closed its critical eastern network eight days ago after protesters set up a blockade in Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory on Feb. 6 in support of Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who oppose a natural gas pipeline slated to pass through their traditional lands in British Columbia.\nThe rail shutdown is rippling out to other sectors. Superior Propane, Canada's largest supplier of the fuel, said the situation is getting dire as it begins to ration distribution in Atlantic Canada over concerns that hospitals, nursing homes and households could run out.\n\"This is a crisis that is unfolding. Unfortunately if it goes on many more days it will be very difficult for the propane industry to recover quickly enough to keep people in supply,\" chief executive Greg McCamus said in a phone interview.\nPropane companies generally have one to two weeks' supply on hand, relying on a network of trains and trucks to convey it from rail terminals to local storage facilities, he said. A frozen railroad squeezes that supply chain, triggering truck lineups as long as 10 hours for propane in Sarnia, Ont., according to Canadian Propane Association CEO Nathalie St-Pierre.\nThe blockades hinder west-to-east flow of household items from produce to plywood, Band-Aids and canola oil, and raise the cost of others, said Retail Council of Canada spokesman Karl Littler.\n\"In terms of the mass carried, rail is far more efficient. So you've got potential price impacts if everything that was formerly moved by rail is moved by truck\" \u2014 a sector already facing a severe shortage of drivers.\nThe effects are likely to be felt more keenly in smaller cities and towns, particularly in Eastern Canada, he said.\n\"We're not talking about some Soviet store where you've got two cans of gherkin,\" he said. \"But a lot of items are stuck 6,000 kilometres away in Vancouver.\"\nThe broader impact on the economy may only amount to a hit of 0.2 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth, said RBC economist Nathan Janzen \u2014 likely in the tens of millions of dollars. But the ripple effects are being felt \"acutely\" by some in the rail and manufacturing sectors.\nOn Wednesday, Via Rail announced temporary layoffs for 1,000 employees as its Montreal-Toronto, Ottawa-Toronto and Montreal-Quebec City routes remain suspended.\nEarlier this week, CN temporarily laid off about 450 workers from its operations in Eastern Canada after cancelling more than 400 trains since protests arose.\nMajor carriers are monitoring the blockades closely. German shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd continues to call on the Halifax port, but is reviewing the situation \"with a view to potentially omitting or rerouting vessels,\" said spokesman Tim Seifert.\nThe crisis is stranding an estimated $425 million in goods every day, according to the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters trade group.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian industry is 'addicted to fossil fuels,' but the Green Party can change that, says Elizabeth May", "description": "Goal isn't to come up with something politically palatable, it's to secure future: May", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-sept-27-2019-1.5298373/canadian-industry-is-addicted-to-fossil-fuels-but-the-green-party-can-change-that-says-elizabeth-may-1.5298632", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5296367.1569410796!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-green-party-20190920.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 27, 2019 12:13 PM ET", "2019-09-27T16:13:36.717Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Read Story Transcript\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May says Canadians want action on climate change, but are stymied by living in a society \"hardwired to fossil fuel use.\"\n\"It's very hard for an individual to take action in a system that's still subsidising fossil fuels, that's still promoting the idea that we can expand the oil sands,\" May told The Current's interim host Laura Lynch.\nShe said that what's needed is leadership and programs that help and encourage people to make sustainable choices, such as putting solar panels on their roofs, or plugging in their cars rather than stopping at the gas station.\n\"These are really good choices for the future, but almost impossible for the individual to do \u2026 against a structure in society that says we're addicted to fossil fuels, and we think that's just fine,\" she said.\n\"It's not fine.

You can't open it up again. So, we wanted to focus on something we could change, which is what this looks like for future trade deals like Canada-U.K., Canada-China and Canada-India,\" Blaikie added.\n\"I look forward to having a better process when the next government comes along that's looking to sign Canada up for some kind of trade deal.\"\nEarlier this week, Freeland offered effusive public thanks to New Democrats for supporting the new deal and stinging criticism of the Conservatives for wanting to study it further at a Commons committee. In the House of Commons Thursday she said Blaikie was a pleasure to work with on the changes.\nFreeland said the government wanted to limit study of the new deal, and was surprised that Conservatives wanted to extend committees' study of the agreement into March.\nBut the Conservative trade critic Randy Hoback told The Canadian Press that there was no circumstance under which his party would vote against ratifying the trade deal. He said the Tories simply wanted to hear from witnesses to give voice to people who are concerned about the deal, to make it stronger in the long term.\n\"That's what created the problem in the previous NAFTA is when people were left out. They were the ones that elected Trump this last election, because they were left out,\" said Hoback.\nPresident Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to rip up the old North American Free Trade Agreement during the renegotiations. Freeland has had cabinet responsibility for Canada-U.S. relations during that time as foreign affairs minister and now as deputy prime minister.\nGetting a new deal became the Liberal government's top priority because of Canada's massive economic dependence on access to the United States, its biggest trading partner.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "British immigration overhaul takes aim at 'cheap labour from Europe'", "description": "Changes likely to impact service, farming and health-care industries, among others", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/britain-immigration-system-plans-1.5468158", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5468167.1582118918!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/britain-politics-patel.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 19, 2020 8:45 AM ET", "2020-02-19T13:45:19.124Z"], "source": null, "content": "Britain announced new post-Brexit immigration rules Wednesday that will make it tougher for European Union citizens, but easier for people from many other nations, to move to the U.K. starting next year.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government said the new rules would \"open up the U.K. to the brightest and the best from around the world\" while ending \"the reliance on cheap, low-skilled labour coming into the country.\" But U.K. employers said the radical changes could bring about a labour crisis for sectors such as health and social care.\nBritain's exit from the EU last month after 47 years of membership is triggering the biggest change to the country's immigration rules for decades.\nDuring Britain's EU membership \u2014 and until a post-Brexit transition period runs out on Dec. 31 \u2014 citizens of any of the EU's 27 nations can freely live and work in the U.K.\nMore than three million EU citizens currently living in the U.K. are entitled to stay. But from Jan. 1, 2021, new immigration rules will apply to EU and non-EU citizens alike.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said Britain's new \"points-based immigration system\" would assess prospective immigrants on a range of skills, qualifications, salaries or professions.\nPeople hoping to work in Britain will need a job offer paying at least 25,600 pounds ($43,975 Cdn) a year. That's less than the current 30,000 pounds ($51,510 Cdn) set for non-EU immigrants, a figure that is more than the country's average annual wage. Prospective immigrants who earn less may be able to come if they have other skills.\nSkilled immigrants are currently required to have a university degree but in future will only need the equivalent of Britain's pre-university \"A levels.\"\nThe government says the new rules will cut net immigration from its current level of more than 200,000 people a year. But it has abandoned a pledge made by previous Conservative governments to cut Britain's annual net immigration figure to below 100,000 a year.\nThe immigration plan still has to be passed by Parliament \u2014 which is highly likely since the Conservatives have a large majority.\nThe government said it would come up with specific proposals for scientists, graduates, health-care workers and those in the agricultural sector. But there is no specific immigration route for what the government calls \"low-skilled workers\" \u2014 a category it says includes 70 per cent of the more than one million EU citizens who have moved to the U.K. since 2004.\nHundreds of thousands of EU citizens currently hold jobs in sectors including farming, health care and restaurants that are relatively low-paid.\nEmployers in those industries have warned there will be worker shortages under the tighter immigration rules. The U.K. Homecare Association described the lack of provisions for low-paid immigrant workers in the proposals as \"irresponsible.\"\n\"Cutting off the supply of prospective care workers under a new migration system will pave the way for more people waiting unnecessarily in hospital or going without care,\" it said.\nBut the government was unsympathetic.\n\"We need to shift the focus of our economy away from a reliance on cheap labour from Europe and instead concentrate on investment in technology and automation,\" it said in a policy paper. \"Employers will need to adjust.\"\nMany people who voted in 2016 for Britain to leave the EU believed that immigration had driven down wages and driven up joblessness among British-born workers. The evidence for this is partial at best.\nThe Migration Advisory Committee, an independent body consulted by the government on immigration plans, said introducing a points-based system would only \"very slightly increase GDP per capita, productivity, and improve the public finances\" compared to continued free movement of EU citizens, and would also reduce Britain's economic growth.\nDiane Abbott, the immigration spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, called the proposed new system flawed.\n\"This isn't an 'Australian points-based system,'\u00a0which is a meaningless government sound bite,\" she said. \"It's a salary threshold system, which will need to have so many exemptions \u2014 for the NHS [National Health Service],\u00a0for social care and many parts of the private sector\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that it will be meaningless.\"\n"}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "Tax the rich, spend on the poor: 3 years in, this is still an NDP government", "description": "But with an economy still performing tops in Canada, the government can comfortably stay the course", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-budget-2020-analysis-1.5467815", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5467963.1582073554!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bc-budget-2020-lock-up.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 19, 2020 4:00 AM PT", "2020-02-19T12:00:00.436Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "\"Budgets are really about choices,\" said Finance Minister Carole James, more than once, as she delivered her third budget as B.C.'s finance minister.\nThat being said, there were fewer choices to make\u00a0in this budget than her first two.\u00a0\nWith over three-quarters of the NDP's election platform already on the way, and a commitment to a balanced budget, there was always going to be little room to manoeuvre \u2014 even if reforms at ICBC and a slight slowdown in the provincial economy hadn't taken place.\u00a0\nBut those things did happen, and it meant the government had a decision to make: how would it stay in the black without going back on spending commitments in the expensive health and education ministries?\u00a0\nThe answer was a new tax on the people making the most money in the province \u2014 giving the province its highest marginal tax rate (20.5 per cent for people making over $220,000) this century.\u00a0\n\"If you had taken a\u00a0look at the past government, what often would happen at this time when you saw moderation in the economy, you'd see programs and services cut \u2026 we're not doing that,\" said James.\u00a0\n\"In order to do that, we've asked the top one\u00a0per cent to pay a little bit more.

According to Space Angels, a venture capitalist group specializing in space startups, the number of privately funded space companies has grown to 375, a near 14-fold increase since 2000.\nSpace Angels says those companies have raised a total of nearly $19 billion\u00a0US in private capital, a number which may be conservative given many venture capitalists don't like to publicize the size of their investments.\n\"We've reached the tipping point of space as a commercial space,\" said Stewart Bain, co-founder and CEO of NorthStar Earth & Space Inc.\nNorthStar is one of several high-tech Canadian space-focused companies with projects either online or coming online in the coming months. The Montreal-based company is creating a system of satellite-based\u00a0hyper-spectral, infrared and optical sensors to continuously monitor and analyze Earth's orbit. Think of it as kind of a space version of an air traffic control system.\n\"You're not going to have a $1 trillion space economy and commercialize space if everybody's worried that there's a one-in-1,000 chance that my satellite's going to get knocked out of space by a piece of debris moving at 15 kilometres per second,\" said Bain.\nThe European Space Agency says there are 34,000 bits of space debris larger than 10 centimetres\u00a0flying around Earth. That number rises to 900,000 for objects from between one and 10 centimetres and to 128,000,000 for objects from one millimetre to one centimetre.\nAccording to a March 2019 report by Research and Markets, more than 3,300 commercial satellites over 50 kilograms\u00a0will be launched between 2018 and 2027.\nThere are also much smaller satellites, nanosatellites weighing between one and 10 kilograms, picosatellites weighing less than\u00a0one kilogram, even femtosatellites, weighing just 10 to 100 grams. And more of those are heading off-planet.\nToronto-based Kepler Communications has two small satellites in space \u2014 launched on Chinese and Indian rockets \u2014 with plans to add 138 more within three years, moving massive amounts of data quickly, even in the most remote regions of the planet.\n\"You can think of it like routers in space,\" says Mina Mitry, Kepler's co-founder and CEO.\nKepler's satellites weigh about 10 kilograms and are about the size of a large loaf of bread.\nMiniaturization of components makes satellites lighter and therefore less expensive to send to orbit. The cost to launch a satellite ranges between $30,000\u00a0and $50,000 US per kilogram.\n\"The reduction in cost of accessing space and the reduction in regulatory burden to be able to access space are all making for a perfect storm to make a new form of space access,\" says Mitry.\nMitry says Canada is well positioned to make inroads in space thanks in part to a highly educated high-tech workforce.\n\"We're very fortunate to be based here in Toronto with marquee access to talent from the University of Toronto, from Waterloo university, from McMaster and all these neighbouring universities that feed directly into our business.\"\nLack of available high-tech talent is one of the hurdles faced by space companies in other countries, he says.\nThat talent is helping several Canadian firms make inroads in the sector, including Waterloo's SkyWatch, Edmonton's Wyvern, Mississauga's Macfab, and Ottawa's Mission Control, says Michelle Mendes, executive director of Satellite Canada Innovation Network or SatCan.\n\"Space commercialization in Canada has traditionally been more latent than other countries, but now it is starting to ramp up,\" says Mendes.\nShe says the U.S. and Europe are well ahead when it comes to commercial space ventures, with China and India also strong. But Canada is making inroads.\n\"We are at the beginning, but there is some good technology coming out of Canada, particularly because of the research and development support that Canada provides,\" she says.\nCanada's space industry produced revenues of $5.6 billion and contributed $2.3 billion to GDP in 2017, according to the Canadian Space Agency's State of the Canadian Space Sector Report 2018.\nBut those numbers are actually smaller than they used to be.\u00a0\n\"Unfortunately the latest studies showed that there was a minus seven per cent increase over last five years,\" says Mendes, who says the drop is entirely related to a drop in space funding from the federal government.\n\"This all comes from the budget. That will flow down into commercial space. Now the issue is that unless some more spending comes from the budget, we're not going to see an\u00a0upward trend,\" she says.\nCanada spends very little on its space program compared to other nations, in dollars and relative to GDP.\nCanada spent $434 million on its space program in 2016. By comparison, the United States spent nearly $35 billion China nearly $5 billion, Russia nearly $4 billion.\nThis year, India increased its budget for space by 11 per cent to\u00a0$1.8 billion\nMore and more though, the torch is being passed to private industry.\n\"The new space economy, this offers us additional opportunities to use more and more of the private sector to do activities that were traditionally done by space agencies around the world,\" says Martin H\u00e9bert, director of technology and science development at the Canadian Space Agency.\nIt's an opportunity and a responsibility Canadian companies are happy to take on.\n\"We'll do this because the demand has never been greater. We'll do this because the next generations depend on it,\" says NorthStar's Bain.\nIn a sense, he says, the passing of that torch began with Apollo 11.\n\"I work in space because somebody decided that the United States needed to go to the moon,\" he says.\n\"It inspired a generation to do something in outer space.\"\nMoon Landing 50th: CBC News takes you inside\nMuseum of Nature marks anniversary with 'supermoon'\nCanada participates in\u00a0Lunar Gateway\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "British immigration overhaul takes aim at 'cheap labour from Europe'", "description": "Changes likely to impact service, farming and health-care industries, among others", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/britain-immigration-system-plans-1.5468158", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5468167.1582118918!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/britain-politics-patel.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 19, 2020 8:45 AM ET", "2020-02-19T13:45:19.124Z"], "source": null, "content": "Britain announced new post-Brexit immigration rules Wednesday that will make it tougher for European Union citizens, but easier for people from many other nations, to move to the U.K. starting next year.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government said the new rules would \"open up the U.K. to the brightest and the best from around the world\" while ending \"the reliance on cheap, low-skilled labour coming into the country.\" But U.K. employers said the radical changes could bring about a labour crisis for sectors such as health and social care.\nBritain's exit from the EU last month after 47 years of membership is triggering the biggest change to the country's immigration rules for decades.\nDuring Britain's EU membership \u2014 and until a post-Brexit transition period runs out on Dec. 31 \u2014 citizens of any of the EU's 27 nations can freely live and work in the U.K.\nMore than three million EU citizens currently living in the U.K. are entitled to stay.

The cost to launch a satellite ranges between $30,000\u00a0and $50,000 US per kilogram.\n\"The reduction in cost of accessing space and the reduction in regulatory burden to be able to access space are all making for a perfect storm to make a new form of space access,\" says Mitry.\nMitry says Canada is well positioned to make inroads in space thanks in part to a highly educated high-tech workforce.\n\"We're very fortunate to be based here in Toronto with marquee access to talent from the University of Toronto, from Waterloo university, from McMaster and all these neighbouring universities that feed directly into our business.\"\nLack of available high-tech talent is one of the hurdles faced by space companies in other countries, he says.\nThat talent is helping several Canadian firms make inroads in the sector, including Waterloo's SkyWatch, Edmonton's Wyvern, Mississauga's Macfab, and Ottawa's Mission Control, says Michelle Mendes, executive director of Satellite Canada Innovation Network or SatCan.\n\"Space commercialization in Canada has traditionally been more latent than other countries, but now it is starting to ramp up,\" says Mendes.\nShe says the U.S. and Europe are well ahead when it comes to commercial space ventures, with China and India also strong. But Canada is making inroads.\n\"We are at the beginning, but there is some good technology coming out of Canada, particularly because of the research and development support that Canada provides,\" she says.\nCanada's space industry produced revenues of $5.6 billion and contributed $2.3 billion to GDP in 2017, according to the Canadian Space Agency's State of the Canadian Space Sector Report 2018.\nBut those numbers are actually smaller than they used to be.\u00a0\n\"Unfortunately the latest studies showed that there was a minus seven per cent increase over last five years,\" says Mendes, who says the drop is entirely related to a drop in space funding from the federal government.\n\"This all comes from the budget. That will flow down into commercial space. Now the issue is that unless some more spending comes from the budget, we're not going to see an\u00a0upward trend,\" she says.\nCanada spends very little on its space program compared to other nations, in dollars and relative to GDP.\nCanada spent $434 million on its space program in 2016. By comparison, the United States spent nearly $35 billion China nearly $5 billion, Russia nearly $4 billion.\nThis year, India increased its budget for space by 11 per cent to\u00a0$1.8 billion\nMore and more though, the torch is being passed to private industry.\n\"The new space economy, this offers us additional opportunities to use more and more of the private sector to do activities that were traditionally done by space agencies around the world,\" says Martin H\u00e9bert, director of technology and science development at the Canadian Space Agency.\nIt's an opportunity and a responsibility Canadian companies are happy to take on.\n\"We'll do this because the demand has never been greater. We'll do this because the next generations depend on it,\" says NorthStar's Bain.\nIn a sense, he says, the passing of that torch began with Apollo 11.\n\"I work in space because somebody decided that the United States needed to go to the moon,\" he says.\n\"It inspired a generation to do something in outer space.\"\nMoon Landing 50th: CBC News takes you inside\nMuseum of Nature marks anniversary with 'supermoon'\nCanada participates in\u00a0Lunar Gateway\n"}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "B.C. budget 2020 promises new tax on wealthy to help ensure future surpluses", "description": "Higher taxes on the top 1% to bring in $216 million next fiscal year ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-budget-day-carole-james-finance-2020-1.5466533", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5467739.1582065248!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/carole-james-b-c-2020-budget-victoria-2020.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 18, 2020 4:00 AM PT", "2020-02-18T23:45:26.781Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The B.C. government is promising continued balanced budgets over the next three years thanks to a new tax on the highest earners, sugary drinks, vaping and companies like Netflix.\u00a0\n\"We're asking those at the top who benefit most from our economy to contribute a little bit more,\" Finance Minister Carole James told reporters on Tuesday as the province unveiled its new budget.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"This really is a budget that builds a stronger British Columbia: not for a few at the top, but for everyone.\"\u00a0\nPremier John Horgan's NDP minority government is projecting a $227 million surplus for the 2020-21 fiscal year, along with $179 million in 2021-22.\u00a0\nBut it also announced three new tax measures to help achieve that:\u00a0\nWatch: Finance Mininster Carole James announces new tax\u00a0for most wealthy British Columbians, PST on sugary drinks and increased funds for low income post secondary students.\nJames said the increase to the top tax bracket \u2014 the second in three years \u2014 still leaves B.C. with the third lowest income taxes in the country\u00a0for people making under $475,000.\u00a0\n\"This will help to deliver the infrastructure and services that create good jobs and keep B.C.'s economy moving,\" she said, arguing the new taxes were required to ensure the province wouldn't have to cut funding to ministries at a time when the economy was slowing.\u00a0\nOutside those announcements, it was a relatively stand pat budget by the government, as it continued to build upon programs announced in previous budgets.\nHowever, there were some notable increases to planned spending.\u00a0\nThe government will spend around $130 million more on education this year than originally planned, due mostly to higher than projected enrolment. Around $50 million more will be earmarked over the next three years for the homeless, including 500 additional shelter spaces.\u00a0\nFurther, spending in the next fiscal year on health care \u2014 long the biggest driver of costs in the provincial budget \u2014 is now $22.2 billion, up from an anticipated $21.5 billion 12\u00a0months ago.\nThe newly announced\u00a0B.C.

There has been a lot of news and so it's understandable that some stories get overlooked.\nI want to draw your attention to a story you may have missed but is worth your attention: the economy isn't doing that great.\u00a0\nThose events I mentioned \u2014\u00a0 specifically the coronavirus outbreak and the railway blockades \u2014\u00a0 have an economic impact in addition to the very significant affects they have on our health and on reconciliation respectively.\nParliament's budget watchdog, Yves Giroux, spelled it out clearly late last week, downgrading his outlook for the Canadian economy. The last quarter of 2019 ended up with almost flat growth at 0.3 per cent, and Giroux cut his projection for the first quarter of this year from 1.8 per cent to 1.5 per cent (which was the estimate back in November).\u00a0\nThe slowdown last year, according to Giroux, is due to temporary disruptions in mining, oil and gas, motor vehicle and rail transportation sectors. Lax business investment was also a factor.\u00a0\nThe reason for the lowered expectation this year is the coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0\nI promise I'm not going to be all doom and gloom. Wages have seen some growth, unemployment is still remarkably low in most provinces (not all) and the economy is growing (if very slowly) not contracting.\u00a0\nThe federal finance minister's read on the situation?\n\"Generally, there's good reason for us to be optimistic about our situation and the economy,\" Bill Morneau said last week after meeting with private sector economists in Toronto. \"There are though, as we know, always challenges ...\"\nMake no mistake \u2014\u00a0 an economy with slow growth is a challenge; and maybe a bigger one than Morneau is willing to admit.\u00a0\nFirst of all, less growth means less revenue for the government. As expenses \u2012 for a variety of reasons, including spending promises made during the campaign \u2012 go up, less revenue isn't a great thing (regardless of how this government does not appear bothered by the current deficit levels, they won't be happy).\u00a0\nBut also \u2014 what the Parliamentary Budget Officer lays out may only be cracking the surface, for a few reasons. Giroux himself admits in his report that his estimate for how much the coronavirus outbreak might impact the economy is \"highly uncertain.\" Early projections are based on modelling from SARS, which happened 17 years ago.\nAs Brian Kingston of the Business Council of Canada put it: \"in 2003 China was responsible for about four per cent of global GDP, they're now responsible for nearly 20 per cent \u2026 so it's a completely different ballgame.\"\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that though exports to China fell last year because of the very strained relationship between that country and ours, China is still the second biggest destination for Canadian exports after the United States. A slowdown in the Chinese economy will impact Canadian exporters, that's a certainty.\u00a0\nAnd there's more. The PBO's analysis was done before the rail shutdowns started last week. There's no firm estimate I could find quantifying the economic impact of the shutdowns, but as of Friday, grain farmers said they'd already lost $10 million. Remember, when Giroux forecasted\u00a0 slower economic growth this year, he wasn't even taking that into account.\nIt will be interesting to see how the government navigates this set of economic circumstances. It's not straightforward \u2014 there's no major alarm bell; there's less growth but more jobs.\nMy guess is that means Morneau and his colleagues will say more of the same thing \u2014\u00a0 things are good but there are challenges. Just like my love for chocolate and my desire to lose weight, they'll continue to straddle the fine line between retraction and growth.\u00a0\nAnd remember \u2014 the budget is coming up, likely at the end of March. The Liberal government will have a better idea of how much of a hit the economy is taking by then \u2014\u00a0 and its decisions in crafting the budget will have to reflect that.\u00a0\nVassy Kapelos is host of Power & Politics, weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on CBC News Network.\nThis is just one part of the Minority Report newsletter.

They are already having an effect on activity levels and the flow of cities, writes CBC's Andre Mayer, while planners, architects and designers are seeing changes both in Canada and around the world that could become permanent.\nEvery major calamity, from the 19th-century cholera outbreaks to the 2013 floods in Calgary, has provided valuable lessons in better city-building, said John Brown, dean of the school of architecture, planning and landscape at the University of Calgary. But COVID-19 poses a unique challenge. Ensuring people have access to transit, shopping amenities and fresh air, all while maintaining a two-metre distance, is difficult in high-density areas.\nAs a result of our collective self-isolation, there are fewer cars on the road. At the same time, people are seeking respite outdoors by walking. But it is increasingly challenging to maintain a respectful distance on sidewalks without veering into traffic. Some municipalities are taking bold action to address this. Last week, the Italian city of Milan announced a plan to transform 35 kilometres of streets to expand cycling and walking space. In reducing car capacity, it will have the dual effect of providing a safe outlet for walkers and reducing air pollution. Berlin, Budapest and Mexico City are just some of the cities proposing similar measures.\nPublic transit is also a crucial element of any cityscape, as many people can't rely on a car to get around. Most cities are reporting a drop in public transit use during the pandemic, and it's likely to remain lower than usual in the short term, said Ahsan Habib, director of the school of planning at Dalhousie University. During the pandemic, U.S. cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and Denver have made several adjustments to their transit systems, including suspending fares and allowing rear-door boarding. Habib said ultimately, cities must invest in ways to make buses and streetcars less prone to crowding.\nThe pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of letting a large part of the labour force work from home. While not everyone can telecommute, enough people are able to do so that it could reduce demand for physical offices, which could in turn affect the proliferation of highrise buildings. Brown, who also runs a Calgary-based architecture firm called Housebrand, said telecommuting may also have an impact on the layout of homes, as residents seek to carve out discrete corners in even the tiniest condo suite to have a private Zoom meeting.\nClick below to watch more from The National\nCanada is officially in a recession because of the pandemic, C.D. Howe says\nCanada is officially in a recession that's been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the C.D. Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council declared today. The council, which monitors recessions and recoveries in Canada, said the economy peaked in February, just before drastic measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus were implemented across the country.\nThere are no hard and fast rules for declaring a recession, although one rule of thumb used by economists is that an economy is probably in one if it has shrunk for two three-month periods in a row. The council rejects the \"two quarters\" rule and instead defines a recession as a \"pronounced, persistent and pervasive decline in aggregate economic activity\" based largely on GDP and the job market.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is still less than two months old in Canada, but the council said that the slowdown is already so swift and deep that it's safe to declare a recession already. In the council's view, this is the first recession Canada has seen since the financial crisis that began in 2008 \u2014 and the data suggests this one is on track to be quite a bit worse than that one. While the decline in March was record-setting, economists expect the data for April will show an even bigger drop, with the measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus in place for the entire month.\nRead more about Canada's economic situation \nOntario allows some businesses to reopen Monday, while Alberta's plan begins Saturday\nThe Ontario government announced today that it's allowing a limited number of businesses to reopen, as long as they meet \"strict public health measures.\" Lawn care and landscaping services, garden centres and nurseries with curbside pickup, community gardens, automatic and self-serve car washes, auto dealers, and some construction projects will be allowed to open on Monday, with specific rules around how they can operate.\n\"Today's news shows us if we stay the course, if we stay vigilant and take the measured approach, we can keep moving in the right direction,\" Premier Doug Ford said at a news briefing. In Alberta, meanwhile, Premier Jason Kenney detailed his government's plan for a multi-stage relaunch that will depend on the province's continued ability to control the spread of the coronavirus and curb the number of COVID-19 patients who need hospital care.\nThe first step in Alberta's plan to reopen its economy will emphasize outdoor activities, with golf courses to open Saturday, followed by shops, bars and restaurants by mid-May. Parts of the gradual relaunch plan, which Kenney announced Thursday, will begin Monday with the resumption of some non-urgent surgeries and office reopenings for dentists, physiotherapists and other professionals. Schools will remain closed until the end of the academic year, with instruction continuing online, but Kenney said the province is in discussions with school boards \"about allowing some limited reopening on a trial basis\" for summer classes and specialized programs.\nRead more about what's happening across Canada \nAir Canada anticipates return of worldwide air travel by Christmas\nAn Air Canada vice-president suggested that by the time winter holidays roll around again, Canadians will be able to board his company's planes and fly almost anywhere in the world. But Tim Strauss said he knows that one of the biggest tasks involved in bringing air travel back to life after pandemic restrictions lift will be convincing the public it's safe to fly.\nThe airline industry has been hammered by the pandemic. Some Canadian airlines have stopped flying entirely while others, including Air Canada, have scaled back more than 90 per cent because of the dramatic drop in demand. At a virtual Canadian Club Toronto event today, executives at several major airlines talked about what the North American airline industry could look like post-pandemic. Air Canada, Sunwing and American Airlines said corporate conversations about post-pandemic operations are focused on making sure planes are kept clean. Some airlines are changing how often they sanitize their planes and are even considering changes to how air is circulated in passenger cabins.\nTransport Canada has made it mandatory for all passengers to wear masks while on board and in airports when they cannot physically distance two metres from others. While Air Canada predicts better times for the industry by Christmas, airline analyst Helane Becker points out that other countries will need to lift their pandemic restrictions and reopen their economies first in order to convince people to travel. \"We need to get all these governments on the same page to kind of open things up. Everyone wants it to be done safely because no one wants the recurrence of cases,\" Becker said\nRead more about the pandemic's impact on air travel \nIs Canada looking into using remdesivir?\nCBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions about the COVID-19 pandemic, including this one. If you have a question of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca.\nAs for the issue at hand: The U.S. is fast-tracking approval of the antiviral drug remdesivir to help treat COVID-19. Top U.S. health official Dr. Anthony Fauci said it has a \"clear cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,\" after favourable results of a clinical trial.\nRemdesivir, which impairs the coronavirus's ability to replicate, was initially used to treat Ebola, but is not officially approved for use in Canada. Yet, some hospitals are getting access to it through \"individual compassionate use.\"\nWhat does this mean? Health Canada has a program that allows particular, unapproved drugs to be used in unique cases. Health Canada said the maker of remdesivir, Gilead, is transitioning to this \"provision of emergency access\" but can no longer accept more requests because of \"an overwhelming demand.\" In an email to CBC News, Gilead said it is ramping up production but did not specify how much remdesivir would be sent to Canada.\nAlberta artist offers daily, online painting class for kids\nCochrane, Alta., artist MJ Stead wanted to do what she could during the pandemic to help keep children occupied and inspired.\nShe created a Facebook group called Paint with MJ and every weekday, Stead does a free, hour-long, Facebook Live painting class for kids.

Stead said art got her through the treatments; when she couldn't get off the sofa, she challenged herself to do a painting a day for 100 days.\n\"My breast cancer and my treatment brought me to a place where everybody else is right now \u2014 a place of uncertainty, of being isolated.

The government attributed that to \"growth in household income and corporate profits.\"\u00a0\nResource revenue was up too \u2014\u00a0by $164 million, mostly due to a narrower differential between light and heavy oil prices.\nExpenses were $364 million lower than in the same quarter of 2018.\u00a0\nToews said increasing cost pressures and flat revenues combined with increasing debt equals trouble. He ruled out the prospect of a provincial sales tax, which some economists say would help curb Alberta's dependence on fluctuating resource revenues. He said the UCP\u00a0has committed to not increasing taxes during its time in government.\u00a0\nThe NDP Official Opposition claims the government's staged decrease in corporate taxes from\u00a012 to eight per cent by January 2022 would add $4.5 billion to\u00a0the deficit.\nToews\u00a0said he was confident the tax cuts would stimulate the economy and add to corporate tax revenues over time. Asked if he would reverse the tax cuts\u00a0if they don't work as planned, he said he would not.\n\"One of the greatest things you can do to actually discourage investment is to create uncertainty,\" he said. \"We've committed to reduce\u00a0corporate taxes. We will follow through on that.\"\nThe Alberta government is required by law to publish updates each quarter of the fiscal year. Usually, Alberta Treasury Board and Finance produces a booklet with fiscal and economic forecasts.\nUsually, fiscal updates compare the government's financial results to the budget. Since the last budget was released in March 2018, finance officials decided to compare the results from this quarter to the same quarter of 2018.\nGovernment officials on Tuesday declined to provide forecasts on Alberta's economy nor a current debt-to-GDP ratio.\n"}, {"author": "Laura Kane", "title": "Some provinces skeptical after money laundering wake-up call", "description": "New report finds criminals wash billions in dirty money through Canadian economy", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/money-laundering-canada-1.5142537", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5142551.1558363496!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/money-laundering-bc-20190509.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 20, 2019 10:00 AM MT", "2019-05-20T16:00:27.896Z"], "source": null, "content": "The authors of a report that found $47 billion was laundered across Canada last year debated whether to include a graph that indicated Alberta, Ontario and the Prairies were hotspots for dirty money, says the lead writer.\nMaureen Maloney said her expert panel used the best mathematical model available to reach the estimates, but it's more reliable at a national level than a provincial one, so they questioned whether to publish the figures.\n\"But we thought, 'No, we need to do this, because people need to know it's not just a B.C. problem,' \" said Maloney, the province's former deputy attorney general and a public policy professor at Simon Fraser University.\n\"It's a big B.C. problem, but it's everybody's problem. And to the extent that B.C. starts fixing our problem or at least makes our province less enticing to money launderers, they're going to go elsewhere. They're not going to disappear.\"\nThe report, one of two recently released by the B.C. government, aimed to sound a nationwide alarm about money laundering. But some provinces have reacted with skepticism, as Alberta questioned the numbers and Ontario said it will monitor the issue.\nMaloney said there is no reliable data on money laundering in Canada, so the panel used what's known as the gravity model, which estimates the flow of dirty money between countries based on characteristics including GDP per capita and crime rates. The panel divided Canada into six regions and treated each region as a country.\nThe panel estimated that Alberta led the country for money laundering in 2015 with $10.2 billion, followed by Ontario with $8.2 billion and the Prairies \u2014 Saskatchewan and Manitoba combined \u2014 with $6.5 billion.\nTo the surprise of many, B.C. came in fourth with $6.2 billion, scuttling its reputation as the money laundering capital of Canada.\nThe authors noted that the relatively high estimates in Alberta and the Prairies might arise from the importance the model places on crime rates and GDP levels, which were high prior to the oil downturn.\n\"If money laundering in Alberta and the Prairies have been overestimated ... that implies that money laundering in B.C., Ontario and Quebec have likely been underestimated,\" the report said.\nStill, the panel concluded that money laundering is corroding \"the very fabric of society\" across Canada, and laid out a vision for it to become a national priority. Multiple recommendations call for the B.C. government to persuade its provincial and federal partners to take action.\nOther provinces have yet to confront the issue with the zeal of B.C., which announced this week it will hold a public inquiry.\nAlberta Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer said the province takes criminal activity seriously, but the figure presented in the report is the product of modelling that may not be completely reliable.\n\"We use intelligence from front-line law enforcement agencies, not data we can't verify. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect law-abiding Albertans,\" he said in a statement.\nMoney laundering is nearly impossible to quantify because, by nature, it's hidden, but the report's estimate for Alberta seems high, said Greg Draper, a national lead of valuations, forensics and litigation support with law firm MNP LLP and a former RCMP investigator based in Calgary.\n\"I would expect that Vancouver has a bigger issue than Alberta, which is not to say that Alberta does not face its own money laundering risks,\" he said, adding illicit money is being washed through the province's casinos, housing and cash businesses.\nOntario's real estate association was so alarmed by Maloney's report that it contacted its provincial government to call for a beneficial ownership registry. B.C. has already announced plans for such a registry, which collects the names of people buying property using corporations, trusts and numbered companies.\n\"Today, drug lords, gun runners and other criminals can hide behind the veil of Canada's privacy laws,\" said Tim Hudak, chief executive officer of the Ontario Real Estate Association and a former provincial Progressive Conservative leader.\nOntario Finance Minister Vic Fedeli wasn't available for an interview and in a statement his department didn't indicate it was planning to take any urgent action.\n\"What I can tell you is that we are discussing this issue with our federal and provincial partners \u2014 most recently at the last meeting of Canada's finance ministers. This is something we will continue to monitor,\" said spokesman Peter Spadoni.\nBoth Saskatchewan and Manitoba said they are taking measures to combat money laundering and pointed to their civil-forfeiture programs, which enable provinces to seize assets believed to be the proceeds of crime without laying criminal charges.\nSaskatchewan added that it will pursue legislative amendments to ensure that corporations hold accurate and up to date information on beneficial owners. But it noted it was difficult to draw conclusions about the province from the Maloney report.\n\"The report itself states there are limitations on the methodology, so it isn't clear what proportion of the Prairie figure in the report applies to Saskatchewan,\" it said.\nJason Childs, an economics professor at the University of Regina, said he would expect money laundering to be worse in B.C. due to its sky-high real estate market, but Saskatchewan's gaming industry is extremely vulnerable.\n\"We have a lot of comparatively small casinos that are going to be operating with different levels of oversight,\" he said. \"And then you've got, also, a lot of cash business going on in Saskatchewan still.\"\nAs for the federal government, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described the reports as \"alarming\" and said his government has strengthened audits on real-estate transactions and is working with provinces to do more.\nMaloney said better data is needed, but if anything, the panel's estimates might actually be lower than the reality.\n\"Our numbers are not definitive. Nobody's numbers can be definitive. But we think at the moment, given the data that is available to us, this is probably the best guesstimate there is,\" she said.\n\"But I would say if we were erring on any side, it would be on a cautious, conservative side.\"\n"}, {"author": "Dr. Brian Goldman", "title": "The health cost of being poor", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/whitecoat/the-health-cost-of-being-poor-1.5449683", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5242435.1580753871!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/homeless-newcomers-20190809.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 03, 2020 11:30 AM ET", "2020-02-03T17:43:31.328Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canadians pride themselves on having a health-care system for everyone.

The mutual defence clause has only ever\u00a0been invoked once\u00a0\u2014 by\u00a0Canada on behalf of the U.S.\u00a0in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\nThe 158 Canadian soldiers and seven Canadian civilians who lost their lives in Afghanistan died upholding Article Five. The NATO alliance only works when members trust that others will answer when the call comes.\nMilitary analyst Dave Perry of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute said NATO allies still trust the U.S. military, American institutions\u00a0and the individual Americans they work with in the alliance.\n\"The concern is really about a president who keeps demonstrating, over and over again, that he has a very different view of how America should be relating to its allies,\" he said.\n\"The American president has left the impression at times that he's got better relations with the Russian president than he does with some of the heads of NATO allies in Europe or even Canada.\"\nIvo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, was the U.S. permanent representative on the NATO Council for four years under President Barack Obama.\nHe said President Trump has undermined the alliance by sowing doubts about America's intentions.\n\"He has said many times that NATO is obsolete. He refused for the first six months of his presidency to reaffirm Article Five, and has called into question whether the United States should continue to be a member of NATO if the allies are not willing to spend more on defence,\" he said.\n\"It's those kinds of questions that lead allies to say, 'If the chips are down, will the U.S. be there?' And there's less confidence about that today than there used to be.\"\nDaalder said Trump has undermined that trust through both his words and his actions.\n\"President Trump has taken a number of steps, including abandoning his Kurdish allies in Syria, that would call into question his commitment to alliance relationships,\" he said.\nPerry agrees that the betrayal of the Kurds sent a shiver through the Western alliance.\n\"It's not just that the United States bailed out on the Kurds, because I think we've seen a version of that movie before. It's the no-notice way of doing it, and the fact that the president would make these kinds of decisions not only capriciously, but also appearing to have totally ignored any advice that he did bother to solicit,\" he said.\n\"The president's whims are increasingly being translated into tangible outcomes. People have been speculating for several years that the president will send some tweets, but then the 'grown-ups' will prevail. I think the Syria example shows that the 'grown-ups-prevailing' narrative may be coming to an end.\"\nWhile some European leaders expressed their doubts in private, France's President Emmanuel Macron made his public in a recent interview with The Economist. In it,\u00a0Macron said NATO was suffering \"brain death\" and openly questioned Article Five.\nDaalder said the French leader's concerns about the United States' reliability as an ally may be affected by his own ambitions to lead Europe.\n\"My reading of President\u00a0Macron's latest statements are back in this Gaullist perspective that France needs to lead Europe,\" he said.\u00a0\"I'm gratified that the reaction to that from allies within Europe has been to say, 'Don't call into question the fundamental nature of the alliance with the United States,\u00a0and indeed with Canada,' while at the same time trying to say how can we do more ourselves within a European context.\"\nOn Thursday, Macron defended his harsh language and expanded on it.\n\"The questions I have asked are open questions\u00a0that we haven't solved yet \u2014 peace in Europe, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the relationship with Russia, the issue of Turkey,\" he said. \"Who is the enemy?\u00a0\n\"So I say, as long as these questions are not resolved, let's not negotiate about cost-sharing and burden-sharing, or this or that. Maybe we needed a wake-up call, as they say in English. I'm glad it was delivered, and I'm glad everyone now thinks we should rather think about our strategic aims.\"\nBut the U.S. does want to talk about cost-sharing; in fact, the Trump administration announced unilaterally this week that it intends to cut its contribution to NATO's total budget from 22 per cent to 16 per cent. Other members, including Canada, will have to pick up the slack.\nIt's a feature of NATO that the closer its members are to Russia, the more likely they are to meet the desired threshold of spending at least 2 per cent\u00a0of GDP on defence.\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, while visiting President Trump in the Oval Office on Monday, made a point of noting that his country spends 3.1 per cent\u00a0of its GDP on defence.\n\"You should tell that to Germany,\" Trump huffed.\nTrump has singled Germany out for failing to spend enough on the alliance, although his\u00a0administration also is pressuring Canada.\nIn the run-up to the NATO summit, the U.S. and Germany have been feuding over another topic familiar to Canadians: Huawei.\nLike their Canadian counterparts, Germany's leaders are wrestling with whether to permit the Chinese company to bid on contracts to build its 5G networks. Berlin has been subjected to a pressure campaign by Washington to ban Huawei as a potential security risk.\nOn Sunday, German minister Peter Altmaier recalled during a TV debate that it was the Americans\u00a0\u2014 not the Chinese\u00a0\u2014 who were caught spying on Germans through the PRISM program exposed by Edward Snowden in 2013.\nPointing out that Germany had not boycotted the U.S. companies that facilitated that spying, Altmaier reminded Germans that \"the U.S. also demands from its companies that they pass on information.\"\nBack in 2013, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel personally reproached President Obama about the bugging of her phone, he apologized and promised to make changes to the program.\nU.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell said Altmaier's remarks were \"an insult to the thousands of American troops who help ensure Germany's security and the millions of Americans committed to a strong Western alliance.\"\nMeanwhile, Turkey continues to behave more like an adversary than a member of the NATO alliance, doubling down on its arms purchases from NATO's main strategic rival Russia \u2014 and threatening other members with sending jihadists captured in Syria back to their European countries of origin if their governments don't stop complaining about Turkey's actions in Syria.\nTurkey has depended on President Trump to shield it from U.S. retaliation over its attack on Kurdish enclaves in Northern Syria, which infuriated both Republicans and Democrats. At the same time, it has counted on Trump to block enforcement of a U.S. law that requires Washington to impose sanctions on Turkey for installing Russian-made S-400 air defence systems.\nOn Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu castigated Macron for hosting a delegate from the Kurdish YPG last month.\n\"He is already the sponsor of the terrorist organization and constantly hosts them at the Elys\u00e9e. If he says his ally is the terrorist organization ... there is really nothing more to say,\"\u00a0said Cavusoglu.\n\"Right now, there is a void in Europe. [Macron is] trying to be its leader.\"\nMacron shot right back, arguing Turkey's attack on the Kurds was at cross-purposes with NATO's mission to defeat the Islamic State.\n\"One cannot say on one hand that we're allies, and consequently demand our solidarity, and on the other hand\u00a0put one's allies in the face of a military offensive delivered as a fait accompli\u00a0that endangers the action of the coalition against the Islamic State,\" he said.\nAnd on Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan upped the stakes again, accusing\u00a0\"some countries\u00a0that are accustomed to not taking risks and always winning\" of being unable to \"tolerate Turkey's efforts to protect its own rights, laws, borders and sovereignty. Most particularly, the latest comments of French president are the examples of this sick and shallow understanding.\n\"[Macron]\u00a0says NATO is experiencing a brain death. I'm addressing Mr. Macron from Turkey and I will say it at NATO: You should check whether you are brain dead first.\"\nAs if the rancour wasn't enough, Perry said that President Trump is sowing new doubts by pardoning convicted war criminals.\n\"For all its warts, the U.S. has long been an upholder of the laws of armed conflict. For him to be intervening in that process of maintaining order and discipline is extraordinarily troubling,\" he said, citing Trump's recent decision to intervene in a disciplinary case against\u00a0a Navy SEAL accused of war crimes in Iraq.\n\"From allies' perspective, it's another piece falling on top of the Syria withdrawal. It's increasingly uncertain what the United States stands for. You're not as sure now what it means to contribute to an American military operation as you would have been even a year ago.\"\n"}, {"author": "Ian Froese", "title": "Manitoba government delivers cautious budget as COVID-19 rattles economy", "description": "Revised budget estimates negative economic growth in 1st half of 2020, rebound by end of year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-budget-2020-21-1.5492319", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5501808.1584564679!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winnipeg-richardson-international-airport-empty.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 19, 2020 3:23 PM CT", "2020-03-19T20:23:46.613Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "While the province's economy is reeling from COVID-19, the Manitoba government unveiled a cautious budget Thursday that it still believes can fend off an economic downturn while delivering on tax cuts.\nThe budget, delayed more than a week by procedural delays from the Opposition NDP, was originally set to be delivered on March 11 \u2014 the day before\u00a0the first presumptive case of COVID-19 was announced in Manitoba.\nPremier Brian Pallister\u00a0pre-empted major budget surprises by announcing an upcoming one percentage point cut to the provincial sales tax and changes to the payroll tax, along with unveiling the province's own carbon tax, earlier this month.\nThe Progressive Conservative government\u00a0has decided to keep those measures, but in recent days has tempered budget plans that were revealed under embargo last week\n\"Because COVID-19 is a rapidly changing situation, we cannot provide specific details in respect to our 'bottom line,'\" the\u00a0province said in the supplemental budget documents.\nThat revised budget maintains a $300-million injection into the\u00a0rainy-day fund, intended to be used for unforeseen expenses, but speeds up the process.\nThe province will top up the fund \u2014 currently sitting at $571 million\u00a0\u2014 to $800 million over the next month.

But a recovery is forecast by the end of the fiscal year.\n\"Growth in 2021 may be higher than currently forecast as a result of the return of pent-up demand across impacted sectors,\" the province said in its Thursday news release.\nOtherwise, the Pallister government appears confident the province's diversified economy can withstand the pandemic.\nThe rest of the spending plan landed Thursday with few surprises.\nIn addition to the $300 million for the rainy-day fund, an additional $100 million is set aside for the emergency expenditures fund.\u00a0\nManitoba Premier Brian Pallister said the government is showing it can be adaptable.\n\"We have to be more resilient than we've ever been in the past,\" Pallister said Thursday.\nThe budget was originally intended to be released on March 11, but those plans were thwarted when the New Democrats delayed several days of legislative business to prevent Fielding from delivering his budget speech.\nThe Opposition said the delay wasn't intended to prevent the budget, but to halt several other pieces of legislation the government could have introduced as early as last Wednesday.\nThe original budget document said the government intended to whittle down its deficit by an extra $140 million this year, with a projected $220-million deficit for the 2020-21 fiscal year.\u00a0\nBut that deficit could now be far higher\u00a0\u2014 as high as $900 million, according to the province's worst-case scenario.\nAny bottom line estimates are\u00a0in limbo because of the pandemic, the government said in the updated COVID-19 supplement it released with the budget on Thursday, and the province says the impact on economic growth could approach $700 million.\n\"The range of revenue impacts from the lowest to highest scenarios are from approximately $160 million to more than $680 million,\" the province's budget says.\nFielding acknowledged last week the province could have balanced the budget this year, but chose to focus on preparedness instead.\u00a0\n\"Potentially we could have [balanced], but we need to be emergency ready,\" he told reporters last week.\nWhile the budget projects an economic rebound in the last half of 2020, Fielding said last week up to $500 million worth of plans could be delayed by a significant downturn. He didn't specify what those projects are.\nWhile the government sets money aside, the Pallister government's fifth budget plans to return more cash to Manitobans.\u00a0\nThe province will cut vehicle registration fees by 10 per cent and eliminate the probate fees \u2014 fees paid on the estate of a deceased person \u2014 by July 1.\nThe removal of the PST from home insurance and salon services over $50, which was promised in last fall's election, will happen next year, Fielding said.\nJuly 1 is also the implementation date for the new provincial carbon tax, which was previously announced. When questioned at last week's news conference, Fielding could not point to any new climate change-mitigation initiatives in the budget aside from the upcoming $25 per tonne carbon tax.\nThat carbon tax \"absolutely has the potential\" to discourage people from using fossil fuels, he said.\nThe budget allocates $101 million for the Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin flood outlets project, which still needs approval from the federal government.\u00a0\nThe spending plan dedicates an extra $22 million for Winnipeg's North End water treatment facility. The deposit will increase the province's commitment for the roughly $400-million first phase of the project to $56 million.\nFor the third consecutive year, funding grants for municipalities will remain flat at $313 million.\nThe budget also signals a shift in the province's role in public housing. The role of the Manitoba Housing and Renewal Corporation will transition from housing provider to becoming a funder and regulator, the budget explains.\n\"It seems to be working better,\" Pallister said Thursday, saying there's\u00a0better maintenance and more available housing stock\u00a0in the units that have already transitioned to the private sector.\nThe province is also committing $5 million to implement the education reforms arising out of its kindergarten to Grade 12 review, but the government is now postponing any significant reforms until summer 2021 because of COVID-19.\nThe budget includes financial support for 4,400 new classroom spaces that will either be open or under construction by the end of the fiscal year, as well as 1,000 more early learning and child care spaces.\nThe budget also contains a tax increase for smokers \u2014 the tobacco tax will rise from 30 cents per cigarette to 30.5 cents.\nThe government estimates $15 million in net revenue from the sale of legalized cannabis over the coming year \u2014 the first time revenues from cannabis have been projected in a budget.\n\"Cannabis revenues are not the fiscal windfall that some had forecast,\" the province's budget documents say.\nNDP Leader Wab Kinew\u00a0said the\u00a0government needs to step up during a pandemic. He suggested the province could top up the income for people on employment insurance and help with child-care fees.\nKinew questioned the need for a PST cut at this time.\n\"It doesn't seem like it makes a lot of sense now,\" Kinew said, arguing the tax savings would be minimal\u00a0since most expenses are PST-exempt groceries.\nPallister\u00a0argued earlier\u00a0that giving Manitobans more money back helps people get by financially during the pandemic.\nLiberal Leader Dougald Lamont said it's disappointing that other provinces and\u00a0governments created measures to help laid off workers, but Manitoba's government cannot.\n\"We need a plan to be able to support workers so they can pay their bills and prevent businesses from going broke.\"\nThe budget made a number of other projections before the mass business closures due to the coronavirus.\nTotal provincial spending is projected to rise $477 million this fiscal year to $17.96 billion.\nTransfers from Ottawa are slated to increase\u00a0$321 million to $5.14 billion. Manitoba now relies on Ottawa for 29 per cent of its revenue.\u00a0\nManitoba's total debt is expected to rise to $26.4 billion, up $336 million from 2019-20.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Susan Noakes", "title": "In the unequal world of work, Canada's a bit more egalitarian", "description": "In the U.K., U.S. and Germany, the share of pay going to highest income workers has risen", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/in-the-unequal-world-of-work-canada-s-a-bit-more-egalitarian-1.5201757", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5201794.1562351423!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bangladesh-garment-workers.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 05, 2019 3:06 PM ET", "2019-07-05T20:13:40.977Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Nearly half of all global pay goes to 10 per cent of the world's workers, while the lowest-paid 20 per cent get less than one per cent of wages, according to a study by the International Labour Organization.\nThe U.S. and U.K.\u00a0are seeing wages become increasingly unequal, with the middle class losing ground, but Canada bucks that trend, according to the ILO.\nThe UN agency found the top 10 per cent of Canadian wage earners make about 24 per cent of total wages, a number almost unchanged from 2004 to 2017, the period measured.\u00a0\nThat's lower\u00a0than most of the world, including Britain with 32 per cent going to top earners and the U.S. with 33 per cent.

Their predictions proved correct,\" said the report.\nThe report lists several components it says should be part of a national strategy, including a clearer infrastructure approval process, a role for government in mitigating geopolitical uncertainty, and a carbon tax strategy.\n\"Industry supports a strategy to reduce greenhouse gases that doesn't disadvantage Canadian exports. Carbon policies must be built around certainty and stability,\" the report said.\nThe report says the huge growth of U.S. supply fundamentally changed the energy landscape.\n\"The United States is now Canada's biggest competitor,\" says the report, which argues that it's therefore\u00a0increasingly urgent for Canada to get its oil and gas to Asia.\n\"Over the next two decades, the IEA\u00a0(International Energy Agency) forecasts Asia will account for half of global growth in natural gas demand and more than 80 per cent of the increase in oil demand. Environmental policies in many of these new markets are also propelling demand for lower-carbon energy sources like LNG.\"\nThe report argues that the pipeline approval process needs hard time limits and should focus on the economic and environmental impacts of the project, and that broader\u00a0issues like climate change need to be addressed through public policy, not the project approval process.\n"}, {"author": "Benjamin Shingler", "title": "Quebec government tries to go green in new budget, pushing public transit and electric cars", "description": "But environmentalists question level of commitment, with bulk of money not allotted until 2nd mandate", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-caq-legault-budget-2020-1.5491033", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5492937.1583872852!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/quebec-budget-20200310.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 4:12 PM ET", "2020-03-11T18:47:50.723Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Flush with cash, the Quebec government will pour more money into health care and education this year, while trying to convince Quebecers it is serious about reducing greenhouse gases.\nThe $118-billion budget for 2020-21 represents a 5.1 per cent increase over the previous year.\nIn the annual spending plan, tabled Tuesday in the National Assembly, Finance Minister Eric Girard reported a $1.9 billion surplus last year, thanks in part to a booming economy.\nThe Coalition Avenir Quebec government, often criticized for its lack of concern for environmental issues, said it would devote $6.7 billion over six years to deal with climate change.\nOnly $322 million of that, however, will be spent this year, prompting skepticism from environmentalists.\nThe CAQ said it's committed to meeting the emissions target set by the previous government: a 37.5-per cent reduction from 1990 levels by 2030.\nGirard also acknowledged the province's cap-and-trade system won't be enough to curb emissions, saying that more needs to be done to \"electrify the economy.\"\nTo that end, Girard set aside $15.8 billion for public transportation projects in Quebec's 10-year infrastructure plan.\n\"Obviously, Quebec cannot reverse climate change on its own. However, we must do our part, and the government will oversee this collective effort,\" Girard said in an advance copy of his budget speech.\nThe government also renewed a popular tax rebate for the purchase of electric cars, dubbed Roulez Vert, and a program (Chauffez Vert) to encourage homeowners to switch to a renewable energy heating system.\nBut Quebec will still need to substantially cut emissions in the transportation sector in order to meet its 2030 target.\nCurrently, about 44 per cent of Quebec's greenhouse gas emissions come from the transport sector, especially fossil fuel-burning cars and trucks.\nPatrick Bonin, a climate campaigner with Greenpeace Canada, said the budget doesn't contain enough measures to curb emissions, and devotes too much money to building roads, as opposed to expanding public transit.\n\"Overall, when you look at what is on the table, it's far from what is needed to counter the climate emergency,\" he said. \"We're quite skeptical that Quebec is on the way to meeting the targets of the Paris accord.\"\nMontreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante, who has made fighting climate change key to her own mandate, said she was \"pleased to witness an important shift\" toward public transit. But she also said she was disappointed that the government did not commit to build any new social housing in the city as its vacancy rate hits a 15-year low.\n\"We cannot ignore the immediate housing needs of thousands of Montrealers,\" Plante said.\nWATCH: Finance minister breaks\u00a0down the budget by the numbers\nThe budget was tabled in the midst of global economic uncertainty, sparked by fears of the coronavirus and volatile oil prices.\nQuebec projected GDP growth to drop to two per cent in the coming year, down from 2.8 per cent in 2019. It expects growth to drop further, to 1.5 per cent in 2021.\nBut Girard's budget was prepared before stock prices dropped dramatically on Monday.\nA line in the document acknowledges the COVID-19 epidemic could hinder economic growth, but otherwise maintains Quebec's finances make it \"resilient to economic disruptions.\"\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Girard said the province is prepared for any impact on the economy or the health-care system.\n\"We will see what the evolution of the virus is,\" he said.\nCarlos Leit\u00e3o, the finance critic for the Liberals, said the budget \"lacked prudence.\"\nHe said the two per cent growth forecast was aggressive given global uncertainty, and that the budget didn't contain sufficient \"provisions for risks.\"\nHe suggested a \"mini-budget\" could even be necessary in the coming months to address the lack of foresight seen in Tuesday's plan.\nHere are some other key takeaways.\nMore cash is being put into the province's crumbling infrastructure. The amount in the province's 10-year infrastructure plan will increase by $15.1 billion, to a total of $130.5 billion.\nIn all, the plan devoted $15.8 billion for public transportation projects in six cities across the province, including Montreal's light-rail network, an extension of the Metro's Blue line and the possible extension of the Yellow line. There was no mention of adding a new Pink line to the network, an idea long championed by Plante.\nThe road network, meanwhile, was allotted $26.8 billion. Environmental groups had pressed the Legault government to devote equal money to roads and public transit.\u00a0\nImprovements to education infrastructure, such as schools, was allocated $25.5 billion, while health and social services got $20.5 billion.\nDespite the focus on the environment, the biggest spending areas in the provincial budget remain health care and education.\nEducation spending is going up by 4.5 per cent, while health-care expenditures are increasing by 5.3 per cent.\nIn education, the CAQ says it will add 350 more pre-kindergarten\u00a0classes for four-year-olds, bringing the total to more than 1,000. The government will also put $126 million toward helping students with special needs, and promised 6,000 more subsidized daycare spaces within two years. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nMuch of the new health-care money is going toward improving primary care services. But it also includes a commitment to add 900 beds to long-term care facilities, and $450 million over five years to hire more staff in the province's beleaguered youth protection system.\nThe CAQ moved closer to standardizing the school tax rate across the province, which was a key election promise. That means homeowners in certain regions will save hundreds in the coming year. Someone who owns a $275,000 condo in Montreal, for instance, will eventually save $182 compared to the 2018 rate, while someone who owns the same priced home in Mauricie will save $509.\nThe CAQ also created a new tax credit to encourage businesses to invest in innovation \u2014\u00a0at a cost of $526 million over five years.\nThe CAQ set aside $200 million over five years for Indigenous peoples. This money is aimed at following through on the recommendations of the Viens commission and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\nThe promise came with few specifics, but Girard said that was by design. He said Indigenous groups should determine their funding priorities.\n"}, {"author": "John Paul Tasker", "title": "Federal government to announce supports for people, businesses hit by COVID-19 on Wednesday", "description": "PM says Ottawa expecting 'significant economic impacts' from COVID-19", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-support-workers-covid-19-1.5492545", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5492779.1584101933!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/commons-20200310.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 2:00 PM ET", "2020-03-10T23:44:21.941Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will announce on Wednesday supports for people and businesses affected by COVID-19 \u2014 the first part of a federal package designed to help workers who are forced to stay home from their jobs as the virus spreads and disrupts the economy.\nTrudeau will announce supports for those facing \"immediate pressures,\" with more aid for other sectors\u00a0to be announced in the coming days.\nSources have told CBC News that the measures\u00a0Trudeau will announce include\u00a0waiving the one-week waiting period for Employment Insurance benefits for people who have to self-isolate because of the outbreak.\u00a0\nThe package also will include a boost to research funding to combat the virus, over and above the $27 million announced in Montreal last week.\nOttawa is also leading a pan-Canadian effort to bulk-buy certain medical devices, and the federal government says it will be ready to support provinces needing further assistance to shore up their health care systems as the number of confirmed cases rises.\nTrudeau met with top ministers this afternoon, including Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Health Minister Patty\u00a0Hajdu, as part of the government's response to a virus that has sickened dozens across Canada and killed one person in B.C.\n\"We recognize that there are going to be significant economic impacts for Canadians, for workers, for businesses, and that's why we're going to be talking very soon about measures that Canada is going to put forward to support people on the economic side,\" Trudeau told reporters on his way into question period.\nTreasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos said Ottawa is considering stimulus spending in the upcoming federal budget.\nBeyond Wednesday's planned announcement, Duclos said the federal government will spend more to help people \"go through the crisis\" and help \"workers, families and businesses thrive and sustain themselves.\"\n\"We have the fiscal room and the fiscal power to intervene and provide the stimulus that the economy will demand,\" Duclos said in an interview with CBC's Power & Politics. \"We have the will and the ability to make a difference.

Hajdu said the flight cancellations were a \"business decision\" based on a notable decrease in the number of Canadians travelling to that country because of Global Affairs Canada advisories.\nThe travel industry has seen a wave of cancellations as companies\u00a0suspend non-essential business travel and conventions as a precaution.\nIn a notice sent to guests Tuesday,\u00a0WestJet\u00a0said it has introduced additional measures to \"increase the sanitization\" of its aircraft.

So we have to keep that in context. But the improvement in takeaway capacity will encourage some improvement in investment. And we think that should drive GDP to\u00a0\u2026 the top of the charts in Alberta in 2020,\" Stewart said.\nThe coming online of Enbridge's Line 3 will create an additional capacity of 370,000 barrels per day in 2021, and the Trans Mountain expansion project is expected to add another 590,000 barrels per day by 2023.\n\"On top of expected improvements in takeaway capacity on existing pipelines, the Alberta government will grant exceptions to the curtailment for producers developing new conventional wells and those bringing new production online for rail export,\" the report says.\nThe report notes that Cenovus plans to bring production fully online at its dormant Christina Lake Phase G oilsands facility, adding about 50,000 barrels per day of new production.\n\"The outlook for production out of Alberta has brightened significantly, even as we head into the new year with curtailments still in place,\" says the report.\nFirst Nations accuse Canada of altering internal reviews of marine spill risk reports on Trans Mountain\n\"Canada's energy sector will put its recent poor performance in the rear-view mirror over the medium term as the LNG Canada project and new oilsands investment lead to an average annual gain of 4.4\u00a0per cent in real oil and gas investment.\"\nThe report goes on to predict that the brighter future for the energy sector will help the national economy as non-energy exports continue to struggle amid a slowing U.S. economy, international trade uncertainty and Canada's higher corporate tax rates.\nStatistics Canada reported on Tuesday that Alberta's 2019 third-quarter provincial unemployment rate was little changed at 7.2 per cent.\nStewart cautioned that Alberta's labour market will remain weak in 2020, given that investment is recovering from such a low level over the several past years.\nMartin Pelletier, a portfolio manager in Calgary with Trivest Wealth Counsel, agrees that there are signs that Alberta's energy sector is turning a corner.\n\"We're starting to see \u2026 some light at the end of the tunnel,\" he said. \"I think we'll start to see oil investment as early as this winter, based on what I'm hearing from private equity funds in the U.S. looking for development.\"\nThe report forecasts that the energy sector is likely to account for most of the growth in Canada's export sector in 2020, with exports expanding 2.2 per cent next year and another two per cent in 2021.\nThe boosts in oil production and exports will happen against the backdrop of prices remaining stagnated, the report predicts.\nWhile OPEC production cuts and sanctions against Iran and Venezuela will put upward pressure on prices, continued rising U.S. production will likely result in the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rising only modestly, from $57.00 US this year to $58.70 US next year.\nThe discount for Western Canadian Select (versus the WTI price) will remain in the range of $15\u2013$20 US per barrel in the short term, the report forecasts.\n\"We no longer think the Bank of Canada will need to stimulate the economy by cutting rates early next year,\" the report says.\n"}, {"author":

\u2014\u00a0the EXPO Centre at the Edmonton Exhibition Lands\u00a0site and the Edmonton Convention Centre downtown \u2014 and attracting tourism.\u00a0\nRight now, the EEDC manages these two areas and\u00a0four groups under its Innovate Edmonton branch: StartUp Edmonton, Edmonton Made, InnovateYEG and the Advanced Technology Centre.\u00a0\nCouncillor Sarah Hamilton said for as long as she can

connect with resources,\" she said.\u00a0\nHamilton expects the recommendations will help\u00a0council to make noticeable changes.\u00a0\n\"City council hasn't been super clear on what our direction should be in this space,\" she said. \"What we'll hear time and again is that we actually need to be really firm and decisive, and it's time to be firm and decisive on the issue of the EEDC.\"\nShe

city's urban form branch.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe recommendations are up for public discussion at a meeting Wednesday.\u00a0\nCouncil can vote to\u00a0develop an innovation authority but the shareholder group \u2014 namely representatives from the City of Edmonton \u2014 must vote separately on whether to alter the EEDC's mandate.

How do Canada and other countries contend with it?\u00a0\nIn our CBC News series China's Power, we examine Beijing's expanding circles of influence.\u00a0\nChina has the mindset and the muscle to play by its own rules.\u00a0Should Canada resist or engage?\u00a0There are risks and rewards to both approaches.\nChina's economic development over the past 40 years counts as the fastest sustained expansion by any state in history. With GDP increases averaging nearly 10 per cent\u00a0per year, more than 800 million Chinese have been pulled out of poverty.\u00a0It is an astonishing story of economic success.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow, no longer content being the world's workshop, China is exporting homegrown technology, engineering expertise, financial capital and visionary development ideas around the world.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis projection of Chinese economic might owes much to President Xi Jinping.\u00a0Under his leadership, China launched the wildly ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, a plan to circle the globe with Chinese-built and financed infrastructure.\u00a0 Highways, deep-sea ports, tunnels, railways, business zones and much more all tied to Chinese banking, data centres, currency exchange and trade rules.\nIt's a whole new organizing principle for global development \u2014 with Beijing at the centre \u2014 and a clear challenge to U.S. leadership.\nMore than 100 countries have welcomed this investment, from across Asia and Africa to Western Europe and Latin America.\u00a0As we'll see in our series, Beijing has even partnered with several small Caribbean states, including Jamaica.\u00a0\nBut there's a price to pay.\u00a0 Some nations have found themselves mired in debt.\u00a0Some regret handing economic levers over to Chinese interests beholden to Beijing.\u00a0All are binding themselves tighter to a state that expects their political support and is notorious for crushing internal dissent.\nIn this country, Canadians are eyeing Chinese investment warily \u2014 and perhaps for good reason.\nOne year ago, relations between Canada and China deteriorated swiftly and dramatically.\u00a0It started with the Dec. 1, 2018, arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S.\u00a0warrant.\u00a0Just nine days later, Beijing jailed two Canadians\u00a0\u2014businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig\u00a0\u2014 in China, accusing them\u00a0of spying.\nChina then blocked Canadian canola shipments, suspended pork imports and impeded a number of other Canadian farm products while warning Ottawa of \"grave consequences.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe whole affair has complicated Ottawa's decision on whether to block Huawei's participation in building Canada's next-generation 5G mobile networks, largely over security concerns.\u00a0\u00a0\nHuawei, though, is already deeply integrated into Canadian business, technology, and consumer culture.\u00a0Its equipment is vital to Canadian telecom giants Telus and BCE, and its electronic devices, including mobile phones, are widely used.\nBeyond that, we'll see in our series how Huawei is making\u00a0investments in Canada's intellectual capacity by funding research centres at universities across the country.\nWe'll also examine the promotion of China's cultural interests in Canada. One way of doing that is through the state-funded Confucius Institute centres in Canadian schools. Some school boards have embraced them as valuable learning tools for students despite concerns about the active promotion of a Beijing-friendly worldview.

The election also mirrors the global trend of populist strongmen appealing to disgruntled majorities amid rising ethno-nationalism.\n\"As we usher in a new journey for Sri Lanka, we must remember that all Sri Lankans are part of this journey. Let us rejoice peacefully, with dignity and discipline,\" Rajapaksa tweeted.\nSupporters outside Rajapaksa's home on the outskirts of the capital Colombo hugged and cheered, some clutching bouquets of flowers.\nAbout 15 million people were eligible to vote, and Sri Lanka's Election Commission estimated 80 per cent turnout after polls closed.\nFlanked by Buddhist monks at campaign events, Rajapaksa focused his message on Sri Lanka's majority Sinhala Buddhist population, who comprise about 70 per cent of the island's citizens. The second-largest group are ethnic Tamil Hindus at 12.6 per cent, while 10 per cent are Muslims and 8 per cent are Christian.\nHe accepted support from Buddhist nationalist clerics who demanded the resignation of Muslim cabinet members and governors they said were interfering with the investigation of the Easter attacks.\nThe Muslim politicians temporarily stepped aside.\nThe campaign said Rajapaksa's swearing-in ceremony would take place at Anuradhapura, a city about 200 kilometres\u00a0from Colombo and the seat of the first Sinhalese kingdom known for a sacred tree that is said to be the southern branch of the Bodhi tree in India under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment.\nThough counting continued, the preliminary result reflected voting along ethnic lines, showing \"a badly polarized country\" that will embolden right-wing Buddhist clerics, said Kusal Perera, a political analyst and independent journalist.\n\"A Sinhala Buddhist theocratic state has been given a people's mandate now,\" he said.\nPremadasa swept the majority Tamil and Muslim districts in the country's north and east, winning as much as 80 per cent of the vote. In majority ethnic Sinhala areas, Gotabaya secured around 60 per cent.\nSinhala Buddhists votes usually don't vote as a bloc, unlike Sri Lankan minorities who have supported whatever party espoused policies comparatively favourable to them.\nRajapaksa's victory will also be a blow to the post-civil war reconciliation process and truth-seeking on alleged wartime abuses by both government troops and the Tamil Tiger rebels. In the lead up to the election, Rajapaksa said that he would not honour a United Nations human rights resolution to investigate alleged abuses.\n\"He has won the war, but Sri Lanka is yet to win the peace and 10 years after, this is how the north and east reacts to the war victor,\" said M.A Suanthiran, lawmaker and spokesperson for Tamil National Alliance, the country's main Tamil party.\nRajapaksa pledged to appoint as prime minister his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was briefly installed as prime minister last year, when outgoing President Maithripala Sirisena fired the sitting prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, over political differences. The Supreme Court ruled Sirisena had acted unconstitutionally, and restored Wickremsinghe to power.\nGotabaya Rajapaksa has also promised to release people detained for running an abduction ring for money in the pretext of counterterrorism, leading some to fear that the ethnic tensions that fuelled the Tamil struggle for an independent state will only grow during his administration.\nDuring the war that ended in 2009, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was accused of persecuting critics and overseeing what were called \"white van squads\" that whisked away journalists, activists and Tamil civilians suspected of links to the Tamil Tigers. Some were tortured and released, while others simply disappeared.\nThe Rajapaksa brothers are also accused of condoning rape and extrajudicial killings and deliberately targeting civilians and hospitals during the war. They deny the allegations.\nThe Rajapaksas did not lift emergency law even after the war ended, curtailing civil and media freedoms. Mahinda Rajapaksa's government accepted Chinese loans for white elephant projects in the family's home district of Hambantota, including to build a big commercial airport that has never been used.\nBattling one of Asia's highest debt-to-GDP ratios, Wickremesinghe's government signed in 2017 a 99-year lease of the Chinese-built Hambantota port to a Chinese company, fuelling public consternation over the loss of Sri Lanka's sovereignty. The outgoing government also re-established ties with neighbouring India and the United States, both of whom have large stakes in Sri Lanka as a buffer against China.\nRajapaksa will inherit a tourism-dependent economy still recovering from the blasts, the first attack in Sri Lankan history targeting foreigners.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Regina residents facing 3.25 per cent property tax hike in proposed 2020 city budget", "description": "Proposed budget to come before council in December ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-city-budget-2020-1.5360611", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5361127.1573841153!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/regina-city-hall.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Nov 15, 2019 8:45 AM CT", "2019-11-15T20:57:16.884Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Regina residents could be seeing another property tax hike if council approves the $472 million budget put forward by administration on Friday.\u00a0\n\"\u200bNobody wants to see a tax increase, and\u00a0yet I think we all want to live in a city that is competitive,\" said city manager Chris Holden.

The numbers are just staggering,\" Brett Finlay, a University of British Columbia microbiology professor who chaired the panel, said in an interview. \"It's time to do something now.\"\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada commissioned the report on the socio-economic impacts of antimicrobial resistance\u00a0and the Council of Canadian Academies assembled the independent panel. The 268-page document released Tuesday represents the most comprehensive picture to date of the country's resistance rate, as well as its costs to the health system and economy.\nAntimicrobial resistance occurs when micro-organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, evolve to resist the drugs that would otherwise kill them. Unnecessary antimicrobial use in humans and agriculture exacerbates the problem, and widespread international travel and trade help resistant bacteria spread around the world.\nThe most common antimicrobials are antibiotics, which treat infections caused by bacteria. The report focuses on resistant bacteria, but uses the broader term antimicrobial because surveillance data tend to be collected under this heading.\nAn investigation by The Canadian Press last year revealed Canada has been sluggish to act on the growing threat. At that time, the government did not know how many Canadians were dying of resistant infections and it had not produced a plan that lays out responsibilities for provinces and territories.\nA pan-Canadian action plan has still not materialized, but the new report estimates an annual death toll in Canada. The panel used the current resistance rate of 26 per cent to calculate\u00a0resistant infections contributed to over 14,000 deaths in 2018, and of those, 5,400 were directly attributable to the infections \u2014 only slightly less than those caused by Alzheimer's disease.\nThe panel's economists used a more cautious model to project the impacts than a well-known international report by British economist Jim O'Neill, which predicted up to 10 million global deaths annually by 2050.\nThe Canadian report's findings on the economic and social toll of antimicrobial resistance are stark. Currently, the problem costs the national health-care system $1.4 billion a year, and by 2050, that figure is projected to grow to $7.6 billion, the report says. The cost to GDP is expected to jump from $2 billion to up to $21 billion annually.\nResistant infections decrease quality of life while increasing isolation and stigma and the impact will be unequally distributed as some socio-economic groups are more at risk, the report adds. These groups include Indigenous, low-income and homeless people, as well as those who travel to developing countries where resistant microbes are more common.\n\"Discrimination may be targeted at those with resistant infections or deemed to be at risk of infection,\" the report warns. \"Canadian society may become less open and trusting, with people less likely to travel and more supportive of closing Canada's borders to migration and tourists.\"\nAntimicrobial resistance has the potential to impact everyone, Finlay says.\n\"It's going to change the world,\" he says. \"We all go to hospitals and we all get infections.\"\nThe report notes that resistance could increase the risk and reduce the availability of routine medical procedures including kidney dialysis, joint replacement, chemotherapy and caesarean section. These procedures all carry a threat of infections for which antibiotics are commonly prescribed.\nLimiting the impacts of antimicrobial resistance requires a \"complete re-evaluation\" of health care in Canada, the report concludes.\nThe panel states that Canada lacks an effective federal, provincial and territorial surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance and use, with little comprehensive data describing the number of resistant infections and their characteristics.\nIt also calls for improved stewardship involving careful use of antimicrobials to preserve their effectiveness, strict infection prevention and control through hand hygiene, equipment cleaning and research and innovation for new treatments.\nThe report notes it's unlikely that new broad-spectrum antimicrobials will be discovered. None have been found in decades and there's little profit incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in drugs that quickly cure patients. However, the panel calls for more flexible regulations and incentives to promote discovery of new antimicrobials that treat infections caused by specific bacteria.\nAlternative therapies are also being developed to treat or prevent resistant infections, including vaccines and treatments using phages, which are viruses that attack bacteria, the report adds.\nCanada should immediately invest $120 million in research and innovation. and up to $150 million in stewardship, education and infection control, matched by the provinces and territories, says Dr. John Conly, a panel member and University of Calgary professor specializing in chronic diseases.\nThe government and public should \"absolutely\" be as concerned about antimicrobial resistance as they are about climate change, Conly says.\n\"It's a slow-moving tsunami. Like a tidal wave, it's out at sea but it's going to land on us much sooner than climate change.\"\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Susan Ormiston", "title": "Trump extends U.S. physical distancing guidelines until April 30", "description": "Many had worried U.S. president would lift restrictions too soon", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-coronavirus-quarantines-1.5513607", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5514384.1585519136!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/virus-outbreak-trump.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 29, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-30T01:13:24.463Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This is a breaking news update.\u00a0 Below is an earlier version of this story.\u00a0\nU.S. President Donald Trump will extend national physical distancing guidelines to limit the spread of COVID-19 until April 30.\u00a0\nThe announcement at the White House on Sunday evening came as many health-care experts worried that Trump would relax restrictions too early after he said he was hoping for an economic resurrection, with the country \"raring to go by Easter.\"\nBut when asked by reporters about those statements on Sunday evening, Trump said the idea of restoring more normalcy by Easter\u00a0\"was just an aspiration.\"\u00a0\nThis is an earlier version of this story. It has been updated above:\nAs Americans hunker down for another weekend, President Donald Trump faces a critical choice. The U.S. has topped 120,000 coronavirus cases, the most in the world and by late Monday, the White House campaign of \"15 days to stop the spread\"\u00a0will end, leaving an unpredictable president with a critical decision to extend, tighten or loosen the mitigation measures.\n\"Our country has to go back [to work],\" he said Thursday. \"Our country is based on that. And I think it's going to happen pretty quickly. A lot of progress has been made, but we've got to go back to work.\"\nHis options are complicated. State governments have locked down 169 million Americans in varying stay-at-home orders. Every day, Vice-President Mike Pence, who heads the White House\u00a0coronavirus task force, has brandished the one-page guidelines for the 15 days,\u00a0urging compliance with hand washing\u00a0and physical\u00a0distancing.\nA new mail out to millions of Americans titled \"President Trump's Coronavirus Guidelines for America,\"\u00a0arrived in mailboxes just before the weekend.\nYet Trump has, for a week now, been peddling the idea of allowing more freedoms, hoping for an economic resurrection, with the country \"raring to go by Easter.\"\nThat statement set off red alarms among health care experts, who strongly urge strict adherence to the restrictions\u00a0for a longer period.\nThis weekend the White House's coronavirus task force will present the president with \"a range of recommendations and guidance for going forward,\" said Dr. Deborah Birx, one of the team leaders.\nOne strategy is to identify if areas in the U.S. that\u00a0have fewer cases\u00a0could open up\u00a0first\u00a0\u2014 the theory being that America could be divided into low-, medium- and high-risk areas.\n\"We may take large sections of our country that aren't so seriously affected, and we may do it that way, but we've got to start the process pretty soon,\" Trump repeated at a briefing Thursday.\nStates with fewer confirmed cases, such as North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana\u00a0and New Mexico and pockets in the northeast, could be targeted as lower risk\u00a0while\u00a0places such as New York, with nearly half the reported cases, and other hot spots\u00a0in urban areas\u00a0would be higher risk.\nOn Saturday, Trump said he was considering putting sections of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut under quarantine. It was not clear how he would be able to block road, air and sea travel out of a region that serves as the economic engine of the eastern United States, accounting for 12 per cent of GDP.\u00a0\nBy Saturday night, he'd retreated from that plan, saying the CDC would instead urge a strong travel advisory to hard-hit\u00a0areas, and that \"a quarantine will not be necessary.\"\nOn the recommendation of the White House CoronaVirus Task Force, and upon consultation with the Governor\u2019s of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, I have asked the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CDCgov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CDCgov</a> to issue a strong Travel Advisory, to be administered by the Governors, in consultation with the....\n\"I think we can start by opening up certain parts of the country, you know, the farm belt, certain parts of the Midwest, other places,\" Trump said.\nBut the job of defending that decision, were it to happen, falls to his coronavirus response team working round the clock to get more data.\n\"What we're trying to do is to utilize a laser-focused approach rather than a generic horizontal approach. And I think in the 21st century, we should be able to get to that,\" said\u00a0Birx, who co-ordinates\u00a0the White House's coronavirus response team.\n\"The president's made it clear that, in his words, he wants to open up the country. But we're going to do that responsibly.\"\nAfter declaring himself a \"wartime president,\"\u00a0the president appeared impatient this week\u00a0with the economic casualties, including 3.2 million unemployed, cratering growth\u00a0and a kick to a stock market that was soaring just a month ago.\nFriday, he seemed to lean toward public health advice, telling a briefing, \"life and safety and then the economy.\"\nBut health professionals\u00a0and state officials\u00a0are deeply worried\u00a0he will muddle the public health messaging.\n\"I am quite concerned that we're considering these measures, especially when the science doesn't support it,\" says Nadia Abuelezam, an infectious disease epidemiologist\u00a0and assistant professor at Boston College's Connell School of Nursing.\n\"Even if we do see a reduction in the number of cases, that doesn't mean that it can't re-surge there\u00a0or it can't be reintroduced to that particular area.\"\nIt's not at all clear how some states with fewer cases could open up\u00a0while neighbouring states with a higher incidence remain locked down. Confusion\u00a0over what's allowed where\u00a0could prompt people to pay\u00a0less heed to the restrictions, health experts fear.\n\"Viruses do not respect borders. Viruses do not discriminate. Viruses just want to find another body where they can replicate. And I think that's something to really keep in mind,\" said\u00a0Abuelezam.\nInfectious disease experts want more time\u00a0to measure if the mitigation efforts across the country are working. They also want to better understand how many Americans have or had the virus, with few or no symptoms.\nThat data would help more accurately define how much coronavirus is circulating in the community, but capturing that picture is still extremely complicated and will take time.\n\"I understand the concept \u2014 we're hearing of 'pockets' [of no coronavirus]. But the problem with those pockets is we don't know if those are places where the disease just hasn't spread\u00a0or testing hasn't started,\"\u00a0said William Jaquis, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, in an interview with CBC News.\n\"Look, we all had low cases at one time, right? And then Seattle started, then New York started, New Orleans, now Detroit, and California is ramping up.\"\nModelling the new virus and predicting its effect on large populations is challenging, and changing, but data from more tests will ultimately produce a clearer picture.\n\"It's really important to remember that \u2026 the mathematical modelling results that are coming out about the United States, are all indicating that if we let up on the [physical]\u00a0distancing now, we will see a large spike in the number of new cases,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Abuelezam.\nThe coronavirus team at the White House is collecting as much data\u00a0as fast as it can to provide concrete evidence to persuade an unpredictable president, who has a habit of freestyling\u00a0from the podium.\nBirx's role at the daily briefings is to balance the bad news piling up as the cases mount and the slope of the virus goes straight up, with no levelling off.\n\"Nineteen out of 50 states\u00a0that had early cases have persistently low level of cases, at this point less than 200 cases [on Thursday],\" she said. \"So, that's almost 40 per cent of the country with extraordinarily low numbers, and they are testing.\n\"Models are models. We are adapting. There is enough data now of the real experience with the coronavirus on the ground to really make these predictions much more sound.\"\nTrump has seemed persuaded that the number of deaths does not justify shutting down the whole of the country for longer than a few weeks.\n\"In my opinion, the mortality rate, it's way, way down, and that takes a lot of fear out. You know, it's one thing to have it. It's another thing to die,\" he said.\n\"When I first got involved, I was being told numbers that were much, much higher than the number seems to be. That's one of the reasons I say, look, we're going to beat this, and we're going to get back to work.\"\nPractically, Trump does not have the powers to regulate whether businesses open or close. The U.S. states can independently decide which restrictions will apply under broader federal guidelines.\nOn Friday, one of those lower-risk states, Wyoming, extended its closures of schools and some businesses to April 17.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It's clear how important it is for us to take sustained action,\"\u00a0said Governor Mark Gordon.\nWith the U.S. now eclipsing cases in all other countries, the experience on the ground changes by the hour and the health-care response in some hard-hit areas is severely strained.\nNurses and doctors say they can't get enough personal protective equipment. Ventilators now being raced into production\u00a0might not come soon enough. States are competing with each other to procure supplies.\nThe number of cases is one marker, but the rate of growth\u00a0is even more telling, said\u00a0Jaquis. In New York, cases doubled in three days.\nDoctors say they need more time to allow them to respond to what's about to hit, without worrying about the second wave of spread.\n\"We're not quite ready to take care of what's coming,\" Jaquis said. \"And we need to make sure that all of our patients and our communities and our health-care workers are protected. So right now, we need people to continue to stay home and we need to flatten that curve. They just need to continue with this for longer.\"\nTrump, calling himself a \"wartime president,\"\u00a0travelled Saturday to Norfolk, Va.,\u00a0 to offer a \"kiss goodbye\" to the USNS Comfort, a naval hospital ship headed for New York harbour to help the city's health care workers deal with the pandemic.\n\"It sends a great signal,\" Trump said, \"when the president is able to go there and say thank you.\"\nPerhaps a confusing signal for the millions of Americans under orders to stay at home.\n"}, {"author": "Susan Ormiston", "title": "Trump extends U.S. physical distancing guidelines until April 30", "description": "Many had worried U.S. president would lift restrictions too soon", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-coronavirus-quarantines-1.5513607", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5514384.1585519136!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/virus-outbreak-trump.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 29, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-30T01:13:24.463Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This is a breaking news update.\u00a0 Below is an earlier version of this story.\u00a0\nU.S. President Donald Trump will extend national physical distancing guidelines to limit the spread of COVID-19 until April 30.\u00a0\nThe announcement at the White House on Sunday evening came as many health-care experts worried that Trump would relax restrictions too early after he said he was hoping for an economic resurrection, with the country \"raring to go by Easter.\"\nBut when asked by reporters about those statements on Sunday evening, Trump said the idea of restoring more normalcy by Easter\u00a0\"was just an aspiration.\"\u00a0\nThis is an earlier version of this story.

Every day, Vice-President Mike Pence, who heads the White House\u00a0coronavirus task force, has brandished the one-page guidelines for the 15 days,\u00a0urging compliance with hand washing\u00a0and physical\u00a0distancing.\nA new mail out to millions of Americans titled \"President Trump's Coronavirus Guidelines for America,\"\u00a0arrived in mailboxes just before the weekend.\nYet Trump has, for a week now, been peddling the idea of allowing more freedoms, hoping for an economic resurrection, with the country \"raring to go by Easter.\"\nThat statement set off red alarms among health care experts, who strongly urge strict adherence to the restrictions\u00a0for a longer period.\nThis weekend the White House's coronavirus task force will present the president with \"a range of recommendations and guidance for going forward,\" said Dr. Deborah Birx, one of the team leaders.\nOne strategy is to identify if areas in the U.S. that\u00a0have fewer cases\u00a0could open up\u00a0first\u00a0\u2014 the theory being that America could be divided into low-, medium- and high-risk areas.\n\"We may take large sections of our country that aren't so seriously affected, and we may do it that way, but we've got to start the process pretty soon,\" Trump repeated at a briefing Thursday.\nStates with fewer confirmed cases, such as North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana\u00a0and New Mexico and pockets in the northeast, could be targeted as lower risk\u00a0while\u00a0places such as New York, with nearly half the reported cases, and other hot spots\u00a0in urban areas\u00a0would be higher risk.\nOn Saturday, Trump said he was considering putting sections of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut under quarantine. It was not clear how he would be able to block road, air and sea travel out of a region that serves as the economic engine of the eastern United States, accounting for 12 per cent of GDP.\u00a0\nBy Saturday night, he'd retreated from that plan, saying the CDC would instead urge a strong travel advisory to hard-hit\u00a0areas, and that \"a quarantine will not be necessary.\"\nOn the recommendation of the White House CoronaVirus Task Force, and upon consultation with the Governor\u2019s of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, I have asked the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CDCgov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CDCgov</a> to issue a strong Travel Advisory, to be administered by the Governors, in consultation with the....\n\"I think we can start by opening up certain parts of the country, you know, the farm belt, certain parts of the Midwest, other places,\" Trump said.\nBut the job of defending that decision, were it to happen, falls to his coronavirus response team working round the clock to get more data.\n\"What we're trying to do is to utilize a laser-focused approach rather than a generic horizontal approach. And I think in the 21st century, we should be able to get to that,\" said\u00a0Birx, who co-ordinates\u00a0the White House's coronavirus response team.\n\"The president's made it clear that, in his words, he wants to open up the country. But we're going to do that responsibly.\"\nAfter declaring himself a \"wartime president,\"\u00a0the president appeared impatient this week\u00a0with the economic casualties, including 3.2 million unemployed, cratering growth\u00a0and a kick to a stock market that was soaring just a month ago.\nFriday, he seemed to lean toward public health advice, telling a briefing, \"life and safety and then the economy.\"\nBut health professionals\u00a0and state officials\u00a0are deeply worried\u00a0he will muddle the public health messaging.\n\"I am quite concerned that we're considering these measures, especially when the science doesn't support it,\" says Nadia Abuelezam, an infectious disease epidemiologist\u00a0and assistant professor at Boston College's Connell School of Nursing.\n\"Even if we do see a reduction in the number of cases, that doesn't mean that it can't re-surge there\u00a0or it can't be reintroduced to that particular area.\"\nIt's not at all clear how some states with fewer cases could open up\u00a0while neighbouring states with a higher incidence remain locked down. Confusion\u00a0over what's allowed where\u00a0could prompt people to pay\u00a0less heed to the restrictions, health experts fear.\n\"Viruses do not respect borders. Viruses do not discriminate. Viruses just want to find another body where they can replicate. And I think that's something to really keep in mind,\" said\u00a0Abuelezam.\nInfectious disease experts want more time\u00a0to measure if the mitigation efforts across the country are working. They also want to better understand how many Americans have or had the virus, with few or no symptoms.\nThat data would help more accurately define how much coronavirus is circulating in the community, but capturing that picture is still extremely complicated and will take time.\n\"I understand the concept \u2014 we're hearing of 'pockets' [of no coronavirus]. But the problem with those pockets is we don't know if those are places where the disease just hasn't spread\u00a0or testing hasn't started,\"\u00a0said William Jaquis, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, in an interview with CBC News.\n\"Look, we all had low cases at one time, right? And then Seattle started, then New York started, New Orleans, now Detroit, and California is ramping up.\"\nModelling the new virus and predicting its effect on large populations is challenging, and changing, but data from more tests will ultimately produce a clearer picture.\n\"It's really important to remember that \u2026 the mathematical modelling results that are coming out about the United States, are all indicating that if we let up on the [physical]\u00a0distancing now, we will see a large spike in the number of new cases,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Abuelezam.\nThe coronavirus team at the White House is collecting as much data\u00a0as fast as it can to provide concrete evidence to persuade an unpredictable president, who has a habit of freestyling\u00a0from the podium.\nBirx's role at the daily briefings is to balance the bad news piling up as the cases mount and the slope of the virus goes straight up, with no levelling off.\n\"Nineteen out of 50 states\u00a0that had early cases have persistently low level of cases, at this point less than 200 cases [on Thursday],\" she said. \"So, that's almost 40 per cent of the country with extraordinarily low numbers, and they are testing.\n\"Models are models. We are adapting. There is enough data now of the real experience with the coronavirus on the ground to really make these predictions much more sound.\"\nTrump has seemed persuaded that the number of deaths does not justify shutting down the whole of the country for longer than a few weeks.\n\"In my opinion, the mortality rate, it's way, way down, and that takes a lot of fear out. You know, it's one thing to have it. It's another thing to die,\" he said.\n\"When I first got involved, I was being told numbers that were much, much higher than the number seems to be. That's one of the reasons I say, look, we're going to beat this, and we're going to get back to work.\"\nPractically, Trump does not have the powers to regulate whether businesses open or close. The U.S. states can independently decide which restrictions will apply under broader federal guidelines.\nOn Friday, one of those lower-risk states, Wyoming, extended its closures of schools and some businesses to April 17.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It's clear how important it is for us to take sustained action,\"\u00a0said Governor Mark Gordon.\nWith the U.S. now eclipsing cases in all other countries, the experience on the ground changes by the hour and the health-care response in some hard-hit areas is severely strained.\nNurses and doctors say they can't get enough personal protective equipment. Ventilators now being raced into production\u00a0might not come soon enough. States are competing with each other to procure supplies.\nThe number of cases is one marker, but the rate of growth\u00a0is even more telling, said\u00a0Jaquis. In New York, cases doubled in three days.\nDoctors say they need more time to allow them to respond to what's about to hit, without worrying about the second wave of spread.\n\"We're not quite ready to take care of what's coming,\" Jaquis said. \"And we need to make sure that all of our patients and our communities and our health-care workers are protected. So right now, we need people to continue to stay home and we need to flatten that curve. They just need to continue with this for longer.\"\nTrump, calling himself a \"wartime president,\"\u00a0travelled Saturday to Norfolk, Va.,\u00a0 to offer a \"kiss goodbye\" to the USNS Comfort, a naval hospital ship headed for New York harbour to help the city's health care workers deal with the pandemic.\n\"It sends a great signal,\" Trump said, \"when the president is able to go there and say thank you.\"\nPerhaps a confusing signal for the millions of Americans under orders to stay at home.\n"}, {"author": "Vanessa Blanch", "title": "Moncton woman celebrates new home, but warns hundreds still struggle with homelessness", "description": "MLA David Coon said 'systemic change' needed to increase affordable housing, which has become a dominant issue", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-homeless-karen-brooker-ywca-david-coon-1.5453889", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5453901.1581011144!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/karen-brooker-apartment.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 08, 2020 8:00 AM AT", "2020-02-08T12:00:00.209Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Karen Brooker sits at her small kitchen table with a mug of coffee in her hand, and a big smile on her face.\nShe\u00a0moved into a\u00a0bright, one-bedroom apartment over a week ago, and says after being homeless and living in a Moncton shelter for six months, she feels relief.\n\"The first morning I woke up I was dancing in my kitchen,\" she laughed.\u00a0\"Even though I don't have much, it's still a home.\"\nCBC News first spoke with\u00a0Brooker in November, 2019 when she was living at the House of Nazareth emergency shelter.

Housing unit\nWith no affordable or subsidized apartments available, Brooker spent more than six\u00a0months sleeping in a shelter dorm with other women, some of whom\u00a0were using drugs and alcohol.\nEventually\u00a0she feared for her safety, and turned to couch-surfing rather than staying at the shelter.\nBrooker\u00a0was thrilled when she was offered a temporary, subsidized apartment by the Moncton YWCA. She receives\u00a0a disability cheque of $763 each month and pays rent equal to 30 per cent of her income, which is $225 a month.\nLiving in a safe, affordable apartment is \"100 per cent better,\" than the shelter.\n\"Just having my own privacy is amazing. The stress level has definitely gone down.\"\nBrooker\u00a0said after her story was reported by CBC News, a stranger contacted the Moncton YWCA and paid her first month's rent and damage deposit to allow her to move in immediately.\n\"Whoever you are, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart,\" she said. \"I thought it was a miracle \u2026 you know to think that someone actually helped me was amazing because I've been through such a struggle in the last year or so.\"\nBrooker said the extra money has helped her to set up her new place, and buy cleaning supplies and other necessities\u00a0like garbage bags.\n\"This being the first month here, I spent quite a bit on groceries and I still don't have everything I need because it's expensive out there,\" she said. \"But I have more than what most people have so I'm thankful for that.\"\nShe spent about\u00a0$150 at the grocery store and is enjoying eating what she wants, when she wants.\n\"I'll tell you it's some nice to be able to cook your own meals. It's just nice to cook what you want to eat \u2014 I find that's quite amazing in itself.\"\nNow Brooker, who is on the waiting list for an N.B. Housing unit, is hoping she will soon get a call that a permanent apartment is available.\nHer current apartment is furnished, and pets aren't permitted. But an N.B. Housing unit would allow her to have her cat, Sassy Girl, and\u00a0take her belongings\u00a0out of storage.\n\"She's my companion,\" she said of her pet who is staying with friends. \"I'm just praying that whatever place I get I can bring my girl with me 'cause she means so much to me.\"\nAs someone who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, Brooker said she doesn't get\u00a0depressed as often when she has Sassy Girl with her.\nLooking back on her time in the shelter, Brooker\u00a0has learned a lot of lessons.\n\"I've learned that \u2026 even though I'm struggling the way I am, that there's a lot more struggles out there. And I think that the way that the system is run, it's broken because there's people in the shelters that need help and they're not receiving it.\"\nBrooker\u00a0talks about an 80-year-old man she met\u00a0at the shelter who she believes should be in a special care home, and others who are in need of mental health supports but not receiving them.\n\"I wouldn't wish it on my enemy,\" she said of her six months at the shelter. \"Believe me I don't ever want to go back.\"\nDuring her time at the House of Nazareth, Brooker saw many people move out, only to return.\n\"You know they got a place. They were only gone for a couple of months and then, poof, they're back.\"\nBrooker said people would try\u00a0to survive paying market rents but most couldn't do it.\n\"People just don't want realize how much of a struggle it is. You know when you're only getting $900 or $700 and you're paying that much in rent, there's no way and it's as if the landlords are putting the rents up so high that we can't afford them anymore.\"\nFor Fredericton MLA and Green Party Leader David Coon, housing\u00a0is the number one issue raised by his\u00a0constituents and has been since he was elected.\n\"That dominates,\" he said. \"And it's been the case year after year since 2014.\"\nCoon said while\u00a0it's great when people \"come out of the woodwork\" to help people like Karen Brooker, there are many more\u00a0with similar stories who aren't getting that same attention.\n\"It's so important that people understand that there are so many people in comparable situations. So we need systemic change.\"\nCoon said the focus of the Higgs government must broaden and goals such as\u00a0\"growing the GDP\" or \"debt reduction\" should only\u00a0be part of a larger strategy.\n\"We need to get to a government that says, 'No, the well-being of New Brunswickers, particularly the most vulnerable and our children is at the centre of everything we do.'\"\nWhile she was in the shelter, Brooker said there was no one there helping the residents to find a way out.\n\"They don't help guide you or show you where to go. You've got to figure it out on your own.\"\nNow that she is on the right track,\u00a0Brooker plans to return to the shelter to volunteer and help those who are still there.\n\"Even though I'm in the predicament I'm in, I'm always trying to help others,\" she said.\n"}, {"author": "Jonathan Montpetit", "title": "Why the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois came back from the dead to haunt the Liberals", "description": "By recycling old arguments, Trudeau and the other leaders appeared out of touch with Quebec", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bloc-qu%c3%a9b%c3%a9cois-come-back-haunt-liberals-nationalism-sovereignty-1.5327944", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5327945.1571530197!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/yves-francois-blanchet.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 20, 2019 10:11 AM ET", "2019-10-20T14:11:34.708Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Throughout the campaign, as the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois rose steadily in the polls, the other leaders would accuse the sovereigntist party of trying to revive vieilles chicanes, old arguments.\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer used the line in the TVA debate.

As Conservative leader Andrew Scheer bids for votes, the cost of his promises is also mounting.\nAll of which leads us to the question of whether government spending is ultimately good or bad for a country. And while there are political\u00a0advocates for both sides, governments rarely avoid spending more than they earn in revenue.\n\"Government is not the solution to our problem, government is\u00a0the problem,\" U.S. President Ronald Reagan famously said in his inaugural address. Ironically the economic boom during the Reagan era was funded by public borrowing, as tax cuts transferred public wealth to the private sector. During his two terms as president, the U.S. public debt\u00a0tripled.\nHistorically, Canada's Conservative-led governments have seen a place for public spending. The Roads to Resources plan by the government of John Diefenbaker in the 1950s\u00a0was promoted as a way to open up the isolated communities of the Canadian North to new\u00a0development.\nMostly remembered as a success, the idea was that the federal government\u00a0would spend\u00a0hundreds of millions of dollars in road construction that no individual company wanting to exploit resources in the region could afford.\nThe idea of government spending to open up new territory is hardly new. It was the British government that funded voyages of discovery such as the Franklin expedition, though that didn't quite pay off. The Spanish government of Queen Isabella sponsored exploration by Christopher Columbus.\nAnd that idea of government investment has expanded from new geography to new frontiers in technology. As economist Mariana\u00a0Mazzucato, author of\u00a0The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths, has pointed out, it was massive government investment in unproven technology that created the even more massive private sector wealth of companies like Google and Amazon.\nLiberals may scoff at Poilievre's comparison of government spending to running up the credit card. After all, when governments spend money on something like\u00a0northern roads or other infrastructure projects, the money flows straight back into the economy as wages and business profits that are taxed once again. But\u00a0the comparison of personal debt and public debt is not baseless.\nRunning up a credit card bill for consumer goods\u00a0is\u00a0different from borrowing to invest in\u00a0a home. In the same way boosting the deficit to offer juicy election handouts to voters is completely different from deficit spending for long-term investments in the economy. Promises from both frontrunners in this election fall on both sides of that equation.\nLast month a group of economists, including French scholar Thomas Piketty, wrote a letter to the Financial Times declaring the advantages of European government investment in the economy, especially when interest rates are so low.\n\"Today the government can borrow at negative real interest rates: Many pressing infrastructure, education and environment projects offer returns well above zero and can therefore generate higher future tax receipts, supporting, not detracting, from fiscal sustainability,\" said the letter writers that also included Mazzucato.\nMazzucato is one of those who have thrown her support behind that ultimate\u00a0licence for governments\u00a0to spend. In\u00a0Modern Monetary Theory, the idea is that while inflation and interest rates remain low,\u00a0governments should keep spending until every person is employed and inflation starts to rise. That theory is widely disputed.\nOf course the public acceptance of government spending depends on the\u00a0political times. When Ontario Premier Doug Ford warned of the province drowning in debt, he was playing on memories of older voters of when the federal debt-to-GDP ratio some claimed\u00a0was as high as\u00a072 per cent,\u00a0though sources differ on that figure.\nWith considerable pain to the country, Liberal Finance Minister Paul Martin got the debt down, and since then governments have managed to hold deficit increases\u00a0below the growth of the economy, something the Liberals are promising to continue. Of course a sudden plunge in economic growth could abruptly change the picture.\nBut in the wake of the Ford government's cuts in Ontario that many critics claim unnecessarily slashed investment in education, damaging the province's future prospects,\u00a0the voters' attitude to deficit spending may be blowing the other way.\nAt least that's what Trudeau is betting for now.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The candidates for Regina\u2012Lewvan and where they stand on the issues", "description": "Candidates gathered for panel discussion Friday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-lewvan-candidates-1.5301190", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301200.1569630322!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/regina-lewvan-candidates.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 27, 2019 6:40 PM CT", "2019-09-28T00:40:14.884Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It's anyone's game for candidates in the Regina\u2012Lewvan riding.\u00a0\nThe federal riding's current MP, Erin Weir \u2014 ousted from the\u00a0NDP caucus last year \u2014 isn't running again.\nFour of the five people who are running in the Oct. 21 election\u00a0gathered for a panel discussion Friday, hosted by the CBC's Stefani Langenegger at the University of Regina Centre for Continuing Education.\nConservative Party candidate Warren Steinley, Liberal candidate Winter Fedyk, NDP candidate Jigar Patel and People's Party of Canada candidate Trevor Wowk were there to speak and answer questions from Langenegger and the audience.\u00a0\nThe Green Party candidate from the riding, Naomi Hunter, wasn't there, but Tamela Friesen \u2014 the party's candidate for Regina\u2012Wascana \u2014\u00a0participated.\nAll five spoke on issues including climate change, health care, Indigenous issues and reconciliation, and immigration.\nFriesen said the Green Party has the most aggressive action plan on climate change, with an aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 60 per cent by 2030. She said her party would cancel all imports of oil, sticking to Canadian fossil fuels until they are phased\u00a0out.\u00a0\nShe also said the party would invest in helping people who work in the oil and gas industry transfer their skills to positions that support a green economy.\u00a0\nThe People's Party's Wowk said he is skeptical of the climate crisis, but supports climate change protests because he and his party are in favour of free speech. He said the climate is changing gradually, but thinks society will adapt and work together to find solutions. His party will would scrap the carbon tax, he said.\nPatel called\u00a0climate change a serious issue that needs to be addressed. He said the NDP action plan on climate change would aim to create 300,000 jobs in green energy, with the goal of moving toward zero emissions.\u00a0\nSteinley said the Conservatives would get rid of the carbon tax which he called\u00a0a \"Liberal tax grab.\" He said the party\u00a0would instead push for the creation of green technology\u00a0that could be shared with the rest of the world.\nFedyk said the Liberals\u00a0would balance aggressive climate action with economic realities, especially in the west. She said the Liberal plan would move\u00a0to net zero emissions by 2050 by bringing in an independent review panel to advise on skills training, investments and education.\u00a0\nWowk said the People's Party\u00a0would let provincial governments take the lead on health care, but would work to reduce wait times.\u00a0\nPatel said it is unacceptable that\u00a0health care in Canada is often cost prohibitive, and the NDP would launch universal pharmacare for prescriptions drugs.\nSteinley said the Conservatives would provide $1.5 billion to the provinces to increase the number of MRIs and CT scans. He said the party would also increase health transfers by three per cent, or more if the GDP goes up.\u00a0\nFedyk said the Liberals would offer universal pharmacare and would invest in both mental health and addictions.\u00a0\nFriesen said the Green Party would also roll out pharmacare. She said the party would treat the opioid crisis as a public health issue, not a criminal one. She also said the party would work to eliminate poverty and improve nutrient density in food to reduce health care costs long-term.\u00a0\nSteinley said the Conservative Party would work on economic reconciliation. He said a Conservative government would partner with First Nations communities on- and off-reserve to find out what issues impact them the most.\u00a0\nFedyk said a Liberal government would work to cut down on the number of First Nations children in\u00a0care of social services. She pointed to the Industrial School land transfer near Regina as an example of work that her party is committed to doing.\u00a0\nFriesen said the Green Party would implement all the recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the missing and murdered Indigenous women inquiry's report, as well as recommendations from the United Nations. She said the Greens would honour self-governance on First Nations communities, but would also make sure Indigenous people had adequate drinking water and K-12 education on reserves.\u00a0\nWowk said the People's Party would help families of MMIW and those who are entitled to residential school settlements.\u00a0\nPatel said the NDP would make sure Indigenous communities have safe housing, access to clean drinking water, education and health care for all residents.\nFedyk said the Liberal Party has committed to maintaining \"healthy levels of immigration,\" with a goal of\u00a0bringing in 350,000 immigrants by 2020. She said the focus will be on economic immigration to help fill gaps in the labour market.\u00a0\nFriesen said the Green Party supports immigration. She said intolerance needs to be addressed on social media, where people spread lies about the immigration process.\nWowk said the People's Party would cut down on immigration, with a focus on maintaining \"Canadian values\" and assimilating immigrants.\u00a0\nPatel, who is an immigrant himself, said immigration helps the economy. He said the NDP would shorten times for families waiting to reunite.\u00a0\nSteinley said the Conservative Party would improve language training for new immigrants and credential recognition for those with schooling, and end illegal border crossings from the U.S.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Where are Thomas Cook travellers stranded?

The NDP has long stated that the new NAFTA doesn't go far enough to protect Canadian workers.\nThe protracted negotiations for a new free trade deal with the United States\u00a0may be over, but the painful sting of tariffs on steel and aluminum \u2014 and the threat of auto tariffs \u2014 are still fresh in the memory of Canadian workers.\u00a0\nIt's those lingering feelings\u00a0the Liberals tapped into with a new ad released on Saturday.\u00a0\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland narrates the commercial as scenes of\u00a0the NAFTA renegotiations and tariff battle flash across the screen.\u00a0\u00a0\nFreeland, a central figure in those trade negotiations, says the Liberals fought \"tooth and nail\"\u00a0and stood\u00a0up to the Americans.\u00a0\nThe ad ends with a pledge that the Liberals will always support \"hard-working Canadians.\"\nAfter more than a year of tense talks, a deal was reached last fall. However, because the trade deal is stalled in the U.S. Congress, Canada has put off ratifying the new NAFTA.\u00a0\nU.S.\u00a0tariffs of 25\u00a0per cent on steel and 10\u00a0per cent on aluminum remained in place for months after an agreement was reached, finally removed by President Donald Trump in May of this year.\u00a0\nCanada's auto industry was heavily affected. About 2.2 million cars were produced in Ontario in 2017, but the auto industry has shifted operations to countries like Mexico.\u00a0Canadian plants, such as the GM operation in Oshawa, are on the chopping block.\nBut bad blood over trade deals isn't the only threat.\u00a0\u00a0A\u00a0report from the\u00a0Ontario government this year warned production has fallen 25 per cent in the last two decades as production gets cheaper elsewhere.\u00a0\nThe auto industry contributes $19 billion to Canada's GDP and is one of the country's largest manufacturing sectors. The industry and related labour employs more than half a million people, according to Statistics Canada.\nIt's those jobs Singh says he's looking to protect with the $300-million\u00a0investment for innovation that would emphasize sustainability.\nThe idea isn't new.\u00a0\nIn 2008, the Harper government introduced similar funding, pledging $250 million over five years to support green research and development in the auto sector. Harper extended those funds in 2013, and the program was also expanded in 2016 under Justin Trudeau.\nThe NDP\u00a0 \u2014 which historically has done well in manufacturing towns in Ontario \u2014 says the difference is its\u00a0policy would shift the focus to made-in-Canada cars.\u00a0\nIt's tricky to define a made-in-Canada\u00a0car, because\u00a0the North American automotive industry is so\u00a0intertwined. Car parts bounce back and forth across the border several times before the finished product is ready.\nSingh says his definition is \"When a car is manufactured in Canada and it puts people to work in Canada.\"\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer\u00a0was also in eastern Ontario on Saturday, campaigning\u00a0in Kanata-Carleton with his candidate Justina McCaffrey.\u00a0\nSpeaking to the crowd mostly comprised of families, Scheer\u00a0said he's focused on putting more money in their pockets and helping them feel like the future is stable.\u00a0\nBut his economic message\u00a0\u2014 cancelling the carbon tax and introducing a new transit tax credit\u00a0\u2014 was interrupted when McCaffrey was caught up in\u00a0a\u00a0social media sinkhole.\u00a0\nThe Liberals released a\u00a0video\u00a0ahead of the rally\u00a0depicting her describing her close\u00a0friendship with Faith Goldy, who has been banned from Facebook for alt-right comments.\u00a0\nIt's the latest in a string of candidate controversies.

Howe Institute found that all three countries will be worse off if the treaty is approved by their legislatures and comes into force: the U.S. economy will be 0.1 per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been, the Canadian economy 0.4 per cent smaller, and the Mexican economy 0.79 per cent smaller. The effects are primarily because of U.S. efforts to get more protections for its manufacturing sector, the analysis found.\n\"Yes, we gave up some access (in the dairy sector) but we have to remember what we got in return, which was Chapter 19 ... That was a big one for us, for Canada,\" Ambrose said.\nChapter 19 lays out the trade agreement's dispute-resolution mechanism and is, in Ambrose's view, \"the heart of the deal for Canada.\" Trump was determined to scrap it and allow American courts to judge trade disputes in future but the Trudeau government held firm that some kind of independent dispute-resolution system must be part of the deal.\n\"It wasn't an idle threat (from Trump),\" said Ambrose. \"They were extremely critical of Chapter 19 and I think right up to the last minute it was their intent to scrap it.\"\nIn addition, Ambrose said Canada scored success on having international labour standards and environmental principles entrenched in the deal.\nAmbrose said Scheer's criticism of the dairy concession is consistent with his strong support for supply management. Dairy farmers were instrumental in his leadership victory over Maxime Bernier, who advocated dismantling supply management and has now left the Tories to found his own party.\nScheer, who has dubbed the new trade pact NAFTA 0.5, has also criticized the deal for extending patent protection for pharmaceuticals, which could drive up the cost of prescription drugs. He's also maintained the deal makes Canadian automakers less competitive and that it gives the U.S. \"unprecedented\" say over Canadian negotiations with future potential trade partners.\n\"The prime minister had a once-in-a-generation opportunity to negotiate a better deal and he failed,\" Scheer told the House of Commons last May. \"He gave Donald Trump everything the president wanted and more.\"\nBut Ambrose said she doesn't think Canada was outmanoeuvred by Trump.\n\"No. I think at the end of the day, there's three parties, everyone gained a little and everyone gave up a little. That's the nature of a negotiation.\"\nFormer Conservative cabinet minister James Moore, who also served on Trudeau's NAFTA advisory panel, refused to comment on Scheer's contention that Trudeau caved in to Trump.\n\"It's a fair question, it's a reasonable story but I'm not going to get sucked into the election,\" Moore said in an interview.\n"}, {"author": "Elizabeth Fraser", "title": "N.B.

The province performed 586 tests on Thursday, the largest volume since testing started last month.\u00a0\nHere is a roundup of other developments.\u00a0\nPremier Blaine Higgs said he was disappointed to find out that New Brunswick's all-terrain vehicle trails reopened Friday.\u00a0\nA letter was sent out Thursday by New Brunswick ATV Federation president Roger Daigle about the opening.\n\"Even though we are in the middle of the woods, it is crucial that we respect the following rules: We must refrain from using our shelters and riding in big groups; also we must keep our distance and ride safely,\" Daigle said in the letter.\nThe move had the support of Natural Resources\u00a0Minister Mike Holland, but Higgs said he was concerned it might lead to\u00a0 gatherings, which are not allowed under the state of emergency.\n\"I think the messaging got a little offside here.\"\nAs the weather gets nicer, Premier Blaine Higgs is pleading\u00a0with New Brunswickers to avoid visiting their cottages over the weekend.\u00a0\n\"I am sympathetic to that situation,\" he said. \"I recognize that in New Brunswick, we have different areas that we like to go and I feel the same way personally.\"\u00a0\nHiggs said Public Health and government want to find a way that would allow residents to have \"some freedom\" to travel across the province.\u00a0\nBut this might not be possible until at least two weeks after\u00a0passed since the long Easter weekend, and the province knows how it's faring by the case numbers then.\nFor now, he's urging people to stay in their communities and avoid \"moving across the province.\"\n\"We'll find a way but I'm asking people just to be patient for a little bit longer.\"\u00a0\nPremier Blaine Higgs\u00a0spoke with 114 New Brunswick mayors and officials on a conference call Friday to answer some of their concerns about economic recovery.\nHe said he told the mayors the government is actively working on a recovery plan and strategy, and the details will be available in coming weeks.\u00a0\n\"But we cannot make the\u00a0mistake of returning to our normal life too soon,\" he said.\n\"Even when current restrictions are reduced, we are not going back to business as usual anytime soon.\"\nPremier Blaine Higgs said some summer concerts and events could also be cancelled this summer.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, the premier did say\u00a0couples also don't need to cancel upcoming weddings this summer.\u00a0\nBut if they do plan to get married, they have to do it in a way that respects physical distancing and keeping people safe.\n\"It's about finding a way to actually do what we want to do and do what we'd like to do, but do it in a safe manner that can adhere to the guidelines,\" he said.\nAt Thursday's premiers meeting, there was discussion about certain regions peeling back some of their restrictions.\u00a0\nThose provinces included New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan.\u00a0\nAlthough New Brunswick might be in a different situation from other parts of Canada, Higgs said the province will continue to follow direction from public health.\u00a0\n\"I don't see anything changing certainly in the control around our borders.\"\nUp to 70 workers\u00a0from a power services company in New Brunswick have been told to self-isolate at home after restoring power in Maine over the past week.\u00a0\u00a0\nThousands of residents in Maine lost power for just over a week after a snow and wind storm. Utilities in the state called on Holland Power Services in Fredericton for help.\n\"In these trying times,\u00a0when you're in the dark and uncertain in uncertain times, we really need to step up and help those people effectively,\"\u00a0Earl Holland, president and owner of Holland Power Service, said Friday.\nThere are more than 800\u00a0cases of COVID-19 in Maine, the majority of them in the southern part of the state.\nHolland said his crews were working in northern and central areas of Maine.\n\"It is an emergency mandatory service,\" he said. \"We have to prepare continuously for all kinds of different scenarios.\"\nThe\u00a0company put together a plan two months ago, preparing\u00a0for the pandemic. For instance, one person is instructed to drive a bucket truck, while that person's partner drives\u00a0another vehicle.\nHolland said his staff have\u00a0returned home safely on Thursday and will stay home for 14 days.\n\"If there happened to be another storm and services are required again, we'll have to make that judgment of when or if we would go,\" he said.\u00a0\nCrews were also asked to restore power Pennsylvania and\u00a0Rhode Island but Holland said the company declined\u00a0 because of safety risks.\u00a0\n\"We'll have to make that judgment of when or if we would go.\"\nIn a Twitter post, the president of the\u00a0New Brunswick\u00a0Medical Society has revealed what it would look like to intubate patients coming in with COVID-19 at\u00a0the Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital in Fredericton.\nDr. Chris Goodyear showed people what the intensive-care unit looks like for patients with COViD-19 who need to be looked after.\nDr. Chris Goodyear shares an inside look on how front-line health-care workers are preparing to receive <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> patients. <a href=\"https://t.co/i5wX4EUOwz\">pic.twitter.com/i5wX4EUOwz</a>\nMedical staff at the hospital practise putting on personal protective gear, which included face shield.

The end result will be for 2020 to mark the steepest one-year decline in GDP for all provinces.\"\nThe Conference Board of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion and National banks have each recently projected a severe economic contraction in New Brunswick this year of between 3.2 and 4.1 per cent.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat's significantly worse than the banking crisis and recession of 2008 when New Brunswick's economy declined by a combined 0.6 per cent over two years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe New Brunswick legislature met for a quick 25-minute sitting Friday to adopt three new measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWorkers will now be protected from being fired for staying home if they're self-isolating or if they have to care for a sick family member.\nThe bill amends the Employment Standards Act, which already has protections for workers, but \"none of them would directly apply to the unprecedented emergency situation we find ourselves in today,\" Labour Minister Trevor Holder told the house.\nMLAs also voted to give the government the power to establish emergency child care centres for children of essential workers who haven't been able to find other arrangements.\nThe province closed daycares last month as part its response to the pandemic but allowed some centres to operate for children of essential workers.\u00a0\nBut not everyone has been able to find spots, so the law will let the province set up centres \"in areas of need, when all other avenues have been exhausted,\" Public Safety Minister Carl Urquhart said.\nThe same bill, which amends the Emergency Measures Act, also suspends the deadlines for New Brunswickers filing court actions or complaints to provincial tribunals.\nThe deadlines will be suspended during the emergency and for 90 days after it ends.\nPeople concerned they might have\u00a0COVID-19 can\u00a0take a self-assessment\u00a0on the government website.

About half of the total survey of 1,200 respondents was conducted before stock markets and oil prices plunged (March 2-8).\u00a0The other half of the interviews took place after this economic shock (March 9-18). Our analysis found no real difference in public opinion about energy transition between the two periods. Growing concerns about the pandemic continue to shape public attitudes.\nAs with all polls, this one is a snapshot in time. CBC News \u2014\u00a0and the public opinion experts consulted on this survey research \u2014\u00a0believe the data offers some valuable insights into Albertans'\u00a0attitudes about the economy and politics just at the moment when COVID-19 changed everything.\nThis is the fifth article to come out of this research. Read the previous articles here:\nIt was sombre. It was serious.\u00a0\nPremier Jason Kenney's televised address to Albertans last week delivered a sobering reckoning of\u00a0\"perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation\" facing the Prairie province.\nFirst \u2014 and most pressing \u2014 the health crisis sparked by the coronavirus pandemic could, in a probable scenario, see as many as 800,000 infections, and between 400 and 3,100 deaths in Alberta.\nThe economic ramifications of the infection are profound, with the most recent forecast estimating that one in four Albertans will lose their jobs and the crisis will \"permanently reshape\" the province's economy. As\u00a0Kenney has said, it could be an economic disaster equivalent to or worse than the Great Depression.\nThe International Monetary Fund's most recent estimates forecast massive global decline, and a terrible situation for energy prices \u2014 Alberta's bedrock industry.\nThe future of the industry is unclear.\nA CBC News poll, taken just before the economic implications of the coronavirus were becoming clear, suggests 79 per cent of Albertans already thought that the province should transition toward renewable energy. More than nine in 10\u00a0Albertans also think the province should do more to encourage the development of the technology sector.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd 51 per cent think that the province should transition away from oil and gas.\u00a0\nWhile support for transitioning away from oil and gas is highest in Edmonton (58 per cent), it has similar levels of support in Calgary (55 per cent). Outside the province's two major cities, only about a third of Albertans (37 per cent) support moving away from oil and gas.\nThere is general agreement that Alberta needs more renewables. Albertans are divided on whether or not to wind down the oil and gas industry.\nThe question is, how do you fix and reshape Alberta's energy-dependent economy\u00a0while looking after people caught up in the change?\nAlbertans have debated diversification for years, but there's an argument to be made that the coronavirus crisis offers an opportunity to speed up diversifying the economy and transitioning to more renewable energy sources.\nCalgary-based pollster Janet Brown has detected an increasing desire amongst Albertans to diversify Alberta's oil and gas-dependent economy over the past couple of years.\n\"Albertans don't necessarily want to abandon the oil and gas industry, but that doesn't mean they don't want to see the economy transition away from the oil and gas industry,\" said Brown, who conducted the research for CBC News.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It's about\u00a0\u2026 keeping the industries that we rely on strong, and diversifying so that in the future we're not so reliant on any single industry,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd that's key: To keep oil and gas viable in the short term, while beginning a green transition.\nEven before COVID-19,\u00a0Kenney acknowledged that Alberta \"will see a gradual shift from hydrocarbon-based energy to other forms of energy.\"\nThat said, in recent weeks, Kenney has pressured the federal government to help the province's beleaguered energy industry, recently suggesting that he anticipates significant federal support for the sector.\u00a0\nThat assistance has been expected for some time\u00a0but hasn't yet arrived.\nThe renewable energy industry, for its part, is pressuring Ottawa to stimulate the pandemic ravaged economy by investing in wind energy, hydro power and electric vehicles.\nAt the same time, hundreds of academics \u2014 including prominent Alberta scholars \u2014 recently called on the federal Liberal government to reject bailing out Canada's energy industry, and instead accelerate a green transition.\nThey stressed that\u00a0\"growing demand for climate-friendly energy sources further threatens the viability of high cost, carbon-intensive oilsands production.\"\nIn an email statement to CBC News, Kavi Bal, the senior press secretary with Alberta's Ministry of Energy, said, \"We've always acknowledged the gradual energy transition, but by all accounts, oil and gas will be needed for decades to come \u2014 not just in Alberta, but globally.\"\nIn the same statement, Bal described the academics' open-letter as \"rich,\" noting that the \"Alberta-based signatories benefit from generous salaries, in part, because of the very oil and gas that they denounce.\"\nFor decades, Albertans have talked about economic diversification and energy transition, but the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic has intensified the argument.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs Rahm Emmanuel, former U.S. president Barack Obama's first chief of staff, quipped to the Wall Street Journal, \"you never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\"\nYears ago, energy analysts debated when we'd reach \"peak oil\" or run out of the stuff.\u00a0 Recently, some analysts have wondered when the demand for Alberta's crude will dwindle, replaced by alternative \u2014 greener \u2014 sources of energy. Others study how a balance could be achieved and how the transition could occur.\nRespected Calgary-based energy economist and investment strategist Peter Tertzakian foresees demand for oil returning after social distancing ends, but a \"bruised global economy with soft oil demand is a foregone conclusion.\" \u00a0\nTravel and commuting habits, he contends, may have forever changed because of the pandemic.\nAnd Tertzakian anticipates an acceleration of the renewable energy transition.\n\"I think it's going to happen. I support it,\" he said.\n\"But that should not be confused with the idea of putting the oil and gas industry here to bed.\"\nMorgan Bazilian, a professor of public policy at the Colorado School of Mines and the director of the Payne Institute, which researches public policy on earth resources, energy and the environment, says that the collapse in oil prices and the decline in its demand triggered by the pandemic highlights the need for Alberta to diversify its economy.\nBazilian believes government stimulus packages aimed at kick starting the economy in the wake of the global pandemic need to be balanced between fossil fuels and renewable energy.\u00a0\n\"But simply saying that we will move all the stimulus money on the energy sector to change and become low-carbon right away is unlikely to be the wisest use of the\u00a0\u2026 stimulus money,\" he added.\u00a0\nThe pandemic and the economic fracture it triggered have revealed that there's no \"going back to business as usual,\" predicts\u00a0Severson-Baker, the Alberta regional director for\u00a0Pembina.\u00a0\n\"It'll be a long, slow recovery, if it ever recovers fully,\" for Alberta's energy industry, Severson-Baker added.\n\"And it'll be immediately followed by another decline in demand as a result of the world responding to the challenge of climate change.\"\nIf change is upon us, the question becomes, how to deal with change the right way.\nAcademics have studied historical energy transitions:\u00a0what worked, and what didn't. They have identified some potential roads, and some potential roadblocks, ahead.\nWriting last May in the prestigious journal Nature, several respected energy analysts, including the above mentioned\u00a0Bazilian, described four possible paths to a low-carbon future.\u00a0\nIn the first scenario \u2014 what they call the Big Green Deal \u2014 government policies, investment and global co-operation accelerate a rapid decarbonization. Governments across the world spend billions on renewable energy, and financial markets divest themselves of fossil-fuel assets, reallocating to low-carbon investments.\nIn the second imagined future \u2014 Technology Breakthrough \u2014 significant technological achievements allow renewable energy to displace fossil fuels, mitigating climate change.\u00a0\nIn the third, somewhat dystopian future \u2014 Dirty Nationalism \u2014 populist governments protect the fossil fuel industries in their jurisdictions, fragmenting the global energy market and slowing the transition to a low-carbon economy.\u00a0\nIn the final predicted future \u2014 Muddling On \u2014 the status quo persists. Fossil fuels remain the world's main energy source. Renewable energy claims a share of the energy mix as its costs decline, but not enough to mitigate climate change.\nBazilian, believes the four models still hold up even in a post-pandemic world, adding that the \"dirty nationalism\" model was most closely aligned with the pre-pandemic situation where Saudi Arabia and Russia waged war over oil prices.\nTertzakian, who has written two books about energy transition, stresses that Alberta is already transforming its energy system, pointing out that the province is moving to mothball coal-fired power plants by 2030.\u00a0\nThe long-time energy watcher supports diversifying Alberta's economy and increasing renewable energy use. But he wonders what will replace the economic benefits of the oil industry.\nCanada remains, after all, the fourth largest producer and fourth largest exporter of oil in the world. In 2018, oil and gas extraction alone accounted for more than seven per cent of Canada's total gross domestic product (GDP), and it is our largest export.\n\"The reality is that the bulk of our oil and gas, the vast majority of it is exported and used elsewhere, for which we have substantial economic activity. So merely transitioning to renewables is not going to backfill that economic activity,\" Tertzakian said.\nBazilian says it's important for any energy transition strategy to take care of the people who lose jobs in the planned switch from, for example, coal-fired power plants to renewable power, such as wind-powered turbines.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"You have to think about how it affects society from a social perspective,\" he cautioned.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe speed of change must be handled carefully as well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Pace of change could really have some very negative connotations for citizens\u00a0\u2026 the poor and the marginalized will suffer even more.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nSo how to support both change and people?\nPart of Alberta's plan to reduce its carbon emissions could begin with the existing oil and gas industry.\nThe Pembina Institute's\u00a0Severson-Baker wants the federal government to invest stimulus money in carbon capture and storage and reducing methane emissions from upstream oil and gas production.\nThe energy industry, for its part, says any federal money should also help pay for the reclamation of inactive and orphan wells, creating jobs for out-of-work oil service workers.\nTertzakian expects some of the coming stimulus spending will be directed into renewable energy, such as wind and solar, and into energy efficiency retrofits. But again, he cautions that, in the long run, it won't be enough to replace the economic activity generated by Alberta's oil and gas industry.\u00a0\u00a0\nTertzakian suggests turning to other natural resources, including forestry and agriculture.\nAlberta also has the advantage of relatively low electricity rates that could power newer industries, such as manufacturing and high-tech.\u00a0\n\"Now we have the opportunity to use what we have under our feet and around us to create an economy that is more resilient,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut when you discuss jobs, livelihoods and people, you run into political territory.\nThe CBC News Road Ahead 2020 poll found that, just as the economic impact of COVID-19 was hitting, 54 per cent of Albertans believed oil and gas companies have too much say in Alberta politics.\nSome longtime political watchers say that, even before the coronavirus crisis began, the current provincial government was out of step with Albertans' hopes for energy diversification.\n\"The government is not, I think, listening to the public on these matters,\" said Duane Bratt, the head of the department of economics, justice, and policy studies at Mount Royal University.\nTaking a closer look at the polling data, we can break down Albertans based on their attitudes toward\u00a0both types of energy transition. Almost half (48 per cent) agree with both increasing renewable energy and decreasing oil and gas production. One in three (30 per cent) support more renewables\u00a0but don't want to move away from oil and gas.\u00a0\nContrast that with only 16 per cent of Albertans who are opposed to both types of transition. And a mere two per cent who hold the curious position of wanting less oil and gas\u00a0but not wanting more renewable energy sources.\nSo, the debate isn't about whether Alberta needs more renewable energy. The argument in Albertans' minds is about the extent to which oil and gas remains a part of the province's future.\nThese divergent Alberta opinions on what exactly our next moves should be are something the provincial (and federal) government must grapple with in a post-pandemic economic reality.\u00a0\nCertainly, there are efforts already underway in Alberta to transition toward green energy.\nA spokesperson for the province's minister of energy points out that Alberta already supports renewable energy projects, such as the country's largest solar energy project near Vulcan, south of Calgary.\u00a0\nBut current circumstances could force the UCP to accelerate economic diversification and energy transition, especially if demand for Alberta oil remains soft.\u00a0\nTertzakian thinks economics will ultimately underpin politics.\nHe predicts the UCP will definitely be talking more about diversification in the expected anemic economy that follows the coronavirus.\n\"I don't think it's lost on them,\" he said.\nMethodology:\nThe CBC News\u00a0random survey of 1,200 Albertans was conducted using a hybrid method between March 2 and March 18, 2020, by Edmonton-based Trend Research under the direction of Janet Brown Opinion Research. The sample is representative along regional, age and gender factors. The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For subsets, the margin of error is larger.\nThe survey used a hybrid methodology that involved contacting survey respondents by telephone and giving them the option of completing the survey at that time, at another more convenient time, or receiving an email link and completing the survey online. Trend Research contacted people using a random list of numbers, consisting of half land lines and half cellphone numbers. Telephone numbers were dialled up to five times at five different times of day before another telephone number was added to the sample. The response rate among valid numbers (i.e. residential and personal) was 13.2 per cent.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Why a Canadian Muslim is boycotting the hajj over Saudi war crimes", "description": "'The hajj is governed by the Saudi regime and I do not agree\u00a0at all with the atrocities they've committed'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/reliving-parkland-in-el-paso-hong-kong-protests-intensify-canadian-muslim-boycotts-hajj-sam-rudy-more-1.5240818/why-a-canadian-muslim-is-boycotting-the-hajj-over-saudi-war-crimes-1.5240836", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5242106.1565387635!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/saudi-haj.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 09, 2019 6:04 PM ET", "2019-08-09T22:04:30.243Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "More than two million Muslims are expected to make the annual hajj pilgrimage\u00a0to Mecca this year, but Waeza Shamsia Afzal won't be one of them.\n\"The hajj is governed by the Saudi regime and I do not agree\u00a0at all with the atrocities they've committed and continue to commit,\" she told\u00a0Day 6\u00a0host Brent Bambury.\nThe annual event began Friday and is considered the spiritual pinnacle for many Muslims around the world.\nAfzal, who wrote about her concerns for the Globe and Mail, says her opposition\u00a0starts with the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.\u00a0\n\"The war crimes that were committed in Yemen have left millions of people to essentially starve to death. I think over 13 million from what I've checked,\" she said, adding that the rights of women, migrant workers and\u00a0LGBT people \u2014 along with\u00a0the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 \u2014 have led her to boycott hajj under Saudi rule.\nhajj is one of the five pillars of Islam\u00a0and\u00a0Muslims are required to perform it at least once in their lifetime. Afzal says she would like to fulfil her duty at some point, but she tells Bambury she has conditions.\u00a0\nBelow is part of that conversation.\nIt's the fact that the hajj is in Saudi Arabia that you cannot abide? \nIt's in Saudi Arabia and it is governed by the Saudi regime who benefits from the pilgrimage.\nBenefits how? \nFrom the facts and figures I've looked into, the Saudi regime brings in about $12 billion that goes toward its GDP from the hajj. I think it's the second largest industry after oil and gas.\u00a0\nWhen did this all start for you?\nI have\u00a0been following some of the political situation there and I actually started a petition a couple of years ago.\nIt didn't really go anywhere, but that was at the time that prime minister [Stephen]\u00a0Harper signed an arms deal with Saudi Arabia and then it wasn't cancelled under Trudeau.\nSo I've been keeping up to date and following this issue for a while and, I think, it's not something new for me.  How did that choice reconcile with your religious duty as a Muslim?\u00a0\nUltimately, I don't feel like I'm necessarily doing anything.\nI feel that I'm simply expressing my opinion in the hopes that there are other people who this may resonate with \u2014\u00a0whether within the Muslim community or other people who are part of a religious tradition that are trying to reconcile some fundamental tenets of their faith with their own personal beliefs or conscience.\nWhat I'm doing is nothing new, I think even within the Muslim community there is discourse on this topic.\nWere you prepared for the fallout from\u00a0that discourse, and did you think your family and friends would support you? \nWhat's interesting is that it was received, I would say, pretty well from within the community and others.\nWithin my immediate family, they're pretty progressive. They have very similar opinions to mine when it comes to the Saudi regime. I think it's some more distant, extended family members and then, possibly, some people in the wider community who do not agree with this stand, because ultimately it is a fifth pillar and I acknowledge that.\nIf the pilgrimage is governed by an independent body, I would like to go on the pilgrimage myself. I understand the sacredness of the place and the importance that it holds for Muslims.\u00a0\nOne of the reasons why this was tough for me is that I really do not want to be pigeonholed into this idea that somehow I'm pandering to an Islamophobic agenda or narrative or somehow betraying the community, because that would really hurt me.\nI am very aware of the current climate that is not very favourable to Muslims and the scapegoating that happens and the rampant Islamophobia that exists.\nHaving this kind of opinion, for me, is a way to exert personal power over a geopolitical issue like this.\nIt has nothing to do with blaming Muslims ...\u00a0It's more about personal power and doing what we can to possibly limit the benefits that the Saudi regime collects from the pilgrimage industry.\nYou said that there were, maybe,\u00a0distant relatives in your family who might not be so supportive of your position here. Let's imagine that those people are over at your house for dinner. What do you do when the subject of the hajj comes up?\nThis is actually really closely linked to the idea that, I would say, Muslims are not a monolithic community, and\u00a0there will be people who strongly believe that this is completely wrong.\nBut there are also others, like me, who reconcile their belief in the faith with not going on the hajj.

I think over 13 million from what I've checked,\" she said, adding that the rights of women, migrant workers and\u00a0LGBT people \u2014 along with\u00a0the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 \u2014 have led her to boycott hajj under Saudi rule.\nhajj is one of the five pillars of Islam\u00a0and\u00a0Muslims are required to perform it at least once in their lifetime. Afzal says she would like to fulfil her duty at some point, but she tells Bambury she has conditions.\u00a0\nBelow is part of that conversation.\nIt's the fact that the hajj is in Saudi Arabia that you cannot abide? \nIt's in Saudi Arabia and it is governed by the Saudi regime who benefits from the pilgrimage.\nBenefits how? \nFrom the facts and figures I've looked into, the Saudi regime brings in about $12 billion that goes toward its GDP from the hajj. I think it's the second largest industry after oil and gas.\u00a0\nWhen did this all start for you?\nI have\u00a0been following some of the political situation there and I actually started a petition a couple of years ago.\nIt didn't really go anywhere, but that was at the time that prime minister [Stephen]\u00a0Harper signed an arms deal with Saudi Arabia and then it wasn't cancelled under Trudeau.\nSo I've been keeping up to date and following this issue for a while and, I think, it's not something new for me.  How did that choice reconcile with your religious duty as a Muslim?\u00a0\nUltimately, I don't feel like I'm necessarily doing anything.\nI feel that I'm simply expressing my opinion in the hopes that there are other people who this may resonate with \u2014\u00a0whether within the Muslim community or other people who are part of a religious tradition that are trying to reconcile some fundamental tenets of their faith with their own personal beliefs or conscience.\nWhat I'm doing is nothing new, I think even within the Muslim community there is discourse on this topic.\nWere you prepared for the fallout from\u00a0that discourse, and did you think your family and friends would support you? \nWhat's interesting is that it was received, I would say, pretty well from within the community and others.\nWithin my immediate family, they're pretty progressive. They have very similar opinions to mine when it comes to the Saudi regime. I think it's some more distant, extended family members and then, possibly, some people in the wider community who do not agree with this stand, because ultimately it is a fifth pillar and I acknowledge that.\nIf the pilgrimage is governed by an independent body, I would like to go on the pilgrimage myself. I understand the sacredness of the place and the importance that it holds for Muslims.\u00a0\nOne of the reasons why this was tough for me is that I really do not want to be pigeonholed into this idea that somehow I'm pandering to an Islamophobic agenda or narrative or somehow betraying the community, because that would really hurt me.\nI am very aware of the current climate that is not very favourable to Muslims and the scapegoating that happens and the rampant Islamophobia that exists.\nHaving this kind of opinion, for me, is a way to exert personal power over a geopolitical issue like this.\nIt has nothing to do with blaming Muslims ...\u00a0It's more about personal power and doing what we can to possibly limit the benefits that the Saudi regime collects from the pilgrimage industry.\nYou said that there were, maybe,\u00a0distant relatives in your family who might not be so supportive of your position here. Let's imagine that those people are over at your house for dinner. What do you do when the subject of the hajj comes up?\nThis is actually really closely linked to the idea that, I would say, Muslims are not a monolithic community, and\u00a0there will be people who strongly believe that this is completely wrong.\nBut there are also others, like me, who reconcile their belief in the faith with not going on the hajj. Because, again, with the idea that Muslims are a very diverse community, you have some Muslims who maybe choose to place more importance on the ritualistic or literalist aspects of the faith.

The way they were going to do that was by bypassing expensive, big city life and starting a unique business in a small town.\nThere's a feeling in the arts community that \"either you have to move to Vancouver, Halifax, Toronto, or do it on your own,\" Kyle said. \"We said, hey let's do it on our own.\"\n\"We didn't want to go to Toronto,\" Chrissy said. \"Just so many people, such a high rate of competition.\"\nAfter attending a conference on artist-run centres in Ottawa in 2009, they realized a huge component of success in those ventures was owning your own property. Chrissy was raised in Picton, Ont.\u00a0(population 4,702) and the pair realized having an established support network in a town with a tourism sector was the perfect choice.\n\"Artists don't make a ton of money,\" Kyle said. \"Coming to Picton meant that we could buy a house for $200,000. You could never find that in Toronto.\"\nThe couple realized that they wanted to keep making art, and devised a plan to create an artist residency that would allow them to sustain their own artistic practices while running a business that would benefit other creatives at the same time.\nThat's how\u00a0Spark Box Studio\u00a0was born. The house itself is a gothic-style cottage on 1.5 acres overlooking a farmer's field and can host up to three residents at a time, each with their own bedroom and workspace. There's also a 1,000-square-foot out-building the pair has fashioned into a print studio, giving visual artists space to spread out and make to their heart's content in a\u00a0gorgeous pastoral setting.\nOn top of unbeatable real estate prices, moving to a small town opened Kyle and Chrissy up to a world of community support that enabled them to get on their feet in the first place. Prince Edward County's Economic Development office took a special interest in the pair and transformed what was originally a notebook of ideas into a 60-page business plan.\n\"You go to art school, learn about art, talk about it, cry about it, but it's rare you learn how to make a living in it,\" Kyle said.\n\"The county actually really liked the project and it fit with a bunch of community mandates they were trying to establish. They assisted us in securing funding for the first two years,\" Chrissy said. \"Just the amount of manpower they put behind us was really impressive.\"\nAs governments begin to realize the benefits of a town rich with culture, programs like this are popping up in small towns and counties all over Canada. \"Being in a small town can open up a lot of opportunities to make meaningful connections with people who can help you along the way,\" Kyle said.\nLambton County in southwestern Ontario's Creative County program also sees the value in helping creative entrepreneurs get started. Andrew Meyer has been Lambton's Corporate Cultural Officer for the past two years and it's important to him that the county is \"recognizing the increasingly important role played by culture in growing local economies and enhancing the quality of life for its residents.\"\nIn 2013, the county created the grant program as a result of its cultural plan, \"Building a Creative Economy.\" They allocate $75,000 annually to the program because they know that an investment in this sector will pay off both socially and financially. In fact, according to the Canada Council for the Arts, in 2016 there were 652,406 self-reported culture workers across the country, which brought in\u00a0over $53-million\u00a0in GDP that same year.\n\"Progressive municipalities find themselves trying to grow and prosper in a highly competitive environment, and that requires innovative thinking and changes in the traditional way of doing business for communities,\" Andrew said.\nThat break from tradition also allowed Kyle and Chrissy to nestle into the fabric of the town and lay down roots. \"You become a staple in the community,\" said Kyle, who, along with Chrissy, gives guest lectures, facilitates workshops, and mounts exhibitions of their own works, on top of their duties as residency directors to up to 70 artists per year. \"We want to teach artists that you are an entrepreneur,\" said Chrissy, who took what she learned in Spark Box's early days to create a solid business foundation for their establishment.\n\"One of the reasons we chose to start Spark Box is because we were leaving our [school] community,\" Kyle said. \"We came here and we built our own community.\" By choosing a small town to set up shop, that feeling of local fellowship is something the couple is able to focus on because their Picton price point is lower. \"We don't have to work 60 hours a week,\" Kyle said.\nAnd while they have many friends who have gone on to have successful artistic practices in big cities, the life and home they've created for themselves in Picton, surrounded by like-minded creators and farmers alike, is just what they always imagined.\n\"It's a very unique experience to have,\" Chrissy said. \"It's really fulfilling.\"\nOriginally published in December, 2018.\n"}, {"author": "Brooks DeCillia", "title": "CBC News poll: Why the economic crisis could speed up transition to renewable energy", "description": "Poll suggests Albertans support energy transition, but it\u2019s complicated", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/cbc-news-poll-energy-transition-support-1.5533036", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3318474.1586971492!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/windmills.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 16, 2020 5:00 AM MT", "2020-04-16T11:00:00.496Z"], "source": null, "content": "Editor's note:\u00a0CBC News commissioned this public opinion research before concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic mounted. About half of the total survey of 1,200 respondents was conducted before stock markets and oil prices plunged (March 2-8).\u00a0The other half of the interviews took place after this economic shock (March 9-18). Our analysis found no real difference in public opinion about energy transition between the two periods. Growing concerns about the pandemic continue to shape public attitudes.\nAs with all polls, this one is a snapshot in time. CBC News \u2014\u00a0and the public opinion experts consulted on this survey research \u2014\u00a0believe the data offers some valuable insights into Albertans'\u00a0attitudes about the economy and politics just at the moment when COVID-19 changed everything.\nThis is the fifth article to come out of this research. Read the previous articles here:\nIt was sombre. It was serious.\u00a0\nPremier Jason Kenney's televised address to Albertans last week delivered a sobering reckoning of\u00a0\"perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation\" facing the Prairie province.\nFirst \u2014 and most pressing \u2014 the health crisis sparked by the coronavirus pandemic could, in a probable scenario, see as many as 800,000 infections, and between 400 and 3,100 deaths in Alberta.\nThe economic ramifications of the infection are profound, with the most recent forecast estimating that one in four Albertans will lose their jobs and the crisis will \"permanently reshape\" the province's economy. As\u00a0Kenney has said, it could be an economic disaster equivalent to or worse than the Great Depression.\nThe International Monetary Fund's most recent estimates forecast massive global decline, and a terrible situation for energy prices \u2014 Alberta's bedrock industry.\nThe future of the industry is unclear.\nA CBC News poll, taken just before the economic implications of the coronavirus were becoming clear, suggests 79 per cent of Albertans already thought that the province should transition toward renewable energy. More than nine in 10\u00a0Albertans also think the province should do more to encourage the development of the technology sector.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd 51 per cent think that the province should transition away from oil and gas.\u00a0\nWhile support for transitioning away from oil and gas is highest in Edmonton (58 per cent), it has similar levels of support in Calgary (55 per cent). Outside the province's two major cities, only about a third of Albertans (37 per cent) support moving away from oil and gas.\nThere is general agreement that Alberta needs more renewables. Albertans are divided on whether or not to wind down the oil and gas industry.\nThe question is, how do you fix and reshape Alberta's energy-dependent economy\u00a0while looking after people caught up in the change?\nAlbertans have debated diversification for years, but there's an argument to be made that the coronavirus crisis offers an opportunity to speed up diversifying the economy and transitioning to more renewable energy sources.\nCalgary-based pollster Janet Brown has detected an increasing desire amongst Albertans to diversify Alberta's oil and gas-dependent economy over the past couple of years.\n\"Albertans don't necessarily want to abandon the oil and gas industry, but that doesn't mean they don't want to see the economy transition away from the oil and gas industry,\" said Brown, who conducted the research for CBC News.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It's about\u00a0\u2026 keeping the industries that we rely on strong, and diversifying so that in the future we're not so reliant on any single industry,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd that's key: To keep oil and gas viable in the short term, while beginning a green transition.\nEven before COVID-19,\u00a0Kenney acknowledged that Alberta \"will see a gradual shift from hydrocarbon-based energy to other forms of energy.\"\nThat said, in recent weeks, Kenney has pressured the federal government to help the province's beleaguered energy industry, recently suggesting that he anticipates significant federal support for the sector.\u00a0\nThat assistance has been expected for some time\u00a0but hasn't yet arrived.\nThe renewable energy industry, for its part, is pressuring Ottawa to stimulate the pandemic ravaged economy by investing in wind energy, hydro power and electric vehicles.\nAt the same time, hundreds of academics \u2014 including prominent Alberta scholars \u2014 recently called on the federal Liberal government to reject bailing out Canada's energy industry, and instead accelerate a green transition.\nThey stressed that\u00a0\"growing demand for climate-friendly energy sources further threatens the viability of high cost, carbon-intensive oilsands production.\"\nIn an email statement to CBC News, Kavi Bal, the senior press secretary with Alberta's Ministry of Energy, said, \"We've always acknowledged the gradual energy transition, but by all accounts, oil and gas will be needed for decades to come \u2014 not just in Alberta, but globally.\"\nIn the same statement, Bal described the academics' open-letter as \"rich,\" noting that the \"Alberta-based signatories benefit from generous salaries, in part, because of the very oil and gas that they denounce.\"\nFor decades, Albertans have talked about economic diversification and energy transition, but the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic has intensified the argument.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs Rahm Emmanuel, former U.S. president Barack Obama's first chief of staff, quipped to the Wall Street Journal, \"you never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\"\nYears ago, energy analysts debated when we'd reach \"peak oil\" or run out of the stuff.\u00a0 Recently, some analysts have wondered when the demand for Alberta's crude will dwindle, replaced by alternative \u2014 greener \u2014 sources of energy. Others study how a balance could be achieved and how the transition could occur.\nRespected Calgary-based energy economist and investment strategist Peter Tertzakian foresees demand for oil returning after social distancing ends, but a \"bruised global economy with soft oil demand is a foregone conclusion.\" \u00a0\nTravel and commuting habits, he contends, may have forever changed because of the pandemic.\nAnd Tertzakian anticipates an acceleration of the renewable energy transition.\n\"I think it's going to happen. I support it,\" he said.\n\"But that should not be confused with the idea of putting the oil and gas industry here to bed.\"\nMorgan Bazilian, a professor of public policy at the Colorado School of Mines and the director of the Payne Institute, which researches public policy on earth resources, energy and the environment, says that the collapse in oil prices and the decline in its demand triggered by the pandemic highlights the need for Alberta to diversify its economy.\nBazilian believes government stimulus packages aimed at kick starting the economy in the wake of the global pandemic need to be balanced between fossil fuels and renewable energy.\u00a0\n\"But simply saying that we will move all the stimulus money on the energy sector to change and become low-carbon right away is unlikely to be the wisest use of the\u00a0\u2026 stimulus money,\" he added.\u00a0\nThe pandemic and the economic fracture it triggered have revealed that there's no \"going back to business as usual,\" predicts\u00a0Severson-Baker, the Alberta regional director for\u00a0Pembina.\u00a0\n\"It'll be a long, slow recovery, if it ever recovers fully,\" for Alberta's energy industry, Severson-Baker added.\n\"And it'll be immediately followed by another decline in demand as a result of the world responding to the challenge of climate change.\"\nIf change is upon us, the question becomes, how to deal with change the right way.\nAcademics have studied historical energy transitions:\u00a0what worked, and what didn't. They have identified some potential roads, and some potential roadblocks, ahead.\nWriting last May in the prestigious journal Nature, several respected energy analysts, including the above mentioned\u00a0Bazilian, described four possible paths to a low-carbon future.\u00a0\nIn the first scenario \u2014 what they call the Big Green Deal \u2014 government policies, investment and global co-operation accelerate a rapid decarbonization. Governments across the world spend billions on renewable energy, and financial markets divest themselves of fossil-fuel assets, reallocating to low-carbon investments.\nIn the second imagined future \u2014 Technology Breakthrough \u2014 significant technological achievements allow renewable energy to displace fossil fuels, mitigating climate change.\u00a0\nIn the third, somewhat dystopian future \u2014 Dirty Nationalism \u2014 populist governments protect the fossil fuel industries in their jurisdictions, fragmenting the global energy market and slowing the transition to a low-carbon economy.\u00a0\nIn the final predicted future \u2014 Muddling On \u2014 the status quo persists. Fossil fuels remain the world's main energy source. Renewable energy claims a share of the energy mix as its costs decline, but not enough to mitigate climate change.\nBazilian, believes the four models still hold up even in a post-pandemic world, adding that the \"dirty nationalism\" model was most closely aligned with the pre-pandemic situation where Saudi Arabia and Russia waged war over oil prices.\nTertzakian, who has written two books about energy transition, stresses that Alberta is already transforming its energy system, pointing out that the province is moving to mothball coal-fired power plants by 2030.\u00a0\nThe long-time energy watcher supports diversifying Alberta's economy and increasing renewable energy use. But he wonders what will replace the economic benefits of the oil industry.\nCanada remains, after all, the fourth largest producer and fourth largest exporter of oil in the world. In 2018, oil and gas extraction alone accounted for more than seven per cent of Canada's total gross domestic product (GDP), and it is our largest export.\n\"The reality is that the bulk of our oil and gas, the vast majority of it is exported and used elsewhere, for which we have substantial economic activity. So merely transitioning to renewables is not going to backfill that economic activity,\" Tertzakian said.\nBazilian says it's important for any energy transition strategy to take care of the people who lose jobs in the planned switch from, for example, coal-fired power plants to renewable power, such as wind-powered turbines.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"You have to think about how it affects society from a social perspective,\" he cautioned.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe speed of change must be handled carefully as well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Pace of change could really have some very negative connotations for citizens\u00a0\u2026 the poor and the marginalized will suffer even more.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nSo how to support both change and people?\nPart of Alberta's plan to reduce its carbon emissions could begin with the existing oil and gas industry.\nThe Pembina Institute's\u00a0Severson-Baker wants the federal government to invest stimulus money in carbon capture and storage and reducing methane emissions from upstream oil and gas production.\nThe energy industry, for its part, says any federal money should also help pay for the reclamation of inactive and orphan wells, creating jobs for out-of-work oil service workers.\nTertzakian expects some of the coming stimulus spending will be directed into renewable energy, such as wind and solar, and into energy efficiency retrofits. But again, he cautions that, in the long run, it won't be enough to replace the economic activity generated by Alberta's oil and gas industry.\u00a0\u00a0\nTertzakian suggests turning to other natural resources, including forestry and agriculture.\nAlberta also has the advantage of relatively low electricity rates that could power newer industries, such as manufacturing and high-tech.\u00a0\n\"Now we have the opportunity to use what we have under our feet and around us to create an economy that is more resilient,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut when you discuss jobs, livelihoods and people, you run into political territory.\nThe CBC News Road Ahead 2020 poll found that, just as the economic impact of COVID-19 was hitting, 54 per cent of Albertans believed oil and gas companies have too much say in Alberta politics.\nSome longtime political watchers say that, even before the coronavirus crisis began, the current provincial government was out of step with Albertans' hopes for energy diversification.\n\"The government is not, I think, listening to the public on these matters,\" said Duane Bratt, the head of the department of economics, justice, and policy studies at Mount Royal University.\nTaking a closer look at the polling data, we can break down Albertans based on their attitudes toward\u00a0both types of energy transition. Almost half (48 per cent) agree with both increasing renewable energy and decreasing oil and gas production. One in three (30 per cent) support more renewables\u00a0but don't want to move away from oil and gas.\u00a0\nContrast that with only 16 per cent of Albertans who are opposed to both types of transition. And a mere two per cent who hold the curious position of wanting less oil and gas\u00a0but not wanting more renewable energy sources.\nSo, the debate isn't about whether Alberta needs more renewable energy. The argument in Albertans' minds is about the extent to which oil and gas remains a part of the province's future.\nThese divergent Alberta opinions on what exactly our next moves should be are something the provincial (and federal) government must grapple with in a post-pandemic economic reality.\u00a0\nCertainly, there are efforts already underway in Alberta to transition toward green energy.\nA spokesperson for the province's minister of energy points out that Alberta already supports renewable energy projects, such as the country's largest solar energy project near Vulcan, south of Calgary.\u00a0\nBut current circumstances could force the UCP to accelerate economic diversification and energy transition, especially if demand for Alberta oil remains soft.\u00a0\nTertzakian thinks economics will ultimately underpin politics.\nHe predicts the UCP will definitely be talking more about diversification in the expected anemic economy that follows the coronavirus.\n\"I don't think it's lost on them,\" he said.\nMethodology:\nThe CBC News\u00a0random survey of 1,200 Albertans was conducted using a hybrid method between March 2 and March 18, 2020, by Edmonton-based Trend Research under the direction of Janet Brown Opinion Research. The sample is representative along regional, age and gender factors. The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For subsets, the margin of error is larger.\nThe survey used a hybrid methodology that involved contacting survey respondents by telephone and giving them the option of completing the survey at that time, at another more convenient time, or receiving an email link and completing the survey online. Trend Research contacted people using a random list of numbers, consisting of half land lines and half cellphone numbers. Telephone numbers were dialled up to five times at five different times of day before another telephone number was added to the sample. The response rate among valid numbers (i.e. residential and personal) was 13.2 per cent.\n"}, {"author": "Michael Gorman", "title": "Union wants Northern Pulp effluent treatment plant built now", "description": "Unifor suggests construction could happen now while pipeline details are worked out", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/boat-harbour-northern-pulp-mill-environment-unifor-1.5238998", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5239004.1565200951!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jerry-dias.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 07, 2019 3:34 PM AT", "2019-08-07T19:30:00.405Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The union representing workers at the Northern Pulp mill wants the Nova Scotia government to allow the operator to start building a new effluent treatment site now and deal with the issue of a pipeline to the Northumberland Strait later.\nUnifor national president Jerry Dias was in Halifax Wednesday for the release of a report that outlines the economic impacts of the Pictou County mill and what would happen were it to shut down.\nDias also used the opportunity to call on the government to grant some permits for construction work immediately, rather than waiting for everything related to a focus report to be complete.\n\"We've run out of time and that's why we did the study, that's why we asked for even more information, so that the entire province can make a concrete decision based on the relevant, pertinent, updated facts,\" he told reporters.\nThe study comes as mill owner Paper Excellence continues work on a focus study ordered by the province. The order followed a determination in March by then-environment minister Margaret Miller that the company's application for a permit to build a new effluent treatment site next to the Abercrombie Point mill, and a pipeline that would send the treated effluent to the strait, lacked sufficient information.\nBut while the company says it's still on track to meet its submission goal of sometime in September, the Boat Harbour Act looms over everything. Passed by the government in 2015, it says the mill's current effluent treatment site at Boat Harbour is to close by Jan. 31, 2020.\nIt marked the first concrete effort by a government to close the site and address the concerns of the neighbouring Pictou Landing First Nation following successive broken promises by previous governments through the years since the mill first came to Pictou County.\nCompany officials have said without an extension to the act, the mill would be forced to shut down. In the study released Wednesday, the union pointed to numbers illustrating what that would mean in terms of potential losses in forestry-related jobs (2,679), tax revenue ($38 million), GDP and sawmill closures, along with a major contraction of the forestry industry.\nIt also highlighted the potential forestry-sector losses specifically to areas tied to the mill, such as Antigonish, Pictou, Colchester, Guysborough and Lunenburg counties and the Region of Queens Municipality.\n\"You can't have Northern Pulp close and then not have a lost industry,\" said Dias.\nThe report predicts the long-term effects of the mill closing would be a contraction of the industry and said it would take more than a decade before \"there could be industry transition that takes advantage of the forest resource as it continues to grow.\"\nSuch a prediction comes against the backdrop of plans by the government to take a new approach to the forestry industry, one with an eye toward long-term sustainability that will reduce clear cutting\u00a0but require years to complete.\nBut while the union and company continue to press for a reprieve, mounting opposition has grown to the mill's plan in the last few years, particularly the call to pipe treated effluent into the Northumberland Strait.\nMembers of Pictou Landing First Nation, fishing organizations and others have raised concerns about the environmental unknowns related to such a move. On Wednesday, Pictou Landing First Nation Chief Andrea Paul said her community expects the government to uphold its commitment in the Boat Harbour Act.\nDias, noting the technology Paper Excellence wants to use is employed at other mills in the country already, said he doesn't believe there are environmental concerns related to a pipe.\n\"If it's good enough in remote communities in British Columbia, then certainly it'll work here in Nova Scotia.\"\nBut the company has yet to satisfy environmental regulations proving that point. A spokesperson for the Environment Department said Paper Excellence is aware of the information required and it would be reviewed upon submission.\nOn Wednesday, the union and company acknowledged one study required as part of the focus report \u2014\u00a0the human health risk assessment \u2014\u00a0would take more time to complete because it begins as baseline work and then requires information gathering that can take up to two years to complete.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": "Ryan Patrick Jones", "title": "Mining boom to drive economic growth in territories beyond rest of Canada: report", "description": "The Conference Board of Canada says outlook rosy for Nunavut and Yukon, but N.W.T. in for a bumpy ride", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/territorial-outlook-summer-2019-1.5209133", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1607983.1487298028!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hi-meadowbank-truck-cp01162884.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 12, 2019 3:00 AM CT", "2019-07-12T17:10:58.771Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Economic growth in the territories will outpace the rest of Canada over the next two years, driven by the strength of the mining sector in Yukon and Nunavut, according to the latest forecast from the Conference Board of Canada.\nYukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are forecast to experience combined growth rates of 5.3 per cent in 2019 and 4.4 per cent in 2020, the independent research organization said in its summer territorial outlook, released on Wednesday.\nThat's compared with 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent across Canada's 10 provinces.\n\"The near-term outlook is actually quite positive if we combine all three territories,\" said Marie-Christine Bernard, director of forecasting for the Conference Board of Canada. \"When you have a positive environment for mining, it generally also has positive effects in other areas of the economy.\"\nBelow is a more detailed breakdown of the reports findings.\u00a0\nNunavut is expected to post the strongest growth rate at 10.3 per cent this year, along with a steady average into the near future.\nThe boom is being driven by high gold prices and a number of new and existing gold mining projects.\u00a0\nMeliadine gold mine, which opened ahead of schedule in May of this year, joins existing mines at Meadowbank and Hope Bay are anticipated to help the territory double gold production by next two years.\nNew projects including the Amaruq\u00a0satelite deposit and Back River are expected to come online in the next few years,\u00a0further contributing\u00a0to GDP growth.\n\"Very strong growth will remain in the next decade,\" said Bernard. \"Even though it's not double-digit growth, it'll still be quite strong relative to what we see outside of the territory.\"\nDespite these strong indicators, the report predicts the majority of new jobs will go to non-residents as companies bring in workers from the rest of Canada who have specialized skills.\u00a0\nAs such, the territory will miss out on much of that money being spent in the region.\nThe economic outlook for the N.W.T. continues to be bleak as the territory's diamond mines have now passed peak production and there is a shortage of replacement projects, the report says.\nTwo of the three operating diamond mines in the territory \u2014 Diavik and Gahcho Ku\u00e9 \u2014 are set to close within the next decade.\nThe third, Ekati, will continue to produce well into the 2030s so long as a planned open pit is built.\nThe focus of the industry will shift from gold mining to metals, including zinc and cobalt to make batteries for electric cars, the report said.\n\"These metal mines are kind of smaller in terms of operations and by how much value they'll add to the economy,\" said Bernard.\nA decline in diamond mining is expected to lead to a growth rate of about two\u00a0per cent for the next two years, and\u00a0become more uneven after that, including multiple years of negative growth.\nThe mining downturn will lead to job losses across a number of industries and put strain on the territorial government's finances.\nThe construction sector will be hit particularly hard \u2014 it's expected to decline by 40 per cent by 2040, the report said.\nYukon's last major mining project closed in 2018, but the negative\u00a0effect on the territory's economy isn't expected to last long.\nGrowth in Yukon is forecast to jump from 2.2 per cent this year to 10 per cent next year because of the September opening of the\u00a0Eagle gold mine.

But in order to get that funding, 65 per cent of the steel, iron,\u00a0and manufactured goods used in the projects must be produced in the United States.\u00a0And that will raise to 70 per cent in 2020.\nBecause Bombardier has contracts with U.S. cities, and because of the Buy America requirement, the company said it had \"no choice\" but to move manufacturing to the U.S. and establish \"an American manufacturing footprint and supply chain.\"\nThe result, according to Bombardier, is having to cut jobs at its Canadian plant.\n\"The problem is, [Bombardier tries]\u00a0to make it sound the reason behind the cuts is that the Americans have become more protectionist, and that's why they're losing money,\" said Ramy Elitzur, a financial analysis professor with the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\nElitzur said while U.S.\u00a0protectionist measures may have had a marginal impact on Bombardier's bottom line, the more complete picture is that the company has not been very efficient,\u00a0effective or agile in terms of strategy.\nTyler Chamberlin,\u00a0assistant professor at the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management, also questioned how much Buy America was impacting business at Bombardier.\n\"It strikes me as a little bit convenient to have that sort of answer at this time, that it's about\u00a0Buy American rules,\" he said. \"I'm\u00a0certainly not aware of any deals that have been\u00a0missed by Bombardier and handed to some American manufacturer.\"\u00a0\nAs for a larger impact on Canadian industry, Chamberlin said he just isn't seeing it.\n\"Our GDP and our export numbers aren't suffering in big ways. Can you find a case or two? Maybe you might be able to. But they're not so sizable that it's actually holding back the Canadian economy or holding back Canadian exports.\"\nBut other observers say the U.S. legislation is certainly having a significant impact on some industries in Canada. Buy America does not just apply to those in the business of selling buses or railway cars, but other U.S. government procurements\u00a0including highway\u00a0contracts and other infrastructure projects.\n\"Buy American had broader impacts than Bombardier. But its impact on Canadian exports of railway rolling stock is virtually prohibitive,\" said international trade expert Peter Clark.\n\"They tell us that effectively, they can't build up a good export base to the United States.\"\nClark agreed that\u00a0companies like Bombardier that want to bid on some U.S. contracts will have to set up shop in the U.S., and that means fewer jobs in Canada.\n\"And the American states are pretty quick to offer incentives to move your plants to the U.S.,\" he said.\nDennis Darby, CEO and president of the\u00a0Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, of which Bombardier is a member, said Buy America\u00a0is a real factor in public procurement.\n\"If they have a U.S. contract and the U.S. says you have to build a certain percentage in the U.S., the jobs have to go there.\"\nDarby said it forces companies like Bombardier and New Flyer, a Winnipeg-based bus manufacturer,\u00a0to do a large part of the assembly in the U.S.\u00a0\n\"Even though it's a\u00a0Canadian company headquartered in Winnipeg almost all of the final assembly is done in the U.S,\"\u00a0he said. \"So that is a problem.\"\nFollowing Bombardier's announcement, Canada's premiers, gathered in Saskatoon for their annual conference, called on\u00a0the federal government to\u00a0take a more active role in negotiating an exemption from Buy America.\nDarby said part of the problem is that there are no real effective reciprocal measures that Canada can employ.\n\"We have no reciprocity on this with any teeth.\u00a0Both Quebec and\u00a0Ontario can ask for up to 20 per cent of the value of rolling stock to be Canadian-made. But\u00a0that's all there is right now.\"\nDarby said Canada should have its own reciprocal Buy Canada measures, or there should be a Buy North American agreement.\n\"This is one of those areas where there is not a level playing field for companies like a Bombardier\u00a0or others that are in the transit business or anyone who is doing public procurement because the U.S. rules are much, much stronger.\"\n"}, {"author": "Peter Zimonjic", "title": "Premiers end summit saying Canadian unity is strong - with some exceptions", "description": "Between 50 and 60 per cent of Albertans support potential secession from the federation: Kenney", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/premiers-pipelines-quebec-religious-symbols-1.5208244", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5209058.1562883607!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/premiers-meeting-20190711.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 11, 2019 12:11 PM ET", "2019-07-11T22:50:48.251Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada's premiers say national unity is strong across the country and that regional leaders are working together on a number of fronts to ensure that harmony becomes even stronger.\nThe provincial and territorial premiers made the comments at the closing press conference of the two-day Council of the Federation meeting hosted by Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe in Saskatoon.\nThe two outliers among the provincial leaders were the premiers of Saskatchewan and Alberta, who maintained that frustration over political factors hampering oil development and export have increased alienation in their provinces.\n\"This is not just some random political opinion,\" Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said. \"We had at least two credible pollsters in the past three months indicate between 50 and 60 per cent support for the principle of a potential secession\u00a0from the federation.\n\"I don't think Albertans are actually ready to do that, I think they believe in this country, but that's a way that they are expressing a truly profound sense of alienation.

He said today that while he respects Legault for following through on a campaign promise to pass such a bill, he disagrees with the law itself.\n\"I think he's a fine man ... and if two men always agree, then one of them isn't doing any thinking,\" Pallister said.\n\"The people of Manitoba celebrate our diversity.\u00a0I believe our country does too.\u00a0I don't think we should hide that. My position will continue to be what it is, and perhaps the premier's will continue to be what it is as well.\"\nOther premiers said that while there were disagreements on pipelines and the religious symbols law, the provinces are working together on trade, labour mobility, immigration, climate change, health care and treatment for addictions.\n\"I don't believe the country's divided, nor do I believe we're in a situation as was described,\" said Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil. \"If you look around this table and the conversations that have happened today, it actually has been about cooperation.\"\nMcNeil said there should have been pipelines across the country decades ago but the premiers are continuing to work on things they can fix now.\nThe premiers agreed to review the exemptions they put into the interprovincial Canadian Free Trade Agreement \u2014 which took effect July 1, 2017 \u2014 with a view to removing as many as possible. Kenney announced Wednesday that his province would eliminate half\u00a0of its exemptions and would work to remove the rest.\nThey also presented a united face on a number of requests they're making of the federal government.\u00a0\nOn health care, they want the federal government to increase the annual health transfer to the provinces by 5.2 per cent per year. Transfers currently rise by either 3 per cent per year, or by the three-year average of nominal GDP growth, whichever is higher.\nThe premiers also said that they asked the federal government to work with them on the proposed federal pharmacare plan to ensure that federal funding for drugs does not hamper work the provinces are already doing.\nThe leaders also want the federal government to streamline their access to funding to mitigate natural disasters\u00a0\u2014 funding\u00a0which they said is not timely or flexible enough to cope with sudden weather events driven by climate change.\nOn Wednesday, the premiers asked the federal government to work with them to standardize professional certifications across the country,\u00a0streamline immigration rules to ensure Canada gets the skilled workers it needs and press the United States for an exemption from \"Buy American\" legislation that they said disproportionately hurts Canadian workers.\nIn a somewhat unusual move, the premiers released\u00a0copies of letters they sent to the federal party leaders asking them to outline their policies on\u00a0job and skills training, immigration, healthcare, climate change, Arctic sovereignty, reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and their commitment to federalism.\nMoe said that the responses to the premiers'\u00a0letters will be released publicly to help inform voters in advance of the coming federal election.\nNext year's Council of the Federation meeting will be hosted by Quebec from July 22 to 24.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian and U.S. economies are converging but danger lurks: Don Pittis", "description": "Poloz and Wilkins warn that markets overestimate the power of a rate-cut quick fix", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/poloz-powell-rates-economy-1.5204132", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5207418.1562794054!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bank-of-canada-20190710.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 11, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-07-11T16:01:07.313Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "On the face of it, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz and his deputy Carolyn Wilkins had some excellent news about the Canadian economy in yesterday's Monetary Policy Report.\nThe happy story included falling mortgage\u00a0rates, continued employment strength and growing business investment that have pushed Canadian economic growth rates higher in the first half of the year than almost anyone expected.\nBut as global trade threats linger, Canada's top central bankers warn that many people who should know better, including stock market investors, seem to think cuts to interest rates can solve all problems.\nIn a complex world riven by trade disputes, they say, there are simply limits to the power of central bankers to patch things up. The warnings, including hints of the possibility of a new bout of stagflation, were effectively a message that rate cuts are no easy answer for the damaging effect of\u00a0a global trade war.\n\"The underlying shock would be very bad for economic growth, it would be bad for the level\u00a0of productivity, it would be quite harmful to profitability,\" said Poloz\u00a0of a potential growing trade spat.\u00a0\"It would be a pretty significantly negative scenario.\"\nMore on that later, but first a look at why the Canadian central bank foresaw Canada's interest rates remaining steady while on the\u00a0same day U.S. central banker Jerome Powell implied in congressional testimony that U.S. interest rates were about to fall.\nWhile that sounds like\u00a0the U.S. and Canada diverging, the senior deputy governor of Canada's central bank\u00a0said at yesterday's news conference, instead it was a sign that the two economies\u00a0were growing together.\n\"In fact, it's a sign of convergence, and this is because the two countries are at different points in our economic cycles,\" said Wilkins. \"The U.S. is slowing to a more sustainable pace while Canada is moving back up to its trend growth.\"\nAt the end of last year there were signs businesses were shying away from new Canadian investments due to fears a new NAFTA would not be resolved. Even as that fear faded, the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and U.S. President Donald\u00a0Trump's threats against Mexico over immigration left a lingering feeling of caution.\nWilkins\u00a0said\u00a0resolving all those difficulties\u00a0plus renewed strength in the Canadian oil and gas sector have helped to stimulate business investment confidence.\nSigns of a return to confidence in the Canadian housing market, including five-year mortgage rates returning to levels of five years ago, mean real estate will once again be a growth stimulant rather than a drag.\nOf course, as Poloz remarked, Canadian business still has an interest rate advantage.\u00a0U.S. interest rates\u00a0at 2.5 per cent are well above Canada's 1.75 per cent.\nFutures markets foresee Canada holding interest rates steady this year while the Fed makes three quarter-point cuts. Barring other potential shocks, that would put the two rates back into sync.\nWhile business confidence and a partial return to strength in oil and\u00a0housing markets are clear drivers, the central bankers say\u00a0continued strength in new hiring is slightly more mysterious.\nWilkins says economists have had trouble working out a clear relationship between the timing of GDP growth and waves of new hiring, just one of the complexities that make looking into the economy's future a far-from-exact science.\nDespite resolution of many of the trade worries the bank has described in the past, Poloz and Wilkins say they and their advisers still believe the biggest risk for Canada's economic future remains trade. The bank's strategy for trying to address something it cannot control is to draw up two divergent scenarios.\nFor those interested, the two extreme outlooks are described in Box 2 on Page 21 of the Monetary Policy Report. And of course the gloomier\u00a0one, an all-out trade war, is the more\u00a0interesting.\nIn describing this bleaker scenario Poloz\u00a0foresees that central banks, with their single superpower of making money cheap, simply may not be equipped to deal with the repercussions. And he says it is here that stock market investors, blithely assuming lower rates will always make stocks go higher, may be mistaken.\n\"The markets are not really onto the complexity of it,\" said Poloz, describing an event where trade barriers raised the cost of imports while a falling loonie added to the effect.\u00a0\n\"In that moment you have a trade-off between a slowing economy and rising unemployment and rising inflation at the same time,\" said Poloz. \"And obviously monetary policy would not be able to buffer both of those.\"\nAll the more reason for Canadians to hope the Bank of Canada's good news scenario where \"the global economy broadly returns to pre-2017 trade arrangements, and uncertainty about future trade policy dissipates\" is the one that comes true.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Canada keeps breaking jobs records, but that could end Friday: Don Pittis", "description": "The end may be nigh.

More significantly, job creation in June will plunge to 4,000, the economists say.\u00a0\nUnemployment and job creation statistics are notoriously variable compared to some of the other figures Statistics Canada calculates. The data is based on surveys\u00a0and most economic statisticians\u00a0say we should not put too much faith in any single month's numbers.\nOf course, the economists offering their predictions to the business news service Bloomberg, as quoted above, are also wildly variable. The average job creation figure was clearly pulled down by a single gloomy prognosticator at Merrill Lynch who said the Canadian economy would lose 45,000 jobs.\nThe fact that estimates by highly paid economists can be so different is the reason why, despite a certain amount of room for error, the Statistics Canada numbers are so useful. Based on a standard sampling method used every month, they compare like with like, uncovering a relative trend even if the absolute numbers are uncertain.\nAs with a lot of data the agency generates, the trend line over time is considered more reliable, and therefore more useful, than any one month's results.\nPerhaps even more important than the absolute numbers is their interpretation. That is what Brendan Bernard, an economist at the job search company Indeed, pointed out yesterday, examining the cumulative number of people working\u00a0rather than the fluctuation in the employment rate.\n\"The prime-age employment rate \u2014\u00a0the share of Canadians age 25-54 with a job \u2014\u00a0is at an all-time high of 83.5 per cent,\" Bernard tweeted yesterday, linking to graphs and\u00a0a longer report.\nWomen were doing well. But most surprising was that despite being hurt by trouble in the fossil fuel sector and the loss of traditional manufacturing jobs in Ontario, the number of employed prime-age men was back up to pre-recession levels, and has not been higher since 1989.\nSomething special to\u00a0watch on Friday is employment for people below the age of 25, as university students tried\u00a0to find summer jobs in June.\nOne of many things the headline unemployment numbers don't tell us is whether the jobs are good enough to pay the cost of living, especially in Canada's expensive cities. As we've reported before, disappearing from the unemployment statistic does not mean you have full-time work or tell whether you feel secure in your job.\nPeople trying to find or change jobs will watch the numbers, but unemployment is also an economic indicator in its own right. While the data may be imperfect, it has the advantage of being fresh, collected within the previous month.\nFor example, yesterday's newly released trade data showing Canada sold more goods\u00a0abroad than it bought\u00a0is two months old. Last Friday's encouraging\u00a0GDP numbers were from April.\nOne of the most important economic indicators for the future of the Canadian economy comes out at the same time as the Canadian employment numbers:\u00a0the equivalent U.S. job numbers.\nAfter going through a rough patch south of the border, economists polled on the prospects for U.S. employment foresee\u00a0a sharp rise in job creation from the previous month, up from 75,000\u00a0to 163,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate expected to stick at a 50-year low of 3.6 per cent.\nIf those predictions come true despite\u00a0recent coal company bankruptcies, GM plant closures and trade talk troubles, it is an indicator that other parts of the U.S. economy remain strong, helping to provide a market for Canadian goods.\nDespite some recent economic good news, a pre-election survey commissioned by the CBC suggests Canadians remain worried.\nThat gloomy view has been repeated by various economic forecasts, including from Capital Economics\u00a0\u2014 the company that repeatedly\u00a0predicted a housing crash through much of the Canadian housing boom\u00a0\u2014 that announced it foresees a whole series of interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada, starting in October.\nPoliticians will also be watching like a hawk to see whether the job creation machine runs out of steam. Liberal incumbents will be hoping the boom continues. Although they are unlikely to mention it, some challengers probably wouldn't be horrified to see a few signs of economic weakness as the election draws closer.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Peter Armstrong", "title": "Despite a strong economy, cost of living still top of mind for Canadians", "description": "An accounting of the economic data shows that perceptions don't quite match reality", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/anxiety-cost-of-living-canada-economic-data-1.5192401", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3538321.1460752072!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canada-election.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 02, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-07-02T09:46:36.698Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of a series, called On Guard for Me: The Uneasy Canadian,\u00a0digging into the results of a CBC News-commissioned online opinion poll of 4,500 Canadians ahead of the October federal election.\nNuance is a lousy talking point.

But, he noted, \"We've seen a modest pick up in the first quarter.\"\nOn a longer scale,\u00a0the last three or four years,\u00a0Antunes said\u00a0the Canadian economy has \"done quite well.\" And while it may sometimes be hard for Canadians to see that bigger picture, economists say the country's economic\u00a0indicators are relatively strong.\n\"The aggregate economic data in Canada is looking quite strong,\" said\u00a0Frances Donald, chief economist and head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife.\u00a0\"We have plenty of jobs, wages are rising, GDP numbers are fairly solid.\"\nThat's all the more remarkable\u00a0given that much of the world is doing a lot worse.\nAnd yet\u00a0a new poll commissioned for CBC News\u00a0highlights Canadians' economic anxiety, with 32 per cent of respondents saying that\u00a0the cost of living is\u00a0the thing they are most worried about.\nWatch why some Canadians say they're worried about the cost of living:\nIn a lot of ways, that makes sense, according to Donald.\u00a0\nThe broader economy\u00a0is\u00a0performing well,\u00a0but many Canadians still struggle:\u00a0Housing affordability is still at crisis levels in Toronto and Vancouver,\u00a0energy prices remain stubbornly low,\u00a0and child-care costs weigh heavily on families.\n\"So while the data,\u00a0as a whole, still looks fairly solid,\" said\u00a0Donald,\u00a0\"it's completely understandable,\u00a0even from someone who spends all day looking at numbers,\u00a0... why consumers and households might be feeling a little bit nervous.\"\nWhat's more, concern about the cost of living ranked as the top worry for every segment of Canadians polled:\u00a0Indigenous Canadians, new Canadians, first-time voters and visible minorities.\nWhile just one in 10 Canadians say they're not getting by financially, another 68 per cent say they \"have to think about how they spend money.\" And concern over jobs ranks seventh\u00a0in terms of what worries Canadians the most.\u00a0\nIt's easy to understand where those concerns come from. Debt\u00a0levels remain high. Wages are finally beginning to rise, but growth has been stubbornly low for decades.\nStill, an honest accounting of the data shows that that negative perception doesn't quite match the economic reality.\nWhen asked to rank their top three most important election issues, a full 35 per cent\u00a0of Canadians polled listed\u00a0\"jobs/the economy.\" But Canada has been posting record job creation. The Canadian economy added 27,000 jobs in May, and\u00a0in April, a stunning 106,500 jobs were added.\u00a0In all, nearly half a million jobs were added over the past 12 months.\nWage\u00a0growth is also coming in above inflation, meaning Canadians are seeing their wages rise faster than the cost of the things we buy, from food to gasoline.\nWhat's more, many of the jobs being added are high-paying tech and financial services jobs.\n\"If you look at the period over the last decade or so, where\u00a0we've seen this kind of restructuring away from high-paid manufacturing jobs, we've seen almost as many jobs created in this [other] segment of the economy, this professional services segment,\" said Antunes.\nThe CBC poll also found that 54 per cent\u00a0of respondents worry\u00a0that accepting too many immigrants would change Canada\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but economists say that change is much needed,\u00a0specifically on the jobs front.\n\"Let's just take a look at where labour markets are today,\" said\u00a0Antunes. \"We\u00a0have an unemployment rate that's at 5.4 per cent. According to some estimates, that's as low as it can get.\"\nCanada, he said,\u00a0is essentially at \"rock bottom on the employment rate.\"\nThe Conference Board of Canada recently released a report highlighting the need for more immigration.\n\"There's no doubt about it that immigration will contribute to the\u00a0labour force,\" said Antunes.\u00a0\"When you talk to employers in many parts of this country, [they're] desperate to find skilled and less skilled workers, and immigration is going to be a big part of solving that gap.\"\nThat kind of disconnect appears throughout perceptions around\u00a0the economy\u00a0\u2014\u00a0whether it's jobs,\u00a0trade wars,\u00a0exports or oil prices. Exacerbating that is the fact that Canada isn't just one singular economy, said Donald.\u00a0Rather, it's a sort of a patchwork of regional and sector-based economies.\n\"The economy is\u00a0\u2014 and feels \u2014 different depending on which province you're in,\" she said.\u00a0\"We have the energy patch, we have urban areas that are being driven predominantly by housing activity,\u00a0and then we have other key cities and rural areas that are swayed by neither of those two factors.\"\nEconomic anxiety also becomes amplified by global oil prices and international trade tensions. Canada alone doesn't have much influence in changing those.\u00a0But both feed into the notion that the economy is struggling, no matter what the data says.\nBut if you can look past the\u00a0anecdotal evidence\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a hard feat for everyone, no doubt\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you'll find an economy performing pretty well. And in a world full of turmoil and trouble, pretty well is pretty good.\n"}, {"author": "Robson Fletcher", "title": "Why this economist says equalization reform isn't the answer if Alberta wants help during its busts", "description": "Revised fiscal stabilization program would hold most promise for the province, Bev Dahlby argues", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/fiscal-stabilization-program-reform-proposal-bev-dahlby-1.5190829", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5190901.1561574500!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bev-dahlby.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 26, 2019 12:57 PM MT", "2019-06-26T19:04:31.815Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Many Albertans have long complained that Canada's equalization system isn't there for them when their province goes through an economic bust.\nBut a University of Calgary economist says calls for reform should be focused, instead, on a lesser known federal program of wealth distribution.\n\"What Albertans should really complain about is the fiscal stabilization program, which is meant to be a form of insurance for provinces whose economies experience economic shocks,\" School of Public Policy research director Bev Dahlby\u00a0writes\u00a0in a policy paper released Wednesday.\n\"In reality, it is an insurance policy that has been designed so that it barely pays anything to Alberta.\"\nAlberta received about $250 million from the program in 2016, but Dahlby is calling for the system to be changed in a manner that would have seen the province receive roughly 10 times that amount.\nUnder the current rules, a province can apply for financial assistance if its non-resource revenues decline by more than five\u00a0per cent from one year to the next.\nPayments are also capped based on population, with a maximum of $60 per person.\nAnd assistance is not automatic; it must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the federal government.\nThis also prevents abuse of the system, which\u00a0Ottawa says is meant to apply only in what it deems to be \"extraordinary\" economic situations.\n\"The\u00a0 program compensates for year-over-year revenue declines due to economic\u00a0downturns,\u00a0not\u00a0for declines due to provincial decisions to reduce taxes,\" the Department of Finance\u00a0specifically states.\nIn other words, provinces can't sabotage their own finances\u00a0\u2014 say, by slashing taxes one year to sink their revenues enough to qualify for assistance\u00a0\u2014 and then simply expect the federal program to make up the difference.\nDahlby is calling for major reforms to the eligibility criteria and a different way of avoiding abuse.\nFor starters, he wants to see the $60-per-person cap removed and\u00a0resource revenues included in the eligibility criteria.\nInstead of making year-to-year financial comparisons, he also suggests contrasting a given fiscal year against the previous, five-year average.\nHe also wants a funding formula to be established so that assistance is automatic, rather than based on an application process.\u00a0This would \"streamline\" the process, speed up payments and avoid political controversy, he says.\nAutomatic assistance would also create the need for different safeguards against \"fiscal arson,\" he admits. But he says this could be accomplished by effectively setting \"deductibles\" and limiting coverage in such a way that would dissuade a province from \"burning down its home to collect insurance.\"\nHe proposes three possible methods to do this.\nMethod A (the least generous of his proposals) would include a five-per-cent \"deductible\" and a 50-per-cent coverage rate for losses beyond that deductible.\n\"In other words,\" Dahlby writes, \"only reductions in annual own-source revenues in excess of five per cent of the average own-source revenue over the previous five years would be eligible for a payment and only 50 per cent of that would be covered.\"\nMethod B would also include a five-per-cent deductible, but with a 75-per-cent coverage rate.\nAnd Method C would have a lower deductible\u00a0\u2014 just three per cent \u2014 along with a lower coverage rate of 66 per cent.\nDahlby calculates these methods would have resulted in much more financial support for Alberta during its recent economic downturn.\nRemember: the province received roughly $250 million under the current fiscal stabilization program in 2016.\nUnder Dahlby's proposals,\u00a0Alberta would have received $2.1 billion under Method A, $3.1 billion under Method B or $3.2 billion under Method C.\nThe following year, it would have received even more: between $2.8 billion and $4.2 billion, depending on the calculation method.\nProvinces like Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador, which also experience booms and busts related to the prices of oil and gas, would also receive more federal funds during downturns under this approach, Dahlby notes.\nHe suggests such a system would be a more effective \"insurance policy\" for provinces that rely heavily on volatile natural-resource markets and, as such, their lobbying efforts would be better directed at reforming the\u00a0stabilization program than Canada's system of equalization payments.\n\"While it is true that the equalization program needs reform, that program was never meant to help a province such as Alberta, where GDP per capita and household incomes are above the national average, even in times when its economy shrinks,\" he writes.\n\"Alberta and the other resource-rich provinces should also pressure the federal government to reform the fiscal stabilization program in order to address their concerns about the lack of federal support in the wake of the downturn in the oil and gas sector.\"\nDahlby also sits on the expert panel appointed by Premier Jason Kenney that is tasked with offering advice to the Alberta government on how to balance its budget without raising taxes.\n"}, {"author": "Brandie Weikle", "title": "Canada and California sign deal to cut vehicle emissions", "description":

"source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada's federal government has signed an agreement with California to further reduce vehicle emissions.\nEnvironment Minister Catherine McKenna announced Wednesday that the two governments will work together on regulations to cut greenhouse gases from vehicles and promote the use of cleaner-running vehicles.\nMcKenna announced the agreement with California Gov.\u00a0Gavin Newsom, and signed the memo of understanding with the chair of the California Air Resources Board, Mary Nichols.\nCalifornia has pioneered low-carbon fuel standards in the United States, and Canada is aiming to cut emissions by 30 million tonnes by 2030, the equivalent to taking seven million cars off the road.\n\"As the world's fifth-largest economy and a global leader in clean transportation, California is a leading example of how climate action can be good for people, the environment and the economy,\" said McKenna in a statement.\u00a0\n\"We look forward to working with California to fight climate change, keep the air clean and give drivers better options for cleaner, more affordable vehicles.\"\nUnder current regulations, by 2025 new model light-duty vehicles are expected to burn as much as 50 per cent less\u00a0fuel and emit half the volume of greenhouse\u00a0gasses compared with vehicles built in 2008.\nDuring a teleconference with media Wednesday, McKenna said the agreement with California will do three main things:\nCalifornia is suing the U.S. federal government after President Donald Trump moved last summer to no longer allow California to set its own standards for tailpipe emissions.\nTrump is enacting that change at the same time as he is rolling back standards set under his predecessor Barack Obama that would have required the efficiency of gasoline-powered vehicles to improve each year through 2025.\nCanada has aligned with the United States on tailpipe emissions standards for more than two decades and signed on to the 2012 version set by Obama.\nAfter Trump moved to lower those standards last summer, Canada said it was reviewing its plan and wouldn't commit to maintaining parity with the U.S. any longer.\nMcKenna said that in the past, Canada harmonized its vehicle emission manufacturing standards with the U.S., but now \"it looks like there will be two standards in the U.S.\"\nShe said \"that's not anybody's first choice,\" but the two countries couldn't meet their emissions targets without aggressive action on vehicle pollution.\nDuring the teleconference with McKenna, Newsom said the reduction of greenhouse gases is \"essential to our economic growth and prosperity.\" He said\u00a0the state has out-performed\u00a0the rest of the U.S. in GDP growth for the past five years.\n\"For us, these vehicle emissions standards are fundamental and critical to reaching our goals.\"\nAsked what he had to say to conservative politicians who oppose firm action on climate change, Newsom issued an invitation.\n\"If you want to see if climate change is real, come to California. See what we've just come through in the past few years,\" he said, citing wildfires that claimed dozens of lives and caused record property damage.\n\"Something big is happening. Mother Nature has joined the conversation.\"\nThe announcement was met with apprehension\u00a0from the auto industry, who voiced concern about the implications of manufacturing vehicles to two different emissions standards.\nMark Nantais, president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, said that if Canada were to formally part ways with the U.S. on vehicle standards, it would create\u00a0\"all kinds of inefficiencies in a market that's a highly integrated market to begin with.\"\u00a0\n\"Over two years now, we've worked very hard to strike an agreement on a North American free trade agreement that supports the integrated economies,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"Canada, in our view, needs to ensure that national standards\u00a0\u2026 for light-duty vehicles remain aligned with the United States, which enable\u00a0us to deliver vehicles to Canadian consumers ... with continued environmental improvements, but at an affordable cost.\"\u00a0\nSimilarly, the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association said the\u00a0announcement \"runs counter to the benefits of single national standard with the United States.\"\n\"Moves away from a harmonized approach will hinder choice and increase costs for Canadian consumers,\" said spokesperson\u00a0Huw Williams.\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Dan Healing", "title": "Canadian agriculture is using more energy \u2014 but more efficiently, too", "description": "Productivity gains outpace steep rise in agricultural energy use since 1990", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/agricultural-energy-productivity-gains-1.5186950", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3842525.1478644927!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/combine-harvesting-barley.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 23, 2019 1:01 PM MT", "2019-06-24T13:50:20.453Z"], "source": null, "content": "Third-generation farmer Ron Lamb remembers his father pulling six-metre-wide crop-seeding equipment around his southern Alberta grain fields in the 1990s, overlapping on each pass to make sure he covered all the ground.\n\"When my dad was seeding the soil, he was using a 20-foot-wide piece of machinery and he was eyeballing or judging how much overlap on each pass across the ground so he didn't miss.

As set out in the party's 2015 platform, a\u00a0Mulcair government would have increased the corporate tax rate by two points, from 15 to 17 per cent. That\u00a0NDP also promised to close the tax loophole on stock options \u2014 an issue the Trudeau government partially addressed\u00a0earlier this year.\nBut the former NDP leader scoffed at raising\u00a0taxes on the wealthiest Canadians, as Trudeau eventually did. \"Several provinces are now at the 50 per cent rate,\" Mulcair\u00a0said in 2013.\u00a0\"Beyond that, you're not talking taxation; you're talking confiscation. And that is never going to be part of my policies, going after more individual taxes. Period. Full stop.\"\nMulcair worried that any increase in personal taxes would tarnish his\u00a0party's brand.

Singh's NDP\u00a0is promising to have a national pharmacare system up and running by 2020, and to then add dental care and seniors care to the Canada Health Act, while also funding eye, hearing and mental health care.\nIn 2015, the NDP promised to build 10,000 new affordable housing units. Singh's NDP\u00a0is vowing to build 500,000 spaces over 10 years.\nIn 2019, there are also aspirational goals of free post-secondary education and free public transit. And a Singh government would fund a basic income pilot project, while also\u00a0increasing\u00a0funding for child care by $1 billion per year.\nThere are promises of nearly a dozen national strategies, covering everything from aerospace to freshwater to food waste.\nLearn more about the NDP's\u00a0recently unveiled platform:\nBut the boldness isn't limited to new social programs:\u00a0Singh's NDP would decriminalize all drugs, and they'd lower the voting age to 16.\nAs for balancing the budget, the NDP isn't particularly worried about it.\n\"Our fiscal approach ensures that Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio falls over our 10-year fiscal horizon,\" the party explains, giving itself significant leeway to increase the federal deficit in the short term.\nTimes, of course, have changed.\nIn 2015, the NDP was the Official Opposition and competitive in the national polls.\u00a0Going into that year's campaign, it even held a small lead over both the Conservatives and Liberals. The greatest risk might have seemed to be that the party would scare off potential voters\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that the increasingly real prospect of an NDP government would cause swing voters to have second thoughts.\nSo the NDP struck a reassuring tone, while promoting Mulcair as a more serious,\u00a0experienced leader than Trudeau.\nFour years later, the NDP\u00a0have neither the political nor the policy room to play it safe.\nWhile surely not to the satisfaction of all progressive activists, the Trudeau government has, in several ways, acted as a moderate NDP government might. And the real NDP has fallen back to a distant third in national polls. After the historic breakthrough of his election as NDP leader, Singh has largely failed to generate any significant excitement.\nThe NDP currently sits\u00a0at 15 per cent and is facing the potential for significant losses in the fall election. Fundraising returns are weak. And\u00a0worse, Elizabeth May's Greens are suddenly not far behind.\nThe clearest\u00a0available path back to relevance involves being interesting\u00a0\u2014 with an eye to voters who might wish the Liberals had done more on various fronts and with a mind to ensuring those progressive voters don't move to the Greens.\nFor certain segments of the NDP's membership, this is no doubt preferable to the 2015 approach. And for certain segments of the public, this might seem like an exciting break from the status quo.\nThe risk for the NDP\u00a0in being more interesting\u00a0is that\u00a0the party may seem less credible. The Liberals have already begun to needle the New Democrats for having great ideas, but no real plan to make any of it happen.\nWhat the NDP\u00a0platform lacked on Sunday was anything that looked like a full costing. That is apparently in the works, with plans to submit proposals to the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer for an independent review.\nEven if the PBO finds that the party's numbers add up, those numbers will\u00a0surely be big. And big numbers are often hard to carry around.\nBut whether borne out of circumstance or ideological inclination, this is what the NDP needs to be right now.\n"}, {"author": "Paul Withers", "title": "Despite labour shortages, Nova Scotia's ocean tech sector is booming", "description": "'The bottleneck is labour, has been for years.

That can help determine impact on marine life.\n\"Basically, everything you see other than the float itself, this piece of foam was either supplied by a local company, manufactured by a local company or produced or assembled by a local company,\" said\u00a0Moloney.\nJASCO used 22 Nova Scotia companies, many based in Burnside \u2014 to produce the Kitimat observer buoy. Electronics, pressure housing and\u00a0connection cables were among the elements sourced locally.\nMoloney\u00a0said his company produces equipment for up to 30 projects per year and relies on the local supply chain each time.\n\"We're probably in the order of about a $10-million company,\" he said. The company has 45 employees.\nHe said the projects likely produce up to $6 million per year for local suppliers.\nMoloney said the industry's reach was on display recently at Woods Hole, Mass., home to one of the world's leading oceanographic research stations.\n\"I was looking at \u2026 a billion dollars of equipment sitting on their base shop floor waiting to go out the door and most of the sensor systems that were on those moorings came from Atlantic Canada, from Canadian companies,\" he said.\n\"This has international impact. We are doing projects all around the globe, on every continent, in every ocean.\"\nEighty per cent of Nova Scotia's ocean tech products are exported.\nTechtronics Machine Works of Musquodoboit Harbour is one of the 22 suppliers used in JASCO's observer buoy project.\nThe company and a related business \u2014 Velocity Machining and Welding in Burnside \u2014 produce\u00a0a variety of subsea instrumentation housings made of plastics, steel, titanium alloys and other materials. They are installed on cameras and remotely operated vehicles.\n\"For Techtronics, it's a big piece of our business,\"\u00a0said\u00a0co-owner Sean MacPhee. \"We manufacture products that we don't ship all over the world, but they end up there through our customers in Nova Scotia.\"\nThe company's biggest challenge is a skilled labour shortage. MacPhee said Velocity is doubling its footprint to\u00a020,000 square feet.\n\"The bottleneck is labour, has been for years,\" he said.\u00a0\"But it's much worse now than it's ever been.\"\nBetween Techtronics and Velocity, the two businesses have about 60 employees.\nMacPhee wants the province's community college to produce more machinists, saying government knows the industry will need 400 machinists over the next decade, but only eight\u00a0to 12 are graduating each year.\nStatistics\u00a0Canada does not measure ocean technology as a separate sector.\u00a0The Nova Scotia government said\u00a0it's made up of 80 core companies.\nThe sector primarily works for defence, oil and gas, fisheries, aquaculture and marine renewable energy companies.\nThe province said\u00a0\"ocean related\" industries generate $4.5 billion \u2014 or 12.2 per cent\u00a0of provincial GDP\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but that does not break down how much is from the high-innovation ocean tech sector.\nEmployment numbers\u00a0haven't been defined either.\nMost ocean tech companies are small and medium-size\u00a0businesses.\nWhat is clear is the sector is growing.\nPaul Yeatman, chair of the Ocean Technology Council of Nova Scotia, said\u00a0growth is being driven by defence, oil and gas, and\u00a0stricter environmental monitoring rules.\nOn the defence side, the focus is on anti-submarine warfare.\nIn 2017, Canada set aside $133 million for research with a focus on sovereignty in the Arctic.\nCanada's five year \"all domain situational awareness\" program includes monitoring subsurface and Maritime traffic in or approaching Canada's North.\nGovernments everywhere are also requiring more environmental monitoring, said\u00a0Yeatman.\n\"The European Union, for example, put out an edict that everyone had to monitor their coastal waters,\" he said.\u00a0\"It's not a wishful thing, it's a must do. And so, they're monitoring. So, where are they going to get their equipment from? A lot of it's coming out of Nova Scotia.\"\nIn his day job,\u00a0Yeatman is president of GeoSpectrum\u00a0Technologies, another Burnside-based acoustics specialist.\nHe said the\u00a0firm is also flourishing and has\u00a0a growth rate of 30 per cent per year, but is also struggling to find people.\nGrowing demand has prompted companies in the supply chain to co-operate to tackle big projects.\n\"We have some companies that are suppliers here that support us and we also supply to them,\" said Yeatman.\u00a0\"It depends on the project\u00a0and the skill sets.\"\nHe said\u00a0almost any product his company may require can be supplied locally.\n\"That's pretty impressive,\" said Yeatman.\n"}, {"author": "Susan Bradley", "title": "Two more months of traffic pain until CN finishes rail bridge replacement", "description": "Local councillor says while project is on schedule, police are ticketing for 'dumb driving behaviour'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/quinpool-road-schedule-bridge-replacement-1.5173791", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5174011.1560445702!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/equipment-and-workers-at-the-construction-site-on-quinpool-road-halifax.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 14, 2019 6:00 AM AT", "2019-06-14T09:00:00.387Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The replacement of the CN Rail\u00a0bridge on Quinpool Road\u00a0is at the halfway mark. For commuters, it means about two more months of disruption.\nThe closure of Quinpool Road from the Armdale Roundabout to Connaught Avenue has put tremendous pressure on Chebucto Road and shortened the tempers of those affected.\nBut District 9 Coun. Shawn Cleary says work is going well\u00a0and should be done by mid-August.\n\"They're on schedule,\" he said. \"The first couple of weeks was Halifax Water.\u00a0So with the bridge, the reinforcement of the arch, the Halifax Water pipes that used to be inside the bridge can no longer be inside the bridge, there's\u00a0not enough room.\"\nA separate bridge to carry the water pipes over the railway cut was built and CN was able to begin its work, he said.\n\"Then\u00a0CN\u00a0came in and they started excavating because they had\u00a0to go right down to the masonry arch. They\u00a0had to reinforce and waterproof the arch and now \u2026 the concrete is curing and so they'll be hopefully at a point soon where they can start rebuilding it back up,\" Cleary said.\nHe said the target date for completion is mid-August and and he's been notified that work is on schedule.\nRainy weather has helped, not hindered, the project.\n\"Concrete, as long as it's hard,\u00a0doesn't mind the rain. Actually, sunshine is a bad thing for concrete when it's curing, you don't want it\u00a0to cure too quickly. Things are progressing. I see lots of equipment, lots of workers on site.\"\nIt's not the first time the\u00a0Halifax West Armdale\u00a0councillor and his\u00a0constituents had to cope with closed roads and upheaval due to a massive construction project.\nIn 2017, a stretch of the St. Margarets Bay Road\u00a0between Douglas Drive and Quarry Road was closed to through traffic from mid-July to the end of November.\nEven though traffic on Quinpool past Connaught is restricted to local residents, drivers are using side streets to weave their way to Chebucto in order to exit the peninsula, Cleary said. As a result, there are complaints from residents.\n\"We've had police every day in here patrolling, actually both on the north side and the south side of Quinpool, and they've had days where they've given out 15 to 20 tickets because people are rolling through stop signs,\" Cleary said.\n\"People are doing dangerous things like coming up outside of their lane to try and make a turn ahead of the rest of the traffic. And so the police have been very active.\"\nThe streets most affected\u00a0\u2014 MacDonald, Quinn and Churchill\u00a0\u2014 are coping with sharply increased\u00a0amounts of traffic.\n\"There are [13,500] vehicles coming up Quinpool every morning, and Armview used to see over 2,000 go down there. And so we know the traffic has increased through MacDonald and Quinn and Churchill,\u00a0certainly not to that extent.\"\nSome changes have been made on those streets. A yield sign on Churchill has been changed to a stop sign and Blink Bonnie Terrance has been closed off where the street meets MacDonald.\nFour speed bumps have been added to MacDonald. But that was due to a traffic study last year that found about 85 per cent of drivers were going too fast on the road that connects Quinpool and Chebucto.\n\"But when it's gridlock, it's not the speed that is the issue. It is the people's aggressive driving tendencies. Thankfully, [there's been] no major incidents, a lot of close calls and those kind of things. The police, as I said, have given a lot of tickets for dumb driving behaviour.\"\nHalifax police said there has not been a spike in the number of collisions since the construction work began.\u00a0\n\"The number of motor-vehicle collisions in the Armdale Roundabout, Chebucto Road and Connaught for April-May 2018 was zero and for April-May 2019 was one,\" Const. John MacLeod said in an email Thursday.\nThe length of time for this particular project has rankled Halifax residents. One local structural engineer said\u00a0CN could have used\u00a0a prefabricated structure to replace, rather than repair, the bridge. That could have cut construction time to one month from more than four.\nCleary\u00a0said the municipality had no control over the means and length of the work.\n\"The city has no authority to dictate how CN rebuilds their bridge. It's their bridge, their land. But the major concern, of course, for CN and the entire city and region is the economic impact that the rail has,\" he said.\n\"And so any project that would see them\u00a0come in with equipment, tear it down and rebuild it say over a week or even several weeks would necessitate the closure of the rail. Now that means that the port would have to close because they can't move product and the port is almost $2 billion in annual GDP for the city and 15,000 jobs.\"\nNeither the city nor CN was willing to risk having shippers move their business to another\u00a0port, Cleary said.\nAttempts by CBC to obtain a comment from CN about the project were not successful.\n"}, {"author": "Drew Anderson", "title": "The anger is real, but is western separatism?", "description": "There's no denying the anger in the west, but quantifying what that means for Confederation isn't so easy", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-separatism-anger-election-trudeau-1.5336196", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5333035.1573582673!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/republic-of-western-canada-passport.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 28, 2019 5:30 AM MT", "2019-10-28T16:55:30.431Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Let's see if you've heard this one before: there's a Trudeau in the Prime Minister's Office and he's angered\u00a0a lot of Albertans and the oilpatch. Alienation and resentment fester, triggering separatist sentiment.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking it's 1980 and not 2019.\nIn 1980, there were no Liberal MPs from Alberta, Saskatchewan or B.C. in Ottawa, and a separatist actually won a provincial seat in an Alberta byelection (but lost it within months).\nSince last week's federal election returned Justin Trudeau's Liberals to power, with no seats in Alberta and Saskatchewan, the anger in Alberta seems to have climbed from its already considerable heights. Western separatism is again being bandied about.\nIt may not even be at the tepid levels of support that it had in the early '80s, but it's not just relegated to the fringes of the fringes of the internet these days.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut how substantial, or how real, are those sentiments, and what does that mean for Alberta, the West and Confederation?\u00a0\nIt's hard to quantify whether online venting is a real thing that could transform into Albertans actually wanting to break away from the rest of Canada.\u00a0 Still, there's no doubting the animosity and impatience\u00a0Albertans have for Ottawa these days.\u00a0\nOne thing that is not up for debate is there is real anger in Alberta.\u00a0\nMany in the heart of Canada's stubbornly sluggish energy economy feel \u2014 justly or not \u2014 that the federal government has been actively undermining the industry Alberta is so dependent on.\n\"There's definite concern, anger, frustration coming from even people who I would describe as real moderates,\" said Monte Solberg, a former Conservative cabinet minister\u00a0and current principal of New West Public Affairs.\u00a0\n\"Because they see things like this tanker ban on one coast but not on the other and start to wonder: 'Well, what has Alberta done to deserve being targeted by its own federal government to\u00a0essentially shut down its oil and gas economy?'\"\nThe list of grievances is long:\u00a0There's new legislation on environmental reviews of large industrial projects like pipelines, which Alberta Premier Jason Kenney calls the \"no-more-pipelines act;\" there's the aforementioned tanker ban on the northern West Coast; and there's also frustration with equalization payments that some Albertans feel are too high (due, it should be noted, to our higher earnings.)\nA fiscal stabilization fund that funnels money into provinces when their GDP nosedives is out of date and provided a relative pittance when the price of oil cratered.\u00a0\nThen, there's the dreaded carbon tax.\u00a0\nFor weeks this past winter, angry protestors in yellow safety vests lined the byways and highways of the Prairies demonstrating against\u00a0a laundry list of grievances ranging from the carbon tax to immigration.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the recent federal election, that all added up to a giant blue swath washing over Alberta and Saskatchewan, with almost 70 per cent of Albertans voting Conservative.\u00a0\nBut would the anger subside if our bellies were full?\n\"Historically, the sentiment is always strongest when the economy is down,\" said Solberg. \"But it's not just about the economy. It's about when the government does something that interferes with the economy and causes this to happen.\"\nIt's a volatile situation that requires deft hands.\u00a0\nKenney says he's an avowed federalist. A longtime Calgary MP who was at the cabinet table when the current equalization formula was developed under prime minister Stephen Harper, he says he wants to find solutions that help Alberta and calls separation \"irrational.\"\nBut there is that whole negotiation thing.\u2026\nKenney plans to barrel ahead with a referendum on equalization, which he said will provide leverage when negotiating with Ottawa.\u00a0\nHe also said last week that he'll appoint a panel to talk to Albertans \u2014 including those with separatist views \u2014 about the province's place in the federation.\u00a0\n\"There's two approaches that leaders can take in an environment like this in Alberta today,\" he said about the panel consultations.\n\"One would be to dismiss and ridicule the sentiment of frustration that is palpable and refuse to listen to those people. That is the worst mistake possible that would just, I think, create even more frustration. The other alternative done is to actually listen to people and respect what they have to say. And I think that is the much wiser approach.\"\nMelanee Thomas, a political scientist at the University of Calgary, doesn't think the premier is doing the province any favours by playing to separatist sentiments. She thinks he's using it to his political advantage.\n\"Who's the person who's speaking most about western separatism and especially 'if we don't get a fair deal, we're going to have a referendum on equalization,\u00a0and we should just leave,'\" she said.\u00a0\n\"This is an elite-driven narrative. I mean, I'm looking at Jason Kenney.\"\nAnd there is a political advantage to whipping up anger. Angry voters are motivated voters.\u00a0 Kenney and the UCP arguably rode a wave of anger into office in April, capturing a massive majority government over the incumbent NDP.\nKenney isn't the first Alberta premier to navigate western anger and alienation. Peter Lougheed plied those same waters in 1980 and used similar language to Kenney.\n\"I don't think that people in Western Canada want to separate,\" Lougheed\u00a0told CBC News in October 1980. \"They want to be a part of the mainstream of Canadian life.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBut Lougheed\u00a0said Albertans had \"a great deal to complain about, and they're justified complaints.\"\nSolberg points to Preston Manning and his Reform Party as an example of channeling western rage into something constructive for Alberta.\u00a0\n\"It can be used, you know, to to get things for the province and get a fair shake and consideration, but it does have to be handled with care,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"You know, if there was sort of an articulate spokesperson for western separation or for Alberta separation, it would be that much more tricky to handle.\"\nSo far, that articulate voice, or real support behind any kind of separatist movement, hasn't materialized.\u00a0\nJay Hill \u2014 a former Conservative cabinet minister first elected as a Reform MP \u2014 has gone full-throttle western separatist.\u00a0\n\"I believe the first step is to hold a referendum and let the people themselves decide once they know all of the ramifications. There's lots of reasons to be afraid of this as there is to leaving an abusive relationship and seeking a divorce,\" he said.\n\"You know it's not unlike that type of situation, but people reach that point where that's the only viable option no matter what the cost is both financial and emotional.\"\nThere's no doubt there would be costs, and lots of details to sort out if Alberta were to separate (with Saskatchewan and others or not). Trade deals, landlocking the province's resources, First Nations land, Crown land, the province's share of the federal debt, and, and, and, and, and.\u00a0\nStill, Hill and others like him think despite the \"myriad hurdles, challenges and difficulties\" involved in separation, it's the only choice.\u00a0\nHe also thinks there will be enough support, if the discussion takes place in a meaningful way, for a referendum to pass.\u00a0\nThe numbers, so far, don't support his claim.\u00a0\nJust prior to the election, polling firm ThinkHQ conducted a survey\u00a0on separatist sentiment in Alberta.\u00a0\nIt found 23 per cent of Albertans would vote to secede from Canada \u2014 a number that dropped to 16 per cent in Edmonton.\u00a0\nThat's despite 71 per cent of respondents saying they believe the current federal government has hurt the province.\u00a0\nThe poll was conducted online using a random stratified sample of panellists between Oct. 4 and 7.\u00a0The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of this size is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.\nIn many ways, that anger is manifesting in online memes and angry Twitter tirades, but the real test of a movement's strength is whether it can transform that online push into real-life action (or prove the proponents are real-life people).\u00a0\nTo that end, the Wexit movement is planning to host rallies next month in Red Deer, Edmonton and Calgary. CBC News reached out to Wexit leader Peter Downing but did not hear back.\u00a0\nHill doesn't think the result would be the same after Trudeau's re-election, and ThinkHQ warned another Trudeau victory could exacerbate feelings of alienation.\u00a0\nBut pollster Janet Brown, who was not involved with ThinkHQs poll, thinks the separatist sentiment is overplayed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Well, I think the frustration is real and the sense of alienation is real. I don't know that there's too many Albertans who really are looking at separatism as a real sort of tangible sensible idea,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"But I think when people talk about separation, it's not because they actually want to separate, it's just an expression of frustration.\"\nBrown says Kenney has no choice but to acknowledge the anger in the province\nSome muse that Alberta should follow the same path as Quebec, stoking nationalism and watching threats of separatism ebb and flow in order to get more out of Confederation, but there's no guarantee that works\u00a0or can be contained.\nThe dust is still settling from a bellicose federal campaign that saw Kenney stumping for the losing Conservatives.\u00a0\nRegional wounds are real, particularly in Quebec with its resurgent Bloc Quebecois, in Alberta and in Saskatchewan.\nThere's still a Trudeau in office, which for people like Hill is a problem in and of itself. And despite the highest wages in the country and a healthy GDP, Alberta still feels left behind and unable to get its main product to market.\u00a0\nProportional representation would even out some of the regional voting blocks, but that's not on the table since Trudeau trampled on the promise of electoral reform after his first election win in 2015.\nUniversity of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe suggests a focus on removing internal trade barriers, restrictions on labour mobility within Canada and improving federal transfer payments would help heal regional divides.\u00a0\nIn a recent column for CBC News, he noted a recent Environics poll found 71 per cent of Albertans feel the province is not treated with the respect it deserves in Canada.\u00a0\nAnd at least there are conversations taking place.\u00a0\n\"The good news is that\u00a0\u2026 there was sort of an opening between the feds and the provincial government,\" said Solberg.\u00a0\n\"And maybe an openness to work together to try and address some of the economic problems that Albertans are concerned about.\"\nIt won't be enough to quell feelings of western alienation. Short of a massive transfer of population out of Ontario and into Alberta, it's hard to see what would. Senate reform, maybe?\nWestern rage seems embedded in Confederation, but the caution is it's now tinged with a contemporary, digitally amplified populism.\u00a0\n\"So what's underlying the anger? It's fear and it's anxiety, and when people are sort of backed into a corner, when they feel their livelihoods are at stake, when they feel their future's at stake, I mean they don't always act in rational ways,\" said Brown.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"And you just have to look at what's happening in Britain right now with Brexit. You know, people who don't take this Wexit thing seriously\u00a0do so at their peril.

Cecil Merritt, the former\u00a0parliamentarian who as commander of the South Saskatchewan Regiment in the disastrous Dieppe raid, had\u00a0won the Victoria Cross.\nMany historians credit the raid with teaching Allies valuable lessons ahead of D-Day.\nTrump quoted from Franklin Roosevelt and French President Emmanuel Macron read from a letter belonging to a French resistance fighter.\nPaired with swing music, interviews with surviving veterans and a recording of Winston Churchill's wartime speech, it was all deeply nostalgic and harkened back to a time when everyone marched and even perhaps danced to the same beat.\nThe invasion of Hitler's 'fortress Europe' was not merely an extraordinary feat of arms, logistics and military planning. It was also a remarkable political achievement \u2014 one that has prompted historians and pundits over the decades to wonder whether it could ever be repeated.\nTo be sure, the allies were a rancorous lot in 1944,\u00a0with Russian dictator\u00a0Joseph Stalin's distrust of\u00a0the western democracies and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt's disdain for France's Charles DeGaulle.\nWhat united them were common enemies.\nMarc Milner, director of the Gregg Centre for the Study of War at the University of New Brunswick, said we've seen flashes of that kind of unity during the interceding decades, notably in the first Gulf War against Iraq's Saddam Hussein.\n\"So yes, I suspect we could do something similar to D-Day again,\" said Milner, offering the caveat that nations would have to be properly\u00a0galvanized into action.\nWhat we likely won't see again, he said,\u00a0is another\u00a0total industrial war.\n\"The likelihood of an all-out and prolonged conventional war with mass mobilization of people and industry is, however, unlikely in the nuclear age,\" Milner said.\n\"In modern total war, our role is largely passive. We can stay at home and watch the missiles coming in on our TVs.\"\nWhen the Allies planned D-Day, they had to invent and negotiate many of the structures and procedures necessary to carry out the invasion.\nThat kind of co-operation still exists in the \"well-developed military structure\" that is NATO, said Walter Dorn, a professor of defence studies at the Royal Military College of Canada.\nIt's an institution that allies can plug into for major deployments and would make it easier today to politically organize a major multinational campaign.\nBut since the end of the Cold War, NATO has expanded to include 29 members with disparate interests. Many NATO partners\u00a0squabble\u00a0over both the alliance's\u00a0decision-making process and the cost of maintaining the military alliance.\nTrump has openly mused about pulling the U.S. out of NATO unless Allies continue to increase their defence spending, demanding that more of them meet the two per cent of GDP\u00a0target that has become the alliance's benchmark.\nDorn said political paralysis in domestic decision-making would make another D-Day difficult to stage these days.\nHe pointed to the unfulfilled peacekeeping promises made to the United Nations by the current Liberal government.\n\"The painfully slow progress of Canada to live up to its UN commitments in peacekeeping does make me wonder how fast the Canadian government could mobilize to meet other commitments, particularly ones involving high risk,\" he said \u00a0\n\"The Trudeau government has avoided risky commitments in peacekeeping and has left the heavy lifting to others.\u00a0So in the case of a major outbreak of conflict, one would have to wonder how quick and dependable Canada would be.\"\nStill, Canada proved to be a stalwart ally in Afghanistan and has taken leadership positions in both NATO's Iraq training mission and the Baltics, commanding a battle group there intended to deter Russian aggression.\nAlthough both missions are risky, they represent safe political choices at a time when western democracies are unwilling to tolerate the casualties associated with modern conflicts.\nAnd\u00a0that \u2014 perhaps more than political and trade differences \u2014 would make another D-Day an unlikely proposition.\n"}, {"author": "Priscilla Hwang", "title": "Gov't wants to 'evolve' N.W.T.'s small manufacturing sector with new strategy", "description": "Hopes to grow number of local manufacturers, increase their sales by 25% over 3 years", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-manufacturer-policy-strategy-1.5160202", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5160462.1559587638!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ism-manufacturing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 03, 2019 3:00 PM CT", "2019-06-03T23:42:09.157Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Northwest Territories government is thinking about changing how it defines\u00a0N.W.T. manufacturing, and\u00a0wants to increase the number of local manufacturers and grow their sales.\nIndustry, Tourism and Investment Minister Wally Schumann announced the government's new 17-action strategy to expand and \"evolve\" the manufacturing sector\u00a0on Monday in Hay River.\nThe strategy targeting the territory's small manufacturing sector is a first for the government.\nUp until Monday morning, there were 12 manufacturers registered under its\u00a0Northern Manufactured Products Policy.\nSchumann said one more company registered since announcing the new strategy \u2014 bringing it up to 13.\n\"The strategy is working! We already increased by one,\"\u00a0Schumann told CBC, laughing.\nAccording to the government's approved manufactured products list, these companies provide\u00a0the government with products, such as: traffic signs, banners and decals for buildings, bridges, specialized steel products, fibreglass, roofs, cabinets, portable live bear traps, steel tanks and fuel trucks, among others.\nThe sector generated $24.8 million in 2017, which was about 0.5 per cent of the territory's GDP that year, according to a news release.\nThe government now hopes to increase the number of N.W.T. manufacturers\u00a0by 25 per cent\u00a0in five years.\u00a0\nIt also hopes to increase\u00a0local manufacturers' sales\u00a0by 25 per cent in three years.\n\"Manufacturing in the Northwest Territories is a challenge for sure,\" said Jason Coakwell, president of the NWT Manufacturers Association, and also the general manager of Aurora Manufacturing.\n\"Up in here North here [we] face typically higher labour costs, higher utility costs, just a higher cost of business in general.\"\nCoakwell said all the local manufacturers have to be diverse with their products because the economy is smaller.\nCoackwell\u00a0said the association worked with the government to help develop the strategy \u2014 voicing the challenges the current policy presents.\n\"We're happy they're asking for our input,\" he said. \"Really, there's still a lot of work to do \u2014\u00a0but we kind of know now what needs to be worked on to potentially grow.\"\nThe government aims\u00a0to change its bid adjustment\u00a0process, which the department calls \"imperfect and administratively burdensome.\"\nWhen there is only one manufacturer registered to provide a product, the government purchases it through a sole-source contract. There is a percentage adjustment that makes sure the product is within 25 per cent of market price, the government explains, but this is \"not transparent.\"\n\"[The department] is\u00a0going to work with the [NWT Manufacturers Association] to examine options to instead have a transparent bid adjustment that would reduce administration and red tape,\" it says in a Q&A document.\nAfter manufacturers expressed concern over the lack of appeal provisions, the government says it will try to add those\u00a0provisions\u00a0in its policy so that \"applications receive fair consideration.\"\nThe strategy also includes an award of up to $100,000\u00a0to support technological\u00a0innovation in the manufacturing sector.\nThe department also hopes to do more marketing at trade shows to help local manufacturers get new opportunities.\nThe department says it's looking to re-examine its definition for N.W.T. manufacturing, after manufacturers proposed it be reviewed.\nThe definition currently specifies that\u00a0one or more major components of a product is produced in an N.W.T. facility.\u00a0But the departments says that right now, the\u00a0product must meet a narrow set of criteria that may be \"burdensome\" for manufacturers.\nAccording to a department spokesperson, changing\u00a0the definition may expand its scope to\u00a0include entities \"that some might consider as manufacturing\" \u2014 like the diamond industry, the agricultural and commercial food industry,\u00a0the wood pellet plant in Enterprise, and the fish processing plant in Hay River.\nHowever, the definition would still exclude \"small scale\" manufacturers, such as artisans and companies that harvest local food products, says the department. The department says there are other, specific programs and strategies to support them.\u00a0\nA part of the strategy is to help strengthen and support the NWT Manufacturers Association,\u00a0which Schumann described as being \"defunct\" at one point.\n\"The association kind of went dead there ... With our help, we helped them revitalize\u00a0this thing and get some book keeping stuff in order,\" said Schumann.\nThe manufacturers will\u00a0have a collective voice, said Schumann.\nSchumann said he hopes eventually, local manufacturers won't limit their sales to government.\n\"One of the problems that we had with this manufacturing policy is, a lot of these businesses just focus on [government]\u00a0business and not broader,\" said Schumann.\nHe said his hope is to get local manufacturers to start selling outside the territory.\n\"That should always be your goal as a business, to grow as much as you can \u2014 not to be focusing on just one industry.\"\n"}, {"author": "Nazim Cicek", "title": "How a shift to electric vehicles is driving change in 'China's Silicon Valley'", "description": "Other cities should follow lead of Shenzhen, where entire bus fleet and 99% of taxis are now electric", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/opinion-cicek-shenzhen-china-electric-vehicles-1.5156436", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5156614.1559253178!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-electric-taxis.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 01, 2019 6:00 AM CT", "2019-06-01T11:00:00.883Z"], "source": null, "content": "Lost in the current news around trade tensions between China and Canada, which have been tied to the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, is the dizzying progress made in Shenzhen\u00a0\u2014 the very city that is home to the world's largest telecom equipment maker and second-largest smartphone maker.\nOnce suffocating from the effects of smog, Shenzhen now has some of the cleanest air among cities in China, and in 2018 had its highest air quality index recorded in over 15 years.\u00a0\nWhat's driven this change? In short, it's what Shenzen is driving \u2014 a large variety of\u00a0electric vehicles.\nShenzhen, a sleepy fishing village only 40 years ago, is located at the Pearl River Delta in southeastern China, bordering Hong Kong. Its transformation started in the early 1980s, when the central government designated it as the country's first special economic development zone\u00a0\u2014 China's initial foray into a market-based economy.\nShenzhen has since grown at an incredible pace (it was one of the world's fastest growing cities in both the 1990s and 2000s) to a population well over 12 million. It is now known as China's most innovative city and commonly referred to as the next Silicon Valley.\nThe rapid growth of Shenzhen's population and economy (its GDP was over $350 billion US in 2018, similar to that of the entire province of Quebec) has had environmental impacts, including air pollution issues. This was one of the main reasons for Shenzhen's drive to reduce fossil fuel usage and vehicle emissions.\nIt certainly helps that BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is headquartered in the city.\nShenzhen gained worldwide attention when it announced at the end of 2017 that all of its 16,359 transit buses were battery-electric, a transition achieved in less than seven years.\nIt followed this with a recent announcement that almost all of its 21,689 commercial taxis are also now battery-electric. The few hundred that are still driving on gasoline will be off the roads soon.\nThese two initiatives alone have reduced diesel consumption by over 120 million litres per year and gasoline consumption by over 300 million litres per year within the city.\nAlthough Shenzhen still relies on coal for some of its electricity supply, the greenhouse gas benefits of transitioning to electric bus and taxi transportation have been significant, with the combined reduction estimated at 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. That is equal to taking about 500,000 cars off the road.\nBut that is not all. Shenzhen has committed to buying 500 electric garbage trucks from BYD. These trucks can complete a full-day shift of collecting household refuse with one charge and substantially reduce neighborhood noise and air emissions. They are currently being tested in a number of cities worldwide, including in Palo Alto, Calif.\nNext in line are electric road sweepers, utility vans, forklifts, and even cement-mixing trucks, all part of a lineup of BYD electric vehicles that are being used in, or in the planning stages for, Shenzhen.\nThe city has also mandated that all ride-hailing services must now use a fleet of electric vehicles. Food delivery services and mail and parcel delivery businesses are utilizing electric vans and e-bikes. The city is requiring the local port authority and airport to utilize electric vehicles for cargo and human transport.\nElectrification of transportation makes the most economic sense when daily usage is high, applications require frequent stop and go, routes are set to allow for easy charging, and restrictions are in place for noise and air pollution in sensitive areas. This is the reason transit and school buses, delivery vans, garbage trucks, street sweepers, and forklifts have seen rapid uptake.\nCommercial taxis and ride-hailing fleets require a more extensive charging network due to route uncertainty, but these constraints can be overcome with municipal leadership and planning.\nThe complaints by taxi drivers in Shenzhen primarily centre\u00a0around charging convenience and the driving range of BYD cars. Significant progress is being made on both fronts, with better battery technology in vehicles and widescale expansion of charging poles and stations.\nWith Shenzhen paving the way, other Chinese cities have followed suit. China has over 420,000 electric buses, which represents 99 per cent of the world's market. It is by far the largest market for electric cars (with over 61 per cent of global sales in 2018), including most of the world's electric taxis.\nMuch of the early demand was driven by government incentives, local and national subsidies, and the need to combat smog in large urban areas. But with costs dropping quickly, it is estimated that China could sell its last conventional car by 2030.\nWhile much of the Western world struggles with the concept and implementation of carbon pricing policies, China has taken a quiet lead in decarbonizing its economy through wide-scale electrification.\nThis is being supported by a rapid expansion in renewable electricity production, as China leads the world in the manufacturing, sale, and use of wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries. As the world transitions from fossil fuels to renewables, cities like Shenzhen, and China overall, are poised to take strong leadership roles.\nNext time you see a Huawei commercial during the NHL playoffs, think beyond the current dispute between China and the West. There is much to be learned from how quickly things are changing in a city like Shenzhen.\nAs Charles Darwin notes: \"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.\" \u00a0\nThis column is part of CBC's\u00a0Opinion section.

Instead, the report, called Missing the Bigger Picture\u00a0consists of\u00a0a relatively prosaic tabulation of the growing contribution of clean energy\u00a0to the existing Canadian economy.\nIt estimates the clean energy industry accounts for about three per cent of Canada's GDP, more than agriculture and forestry or the hotel and restaurant industry, and employed 298,000 people in 2017.\n\"It's the most comprehensive look at Canada's clean energy sector that's been done to date, so it looks at the number of Canadians that are employed in this sector and the economic contribution the sector provides,\" said Joanna Kyriazis, with\u00a0Clean Energy Canada, a\u00a0non-profit think-tank based at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.\nWhat it finds is revealing. As well as being big and growing, attracting more than $35 billion in investment in 2017, the clean energy business sector is invisible to most Canadians and not even classified in most statistics as a sector at all.\nToday's report is compiled from data assembled by Navius Research, a Vancouver-based business that has a reputation for collecting reliable data to guide companies exploring developments in the green sector. In any business, fudged data is a recipe for ruin, and the environmental sector is no exception.\nPart of what Navius has done is to try to create strict rational criteria for what to include in its assessment of the clean energy economy, exclusively targeting\u00a0firms where the primary business was clean energy, whether in energy production or\u00a0in improving\u00a0energy\u00a0efficiency.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs the executive director of Clean Energy Canada, Merran Smith says in her introduction to the report, \"Put simply, it's made up of companies and jobs that help to reduce carbon pollution\u00a0\u2014 whether by creating clean energy, helping move it, reducing energy consumption, or making low-carbon technologies.\"\nWhereas fossil fuel energy data has been accumulated for more than a century, and is clearly identified in government and market statistics, companies contributing to the green energy economy have never been classified as a group. As such, what's in the category, such as traditional hydroelectric production or power storage\u00a0or public transit alternatives to cars, or what's out,\u00a0may yet be disputed.\nThat will work itself out over time, but the concern of Smith and her group, and the reason for assembling today's report, is the blinkered view of many Canadians that the energy industry and the economy are somehow in conflict with green principles.\nInstead, as long predicted by advocates of the green economy, businesses that may initially have been motivated by regulation have begun to find new market-based incentives as the world seeks low-carbon alternatives.\n\"Instead of being in the compliance part of a company's brain, all of a sudden it becomes part of the profit part of a company's brain,\" Stewart Elgie, professor of law and economics at the University of Ottawa, told me in a 2015 interview on the future of the business-led green economy.\nThis has certainly happened as demand in the global green power sector, from components of electric cars to tools and techniques for energy efficiency, reach\u00a0critical mass.\u00a0\nEconomic research\u00a0has shown that making the world more energy efficient is exactly what successful businesses have done throughout\u00a0history, because energy is a cost, and cutting costs is what thriving\u00a0businesses do.\n\"The clean energy sector isn't just about fighting climate change\u00a0\u2014 it's also about using Canadian innovation to create\u00a0better and cheaper solutions for everyday life,\" said Smith.\nIf current trends continue, the Navius research says that the effect of\u00a0the green energy sector will become harder to miss in the economy. Studying the period from 2010 to 2017, not only did the sector outgrow the entire economy by more than\u00a0one full percentage point, but jobs in that component of the economy increased by 2.2 per cent a year, compared to an annual increase of 1.4 per cent in jobs overall.\nPart of the reason why the clean energy sector is not visible is because we think of it under different categories such as public transit or hydroelectric generation. But a second reason is that as a sector,\u00a0clean energy\u00a0is fractured into smaller players.\u00a0It is\u00a0unlike the fossil fuel industry, which is backed by decades of lobbying success and established connections to political elites.\nThe clean energy category has no giant business voice or industry group\u00a0to represent it. Even\u00a0the firms defined in this report as being clean energy businesses may not see themselves as part of this sector.\u00a0Perhaps the report will help change that, and will help them get the economic respect they deserve.\nKyriazis\u00a0says she hopes today's report will make people more optimistic. Usually when we hear about energy in the media, it is bad news such as a lack of pipelines, falling prices,\u00a0shrinking jobs or gloom over the\u00a0effects of climate change, she says.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The clean energy sector, here, it's obviously a big success story that is not making the headlines,\" she said.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Janyce McGregor", "title": "New NAFTA beats no NAFTA, gov't says, but no big economic boost coming for Canada", "description": "Global Affairs Canada releases study at last minute, compelled by Conservative committee motion", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-economic-impact-analysis-1.5477542", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5477708.1582805254!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usmca-committee-20200226.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 27, 2020 7:29 AM ET", "2020-02-27T17:52:41.920Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The federal government's much-anticipated economic impact study of\u00a0the revised North American trade agreement does not forecast a significant\u00a0economic boost when the deal takes effect, but officials from Global Affairs Canada told the Commons trade committee Wednesday that\u00a0it's preferable to having no deal.\nAlthough Justin Trudeau's government has touted the successful renegotiation as a significant win for Canada, most of the effects in the forecast are relatively small.\nImplementing the new Canada\u2013U.S.\u2013Mexico agreement (CUSMA) would provide a modest boost to Canada's gross domestic product of 0.249 per cent, the analysis found, compared to a hypothetical scenario in which NAFTA, which came into effect in 1993,\u00a0was dismantled and not replaced.\u00a0\nBut will Canada's economy be better or worse off compared to how things stand today, with the original NAFTA\u00a0still in place?

Both failed.\nThe bill could receive unanimous support in\u00a0its final votes, following an agreement Wednesday between the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland to address the Bloc's concerns about protecting Quebec's aluminum industry from offshore competition.\nIn anticipation of C-4's passage, a\u00a0Senate\u00a0trade committee has started organizing\u00a0a\u00a0pre-study of the bill.\nCanada's chief negotiator, Steve Verheul, told the committee Wednesday that officials project\u00a0gains and losses as part of their negotiation process. They\u00a0analyzed\u00a0the potential losses if the Trump administration pulled out of the 1993 agreement altogether, a threat \"we were facing at the time,\" he said.\nConservative Canada\u2013U.S. relations critic Chris Lewis questioned\u00a0the department's decision to base its comparative analysis on this withdrawal\u00a0scenario, rather than the deal Canada already has.\n\"Would it be a fair statement to say that the only way ... that\u00a0you could make ... the numbers look good, is to compare it to no deal at all?\" Lewis said.\n\"No it's not,\" Verheul said.\u00a0\"That was the reality of that path, if we had not negotiated.\"\nCommittee members asked if it would be possible to run another scenario through the model, comparing the new CUSMA with the status quo of sticking with\u00a0the original NAFTA.\nVerheul\u00a0said he did not see the sense in doing that.\nComparing new NAFTA to no-NAFTA \"sets a stunningly low bar for ascertaining whether the new NAFTA deal is positive for North American trade,\" Conservative trade critic Randy Hoback\u00a0said in a statement.\u00a0\"Almost any trade deal, no matter how unbalanced or restrictive, would be better than having nothing at all.\"\n\"For Parliamentarians to understand the impact of the new NAFTA deal on the Canadian economy and Canadian families, we must compare the new deal to the original NAFTA,\" he said.\nIt's unclear whether the trade committee will ask for more data from Global Affairs.\nWhile the Trump administration's threat to blow up NAFTA\u00a0was taken literally, another more recent threat by the U.S. to pull out of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Government Procurement was\u00a0ignored in the Global Affairs analysis.\nCanada's negotiating objective to gain more access to\u00a0American public sector contracts\u00a0was unsuccessful: CUSMA changes no procurement obligations between the two countries.\nBased on that, the department's study assumes Canadian companies can continue to access some types of U.S. government contracts under the terms of the multilateral\u00a0agreement. But that trade now appears at risk.\nConservative MP Colin Carrie accused the government of holding back information until after last fall's federal election. He said he was \"outraged\" that the committee was only given the report minutes before the start of Paquet's\u00a0testimony Wednesday morning.\nThe positive effects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Pacific Rim trade deal negotiated by the previous Conservative government, were\u00a0shared much sooner in its\u00a0process, he said.\n\"If the information is already there ... I just don't see why it isn't possible to release more information earlier on,\" said NDP MP Daniel Blaikie, who last week struck an agreement with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland\u00a0for more transparency in how\u00a0future trade deals are negotiated, in return for his party's support for C-4.\nPaquet said the department was already studying CUSMA's potential economic impacts when she joined Global Affairs in 2017, but in recent weeks they \"re-did\" their analysis, which was\u00a0only finished Tuesday evening.\nThe committee was\u00a0told\u00a0Feb.5 that the department had not modelled the new automotive chapter and was trying to figure out an analysis \"it could defend credibly\" for the deal's qualitative improvements to reduce trade barriers.\nPaquet\u00a0said she was unable to analyze the entire\u00a0agreement, because some parts aren't suited to economic modelling. Because NAFTA\u00a0already cut most tariffs to zero, this negotiation focused\u00a0on other trade barriers.\nFour parts of the deal were modelled, based on\u00a0their magnitude and feasibility: new\u00a0tariff rate quotas for supply-managed agricultural products like dairy;\u00a0revised rules of origin that\u00a0determine what North American automobiles qualify for tariff-free status;\u00a0new measures\u00a0on\u00a0data storage for financial services; and changes to the way goods are processed at the border\u00a0to facilitate trade.\nDan Ciuriak, the trade analyst who wrote the C.D. Howe\u00a0paper, said\u00a0his analysis is pretty much in line with the department's, forecasting only marginal effects.\nInu Manak, from the Washington, D.C.-based Cato Institute think tank, said the Canadian government's analysis was far more modest than the optimistic\u00a0figures\u00a0presented to the U.S. Congress last spring, but still warrants scrutiny.\n\"If anything, the results are an endorsement of the old NAFTA, plus liberalization achieved through CPTPP [the TPP's successor] and the World Trade Organization, which are making up for the negative impacts of the recent changes,\" she said.\nIn her view, CUSMA\u00a0should be compared with not only the 1993 NAFTA deal, but also the TPP that the U.S. negotiated, along with Canada and Mexico,\u00a0and then opted not to ratify. Contrary to CUSMA's new restrictions for\u00a0the auto sector, the TPP\u00a0would have liberalized automotive rules of origin and set a new standard for the North American market, she said.\nManak's troubled by the\u00a0assumption in Wednesday's analysis that Canada secured exemptions to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs in CUSMA when in fact, the U.S. could re-impose them\u00a0based on its vague criteria.\n\"There's nothing to suggest any agreement made with this administration guarantees any specific outcome,\" she said.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Evan Dyer", "title": "New Chinese ambassador doesn't budge on detainees, Hong Kong during press conference", "description": "Cong Peiwu also warns Canada not to follow U.S. example over Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cong-peiwu-china-ambassador-kovrig-spavor-1.5370503", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5370578.1574462452!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cda-china-ambassador-20191122.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 22, 2019 5:47 PM ET", "2019-11-22T23:43:56.243Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It's still up to Canada to mend fences if it wants better relations with China, the country's new ambassador to Canada suggested today during his first official press conference in Canada.\nCong Peiwu also warned Canadian parliamentarians not to follow the lead of the U.S. Congress in seeking to sanction Chinese officials over their handling of the Hong Kong crisis.\nCong took questions at China's embassy in Ottawa today. Reporters were free to ask whatever they wanted, though there was no opportunity for follow-up questions.\nOverall, Cong presented an impression of continuity with the previous ambassador, Lu Shaye \u2014 and offered no indication of movement in Beijing's\u00a0position on either the two Canadians detained in China or the dramatic situation in Hong Kong.\nCong\u00a0began his remarks by talking about the economic advances China has made over seven decades of Communist Party rule. He described China as the main motor of growth in the world's GDP\u00a0and the nation that has lifted the largest number of people out of poverty.\nHe also talked about China's commitment to be more open to the world\u00a0\u2014 although he described that openness in strictly economic and business terms.\nHe spoke about China's desire to have friendly relations with other countries, including Canada, but stressed that those relations would have to be conditioned on \"mutual respect\" and \"equality\" among nations.\n\"We believe that the countries should live in harmony, and treat each other as equals in this community of the world, just as President Xi Jinping has been pointing out,\" he said.\nCBC News asked Cong about China's treatment of Canadian detainees Michael\u00a0Spavor and Michael\u00a0Kovrig, who are being held in solitary confinement while\u00a0Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou\u00a0\u2014 taken into custody by the RCMP on an American warrant\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is able to spend her pre-trial period in one of her two Vancouver homes.\n\"We have always stressed that (the Meng case) is by no means a purely judicial case,\" said the ambassador, \"but instead a very serious political incident plotted by the United States.\n\"And for Canada, it has abused its treaty of extradition between Canada and the United States, and arbitrarily detained [Meng Wanzhou], which violates her legitimate rights.\"\nCong said that Kovrig and Spavor were \"engaged in suspected activities endangering national security of China. But there is nothing like arbitrary detention.\n\"These two cases they are very much different in nature. Meng Wanzhou's case is arbitrary detention by the Canadian side. For those two Canadian citizens there is no arbitrary arrest at all. So that's my answer.\"\nAsked about the possibility that China might be open to a dialogue with the Hong Kong protest movement, Cong replied that the protesters were \"violent and radical criminals.\"\n\"Supporting the Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing the law, and supporting the Hong Kong judiciary in bringing those criminals to justice according to law, that's our position. And we are determined to safeguard our national sovereignty, our core interests, our security and development interests, and we are determined to oppose any foreign intervention.\"\nCong said that any voices in Canada calling on Beijing to respect the principle of \"one country, two systems\" in Hong Kong are misguided, insisting China has respected that commitment since 1997 and continues to do so.\nAnd he was sharply critical of legislation that passed almost unanimously through the U.S. Congress yesterday, setting up potential sanctions for Chinese officials involved in suppressing Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.\nThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, if signed into law by President Trump, would also require the State Department to certify annually that Beijing is still respecting its commitment to the \"one country, two systems\" principles under which the territory returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.\nCong warned that Canada would be unwise\u00a0to follow the U.S. example.\n\"If somebody here is really trying to push the decision to have this kind of law like that in the United States, it's very dangerous, we would certainly be firmly opposed to that,\" he said.\u00a0\"And if anything happens like this, we would suddenly have very bad damage to our bilateral relationship. And that's not in the interests of Canada.\"\nWatch: China's new ambassador warns Canada against intervention on Hong Kong\nThis morning, President Donald Trump told the Fox News show Fox & Friends that he was considering vetoing the U.S. legislation.\n\"We have to stand with Hong Kong,\" the president said, \"but I'm also standing with President Xi. He's a friend of mine. He's an incredible guy, but we have to stand \u2026 I'd like to see them work it out, okay?\"\u00a0\nTrump has until the end of the month to decide whether he will sign the bill, but the overwhelming strength of the bill's majorities in both houses suggests that any presidential veto probably would be blocked.\nNo such law is currently under consideration in Canada, but Canada already has a law \u2014 the Magnitsky Act \u2014 that could be used to sanction Chinese officials.\nThe Hong Kong democracy bill was one of two setbacks China suffered this week in the United States.\nToday, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted unanimously to ban companies that use equipment and services from either Huawei or Chinese tech company ZTE from accessing U.S. government broadband subsidies.\nThough not strictly speaking a ban, the move eliminates any cost advantages the Chinese firms may have enjoyed in the U.S., making it very difficult for them to sell into that market.\n\"They are mobilizing their national resources to try to cover, to contain the obvious development [of Chinese technology], and its intention actually is trying to pin down our high tech industry,\" said Cong.\n\"As you can see, some senior officials of the United States, wherever they travel they will say something very negative\u00a0against Huawei, and claiming Huawei is posing a security threat to the country they are visiting without providing any evidence.\"\n\"Actually it's those countries which have the PRISM program who have used these kinds of things to spy and have this surveillance, large-scale impact on foreign countries and companies.\"\nPRISM is the code name of a U.S. surveillance program, exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden, that conducted massive eavesdropping operations in foreign countries.\nCong suggested foreign countries would be safer installing Chinese equipment.\u00a0\n\"There's nothing like back door devices being installed by Huawei,\" said the ambassador. \"So that's a groundless accusation.\n\"So we do hope that the Canadian side will provide a fair, just and a non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies.\"\nCong closed his remarks with what sounded like a message for the new Trudeau government.\nTalking about the past year of \"twists and turns, even setbacks\" in the relationship, Cong said \"we do hope that the Canadian side will reflect on what has happened and take concrete measures to push our relationship back to the normal track. So that's the task for the government.\n\"And we do hope that those important people in the new cabinet will play an active role in making sure that relations of our two countries return to their normal track on the basis of mutual respect and equality.\"\nIn our upcoming CBC News series, China's Power, we examine Beijing's expanding circles of influence both around the world and here at home \u2014 watch starting Monday night\u00a0on the National at 10 p.m. on CBC TV and CBC Gem.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Teamsters point finger at CN Rail over propane shortage from strike", "description": "Garneau says train with propane heading to Quebec, repeats support for collective bargaining", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/teamsters-cdn-strike-1.5369359", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5370553.1574462020!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cn-rail-strike-20191122.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 22, 2019 11:45 AM ET", "2019-11-22T22:34:23.476Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The union representing striking Canadian National Railway workers said early Friday there was \"no substantive progress\" in talks aimed at ending the dispute, and they hit back at what they characterized as a \"fabricated\" narrative of a propane shortage that has emerged through politician statements and media reports.\nAs the strike entered its fourth day, the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) said there are still hundreds of employees on the job operating trains, and that what those trains carry is a decision made by CN.\nLyndon Isaak, TCRC\u00a0president, speculated that the company may be throttling the supply of propane.\n\"CN is far from operating at full capacity, but we believe there are enough trains going around to allow the company to supply propane to Ontario and Quebec,\" said Isaak. \"The question is whether CN refuses to transport propane to create a crisis and force a special back-to-work law.\"\nCN\u00a0said in a statement it was doing the best it can given the limited resources in a strike scenario.\n\"CN has a small pool of qualified managers that only allows the company to operate at approximately 10 per cent of normal service across its extensive 22,000-kilometre-long Canadian network safely,\" the corporation said. \"Currently, very limited amounts of various commodities are moving across the country. This includes container traffic to keep Canada's ports fluid to be able to return to normal operations after the strike.\"\nAcross the country, politicians and industry leaders have raised the prospect of critical shortages resulting from a prolonged strike that would impact a number of economic sectors.\nThe governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan have called on Ottawa to intervene. Quebec, which sees 85 per cent of its propane supply transported by rail, has also done so.\nAt least for the time being, the federal government is not considering such action.\nTransport Minister Marc Garneau said Friday that\u00a0a train has left Edmonton with 100 propane cars, but will take some time to get to Quebec, and that he was told there are some trucks with propane that could also come from Sarnia, Ont.\n\"We want to resolve this as quickly as possible,\" Garneau said, reiterating his statement\u00a0 from the previous day that the collective bargaining process is the best way forward.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford appeared to agree with Garneau's view on Friday after meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\"Calling back the legislature is one thing. But it doesn't happen right way,\" said Ford.\nFord, however, agreed it was a \"critical time right now\" with respect to propane supply, citing shortages in the northern and rural areas of his province.\nJonatan Julien, Quebec's national resources minister, gave an update on the province's status on Friday.\nHe said the province has a current supply of six million litres of propane, with another 14 million from various sources expected soon. By rationing supply, Julien said Quebec can \"get to the end of next week.\"\n\"We are looking at all solutions, but if it continues, things will get more complicated to provide propane in Quebec,\" he said.\nNegotiations between CN Rail and the union are continuing with the help of a federal mediator, but the Teamsters have rejected CN's call to enter a process of binding arbitration.\nIndustry groups representing petroleum producers, and the chemistry, mining and propane industries, are among those expressing concern about the impact of a strike, especially if it drags on. It is estimated that 60 per cent of crude-by-rail exports in Canada are transported by the Montreal-based company.\nHours-long delays have been reported by truckers in Sarnia, Ont., the end point of propane shipped from Western Canada by pipeline, where it is then transported\u00a0by truck or rail.\nThe Canadian Propane Association has urged the federal government to take \"whatever action is necessary\" to ensure transportation of propane is not interrupted.\nNathalie Saint-Pierre, president and executive director of the association, noted that in a 2007 strike, CN Rail had a contingency plan with reduced delivery to ensure propane was available in Quebec.\nPropane distributors are adjusting as a result of the strike. Ian Wilson, the president of Wilsons Heating in Nova Scotia, said his company is exploring bringing propane in by truck, a more expensive proposition.\nWilson said his company is prioritizing customers who use propane for heating, and in some cases are making smaller deliveries to customers than would normally be the case.\nThe Grain Farmers of Ontario is\u00a0among the groups concerned about the impact on the agricultural industry in what has described as a challenging growing season.\nFarmers need propane for grain dryers, among other uses, and a prolonged strike's impacts \"might be downloaded to the consumer at a certain point,\" according to Grain Farmers chair Markus Haerle.\n\"Is it going to be right away? I doubt it will be. But there will be a financial impact to the consumer,\" said Haerle.\nQuebec farmer Dominique Leroux described the feeling as \"desperation,\" as a late growing season has meant hectares\u00a0of crops have yet to be harvested and dried.\nAvery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, said Friday they were monitoring developments and if necessary would adjust its fourth-quarter forecast for the Canadian economy, in which projections for growth were already expected to be modest.\n\"Should this strike drag on, it would clearly be disruptive to the Canadian economy and to the company in question, both due to the direct reduction in the transportation services component of GDP,\u00a0the resulting backup in unshipped inventories, and\u00a0the further spillover from that into production\u00a0in affected sectors,\" Shenfeld said via email.\nA five-day strike could cost the Canadian economy between $800 million and $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, TD Bank's senior economist, Brian DePratto, told Reuters.\nAbout 3,200 conductors, train personnel and yard workers are on strike.\nThe workers, who have been without a contract since July 23, say they're concerned about long hours, fatigue and what they consider dangerous working conditions. Wages are not among the critical areas of dispute.\nThe union has said passenger rail services in the country's three biggest cities would not be affected by the strike.\nThe strike went into effect days after CN confirmed it would be cutting jobs in response to a weakening North American economy depressing demand for railroaded transportation, though it did not specify how many workers would be affected.\n"}, {"author": "Michael Gorman", "title": "Budget aimed at health care, education and poverty likely to fuel N.S. election talk", "description": "Fallout from Northern Pulp closure and coronavirus could hurt province's economic growth", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/budget-aimed-at-health-care-education-and-poverty-likely-to-fuel-n-s-election-talk-1.5475294", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5475301.1582651006!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/karen-casey.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 25, 2020 1:16 PM AT", "2020-02-25T19:23:37.360Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "If Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil hoped to quell recent talk of a pending provincial election, his government's budget on Tuesday won't help.\nWith estimated expenses of $11.5 billion and a $55-million surplus, the 2020-21 budget sees major infrastructure projects beginning to ramp up, further increases in spending on health care and education, and the McNeil government's most targeted effort to date in trying to reduce poverty, all while some economic uncertainty looms.\nIn her budget speech, Finance Minister Karen Casey said that while the province might be in a \"positive fiscal position,\" the budget is intended to support people \"who may not have been feeling the success of the province.\"\nTo that end, the government will spend $18 million to increase the low-income threshold for the Nova Scotia Child Benefit, extending it to families with incomes below $34,000. The change is expected to help 28,000 families and 49,000 children.\nThe standard household rate will become fully funded this year thanks to an additional $17.3 million and there's $16.6 million for the Disabilities Support Program.\nAmong other things, the government is promising that new money will help transition residents from larger care facilities into community-based living. In her speech, Casey said 50 people would make the move this year, with more in the following three years.\nHousing Nova Scotia will add 560 new rent supplements, 120 of which will be directed to people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The government is also planning to spend $20.5 million in the next five years for the Integrated Action Plan to Address Homelessness. The intention is to help people find permanent, stable and safe housing.\nCommunity Services officials said the increased funding reflects how stubborn the poverty issue has been and that efforts to date haven't moved the needle far enough. Nova Scotia has lagged behind other provinces in recent Statistics Canada reports on poverty rates for children and families.\n\"We saw numbers come out that saw us drop\u00a0\u2014 the largest drops inside of Canada, but it's still too high,\" McNeil told reporters.\n\"And this is an acknowledgement of that and this is an investment in those kids, kids in our province who are living in poverty.\"\nHealth care, as always, gobbles up the largest proportion of the budget.\nThis year, the Health Department's budget will hit $4.8 billion, almost 42 per cent of the total.\nThere's $75.3 million more for doctors following the recently announced new master agreement. There's also previously announced money for more seats at Dalhousie University's medical school and for resident training, and money to create 70 new nursing seats \u2014 62 at Cape Breton University and eight at Dalhousie's satellite campus in Yarmouth.\nThere's more money for a variety of drug programs and $1 million for a new ovarian cancer research program at Dalhousie.\nThe Nova Scotia Health Authority will see its budget increase by $77.7 million, while the bottom line at the IWK Health Centre will go up by $8.4 million.\nThe government will also spend $3.2 million to implement the new Human Organ Tissue Donation Act, money that will go toward doing more transplants.\nThe Education Department's major increases include $21.5 million to complete the rollout of pre-primary and another $15 million for the recommendations in the Commission on Inclusive Education's report.\nThe student loan forgiveness program is increasing by $2.2 million to now include graduates of the Nova Scotia Community College, a move that should affect 1,400 people as of this summer.\nThen there's the capital plan.\nAs Casey announced last week, it will hit $1 billion this year, driven primarily by hospital construction and renovation, buying and building 46 schools, and work on highways, roads and bridges. This year's operating grant for the Nova Scotia-to-Maine ferry is $16.3 million.\nThere's also about $40 million dedicated to green programs, such as energy efficiency programs and community-based projects to address climate change.\nThe spending is helped by $395 million more from Ottawa this year, including more money for equalization ($200 million) and the federal health transfer ($41.3 million).\nOpposition leaders and others were critical of the budget, saying it either didn't go far enough on certain issues or\u00a0placed too much emphasis on some things at the expense of others.\nTory Leader Tim Houston called the document an\u00a0election budget filled with investments that should have come \"years ago.\"\nHouston pointed to the $700,000 to create the new nursing school seats as an example.\n\"They could have easily started that three years ago and we'd be graduating nurses today instead of trying to look for someone to go in the program,\" he said.\nHouston said the level of transfer payments the province is receiving from Ottawa is proof that things aren't as fiscally strong as the government would have people believe.\n\"There is huge headwinds before this province for sure and easily our economy could shrink this year and that's a major concern,\" he said.\nNDP Leader Gary Burrill\u00a0called it a tale of two budgets, with\u00a0\"a great banquet feast\" laid out for the business community while the most needy get \"crumbs.\"\n\"It has the character of a fiscal deathbed confession,\" he told reporters.\n\"After years in which the province has really been starved for social spending, now, on the front porch of an election, we have all these crumbs being tossed in all kinds of different directions. So the spending, yes, fine, but it's a little bit little and it's a whole lot late.\"\nChristine Saulnier with\u00a0the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said the new funding aimed at addressing poverty doesn't go far enough.\n\"We need to do much\u00a0more than wait for a business sector to do something with a tax cut,\" she said.\n\"We've had 30 years to know what they're going to do: they're going to sit on it, their shareholders are going to be enriched, maybe some of their top employees, but we're not going to see the trickle down that apparently the premier thinks will be different here.\"\nHealth-care advocates said there were some things to be happy about, such as extending dialysis to rural communities, but\u00a0both Nan McFadgen of CUPE and Chris Parsons of the Nova Scotia Health Coalition were concerned there aren't any new long-term care beds included in the budget or support for the workers who staff those homes.\n\"It's a problem for anybody that wants access to any kind of health care because it just flows through all of the system,\" said McFadgen.\nThe government may be opening up its wallet, but this budget will require people who smoke and vape to do the same. All tobacco taxes will increase as of Feb. 26. That includes a two cent increase per cigarette, increasing the tax on cigars from 60 per cent to 75 per cent and an increase on fine cut and other forms of tobacco to 40 cents per gram.\nVape products will begin being taxed in September and retailers will require a permit, the cost of which has yet to be finalized, in July. The vape tax, the second in the country after B.C., will include $0.50 per millilitre of liquid and 20 per cent of the retail value of all devices. For example, the taxes would amount to $10.40 for a $45 starter vape kit.\n\"A small price to pay for our youth health,\" Casey told reporters.\nCasey said the measures, along with a previously-announced ban on flavoured vape products, are intended to target youth vaping rates.\nThe premier's previously announced tax breaks for small business (down from three per cent to 2.5) and the reduced corporate rate (down from 16 per cent to 14 per cent) are included in this budget, moves that will cost $81 million.\nOther tax measures include a five-year extension of both the digital media tax credit and digital animation tax credit. The Nova Scotia Film and Television Production Incentive Fund will rise to $25 million.\nThere are risks in this budget, as with any. The government has not accounted for the short-term effects of the coronavirus outbreak, and that includes what effect it might have on seafood exports to Asia, a market that in recent years has been the engine for economic growth.\nThere is also the question of the long-term effects of Northern Pulp's closure. The government estimates the tax hit of losing the mill is about $32 million, something Finance Department officials say is offset by an otherwise strong economy. But offsetting mitigations and transitions related to the mill closure are not factored into the budget.\nMcNeil told reporters the shutdown of Northern Pulp had no correlation\u00a0with the increased capital spending, other than money tied directly to already-announced funds and initiatives designed to help the forestry industry transition.\nThe province's real economic growth is expected to slow to 0.4 per cent in 2020 before reaching 1.2 per cent in 2021. The 2020-21 debt is estimated to hit $15.7 billion, with the debt-to-GDP ratio coming in at 33.3 per cent.\nThe debt is projected to increase in each of the next four years, driven by construction of hospitals, highways and schools. The government is also projecting balanced budgets in each of those years, aided in part by favourable debt servicing costs as long-term high-rate loans come off the books and are replaced by loans at much lower rates.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "How will Scheer's views on abortion and same-sex marriage impact the Conservatives?", "description": "The Canada Votes newsletter is your weekly tip-sheet as we count down to Oct. 21.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-votes-newsletter-issue21-andrew-scheer-abortion-lgbt-rights-1.5266068", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5266110.1567189594!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/party-leaders-composite.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 01, 2019 4:00 PM ET", "2019-09-01T20:00:00.141Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Vassy Kapelos, host of Power & Politics\nGood question. Maybe there's a better way to ask it: will it help the Liberals?\nThis week wasn't a great one for federal Conservatives. They were neck and neck with the Liberals in the polls and coming off some good weeks, with the release of the ethics commissioners' report. But then the Liberals went on the attack - and it stuck. Nobody's talking about Mario Dion today.\nThe Liberals changed the channel by reviving a 2005 video of Scheer speaking out against same-sex marriage. As the Conservatives pointed out at the time, Scheer wasn't alone in his opposition to same-sex marriage at the time; even Ralph Goodale, the Liberal minister who tweeted out the 2005 video, voted to endorse the traditional man-woman version of marriage in 1999.\n\"My views have evolved,\" Goodale says today. Have Scheer's views changed?\nScheer was asked that question multiple times last week, in a variety of ways. At no point did he offer a clear answer.\nScheer did say that a Conservative government led by him would not re-open the abortion and same-sex marriage debates, and that while backbench Conservative MPs are free to follow their individual consciences, he would \"oppose measures to reopen\" these debates and is \"confident\" the caucus \"understands that.\"\nBut when it came to Scheer explaining what he actually thinks \u2014\u00a0personally, even some of his supporters found his words a little wishy-washy.\n\"On the issue of same-sex marriage, I think what would have helped would have been to hear him say that his own personal views had evolved since 2005, much as (Alberta Premier) Jason Kenney did during the Alberta provincial campaign. He didn't say that,\" Rachel Curran, former director of policy to Stephen Harper, told me on Power & Politics.\nAs Curran pointed out, Liberals likely will be talking about this day in and day out during the campaign (and in the pseudo-campaign period we're in right now).\nWill it work?\nTo answer that question, it helps to look at who might be motivated or affected by the aforementioned wishy-washyness.\nThe Conservatives' base, most pollsters will tell you, is rock-solid. Yes, there are a number of 'progressive' Conservatives who are unhappy with what Scheer said (or didn't say) this week. That's not likely to be enough to push them over to a new party - though it could leave many of them less than motivated to get out and vote.\nBut they're not the targets for this strategy. Think about the battle for the \"progressive\" vote shaping up now between the Liberals, NDP and Greens. Think of the bloc of those voters who came out for the Liberals in the last election. They might be disappointed by the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, or by Justin Trudeau breaking his promise on electoral reform.\nThe Liberals might be worried about those voters throwing their support behind the NDP and Greens. They're probably more worried about them staying home on election day. What might motivate those voters to get out and cast ballots? A desire to keep Scheer out of office. Why might they want to do that? If they decide his views \u2014\u00a0even his personal ones\u00a0\u2014\u00a0aren't aligned with theirs.\nDon't take my word for it. I was told explicitly by Liberal cabinet ministers last month that this is the strategy, particularly in Quebec: to associate Scheer with austerity in voters' minds while pulling on any dangling social conservative threads.\nSome Conservatives recently pointed out that, in Alberta's recent election, the NDP tried to make an issue of Jason Kenney's social conservatism and still lost. Others say the provincial context in that election \u2014\u00a0especially the state of the provincial economy in Alberta - swamped any concerns about social conservatism.\nChristian Bourque of the Leger polling firm told me the Liberals' strategy could work in Quebec.\n\"One way it may be effective in Quebec is the fact that the pool of social conservatives in the province is very small,\" he said.\n\"So I believe what they're trying to do here is to try to send the message that we are here to reduce that level of support for the Conservatives to that smaller social conservative circle\"\nShachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute cautioned that the Liberals' will still have to offer their base and progressive voters something more in order to motivate them to show up and vote.\n\"Obviously some of these things are going to dominate campaigns on certain days of certain weeks,\" Kurl said.\n\"But as we get down to the real essence of a campaign period once that writ is dropped, I think the Liberals are really going to have to emphasize their track record on things like carbon taxation to speak to those left-of-centre voters.\"\nAt the end of the day, those issues and others (climate, the economy, the cost of living) will all move votes. But the 'who' matters as much as the 'what': people want to know who their leaders are and what they stand for. And while everyone is entitled to their own views and beliefs, when it comes to politicians campaigning for high office, voters are entitled to know what those views are.\nVassy Kapelos is host of Power & Politics, weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on CBC News Network.\nThe Power & Politics Power Panelists on where the big parties will be focused this week\nAmanda Alvaro\u00a0 president and co-founder of Pomp & Circumstance The Liberals will continue to push Andrew Scheer to clarify his murky response on questions about a woman's right to choose and equal marriage rights.

Provincial elections in Manitoba haven't exactly been harbingers of federal election outcomes \u2014 not since 1988 has the federal party that won the most votes in Manitoba shared the same political hue as the provincial government.\nBut there's good reason to wonder what's going to happen in the federal election in Manitoba: the province is setting up to be surprisingly competitive this fall.\nPerhaps as many as half of Manitoba's 14 federal seats could change hands. The New Democrats will be playing defence in the two seats they hold \u2014 one in the north, one in Winnipeg \u2014 while the Liberals will be hard-pressed to replicate the big numbers they put up in Manitoba four years ago.\nPolls suggest the Liberals have lost a lot of support throughout the province. After taking Winnipeg by a margin of about 24 percentage points over the Conservatives, the Poll Tracker estimates the Liberals to be trailing by about three points in the city today.\nThat means the Conservatives are targeting Liberal seats like St. Boniface\u2013St. Vital, Winnipeg South, Charleswood\u2013St. James\u2013Assiniboia\u2013Headingley and Kildonan\u2013St. Paul.\nThose could prove to be important battlegrounds. Not every seat in Manitoba will be competitive, so realistically the Liberals and Conservatives might be fighting over just four seats in the Winnipeg suburbs.\nBut that's nearly half the margin separating the two parties in the Poll Tracker's seat projection \u2014 so those four seats could loom large on election night.\nTap here to go to the full poll tracker \nWe want to know what YOU want to know.\u00a0\nNorbert Klaue asks: What is the most recent amount of our national debt and how did it change over the last years?\nShort answer: It's increased about nine per cent in the last few years.\u00a0\nThe federal debt was $671.3 billion\u00a0at the end of the 2017-2018 fiscal year\u00a0(so, March of last year).\u00a0 Back in March 2016,\u00a0it was $616 billion.\nHowever, it's about the same debt-to-GDP ratio\u00a0\u2060\u2014\u00a031.1\u00a0per cent in 2016, versus 31.3 per cent last year.\nThis year's\u00a0budget\u00a0forecasted that the ratio will decline every year, reaching 28.9\u00a0per cent by 2024 (when the debt is projected to be $766.1\u00a0billion). Keep in mind: Canada already has one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in the G7.\u00a0\nLet's take a look at the deficit.\u00a0\nA quick refresher: The federal debt is all the accumulated deficits, minus the surpluses, at the federal level (the overall national debt is significantly higher when provincial deficits are added).\u00a0A deficit is when Ottawa spends more revenue than they bring in over a specific time period\u00a0\u2060\u2014\u00a0usually a fiscal year.\nAs you'll likely remember\u00a0\u2060\u2014\u00a0and as the Conservatives have been trying to remind Canadians\u00a0\u2060\u2014\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a balanced budget while on the campaign trail in 2015. He backed down from that promise in early 2016.\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer also made an ambitious promise in 2017 that he would balance the books in two years. This May, he stepped back from that pledge, increasing the timeline to\u00a0five\u00a0years.\nNow to the numbers.\nThe deficit this year is expected to be around $15.7 billion,\u00a0increasing to $22.3 billion by 2021. After that, it's set to decline pretty significantly.\nThe last year that Stephen Harper was in office, the government posted\u00a0a surplus\u00a0of $1.9 billion.\u00a0\nBut right after the 2015 election, a report from the Parliamentary Budget Officer showed things weren't actually so\u00a0rosy.

And the NDP is going to un-rig it to work better for everyday people.\"\n\u2014 Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party, unveiled the costing for his party's platform in Ottawa, Friday morning.\u00a0\nThe facts: The NDP has finally put a price tag on the 70 new spending measures it has proposed during the federal election campaign \u2014\u00a0$35 billion in fiscal year 2020-21.\nAnd the party also has explained how it hopes to pay for them in part, forecasting $30.5 billion in new revenues in 2020-21, rising to $34.34 billion a year by 2023-24.\nUnder their plan, the New Democrats would run a $32.7 billion deficit (including a $4.58 billion contingency fund) during their first year in power, and then whittle the shortfall down over the course of their mandate to $16.57 billion in 2023-24.\nThe party's ambitious spending measures range from a plan to spend $13 billion over four years to build 500,000 new affordable homes, to $5.8 billion for clean transit and transportation, to\u00a0$43.1 billion for a national pharmacare program. Over the course of an NDP mandate,\u00a0there also would be $10 billion for universal childcare, $2.5 billion for green home renovations\u00a0and $2.4 billion to provide clean drinking water to Indigenous communities.\nMost of the new revenue would\u00a0come from tax increases on businesses and wealthy Canadians \u2014 like a three per cent rise in the corporate tax rate that would bring in $27.65 billion over four years, or $21.75 billion realized from \"cracking down on corporate tax havens.\" And the NDP has taken a page from the Liberals by also promising a tax on luxury boats, aircraft and vehicles, setting it at 12 per cent \u2014 two points\u00a0higher than Justin Trudeau's proposal.\nThe 13 new tax measures have all been costed by the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO). But just three of the spending measures \u2014 pharmacare, free dental coverage for families making $70,000 or less, and eliminating interest on future and current student loans \u2014 have been put under the same scrutiny.\u00a0\nThe University of Ottawa's Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy (IFSD), overseen by former PBO chief Kevin Page, has produced a quick analysis of the NDP costing giving\u00a0the party a barely-passing grade on its fiscal projections and management \u2014 3 out of 6, and 3.5 out of 6, respectively.\nHowever, the institute failed Singh on transparency, noting that, like the Conservatives, the NDP waited until after the debates to release their costing ... on the Friday before a long weekend, just 10 days out from the Oct. 21 vote.\u00a0\n\"Overall, the fiscal strategy in the NDP Party Platform Costing is one of significant fiscal expansion and a commitment to a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium-term,\" says the report-card. But it warns that the \"historic\" tax increases \"come with significant economic and fiscal risk,\" and that the equally huge spending increases likely would require tough and bitter negotiations with the provinces.\n\"The New Democrats are proposing significant changes to the tax and spending structure of the federal government,\" Mostafa Askari, the chief economist for the IFSD, told CBC News. \"Those objectives are very difficult to achieve without causing significant disruption in the economy.\"\nThe NDP costing doesn't provide much detail about its spending promises. And there is reason to question the accuracy of the party's revenue projections as well.\nThe PBO judged nine of the 13 new tax measures to have \"high uncertainty\" due to incomplete or old data, and the well-recognized reality that the ultra-rich have the means and motivation to frustrate, or even evade, collection attempts. In total, $30.2 billion of the NDP's projected $32.2 billion in additional revenue in fiscal 2021-22 is rated highly uncertain by the PBO.\u00a0\nTake, for example,\u00a0that $5.562 billion that the party is hoping to bring in that year from its tax haven crackdown. To date, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has a woeful record when it comes to finding money that Canadians have hidden offshore \u2014 even when they are provided with a roadmap.\nIt's been more than three years since the leaked Panama Papers \u2014 11.5 million documents\u00a0from 200,000 accounts \u2014\u00a0revealed the sheltered assets of the world's financial elite. Countries like the U.K., France and Spain have used the information to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and penalties.\nAs of June, the CRA had only examined 116 of the 894 Canadians implicated, assessing just $14.9 million in taxes and fines. And it's not clear how much \u2014 if any \u2014 of that money has actually been collected.\nPercy Downe, a senator for P.E.I and former chief of staff to Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien, has been studying offshore tax havens for years and said he is mystified by how successive governments \u2014 Conservative and Liberal \u2014 have shown so little interest in cracking down.\n\"There's a terrible double-standard. The CRA does an excellent job on domestic tax evasion. The chances of being detected, caught and jailed are very high,\" he said. \"But the corresponding effort for overseas tax evasion is simply not there.\"\nThat could change with a government that makes enforcement a priority, said Downe. But it won't happen overnight, as the NDP (and the Green Party) are forecasting in their platform costings.\n\"We have a massive problem that has gone from the very rich, to the rich, to the upper middle class,\" said Downe. \"It won't be easy to fix.\"\nThe NDP isn't alone in offering a mix of perhaps-over-estimated revenues\u00a0and probably-under-estimated costs.\nThe Greens, who had the PBO cost 23 of their 102 promises, saw 13 of them come back tagged \"high uncertainty,\" throwing $49.73 billion of the $63.98 billion in new revenue that the party hopes to collect in 2021-22 into question.\nThe Liberals submitted 24 of their 55 spending and revenue proposals to the PBO. Ten of them were judged to have \"high uncertainty,\" accounting for $3.073 billion of the $6.285 billion in new revenue the party is counting on for 2021-22.\nAnd the Conservatives, who also released their platform costing on Friday, have sent 44 of their 81 promises for scrutiny at the budget office. Seven were found to have heightened uncertainty. But with a relatively small footprint \u2014 the Tories are projecting $8.5 billion in tax breaks and new spending in 2021-22, versus $8.89 billion in additional revenue and program cuts \u2014 the nine shaky estimates total just $2.6 billion.\nAskari said the IFSD found that the Liberals and Conservatives were both \"inside the box\" of traditional government spending and taxation.\nThe NDP and the Greens, on the other hand, are dreaming big.\n\"It's very ambitious,\" said Askari. \"But it may not be feasible, or doable.\"\nThe verdict: It's complicated. The NDP are aiming to fundamentally transform Canada if elected. They've attached price tags to their promises, and the PBO has checked some of their math, but their assumptions on the revenue side might prove to be overly optimistic.\u00a0\nSources: A New Deal for People: Our Fiscal Plan, New Democratic Party of Canada; Liberal Party Costing Estimate: Luxury Goods Sales Tax, Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer; 2019 Election Proposal Costing: New Democratic Party, Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer; IFSD Fiscal Credibility Assessment: New Democratic Party (NDP) Platform 2019 Costing, Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy; Panama Papers spur billion-dollar global tax windfall, with $15M found in Canada, CBC News; Why Can't the Canada Revenue Agency Catch Tax Cheat?, Policy Options; Green Party Costing Estimate: End offshore tax dodging by corporations, Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer; A Responsible Fiscal Plan, Liberal Party of Canada; Platform 2019 Costing, Green Party of Canada; Andrew Scheer's Plan for you to get ahead, Conservative Party of Canada.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Robson Fletcher", "title": "What Canada's economy would look like if Alberta's recession never happened", "description": "Politicians often say a 'strong Alberta' means a 'strong Canada.'

That's also correct.\nMaybe your mind went to federal politics, though. No problem. If you said Michelle Rempel, the Conservative MP for Calgary Nose Hill, that is a\u00a0correct answer, as well. So, too, is Kent Hehr, the Liberal MP for Calgary Centre.\nOther correct answers include Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi, former B.C. premier Christy Clark\u00a0and even former Ontario finance minister Dwight Duncan.\nIn this age of partisan talking points repeated ad infinitum, variations on the \"strong Alberta, strong Canada\" theme represent a rare turn of phrase that cuts across provinces, government jurisdictions and party lines. If you listen for it, you'll hear politicians of all stripes make the point, and with good reason. The evidence bears it out.\n\"There are very deep and important interconnections between Alberta's economy and the rest of the country,\"\u00a0says University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe, who recently completed a quantitative analysis on just that topic.\nJust how deep are those connections? Think $130 billion \u2014 per year. Think a federal deficit that would be virtually wiped out. Think an unemployment rate that would have dropped to levels never before seen in this country.\nThis is what Canada missed out on, Tombe says, because of Alberta's latest recession.\nThat recession, by most measures, started with the oil-price slump in late 2014 and lasted until late 2016. Alberta's economy then bounced back, to a degree, in 2017, but that recovery started to sputter in 2018.\nMultiple economic forecasts for\u00a02019 are pointing to another weak year, with the Conference Board of Canada saying a second, \"mild recession\" may even be in the cards for Alberta.\nTombe's\u00a0peer-reviewed analysis, produced at CBC's request, was released today by the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy. It looks at how Canada's economy would have fared if Alberta's recent recession had never happened and, instead, the provincial economy had simply matched British Columbia's growth from 2014 to 2019.\nThe analysis builds on previous work from the school's Ron Kneebone, who in 2014 investigated the opposite: What Canada would have looked like if Alberta's economy, which had been previously booming, had instead grown at only a moderate pace.\nIn both cases, the results were stark.\n\"What these numbers show is that Alberta's recession had a very real and significant impact on the national economy,\" says Tombe.\nIn terms of sheer economic growth, he says Canada has missed out on roughly $130 billion per year, thanks to Alberta's recession.\nAnd then there's the jobs.\nEarlier this year, Canada's unemployment rate hit a historic low, dipping to 5.4 per cent in June. That's the lowest level recorded by Statistics Canada since it started tracking comparable data nearly a half-century ago.\nIf Alberta hadn't experienced its latest recession, however, Tombe's analysis suggests the national unemployment rate would be even lower today.\n\"I estimate Canada's national unemployment rate would be 4.9 per cent\u00a0or 0.8 percentage points below its August 2019 rate of 5.7 per cent,\" he writes.\u00a0\"This is a significant drop.\"\nAnd this, Tombe says, is not simply due to Alberta's unemployment rate declining in a hypothetical scenario where the recession never happened, thereby dragging down the national rate, on average.\nTo understand why, just consider the impact the actual recession had on workers beyond the province's borders.\n\"In 2014, 150,000 people worked in Alberta but lived somewhere else,\" he says.\u00a0\"So the job losses that we saw during the recession \u2014 at worst, 130,000 job losses \u2014 a lot of that was actually felt by workers who lived in provinces elsewhere. So the unemployment rate being higher nationally is not just because Alberta's unemployment rate is higher.\"\nThen there are the broader economic effects.\nA stronger Alberta economy means more trade between it and other provinces, something that also affects jobs.\nTombe says total internal trade within Canada was roughly $380 billion per year prior to the recession, and Alberta represented about $75 billion of that.\n\"So when a recession occurs here, that's going to mean fewer trade flows between Alberta and the rest of the country,\" he says. \"And so that's another way in which businesses elsewhere can suffer because of a recession here.\"\nAll that trade also translates into tax revenue\u00a0for the federal government. Tombe's analysis suggests the GDP boost that would have occurred if Alberta's recession had never happened would have resulted in an\u00a0additional $13 billion flowing to the\u00a0federal government\u00a0in the fiscal year that just ended.\n\"The federal deficit was just a little bit over $14 billion,\" he says.\u00a0\"So this analysis suggests that almost all of the federal deficit for the prior year might be due to Alberta's recession.\"\nTo economists, this all might be obvious. The fact that economic growth in one part of the country comes with benefits for the country\u00a0as a whole\u00a0is not exactly a groundbreaking discovery in the field.\nBut Tombe worries recent political rhetoric that pits Alberta against B.C., or provincial governments against the federal government, or Western Canada against Central Canada, or pipeline supporters against pipeline opponents,\u00a0obscures this reality.\n\"I think a lot of Canadians don't recognize just how closely and tightly interconnected provincial economies are,\" he says.\nIt's something that troubles Jim Dinning as well.\nThe former Calgary MLA, who served as provincial treasurer and in other cabinet roles in Alberta's Progressive Conservative governments of the 1980s and 1990s, believes too much of politics these days frames disagreements between regions as an either-or scenario, ignoring the common ground they all share.\n\"It shouldn't be Quebec or Alberta,\u00a0or Ontario or the West. It's got to be Ontario, Quebec and a strong Western Canada,\" Dinning says.\n\"Really, every province in this country can be a contributor. And\u00a0if one or two or three are left behind because of poor or bad or ill-thought public policy, that's a drag on the whole economy.\u00a0And that's a tragedy.\"\nThere's a tendency in the public discourse, he says, to \"talk past each other too much.\" Admitting Albertans are as guilty of it as anyone else\u00a0\u2014 of\u00a0\"having a little too much swagger,\" especially\u00a0during the boom times \u2014 Dinning believes Canadians across the country\u00a0focus on narrow regional interests at the peril of the larger, national whole.\nTombe hopes his quantitative analysis will add weight to the political rhetoric discussed earlier:\u00a0the \"strong Alberta, strong Canada\" language that we've heard, at various times, from UCP and NDP premiers alike,\u00a0from Conservative and Liberal MPs, and from leaders at all levels of government.\nThis type of talk sometimes gets drowned out by more inflammatory kinds of political rhetoric,\u00a0which\u00a0tend to attract more attention for their bombast,\u00a0but Tombe believes it's important to hear.\n\"I think this does speak to national unity considerations that are not often talked about,\" he says.\n\"The economic health of one region affects the economic health of all.\"\nWest of Centre is an election-focused pop-up bureau based out of CBC Calgary that features election news and analysis with a western voice and perspective.\n"}, {"author": "Aaron Wherry", "title": "Liberals to boost spending and extend deficits while taxing luxury goods and internet giants", "description": "Trudeau offers support for students, sexual assault training for judges and new tax on internet giants", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-liberal-platform-release-election-1.5302042", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302125.1569786292!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-liberals-20190927.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 29, 2019 2:06 PM ET", "2019-09-29T22:14:12.753Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Justin Trudeau's Liberals launched their full campaign platform on Sunday with promises of new support for post-secondary students and graduates, paid for, in part, by new taxes on internet giants and luxury goods.\nIn total, the Liberals are proposing new investments of $9.3 billion in 2020-2021, rising to $17 billion in the fourth year of a second mandate. The federal deficit would increase to $27.4 billion in 2020-2021, declining to $21 billion in 2023-2024.\nThe Liberals promised in 2015 to run three years of deficits before returning the federal budget to balance in 2019.\u00a0\nWith the new promises, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio would still decline, from 30.9 per cent in 2020-2021 to 30.2 per cent in 2023-2024.\nPolitically, the Liberal platform increases the party's contrast with the Conservatives, between a Liberal proposal to spend more and a Conservative commitment to spend less. The Liberal proposals might also reduce the space between themselves and the NDP, their rivals on the left.\n\"We are making a different choice than the Conservatives do. We're choosing to invest in middle-class Canadians, invest in people's communities, because, quite frankly, that is what has worked over the past four years,\" Trudeau told reporters at an event in Mississauga, Ont.\n\"Conservatives are still making the argument that the way to grow the economy is through cuts and austerity and tax breaks that go to the wealthiest. We disagree. Our plan is focused on investing in Canadians, in a fiscally responsible way that means the size of our debt in relation to the size of our economy is low and will keep getting lower every single year.\"\nDuring his prepared remarks, the Liberal leader highlighted a series of cuts that are being made in Ontario under the Progressive Conservative government of Doug Ford.\nAt a news conference to respond to the Liberal platform, Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre\u00a0scorned the new spending commitments.\n\"This is Justin Trudeau's credit card campaign,\" Poilievre said, alleging that the Liberals were concealing future tax increases. \"He expects Canadians to believe that money falls out of the sky or grows on trees.\"\nThe Conservatives have not yet released their full platform. They have previously promised to balance the budget by 2024.\nIn his own response, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said his party would do still\u00a0more to help students and those struggling with the cost of prescriptions\u00a0and housing.\n\"What Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals are doing [is] they're trying to scare people into settling for less,\" Singh said. \"You don't have to settle for less.\"\nUnder the Liberal plan, the maximum annual amount available under the Canada Student Grant program would rise to $4,200, an increase of $1,200.\u00a0\nInterest charges on student loans would also not be charged for two years or until a graduate is making a salary of at least $35,000. In the event that an individual's salary drops below $35,000, interest charges would be suspended.\nFinally, graduates who are new parents would have the option to suspend student-loan payments until their child reaches the age of five.\nThe NDP, Singh noted, is promising to eliminate interest on all student loans.\nTo raise new revenue, the Liberals are proposing a 10 per cent \"luxury tax\" \u2014 an additional excise tax on luxury cars, boats and personal aircraft that sell for more than $100,000.\u00a0\nDigital companies that make at least $1 billion in annual global revenues and at least $40 million in Canadian revenues \u2014 firms\u00a0like Amazon, Google, Netflix, Apple and Facebook \u2014 would pay a three per cent tax on revenue generated through sales of online advertising and user data.\nThe Liberals would also undertake a new review of federal spending and tax expenditures, with a focus on tax measures that \"disproportionately benefit Canada's wealthiest individuals and large corporations.\"\u00a0\nThe Liberal platform does not specify any items in particular to cut, but the Liberals hope to find $2 billion in savings in 2020-2021, rising to $3 billion in four years.\nThe office of the parliamentary budget officer warned that the platform's projections for the new revenue measures came with a high degree of \"uncertainty,\" because of a number of variables. But the\u00a0Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy, a think tank that is analyzing party platforms for transparency and reasonableness, gave the Liberal platform a passing grade.\nThe 85-page Liberal platform restates a number of existing commitments and policies already implemented. But it does include a number of new promises.\nThe federal minimum wage, for instance, would rise to $15 per hour and the Liberals would create a $200 \"culture pass\" available to every child when they turn 12\u00a0to cover the cost of theatres, museums, art galleries and other cultural venues.\nThe federal child disability benefit would also be doubled.\nThe Liberals are promising to implement mandatory training for judges on sexual assault, effectively reviving a measure put forward in a private member's bill by former Conservative MP Rona Ambrose. Survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence would be provided with free legal aid.\nThe privacy commissioner would be empowered to enforce a new digital charter that gives internet users greater power over the use and retention of their data and social media platforms would be required to remove illegal content, including hate speech, within 24 hours.\nIn partnership with Indigenous leaders, a Liberal government would co-develop legislation to cover Indigenous health care, infrastructure in Indigenous communities and the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\nThe Liberals would also create a director of terrorism prosecutions, a new office with a mandate to pursue cases of Canadians who travel abroad to join terrorist organisations. Funding for the federal anti-racism strategy would also be doubled, to $90 million from $45 million.\nNot addressed in the Liberal costing is a commitment to invest in pharmacare. Trudeau said that will be subject to negotiation with the provinces.\nAmong the commitments already announced during the campaign, the Liberals have promised to:\n"}, {"author": "Jonathon Gatehouse", "title": "Trudeau's big \u2014 and underfunded \u2014 health care promises", "description": "Liberals' pledge to 'fix' gaps in health care system would cost billions more", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-health-care-fact-check-1.5295449", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294060.1571730710!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-liberal-20190923.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 24, 2019 2:00 PM ET", "2019-09-24T18:29:55.582Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The claim: \"A re-elected Liberal government will make sure every Canadian has access to a family doctor, to mental health services, to affordable prescription drugs\u00a0and to national pharmacare.\"\n\u2014 The federal Liberals tout their promise to boost health care funding by $6 billion over the coming four years.\nThe facts:\nOn Monday, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau unveiled his plan to close the \"gaps\" in Canada's health care system, promising an \"additional down payment\" of $6 billion to strengthen medicare and the public health system.\u00a0\nThe party reported the amounts \u2014 $750 million in 2020-21, rising to $1.75 billion in 2023-24 \u2014 but said a detailed breakdown of how the money would be spent will have to wait until later in the campaign.\nStill, that didn't stop Trudeau from raising expectations about what he might accomplish\u00a0in a second term, vowing\u00a0that Canadians in every province and territory would have access to a family physician, mental health services as needed and prescription medications via a universal \"pharmacare\" program.\n\"Every Canadian, no matter where they live, who they are\u00a0or what they do, should receive the care they need to stay healthy,\" Trudeau said during a campaign event in Hamilton, Ont.\nThe Liberals came to power in 2015\u00a0promising to negotiate a new \"collaborative\" health accord with the provinces and territories. But when the 10-year deal was finally struck in 2017, it wasn't nearly as generous as the premiers had hoped: it capped\u00a0increases to the Canada Health Transfer at three per cent per year, down from six\u00a0per cent under the old agreement.\nOttawa did sweeten the pot with $11 billion in funding over 10 years for improved home and palliative care, and mental health and addiction services. The Liberals have been talking about that a lot during this campaign, along with changes to prescription drug pricing that they say will save Canadians $13 billion over the coming decade.\nThe Canada Health Transfer in fiscal year 2018-19 was $38.6 billion, more than half of the total $75.4 billion that flowed from Ottawa to the provinces and territories.\nBut that remains a fraction \u2014 just 15 per cent \u2014\u00a0of overall public and private health care spending in Canada, which totalled $253.5 billion in 2018, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).\nPer capita health care spending has been increasing since 2014, up an average of 1.7 per cent per year, after declining by an average of 0.2 per cent a year between 2010 and 2014. In 2018, it worked out to $ 6,839 per person, or 11.3 per cent of Canada's Gross Domestic Product. That's still below the peak health care spending ratio of 11.6 per cent of GDP in 2010.\nThe Liberals can claim partial credit for that uptick, but if they're really intent on filling the gaps in the system, it's going to take a lot more money than they have budgeted and promised thus far.\nTake Trudeau's vow to implement national pharmacare and help the nearly one million Canadians \"who skimp on food and heat to be able to pay for the medications they depend on.\"\nIn June, the advisory council that the Liberals set up to look into pharmacare tabled a final report with some awfully big numbers. If, as recommended,\u00a0 the government starts with a stripped-down version of the program covering only \"essential'\"medicines in 2022, the net annual cost would be $4.1 billion. And as the list of eligible drugs expands, along with the number of users, the price tag would grow to $15.3 billion a year by 2027.\u00a0\nMichael Law, an associate professor of public health at the University of British Columbia and the Canada research chair in access to medicines, said it's hard to reconcile the Liberals' ambitions with the $6 billion sum and the multiple objectives on offer.\n\"It might go toward some of the groundwork to get things started,\" he said.\u00a0\"But what they are currently proposing to spend is nowhere near what they would have to spend to set up a national pharmacare program.\"\nTrudeau's promise to improve access to mental health services \u2014 so that \"Canadians can\u00a0get the support they need quickly, when they need it most\" \u2014 would also be costly.\nLast year, the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) produced a report that looked at spending on mental health versus physical health in Canada. Right now, only 7.2 per cent of the federal health care budget is dedicated to mental well-being. And the 2017 pot-sweetener that dedicated $5 billion more over 10 years barely moved the needle, increasing slightly the share of federal health spending going to mental health from 7 per cent.\nFardous Hosseiny, the CMHA's interim chief executive, said getting to nine\u00a0per cent would take an additional $3.1 billion a year \u2014 which would still be well below the spending level his organization wants to see.\n\"More investment is always welcome,\" he said. \"But it won't take one budget, or even one government, to right-size that funding gap.\"\nThen there's that Liberal pledge to provide everyone with access to a family doctor.\nIn 2017, Canada had 86,644 practising physicians, which works out to 234 doctors per 100,000 population. That's slightly more than Mexico, slightly fewer than the United States\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but well below the levels in Argentina, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, all of which have ratios closer to 400 doctors per 100,000 population.\nCIHI reports that gross clinical payments to physicians amounted to $26.4 billion in 2016-17\u00a0\u2014 a 2.8 per cent increase over the year before, with an average payment of $342,000 per doctor.\u00a0\nStatistics Canada estimates that there are now 4.7 million people who don't (by circumstance or choice)\u00a0have a primary health care provider. Offering them the same level of access as other Canadians would mean adding at least 11,000 more doctors\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which, at current payment rates, adds up to an additional $3.76 billion a year in health costs.\nAnd keep in mind that the country already is having difficulty finding enough residency spots for the record number of students graduating from medical schools.\nOf course, party pledges to \"fix\"\u00a0Canada's health care system are a staple of almost every election,\u00a0provincial and federal.\n\"The Liberals first promised medicare in 1919 under William Lyon Mackenzie King,\" said Dr. Michael Rachlis, a public health physician and adjunct professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health. \"And they took until 1968 \u2014 47 years \u2014 to pass the legislation.\"\nRachlis noted that these current Liberal goals come with a number of caveats and all depend\u00a0on more \"collaborative\" negotiations with the provinces and territories\u00a0\u2014 many of which are led by Conservative governments.\n\"If they're re-elected, they're going to face really hostile provincial governments who won't want to do any of this stuff with them,\" said Rachlis. \"These are nice promises that the Liberals are never going to have to fulfil.\"\nThe Verdict: False. Filling the gaps in Canada's health care system will take billions of dollars\u00a0more than the Liberals have put on the table, and a level of political goodwill that probably doesn't exist right now.\nSources: Liberals to boost investments in health care for Canadians, Liberal Party of Canada; Liberals promise improved access to family doctors, mental health care and prescription drugs, CBC News; A new plan for a strong middle class, Liberal Party of Canada; Divide and conquer: How the feds split the provinces in health talks, Hill Times; Manitoba signs on to Ottawa health accord for more mental health, home care funding, CBC News; Ottawa promises to save billions with tweaks to patent drug system, CBC News; Federal support to provinces and territories, Dept. of Finance; National Health Expenditure Trends, 1975 to 2018, Canadian Institute for Health Information; Final Report of the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare, Government of Canada; Mental Health in the Balance, Ending the Health Care Disparity in Canada, Canadian Mental Health Association; Physicians in Canada, Canadian Institute for Health Information; Density of Physicians, World Health Organization; Primary Health Care Providers, 2017; Statistics Canada; 'You feel like your world in over': Problems and solutions for medical graduates without residencies, CBC News.\n"}, {"author": "Neil Macdonald", "title": "Winter is coming, and so is an uncharted economic abyss: Neil Macdonald", "description": "The economic situation scares me.

Their contempt for amateurs \u2014 columnists with broad audiences, for example \u2014 would sear the lungs if inhaled.\nSo, because criticism just makes me feel so terrible, let me phrase a whole set of nagging worries as questions. Can we agree there are no stupid questions? Probably not. But let's try anyway.\nQuestion No. 1: How in heaven's name did we arrive in a world where you must pay someone to borrow your money, and what does that mean to the punters? Like, um, me?\nAt the moment, there is more than $14 trillion US in negative-yielding debt extant in the world, meaning money is not just cheap, it's on sale at a loss.\u00a0\nLet's put that sum in perspective: Canada's GDP in 2018 \u2013 the entire economic output of a G7 country \u2013 was about $1.7 trillion US. Fourteen trill is a huge chunk of global wealth.\nGovernments, many of them European, are actually offering \u2014 and investors are buying \u2014 bonds that are worth less at the end of five or 10 or even 30 years than their purchase price.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd a bank in Denmark\u00a0is now offering\u00a0a negative-yield mortgage. Jyske Bank will lend customers a ten-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of -0.5%, which means those borrowers will actually pay back less than they borrowed.\nAs for the punters, some have pensions, private and public, which, if this trend continues, will be forced to severely reduce their payouts. Some have RRSPs and other savings, which are subject to the same market forces. The expectation my generation was raised on was that prudence and parsimony would result in a nest egg later in life, which someone would pay to borrow, which would help fund your retirement. Now, apparently, we will have to pay someone to \"hold\" our money for us.\nBloomberg, the financial news agency, moved an explainer piece on all this last week, which suggested that this is all perfectly normal.\u00a0\nRelatively flat economic growth in the developed world, explained the explainer, combined with ever-increasing concentration of wealth, has left rich people and companies sitting on vast piles of cash for which there is weak demand.\u00a0\nThe rules of economics being what they are, theorized the author, it only makes sense that financial institutions would begin charging to store this surplus money. After all, if you own something really expensive, don't you have to pay to store it safely? A safety deposit box costs money, doesn't it?\nWhat the explainer avoided was where a lot of this money came from in the first place. Which brings us to Question No. 2: Governments have printed unimaginable amounts of money, inflating the money supply, since 2008. That must have consequences for the punters, right?\nIn early 2008, before the criminal greed of America's mortgage and investment bank industry nearly destroyed the world's economy, the balance sheet of the U.S. Federal Reserve stood at about $870 billion.\n(Speaking of 2008, there is no better example of economists being wrong. Larry Summers and Alan Greenspan, two economists who rose to manage much of the American economy, not only didn't see the subprime crisis coming, they both fought successfully against regulation of derivatives, which are essentially bets on the rise and fall of asset values. Wall Street's creation of ever more insane derivatives basically caused the meltdown while regulators looked the other way.)\nBen Bernanke launches blog defending actions as Fed chief\nLessons from the 2008 recession\nThen-Fed chair Ben Bernanke and his fellow governors, desperate to avert complete disaster, plugged in the money-printing machine (actually, money printing is done electronically, with a few computer keystrokes).\u00a0\nThe Fed balance sheet is now at nearly $4 trillion.\nThe European Central Bank began printing money in 2015: $2.6 trillion Euros over four years, or about 7,600 Euros for every person in the currency bloc. Japan, the UK and Switzerland have all done the same in differing amounts. The technical term for it is \"quantitative easing.\"\nThe central banks have used the oceans of new money to buy bonds from their own debt-addicted governments, with the intended result of lowering the cost of borrowing and encouraging risk-taking, which is at least one explanation for the nosebleed stock market levels nowadays, and the staggering levels of household debt here and in the U.S.\nBut there is serious pressure to do even more. Which brings us to Question Number Three: Winter is coming, and so is another recession. It is inevitable; 10 years have passed since the last one. What will we do this time? And\u2026the punters.\nOne thing central banks won't be able to do this time is lower interest rates significantly. As negative rates are already here. U.S. President Donald Trump, judging by his weekly rants about the incompetence of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump appointed, seems to think monetary policy should be in the hands of politicians like him. (Now that would be a confidence-inspiring move, wouldn't it?). Trump thinks cutting U.S. interest rates even further is just the ticket.\n....proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much (and that I was right!). They must Cut Rates bigger and faster, and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening NOW. Yield curve is at too wide a margin, and no inflation! Incompetence is a.....\nOther politicians, on the left, are promoting Modern Monetary Theory, which posits that governments can print unlimited amounts of money without inflationary consequences. Some even want central banks to just start sending cheques to every household.\n(Actually, Trump is right over there with the leftists, if you think about it: pro-spending, pro-debt, and pushing for even looser monetary policy).\nAnd of course the central banks are increasingly shackled by the fact that citizens and governments owe so very much; at this point, having helped create this mess to save us all from the earlier mess, they haven't much choice but to leave interest rates where they are for many years to come.\nThis much is absolutely true: we are in unknown territory, out past the \"here be monsters\" sign. None of us has any idea how this will turn out, economists included. As we saw in 2008, the collateral damage when things start to go badly can be devastating. Personally, I have a bad feeling about it all, but then I'm not an economist.\nI'm with Bruce Springsteen, also a non-economist, who once put it this way: \"Blind faith in your leaders \u2026 will get you killed.\"\nBy \"you,\" he did not mean the top .5 per cent, with their insider information and high-speed trading algorithms and political influence and vast, expanding piles of cash. They'll be fine. When Donald Trump, a member of that cohort, said in 2015 that the system is rigged, he was right, just not in the way he meant.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

It added there are also effects of climate-related investments on growth and employment.\nHamilton said\u00a0environmental regulations targeting emissions can give companies an incentive to invest in knowledge and technology.\n\"That's a big plus,\" he said, adding that such technologies can often then be applied in new ways to other sectors and activities, amplifying the positive impact.\u00a0\nHamilton said\u00a0getting governments worldwide to act on climate change has been hard because reducing greenhouse gas emissions is costly in the short-term, but the impact is uncertain, won't be felt for years, and is spread around the world: \"It looks like a bad deal.\"\nThe deal looks a lot better when co-benefits are taken into account, because their impact tends to be certain, immediate and local, he adds.\nIt's something that policy makers are starting to recognize.\nIn collaboration with the B.C. government's Climate Action Secretariat, Ann Dale, a professor in the School of Environment and Sustainability at Royal Roads University, has mapped some of the co-benefits of climate change action.\nThat way, policy makers will know how to look for and track them \u2014\u00a0the map shows, for example, that greener buildings lead to higher energy efficiency, better water quality, and new job opportunities:\u00a0\"So that you can show to political decision makers it's not jobs versus on the environment \u2014\u00a0there's money to be saved by doing the right thing, and there's benefits to be achieved.\"\nThat said, there can also be tradeoffs between reducing emissions and other environmental goals. For example, the UN report notes that inappropriate use of biofuels or diesel can lead to increased air pollution.\nDale said\u00a0it all points to the importance of more integrated planning by governments. \"What we need them to do is track the costs and benefits when they implement a climate action.\"\nMeanwhile, taking action to adapt to the impacts of climate change can have co-benefits that reduce emissions and also improve quality of life, notes Deborah Harford, executive director of the Adaptation to Climate Change team at Simon Fraser.\nFor example:\nGreen roofs to control flooding and reduce building temperatures can suck up carbon dioxide and also reduce emissions by reducing the demand for air conditioning.\nRestoring wetlands to reduce flooding can sequester carbon and cut emissions by reducing the energy needed to filter and pump stormwater.\nShe said\u00a0so far, the cost and benefits of things like removing or restoring natural infrastructure like wetlands isn't being considered often enough.\nBut it's an idea that's gaining traction, she added.\n\"This new narrative about low-carbon resilience and all the co-benefits is literally emerging now and is actually starting to be taken up very quickly.\"\nOn the flip side, not investing in climate change action could hurt countries economically in the longer term, Harford warned.\nShe thinks given all the benefits, the world would be moving toward greener technologies such as renewable power, albeit more slowly, even if climate change weren't a pressing problem.\n\"Countries that fail to get on this new shift are going to be the ones that are left behind in the new economy,\" she said. \"Because it's coming.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Canada's economy would be less hurt by climate change than other countries, Moody's says", "description": "Consulting firm says climate change will come with winners and losers, economically speaking", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/climate-change-moody-s-1.5199652", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5199836.1562254057!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/europe-weather-france.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 04, 2019 12:32 PM ET", "2019-07-04T17:06:21.233Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Consulting firm Moody's Analytics says climate change will take a heavy toll on the world's economy, but not all countries are likely to pay an equally heavy\u00a0price.\nIn a new report, Moody's tried to assess the economic impacts that would entail if some of the more dire predictions of climate change come to pass in the coming decades. The report is based on the extensive report that the Nobel Prize-winning\u00a0Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change put out last fall, in which the UN agency laid out a number of dire predictions for what may be in store for\u00a0the planet's climate in the years to come.\nThe main takeaway of that report is that it is basically already too late to hold the global temperature rise to just one degree Celsius\u00a0\u2014 and concludes much bigger temperature rises are quickly becoming more likely, if not inevitable.\nThe IPCC report concluded that the economic impact of a two-degree rise in global temperature could be as much as $69 trillion US, and even limiting the rise to 1.5 degrees would come with a $54-trillion price tag.\nThe Moody's report took a deeper dive into those scenarios, and tried to break down how different parts of the planet would see their economies impacted by a hotter climate. Broadly, the Moody's report breaks the impact of a hotter planet\u00a0into six areas:\nMoody's then looked at all those factors, and tried to come up with the likely economic impact based on how bad things get. One scenario assumes the global temperature rises by one degree in the next century. A second assumes an increase of 1.9 degrees. A third assumes a 2.4-degree rise, while the most dire scenario assumes a 4.1-degree average increase.\nAs Moody's crunched the numbers, one trend quickly became clear: emerging economies in parts of the world that are already generally warm fare worse. Bigger, industrialized economies in the northern hemisphere generally fare better.\nIf the more dire predictions come to pass, no country will be hit as hard as Saudi Arabia, by Moody's calculations. \"As the second largest oil producer in the world, Saudi Arabia is the most negatively affected country by climate change. Not only does it get hit on tourism and productivity, but the reduction in oil prices limits government revenue,\" the report says.\nIf the most dire scenario comes to pass, Saudi Arabia's economy will be more than 10 per cent smaller in 2048 than it would otherwise have been. Even under the best case scenario of just a one-degree uptick in temperature, the Saudi economy is expected to be 0.6 per cent smaller than it would otherwise be, three decades from now.\nThe second-most hard hit economy would be Hong Kong, largely because the Chinese territory is expected to lose a lot of valuable real estate to higher sea levels. \"As sea levels rise, and destroyed land cuts rents, weaker income growth results in weaker consumer spending,\" Moody's said.\nAmong large economies, India is hit harder than anyone. Because of the country's large itinerant labour force \"the country suffers greatly from the heat stress impact channel,\" Moody's said. \"Agricultural productivity also falls, and the hit from human health effects is roughly equivalent to the hit from agriculture.\"\nThe impact on China, meanwhile, is\u00a0fairly modest, with a loss of between -0.19 per cent in the best case scenario for the climate, to -0.62 per cent for the worst.\nOther big losers are clustered in Southeast Asia, the Middle East\u00a0and Africa, including Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Kuwait, Indonesia,\u00a0Russia, and Egypt, all of which can expect tough times ahead as the planet warms.\nBut not only will some countries not have to pay as heavy a price, some are poised to actually come out ahead. That's a list that includes Canada. Across all temperature scenarios, Canada's economy is poised to eke out small gains, according to Moody's.\nThat's because when all the changes to things like tourism demand, crop yields and the growing season are factored in, there's a slight net positive.\nAssuming a one-degree rise, Moody's forecasts a Canadian economy that's about the same in 2048 as it would otherwise be. If the impact is 1.9 degrees, the GDP impact inches up to 0.16 per cent. At 2.4 degrees, it's 0.1 per cent.

The report is based on the extensive report that the Nobel Prize-winning\u00a0Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change put out last fall, in which the UN agency laid out a number of dire predictions for what may be in store for\u00a0the planet's climate in the years to come.\nThe main takeaway of that report is that it is basically already too late to hold the global temperature rise to just one degree Celsius\u00a0\u2014 and concludes much bigger temperature rises are quickly becoming more likely, if not inevitable.\nThe IPCC report concluded that the economic impact of a two-degree rise in global temperature could be as much as $69 trillion US, and even limiting the rise to 1.5 degrees would come with a $54-trillion price tag.\nThe Moody's report took a deeper dive into those scenarios, and tried to break down how different parts of the planet would see their economies impacted by a hotter climate. Broadly, the Moody's report breaks the impact of a hotter planet\u00a0into six areas:\nMoody's then looked at all those factors, and tried to come up with the likely economic impact based on how bad things get. One scenario assumes the global temperature rises by one degree in the next century. A second assumes an increase of 1.9 degrees. A third assumes a 2.4-degree rise, while the most dire scenario assumes a 4.1-degree average increase.\nAs Moody's crunched the numbers, one trend quickly became clear: emerging economies in parts of the world that are already generally warm fare worse. Bigger, industrialized economies in the northern hemisphere generally fare better.\nIf the more dire predictions come to pass, no country will be hit as hard as Saudi Arabia, by Moody's calculations. \"As the second largest oil producer in the world, Saudi Arabia is the most negatively affected country by climate change. Not only does it get hit on tourism and productivity, but the reduction in oil prices limits government revenue,\" the report says.\nIf the most dire scenario comes to pass, Saudi Arabia's economy will be more than 10 per cent smaller in 2048 than it would otherwise have been. Even under the best case scenario of just a one-degree uptick in temperature, the Saudi economy is expected to be 0.6 per cent smaller than it would otherwise be, three decades from now.\nThe second-most hard hit economy would be Hong Kong, largely because the Chinese territory is expected to lose a lot of valuable real estate to higher sea levels. \"As sea levels rise, and destroyed land cuts rents, weaker income growth results in weaker consumer spending,\" Moody's said.\nAmong large economies, India is hit harder than anyone. Because of the country's large itinerant labour force \"the country suffers greatly from the heat stress impact channel,\" Moody's said. \"Agricultural productivity also falls, and the hit from human health effects is roughly equivalent to the hit from agriculture.\"\nThe impact on China, meanwhile, is\u00a0fairly modest, with a loss of between -0.19 per cent in the best case scenario for the climate, to -0.62 per cent for the worst.\nOther big losers are clustered in Southeast Asia, the Middle East\u00a0and Africa, including Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Kuwait, Indonesia,\u00a0Russia, and Egypt, all of which can expect tough times ahead as the planet warms.\nBut not only will some countries not have to pay as heavy a price, some are poised to actually come out ahead. That's a list that includes Canada. Across all temperature scenarios, Canada's economy is poised to eke out small gains, according to Moody's.\nThat's because when all the changes to things like tourism demand, crop yields and the growing season are factored in, there's a slight net positive.\nAssuming a one-degree rise, Moody's forecasts a Canadian economy that's about the same in 2048 as it would otherwise be. If the impact is 1.9 degrees, the GDP impact inches up to 0.16 per cent. At 2.4 degrees, it's 0.1 per cent. And if the temperature rises by four degrees in the next three decades, Canada's economy is projected to be 0.3 per cent greater than it would otherwise have been.\nThe forecast for the U.S. is a bit of a wash, as the most optimistic temperature increase would hurt the U.S. economy to the tune of 0.9 per cent, while the most dire would see a 0.8 per cent expansion. \"But it would be too simplistic to say that climate change does not hurt the U.S.,\" Moody's said, noting that some parts of the country would be badly hurt by disasters and rising sea levels, whereas others would benefit.\nCanada and the U.S. aren't the only countries to come out relatively unscathed, in the economic aggregate.

He compared the situation in long-term care settings to a \"raging wildfire\" during his Wednesday news conference.\nCanadian Forces personnel have already been deployed to Quebec to help out in the hard hit long-term care facilities there. On Wednesday, Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said he's asked the federal government to send 1,000 additional soldiers to help staff the\u00a0 institutions.\nLegault told reporters at his daily briefing that he made the request because the province has not been able to find enough trained workers to meet the system's immediate needs, even after bringing in 350 medical specialists, as well as other nurses from elsewhere and nursing students.\nThe number of residences in Quebec considered to be in a \"critical situation\" nearly doubled in the past week, going from 41 to 80.\u00a0\nIn all, approximately 850 of the 1,041 people who have died from COVID-19 in Quebec were residents of CHSLDs or seniors' homes.\nIn Ontario, 128 residences are currently dealing with active COVID-19 outbreaks.

Trudeau last week said the federal government was planning to consult with the provinces on topping-up wages of lower paid essential workers, but it's not yet clear how or when that might happen.\nTrudeau also said the federal government is co-ordinating\u00a0with provinces and territories about how to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but he said each will make its own decision\u00a0given the different circumstances of every region.\n\"We recognize that different provinces will make different decisions about how and where to start restarting and reopening their economies,\" Trudeau said Wednesday during his daily briefing.\nThe decision around when to reopen the border with the U.S. is a nationwide measure and any change in that decision will come from the federal government, he said.\nWATCH | Ontario calls for military help for long-term care:\nA federal official Wednesday expressed concerns that Indigenous communities\u00a0will face elevated risks of COVID-19 infections once provinces and urban centres begin easing\u00a0lockdown restrictions.\u00a0\nValerie Gideon, senior assistant deputy minister for the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, says\u00a0COVID-19 rates in Indigenous communities are currently running below the national percentage due to protection efforts.\u00a0\n\"There are communities that are 20 minutes from an urban centre. Some communities are in the middle of an urban centre. It is impossible for those communities to be completely closed off if cities decide to open up their operations.\"\nTrudeau's remarks come a day after\u00a0Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam made similar remarks. Tam, who was speaking at a daily briefing on Tuesday, urged continued vigilance around public health measures and\u00a0said steps taken by Canadians across the country to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus have prevented an explosion of cases.\u00a0\nTam said Tuesday that health officials across the country are closely monitoring for \"continued and stable slowing of the epidemic\" as they plan for what comes next.\n\"But we are still a ways off and the path remains uncertain,\" Tam said, adding that she knows questions around recovery and what comes next are on everyone's mind. While there are a lot of unknowns about the path forward, Tam said the actions Canadians have taken in recent weeks have been critical to slowing the spread of the virus.\n\"There is no doubt that our sacrifices and every day inconveniences over the past weeks have prevented an explosive outbreak in Canada like the ones that have overwhelmed health-care systems in places like Italy, Spain and New York.\"\nThe virus, which was first identified in China in late 2019, causes an illness called COVID-19.

It's not always easy to find out \u2014 and that's part of the problem.\nSome of the most recent figures come from a study done by John Lester, an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy.\nAccording to his report, the federal government and the four largest provinces in Canada collectively spend about $29 billion a year on business subsidies \u2014 delivered through the tax system, spending programs and government businesses enterprises.\nAlberta leads the charge among the other provinces, Lester told The Sunday Edition.\u00a0In the 2014-15 fiscal year, per-person subsidies in Alberta were $640 \u2014 about $100 ahead of the next most generous jurisdiction, Quebec.\nLester said that accessing these figures was one of the hardest projects he's ever undertaken.\nWhile there have been significant improvements in the data provided by the federal government and in some of the provinces, Alberta remains an outlier, he said.\n\"I had to resort to Access to Information requests to find out which [spending] programs were in operation and how much money was allocated to each.\"\nBeyond the dollar amounts, Roberta Lexier said Canadians also need transparency about the conditions attached to the subsidies.\n\"There's almost zero strings attached,\" Lexier said. \"This became clear with General Motors, for instance, when a decade ago they received a massive bailout which ended up costing the taxpayers about $4-5 billion, and then not long ago they just announced they're closing a plant in Oshawa.\"\n\"What was that money for?\" she asked.\nLexier also argued that much of corporate welfare is made possible outside subsidies \u2014 through tax evasion and offshore tax havens, for example.\nShe said the oil and gas industry is estimated to be sitting on $260 billion of environmental liabilities \u2014 something the public may very well end up paying for.\n\"So much of this is hidden costs, or subsidies that aren't framed as subsidies,\" Lexier said.\nLexier believes these handouts reflect lopsided government priorities.\n\"[Finance Minister] Bill Morneau, in his 2018 economic report, announced that corporations would receive $14 billion in new tax breaks,\" she said.\n\"That would be about the cost of a nationwide daycare program \u2026 and that's just one example of where money could be spent on social programs.\"\nWhile it's become accepted wisdom that the market can and should balance itself out, the same argument doesn't seem to apply when it comes to corporations asking for help, Lexier added.\n\"So much of this argument is contradictory and self-serving,\" she said. \"We're told all the time that the market is supreme and functions best without government interference. That's basically the premise of neo-liberal economics \u2026 But when government largesse flows the way of corporations, then that's fine.\"\nAnd this is happening at a time when corporations are raking in record profits, she added.\n\"Where are those subsidies actually going?\" she asked. \"Are they going to creating good jobs or are they going to shareholders and CEOs?\"\nLexier, who is a historian of the NDP, has been researching David Lewis's famous campaign against \"corporate welfare bums.\" In fiery speeches on the 1972 federal election campaign trail, Lewis would call out individual multinational corporations that received large subsidies while deferring their taxes.\n\"The NDP elected 31 MPs in 1972 during that campaign, which was their biggest caucus to that point,\" Lexier said. \"It seemed Canadians were really receptive to calls to rebalance this tax burden and direct government spending to something other than corporate welfare.\"\nLexier believes the fight against corporate welfare calls for another champion today.\n\"I think in our current context, a similar campaign would work incredibly well,\" she said. \"It's in the interests of corporations, and in some cases in the interests of governments to keep some of this quiet\u2026 It's going to take a lot of guts and it's going to take somebody stepping up.\"\nFor Lester, the issue is less about corporate welfare and more about flawed policies.\n\"While I think that only a small portion of these subsidies that governments offer actually work in the sense that they raise real income, I would be a little bit reluctant to endorse the idea that we're indulging in corporate welfare on a massive scale,\" he said.\nLester found that while around 70 per cent of all government subsidies are intended to improve economic performance and create jobs, most of them are not in fact meeting that objective.\n\"The idea behind that would have to be that you don't think the market is working properly and that the income of Canadians \u2014 not just the people who are being subsidized but the income of all Canadians \u2014 would on average be higher as a result of these subsidies.\n\"It's really tricky to do that right. You've got to be able to identify the sector, set up a subsidy that's appropriate in the circumstances, and then you have to figure out who's going to pay for it. If you're not careful, you're going to get the average Canadian subsidizing people who earn higher incomes.\"\nAt best, only a third of subsidies intended to raise real income actually achieve that objective, Lester said.\nThat's because, in order to finance these subsidies, governments have to either raise taxes or cut other kinds of spending, he said.\n\"The net creation of jobs that we're getting from that is pretty much zero,\" he said.\nThe battle for Lester, then, is for the public to convince governments to evaluate these programs in a more critical way.\n\"I think we should probably give politicians the benefit of the doubt and seeing that in most cases \u2026 they are offering subsidies to business because they think it makes the economy perform better. And I think it's our job to tell them that no they're not doing that,\" Lester said.\n\"I think it's better to think of them as being well-intentioned but poorly-informed, rather than being in bed with corporations.\"\nClick 'listen' near the top of this page to hear the full conversation.\n"}, {"author": "Murray Brewster, Catharine Tunney", "title": "Trudeau-Trump spat cast a shadow over a summit that got things done, say leaders", "description": "Trump called Trudeau 'two-faced' after the PM was caught talking about the president in a reception video", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nato-summit-leaders-candid-comments-1.5383451", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Dec 04, 2019 6:05 AM ET", "2019-12-04T20:44:35.298Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It was an unguarded misery-loves-company moment that went viral. It\u00a0ended with U.S. President Donald Trump taking another personal shot at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, calling him \"two-faced.\"\nNormally, royal receptions for visiting dignitaries at Buckingham Palace offer media outlets the video equivalent of\u00a0wallpaper: boring, harmless.\u00a0But Tuesday's reception turned into an international incident when video emerged of Trudeau at the reception\u00a0apparently venting to French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson about Trump's unexpected marathon news media availability on Tuesday.\nThe fuss threatened to overshadow the military alliance's 70th anniversary celebrations in London and appears to have driven another personal wedge between Trudeau and the mercurial Trump.\nTrudeau\u00a0attempted to calm the political storm today, saying that he simply expressed surprise to Macron and Johnson at having to conduct a 30-minute press conference with Trump ahead of their bilateral meeting.\nOn the video, Johnson can be heard asking Macron, \"Is that why you were late?\"\n\"He was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference at the top,\" Trudeau is heard\u00a0saying.\nTrump is not mentioned by name in the exchange, but the video provided fodder for more behind-the-scenes and in-front-of-the-camera drama.\nTrudeau said today that the U.S. president caught his own staff off-guard by saying the next G-7 summit will be hosted by the Americans at the presidential retreat at Camp David.\n\"Every different leader has teams whose jaws drop at unscheduled surprises. Like that video itself, for example,\" he said.\nTrudeau's attempt at a walkback did nothing to mollify Trump, who\u00a0took a shot at the prime minister today before leaving the NATO summit early.\n\"He's two-faced,\" Trump said at a media availability with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"I find him to be a nice guy, but the truth is, I called him out on the fact that he's not paying two per cent and I guess he's not very happy about it.\"\u00a0\nTrump appears to believe that Trudeau's quip was a response to an awkward moment during the two leaders' news conference the previous day, when he put the\u00a0prime minister on the spot over whether Canada is meeting its defence spending commitments.\nHe jokingly called Canada \"slightly delinquent\" on meeting NATO's benchmark of spending the equivalent of two per cent of GDP on defence.\nTrudeau said he's confident he still has a good working relationship with Trump.\n\"I think people know that the relationship between Canada and the United States is deep and goes far beyond the relationship between the prime minister and the president, although I will say, as you all know, we have a very good and constructive relationship between me and the president,\"\u00a0Trudeau said.\nThe personal sniping as the NATO meeting ended was an echo of Trump's public meltdown after the Charlevoix G7 in 2018, when the U.S. leader took offence at remarks Trudeau had made at that summit's closing news conference. Back then, Trudeau told journalists Canada would retaliate against U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum products, calling the tariffs \"kind of insulting.\"\nTrump was barely in the air following the summit when he tweeted from Air Force One, accusing Trudeau of\u00a0being \"very dishonest and weak\" and of making up \"false statements.\"\nThe reaction from Trump this time was nowhere near as visceral, even though conservative news outlets in the U.S. have portrayed\u00a0the incident as Trudeau and other world\u00a0leaders laughing behind Trump's back.\nAs with last year's meltdown, the timing of this latest Trump eruption could have been better from a Canadian perspective. The spat blew up\u00a0as the U.S., Mexico and Canada\u00a0have been pushing for the final ratification of the new North American free trade deal \u2014 and after NATO allies had tried to present a united front and smooth over the divisions that marred the run-up to the summit.\nA source in the Canadian government tells CBC News the Trudeau PMO is less concerned about this spat with the president than it was after the\u00a0Charlevoix\u00a0blowup, saying the trade talks are coming to a positive conclusion and the Canada-U.S. relationship is solid.\nPrime Minister Johnson steered around the fallout from the dispute. He declared that the alliance is \"rock solid\" after seven decades and the moments of discord during the summit\u00a0\u2014 including a tense public exchange between Trump and Macron over the Turkish incursion into Syria and the repatriation of ISIS fighters \u2014 were no more than family squabbles.\n\"There is far, far more that unites us than divides us,\" he said.\nNATO Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg downplayed the rifts and focused on the decisions made on Wednesday.\n\"Most of the time we agree and reach concrete conclusions. Sometimes we disagree,\" he said.\n\"And the meeting today was a meeting where there was a good atmosphere. It was very constructive and most importantly it was very productive.\"\nNATO agreed to put more forces on high readiness under the \"four-30s\" plan\u00a0\u2014 a U.S. initiative that requires the alliance to mobilize 30 troop battalions, 30 squadrons and 30 warships within 30 days of an emergency.\nCanada's contribution to the readiness initiative will see the Liberal government add six fighter jets and a frigate to existing NATO deployments.\nThat brings the total Canadian commitment to 12 CF-18s, an expeditionary air task force, a C-140\u00a0maritime patrol aircraft, three frigates, a submarine, a mechanized infantry battalion, a mobile hospital\u00a0and a platoon for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear decontamination.\nTrudeau promised the government would provide the\u00a0necessary funds to ensure the units are trained and deployable on short notice.\nStolenberg also said NATO has declared that all 29 member countries would agree to use secure wireless telecommunications networks \u2014 a nod to American concerns about the Chinese tech giant\u00a0Huawei and the security of the soon-to-be built 5G network service.\nCanada has yet to decide whether it will ban Huawei\u00a0from participating in building the system here.\nAlliance delegates also talked about bringing\u00a0China into the international arms control framework, pointing to the superpower-in-waiting's massive military expansion.\nBack in Ottawa, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer cited the NATO summit video in a speech to his caucus.\n\"At a time when Canada needs strong relationships more than ever, Justin Trudeau's poor judgment, lack of professionalism and love of drama continues to weaken Canada's position on the world stage,\" Scheer said, as assembled Tory MPs yelled, \"Shame!\"\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also seized on the moment, saying Trudeau has a record of saying one thing in public and something else behind closed doors.\n\"There's many reasons to criticize Mr. Trump, but criticizing about making someone late to a cocktail party is not one,\" he said.\nDavid MacNaughton, Canada's former ambassador to the U.S., said the video gaffe must not be allowed to distract from efforts to get the trade deal ratified.\n\"The most important thing in the relationship is getting the USMCA passed,\" he told CBC, using the Americans' preferred title for the new North American free trade agreement. \"And we shouldn't be distracted by this kind of stuff. We should get the deal done.\n\"The Mexicans know what they have to do to get this across the finish line, and they should just do it.\"\nThe deal has stalled in the U.S. Congress, where Democrats have been pushing for stricter enforcement measures on its labour and environmental standards. The American labour movement fears U.S. jobs will continue to head south if Mexico doesn't raise wages and bring in collective bargaining in a timely manner.\n\"What the Democrats have asked for in terms of enforceability, and what [U.S. Trade Representative Robert] Lighthizer has asked for in terms of enforceability, is what they're going to have to do to get this thing done,\" said MacNaughton.\n\"I know it's interesting, speculating ... and gossip and everything else, but it isn't actually enduring.\"\n.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JustinTrudeau</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EmmanuelMacron</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a> and other VIPs shared a few words at a Buckingham Palace reception Tuesday.

Not a bad way to describe Alberta and Saskatchewan.\nSir Frederick Haultain, the first premier of the North-West Territories, argued the territory that went on to become the two provinces in 1905\u00a0should enter Confederation as one province named Buffalo\u00a0\u2014\u00a0an idea Sir Wilfrid Laurier rejected.\nAs former Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall says, \"It's on the record, maybe quite prescient, that the province, if it was admitted as recommended, would rival the centre for economic and political influence.\"\nWall recalls that the unofficial motto in Saskatchewan is \"hard to spell but easy to draw,\" referring to the straight line between the two provinces. But that line is a bit more blurry to the eye these days as a combination of factors \u2014 political, economic and social \u2014 has been working to reconstruct the \"Buffalo\" Haultain envisioned.\nSaskatchewan got out of the Confederation gate with the kind of alacrity that Alberta could only dream of. Its population growth was explosive in the early years, easily outpacing its neighbour to the west.\nA rich deposit of oil, discovered in Leduc, Alta., in 1947, changed all that. The trajectories shifted dramatically to where Alberta now has four times the population with a GDP that is more than four times the size.\nPolitical scientist Duane Bratt with Calgary's\u00a0Mount Royal University\u00a0argues this is why any alignment or alliance can't really be a partnership of equals. But he says it can still serve both.\n\"Saskatchewan benefits by having the greater heft of Alberta, and Alberta has the benefit of saying it's not just us.\"\nFor years, Saskatchewan was little more than a source of labour for an Alberta with the kind of swagger only wealth can buy. It must have been irritating.\nSaskatchewan was acknowledged for its role in creating social programs like medicare, but was an economic afterthought.\nAs Wall puts it, \"We saw so many Saskatchewan people seeking opportunity in Alberta. You know, that's the origins of the roots of the joke, or I guess the one-liner, about how McMahon Stadium, when the Riders are in town, is maybe the third-largest city in Saskatchewan.\"\nOil and gas, potash, uranium and gold finally helped Saskatchewan graduate out of \"have not\" status. The province no longer receives equalization \u2014\u00a0a word and a program that can make the staunchest Canadian recoil and retreat from the inevitable misinformation and inflamed rhetoric it engenders.\nBecoming a \"have\" province changed everything. Saskatchewan has embraced its heightened hubris and has joined the fight with Alberta.\nWhat is the fight all about? It's essentially about resource-based economies without sufficient electoral power within the federation. It's about being, in the view of the political leadership of Alberta and Saskatchewan, lectured and hectored about the source of their wealth and its impact on the climate, with little consideration to the realities of the economies and their respective contributions for the federal bottom line.\nAdam Legge, the head of the Business Council of Alberta, summarizes it this way: \"I think both Albertans and Saskatchewanians feel that many parts of the country are very happy to take the money that's transferred to them through the wealth generated out of our provinces, but are also very happy to obstruct the further development and progress of those sectors across the country.\"\nIt is for this reason that \"Buffalo\" has found common cause, according to Legge.\n\"It's easier to dismiss one voice,\" he says. \"Aligned voices of the two provinces, I think, can bring some additional heft.\"\nWall says each province has made different choices politically and economically that allowed Saskatchewan to lose its early advantage. Although the two provinces diverged in their paths for decades, this year's federal election results intensified an alliance that has been building over the past dozen years or so.\nWall was often emblematic of that alliance, even though \u2014 as premier \u2014 he never shied away from trying to lure people and businesses to move from Alberta to Saskatchewan.\nDuring the early years of Rachel Notley's time as Alberta's premier, before she got her elbows up when advocating for the oil and gas sector, Wall was, for many conservatives, the de facto political spokesperson for the energy industry.\nIn my conversation with him, he refers to \"Buffalo\" easily and often.\u00a0 (The word was also chosen for the name of the Buffalo Project, a conservative-leaning political action committee he helped get off the ground.)\nWall points out that Alberta and Saskatchewan have come together many times before in times of crisis, including the fight against the National Energy Program, in which Saskatchewan's NDP premier, Allan Blakeney, supported Alberta's PC premier, Peter Lougheed. It happened again during the fight for the notwithstanding clause in the constitution.\nWall says, \"I think there have been occasions throughout our history where\u00a0I'll call it the spirit of Buffalo, that place that was supposed to be both provinces together, was manifest in governments that didn't agree on everything ideologically, but understood their interests were aligned.\"\nThat alignment, that alliance, is hardening.\nSoon after the votes were counted in the federal election, and Saskatchewan and Alberta went blue with the lonely exception of one NDP seat in Edmonton, premiers Scott Moe and Jason Kenney each sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with a list of demands that were similar in content and tone.\nThose demands included getting the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion built, ensuring more pipelines can follow, equalization reform and scrapping the federal carbon tax.\nSince then, some language has changed.\nSaskatchewan is now asking for a one-year reprieve from the carbon tax. An equalization re-write is on pause and the more immediate request is for some kind of rebate or payment on a per-capita basis to resource-based economies.\nAs Wall says, \"If they propose some non-constitutional things to the federal government and they have an earnest partner, then the two of them could get a lot done. And I think that might alleviate some of the alienation ... the pressure that's building.\"\nWall seems to believe, based on his observations post-election, that Trudeau might be on the cusp of a kind of epiphany.\n\"I saw, for the first time that I could remember, maybe some humility. Or he was chastened, or something. But I just sensed that this might be different, that he wasn't just expressing words or thoughts and prayers for the West, but a desire to reach out. And, if he does, I think he'll find in those two premiers willing partners who are also federalists,\" says Wall.\nBut these \"federalists\" have also been among the loudest voices warning of a unity crisis.\nCritics have characterized it as stoking a separatist sentiment. Others have argued that both Kenney and Moe are simply reflecting a deepening and dark angst and sounding the alarm. No one disagrees that there is a strong feeling of alienation, anger and anxiety in both provinces.\nA recent Wexit rally attracting several hundred people in Edmonton is seen as a warning shot.\nIt's proving to be a struggle for business and political leaders to quantify and respond to voices growing louder and demanding a more radical reaction to perceived inequity in the federation.\nHowever, as Legge from the Business Council of Alberta says:\u00a0\"The escalating rhetoric around alienation and separation might bring the parties to the table in a more constructive way. It might not. I don't know.\"\nThat sense of uncertainty is shared.\n\"I'm sensing an intensity to it here that I have not witnessed,\" says Wall. \"I hear it from people who I know are federalists, they're proud Canadians \u2026 with disappointment and sadness as a tone, saying, 'No I don't know. I don't know what else we're going to do here ... What we should do?'\"\n\"This \u2026 is different somehow,\" Wall adds.\n\"I should be doing a better job of explaining why it's different. But that's the best I can do.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The candidates: Great Slave", "description": "Patrick Scott, Katrina Nokleby face off for seat vacated by former minister Glen Abernethy", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-votes-great-slave-candidates-1.5281945", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5285788.1568664617!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/great-slave.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 16, 2019 10:00 PM CT", "2019-09-17T04:00:00.878Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Election day in the Northwest Territories is Oct. 1, and CBC North is working to bring you all the information you need to cast your ballot.

There was little progress on social issues, a\u00a0collapse of economic activity, and little movement on environmental concerns, except for a tax.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\u00a0\u00a0\nI have negotiation\u00a0and community development experience, as well as media and advocacy work for injured workers with WSCC. I have raised eight children in YK and I am a small business owner.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\u00a0\u00a0\nBirchwood Coffee Ko (Scott is a co-owner).\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's a split between economic renewal through diversification, and resolving social issues such as universal daycare, homelessness, and seniors' housing..\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\u00a0\nFrom speaking with constituents at their door\u00a0\u2014\u00a0homelessness, downtown violence, and the cost of living.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\u00a0\nBuilding appropriate homes for homeless support, with programs, and getting the polytechnic university developed as an independent institution from the GNWT with\u00a0northern-focused faculties, including a fine arts department.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\u00a0\u00a0\nMore renewable energy, and to\u00a0get fly-in\u00a0mine workers living in the N.W.T. and making a contribution to the northern economy while reducing the carbon footprint.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\u00a0\nIf you mean the Legislative Assembly, I believe we need to look at our political system and vision and design what will be the best structure for the future.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\u00a0 \nDiversify, encourage e-commerce developments, improve tourism infrastructure, and build a world-class university.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\u00a0\nSettle outstanding claims, work directly with GNWT.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\nHaven't decided. It\u00a0will depend on who all is elected.\nWould you like to be premier?\nNot ready for that at the moment.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nYellowknife is my home and I love the North. I want to ensure that the N.W.T. is on a path toward a sustainable economy while addressing the social issues we are facing. With a strong background in sciences, experience working across the N.W.T., and my social advocacy background, I will bring a unique skill set to the Legislative Assembly. Through the sciences, I have learned critical thinking, problem solving, the analyzing of data, and attention to detail.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nI've been heavily involved with a variety of organizations during my time in Yellowknife including NAPEG (the regulatory body for Engineering and Geoscience), the YWCA-NWT, Girl Guides, the Association of Consulting Engineering Companies, and others.\nBeing on boards and councils has provided me with valuable tools such as the ability to work well in a collaborative, group setting; fiscal and budgeting knowledge; and strategic planning. My work as an environmental consultant has provided me with experience working across the territory on a variety of project sites and in the communities. I've worked closely with Indigenous people throughout my career which has given me a deep appreciation and respect for them as I see the struggles the communities are facing and the want for change.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nI'm most proud of the volunteering I do in our community, such as the time I spend with the Girl Guides. I believe in the adage you can't be what you can't see, and it's important to me that I be a role model to interest young people in STEM.\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nOur economy. Without a robust economy, the N.W.T. will not be able to pay to solve the wide range of social issues facing our territory. The Conference Board of Canada has reported we are on the edge of an economic downturn in the N.W.T. while the Yukon and Nunavut are growing. We need to be active participants in the development of the Arctic in order to safeguard it for future generations and to ensure the people of the Northwest Territories benefit.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nAs Great Slave borders Yellowknife Centre, I believe the situation in the downtown is one of the biggest issues for residents in my riding. Many have expressed concern for what they believe is a worsening problem and want the 19th Assembly to effect real change in this area.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nWe are one of the only jurisdictions in this country that ships some of our most vulnerable citizens, who are struggling with mental health and addictions, to other parts of Canada. The Northwest Territories has no comprehensive relapse prevention program.\nIf elected, I will advocate for a review of current practices and work toward\u00a0change for the better. We need to engage front-line workers and those administering policies for their input as to how to serve our vulnerable citizens better.\nUltimately, I would like to see a treatment centre\u00a0in the N.W.T. that includes aftercare programs and family trauma counselling.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nIn order to reduce the territory's diesel dependency, I believe we need to explore more green energy options such as community-specific, hybrid energy systems and the possible expansion of Taltson. We also need to expand our all-weather road system and ensure that our transportation system can withstand future climate uncertainty.\nEach year, our ice roads are becoming more unpredictable, and without ice roads our communities become stranded with the cost of airfare prohibitive for most residents.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\u00a0\nI believe the government needs to work harder on the collection of data and statistics regarding programming and policy and then use that data to make better informed decisions. We need to look at improving the efficiency with how we operate the territory and we need to solicit feedback from end-users and experts when making decisions that affect their lives and work. It appears that communication between departments could be improved to streamline processes and reduce costs.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nMining is over 30 per cent\u00a0of our GDP and with the diamond mines set to close within the decade, we need to act now to stimulate exploration. When speaking with exploration companies, I hear mining companies are not interested in the N.W.T. because they have sustainability mandates for their mines to be powered with cleaner energy. When all we have to offer is diesel operations, exploration companies can't sell their finds.\nWe must remember we are competing for mining dollars in a global economy and must make investment here enticing. This could be done by investing in infrastructure such as all-weather roads to reduce shipping costs and green energy sources.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nI would make sure I listened more than I spoke. There seems to be a real disconnect between the government and the Indigenous people of this territory. We need to move away from a colonial mentality when dealing with the First Peoples of this land.\nI have often been told when working in the communities that people don't feel that they are heard.

It will take place in the modern surroundings of the new King Abdullah Financial District, with 59 towers and a few architectural wonders.\nBut for a taste of the real Saudi Arabia, summiteers need only take\u00a0a cab\u00a0south on King Fahd Road. In about half an hour they'll come to Deera Square, colloquially known as 'Chop-chop Square' for its frequent public executions.\nDespite praise from western governments for his supposedly modernizing ways, Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (often known as MBS) has overseen a near-doubling in the number of executions.\nThe swordsmen were busy on April 23, when Saudi Arabia executed 37 people in one day. All but four were members of the country's persecuted Shia minority.\u00a0The body and severed head of one of the 37 was put on public display.\nThe next group of condemned individuals\u00a0set for execution\u00a0in Saudi Arabia includes Murtaja Qureiris, who has been in prison since the age of 13. He's\u00a0accused of crimes that include leading a protest of children on bicycles during the Arab Spring movement\u00a0\u2014\u00a0when he was ten.\nMany of those executed in Saudi Arabia are poor foreigners. Saudi Arabia has sentenced people to die in recent years for such crimes as witchcraft, making potions and predicting the future. Under MBS, political opponents of the royal family have made up a large percentage of those executed.\nBut\u00a0the killing that made Saudi Arabia uniquely controversial as a site for a G20 summit was \u2014\u00a0unlike the ones in Deera Square\u00a0\u2014 never meant to be seen by the wider world.\nJamal Khashoggi's murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\u00a0has been a public relations disaster for a kingdom that has worked hard to present a face to the world very different from the one it shows at home.\nAccording to the report of UN\u00a0special rapporteur Agnes Callamard, Turkish microphones captured the killing and dismemberment of Khashoggi,\u00a0while his fiancee waited outside for him, unaware. Turkish cameras captured one of Khashoggi's killers leaving the consulate wearing the dead man's clothes.\nAnd Turkish wiretaps captured the communications between the hit squad and home base, leading foreign intelligence services to conclude that the murder realistically could not have been carried out without the approval of Mohammed bin Salman.\nThe prince's response was to deny everything and arrest the hitmen. Riyadh has made it clear that, if found guilty, they too will be headed for Chop-chop Square.\nCallamard said the Saudi investigation can't be expected to produce a true or just outcome. She wants to see a credible probe that assigns individual responsibility and examines the role of prime suspect Mohammed bin Salman.\n\"The holding of the G20 in Saudi Arabia next year is a slap in the face of all those who have fought and some of whom have died for accountability and human rights protections,\" she told CBC News, calling for the summit to be moved.\nCallamard said she admires the positions that Canada has taken on Saudi Arabia, particularly when compared to those taken\u00a0by other western nations.\n\"Canada has already taken possibly the strongest stance on Saudi Arabia and has paid a heavy price for it,\" she said.\u00a0\"The international community as a whole failed to support Canada a year or so ago when it criticized Saudi Arabia for its treatment of women activists.\"\nCallamard said Canada also has \"taken a number of stands when it comes to accountability for Mr.\u00a0Khashoggi. I think the government of Canada has probably taken the strongest stance against Saudi Arabia of all western countries, alongside with maybe Germany.\"\nIt was at the G20 Summit in Argentina in November 2018 that the crown prince made his first international appearance after the murder. Most leaders steered clear of him. Some, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, were friendly. But only one, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, spoke to him directly about the killing.\n\"It's important that Canada exercise leadership as it has so far,\" said Callamard. \"But it cannot do that on its own. Other countries must rally around Canada in a way that they haven't done so far.\"\nThe Trudeau government says it intends to keep speaking out about Saudi Arabia, but Canada is not prepared to skip the G20 summit to show its disapproval.\n\"The G20 provides a forum for Canada and its partners to take concerted action on some of the world's most pressing challenges,\" said Adam Austen, spokesman for Global Affairs. \"Canada supports the important inquiry of Agnes Callamard ... into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. This murder was an unconscionable attack on the freedom of expression of all individuals and on the freedom of the press.\n\"The explanations provided by Saudi Arabia to date are insufficient. We continue to call for a full, international independent investigation into the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\"\nCBC News also asked the Conservative Party if a Prime Minister Andrew Scheer would attend the summit \u2014 which happens after the coming\u00a0federal election \u2014 but the answer wasn't quite\u00a0clear.\n\"Conservatives have always been clear and consistent when it comes to the promotion of human rights in Saudi Arabia, China or any other country,\" said foreign affairs critic Erin O'Toole. \"We will raise these issues at the G20, the United Nations or any other multilateral gathering where members do not support human rights, the rule of law and the democratic freedom. The Trudeau Liberals have not been consistent in this regard and are not taken seriously on the world stage.\"\nAsked whether that meant the Conservatives would show up in Riyadh, party spokesperson Mey Fung replied: \"We haven't said that.\"\nGuy Caron, the NDP foreign affairs critic, said in a statement that Canada shouldn't take part in the Riyadh summit.\n\"When the Liberal government was elected in 2015, it promised the return of Canadian leadership on the international stage,\" Caron said.\u00a0\"Yet, more than eight months after committing to review arms export permits to Saudi Arabia, the government is still unable to give a timetable. In the meantime, Canadian weapons are fuelling the crisis in Yemen.\"\nCaron went on to say that the Liberals are \"not doing much better than the Conservatives before them.\"\n\"The atrocities committed by the Saudi regime are not consistent with Canadian values. Canada should not take part in the upcoming G20 summit in Riyadh. The Canadian government must stand up and reclaim its international leader status.\"\nDennis Horak, Canada's former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, was expelled during last year's diplomatic spat with the kingdom. He\u00a0told CBC News he feels that avoiding the summit, or trying to move it elsewhere,\u00a0would be an \"empty gesture.\"\n\"What would be the objective? What would we be trying to achieve?\" he asked.\n\"Normally when you put sanctions on a country or punish them in some way, it's because you're trying to get them to do something. What is that something we want them to do? Are we looking for them to remove the crown prince and put him on trial? Because that's not going to happen.\"\nThe G7, which Canada hosted last year in La Malbaie, Que., has always been a club for advanced economies that are also democracies. China has never been invited to join. Russia was expelled for bad behaviour (the annexation of Crimea) in March 2014.\nThe Group of 20, on the other hand, was never supposed to be about democracy. It was born as a leaders' summit in 2008 (previous meetings had been at ministerial level only), to provide a forum where the rich western democracies could engage with some of the biggest developing nations and emerging economies\u00a0\u2014 countries like Indonesia, India, Turkey, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico.\nA quick glance at the recent family photo in Osaka shows that the current crop of leaders is not limited to fans of democracy and civil rights. In addition to MBS, there is one other unelected autocrat:\u00a0President Xi Jinping of China, who hosted the G20 in Hangzhou in 2016.\nPutin's government is believed to have ordered several deadly attacks on\u00a0dissidents.

Read his previous articles here:\nAs climate change and energy have become one of the central issues in this campaign, I've had the chance to do a lot of writing and thinking about the platforms.\nI've written assessments of the climate platforms of the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and the Green Party as well as collaborating on a climate platform report card with Dr. Katharine Hayhoe.\nAmidst the political talking points, there's a deeper issue that is being addressed: a national reckoning on climate change may well be the legacy of the 2019 election.\nThis campaign has offered three different visions for Canada's future climate change policies from the national parties.\nThe Conservatives have proposed a plan with a few token measures to reduce domestic emissions, and their most significant climate change policies are the removal of the federal carbon tax and the introduction of a subsidy to home energy consumption via a GST cut. Their suite of policies will, it's almost certain, increase domestic emissions. That's fine, the Conservatives say, because we're going to supply the world with the energy it needs and reduce global emissions in the process.\nThe Liberals, with all the advantages of incumbency, offer the middle of the road: an aggressive domestic policy but one that will need to get more stringent over time if we're to meet our existing emissions targets.\nThe NDP and the Greens each propose a rapid remaking of our economy, in particular in certain regions, with the hope of meeting much more aggressive near-term targets. This is what the science demands, they say.\n(Not to be completely forgotten, Maxime Bernier thinks that climate scientists might have \u2014\u00a0despite his recent reminders \u2014\u00a0forgotten to consider the role of the sun. That's about all I'll have to say about the People's Party.)\nNavigating Canada's climate reckoning demands a leader who understands a few things.\nClimate science is crucial, but it's not enough.\nA leader should understand our economy and our place in the world, including the degree to which some regions of the country depend on fossil-fuel resources today.\nA leader also needs to understand how to best reduce emissions: technology is important, but the right leader also needs to understand how policies can (or can't) change behaviour, the costs of those policies, as well as the limits to the powers of the federal government in Canada.\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, an effective climate change leader for Canada must show that he or she understands the distributional impacts of our choices, not just how they affect the average person or people like them.\u00a0\nI wish I could say that any of the leaders have ticked all these boxes so far. They haven't.\nPerhaps more than anything during this campaign, I've been frustrated by lazy appeals to science.\nWhat does the science tell us about Canada's emissions?\nListening to the NDP and the Greens, you'd think that a carbon budget for Canada is a law of physics. It's not.\u00a0\nScience tells us a lot about the impacts of continued increases in global emissions (the news is bad and, in general, getting worse) and that we're going to need a rapid decrease in global emissions (net zero or lower by 2050 to avoid warning of more than 1.5 C).\nWe know that reducing global emissions is going to require rapid changes in both how much energy we use and how that energy is supplied (see the graphs below). Finally, although our political discussion is focussed on binary targets, we know that climate-related risks increase the greater our emissions are, so any emissions reductions are beneficial.\nBut, what of Canada?\nToday, we're less than two per cent of global emissions. On its own, Canada is not going to do much to mitigate climate change, even though all emissions reductions are beneficial at a global scale.\nIf we're relying on science alone, it must be said that there is no necessary or sufficient level of Canadian action that will ensure that we will meet (or prevent us from meeting) the 1.5 C or 2 C targets.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe fact that we're a small emitter should not be an excuse for inaction, but neither can we assume that other countries will mirror our policies.\nI'd like to see our leaders ask a simple question of their plans: if the rest of the world implemented our policies, would we meet global goals?\nFor me, the 2030 coal phase out, a carbon price at $50 per tonne by 2022, and clean fuel regulations proposed by the Liberals, as well as the more aggressive policies proposed by the NDP and the Greens pass this test. The Conservatives? Not so much.\u00a0\nLeadership also requires understanding our economy today.\nWhether you like it or not, mining and oil and gas constitute about one fifth of our foreign direct investment, and activities directly related to fossil fuel extraction are about 10 per cent of our GDP.\nOur most emissions-intensive industries directly employ hundreds of thousands of Canadians, with many more jobs linked to these activities directly via supply chains and financial transactions or indirectly via municipal, provincial and federal taxes.\nNational shares also hide regional and local concentrations: in some parts of the country, everything is connected to oil and gas or coal power, and an end to that industry is an end to the community.\nThere is no just transition which can cushion a region fully against government policy that shuts down its primary economic engine in less than a decade.\nLeadership means acknowledging the real, human costs of policies, not pretending the costs don't exist. It also means acknowledging that these costs won't be spread evenly across the country just as our emissions (see below) are not evenly distributed.\nWhile Canada won't solve climate change on its own, we are very exposed to the potential actions of others when or if they come to act aggressively on this problem. So, let's talk about what happens if the world acts on climate change, because for the most part, the leaders haven't been.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf the world acts on climate change aggressively enough to meet global goals, it will mean less global oil demand.\nIn all the model runs used to develop the IPCC 1.5\u00a0C report, there are no scenarios in which the world acts aggressively on climate change and continues to use more oil year over year: the math just doesn't work.\u00a0Even the global oil majors agree on this point.\nPipelines have been a source of a lot of discussion during this campaign. It's obvious that, if we're not going to produce more oil, we don't need more pipelines.\nI'd rather see our leaders justify whether, in a world in which action on climate change is lowering oil demand, we should be producing more oil here.\nThe Liberals would answer yes, the Greens and the NDP would answer no, and the Conservatives would likely answer that they don't believe world oil demand is set to decrease, so we should build all the pipelines.\u00a0\nGas is more complicated. Using the same model runs, some predict significant declines in gas production but some also see gas as a bridge fuel allowing a rapid phase-out of coal.\nUnlike oil, we can't say with any confidence that a world acting on climate change, even with the aggressive 1.5 C goals, needs to use less gas in every year in the future than we use today.\nSo, what of campaign claims about LNG? Is there more than a grain of truth in Scheer's claims that producing more Canadian LNG will reduce global emissions? Perhaps.\nThe answer depends on whether you believe that, if we don't win the race to supply the world with LNG, someone else will claim that market share. If there's going to be LNG available to China no matter what Canada does, it's not fair to claim that whatever we do will reduce emissions by as much. But, even then, insofar as our LNG supplies are lower emissions than the potential alternatives, that would reduce emissions.\nThe science does not say that no more gas should be developed anywhere on earth if we're to meet climate change goals, and it's not clear at all that more Canadian LNG is harmful rather than helpful to the global energy transition.\nSo, why am I not giving much credence to Scheer's claims on the role of Canadian LNG in reducing global emissions?\nI'd give him a lot more credit if there were any chance he'd be willing to entertain a similar discussion about substituting away from the highest-emissions barrels in Canada's oil sands (which are among the most emission-intensive barrels produced in the world). He's not. And, since some of you are likely to take issue with this claim of mine, I've included a graph below.\nNow, what about policies?\nYou've all heard economists drone on about how carbon prices are the most cost-effective means to reduce emissions. That doesn't mean they'll necessarily be the most effective: a stringent regulation will lead to more emissions reductions than a weak carbon price every time, so we should not dismiss out-of-hand platforms without a carbon price.\nWe do know that regulations are more costly, all else equal, and demand more from government than carbon prices do. We also know that subsidies and taxes can be very expensive policies, not because they don't change behaviour in some people, but because they often pay people for doing what they would have done anyway.\u00a0\nThe Liberal, NDP and Green plans each rely on a mix of pricing, subsidies, and regulations, while the Conservative plan is more reliant on tax incentives, subsidies and talking down emissions with encouraging words from the government.\nNext to the lazy appeals to the science, one of the things that most disappointed me in the campaign was Scheer's leaving on the shelf arguably the most stringent climate change plan ever proposed by a Canadian federal government: the 2007 Turning the Corner plan. Don't believe me? Have a look. The Conservatives adopted many of the policies from the Harper era, including the transit pass credit and home retrofit subsidies. They missed the good one.\nThere's definitely a conservative answer to the risks posed to our economy by climate change and I wish we'd have seen a better push in that regard from Andrew Scheer's team.\nWhatever your preference, I hope you'll take the time to vote.

At times, the Trudeau government attempts to anoint itself as the great defender of that order \u2014 not a bad thing on its own, since multilateral institutions are supposed to keep any one country from acting unilaterally in a way that harms the rest of us.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization is one of those multilateral institutions. It's a military and political alliance, formed after the Second World War, between Europe and North America. At NATO's heart is the concept of collective defence, enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty that created it. It means that an attack against one NATO member is regarded as an attack against all of them.\nNATO has taken some heat over the past few years from Trump. The president has suggested the U.S. could withdraw from the alliance, questioned the utility of Article 5 and called member states \"delinquent\" in their defence spending.\nHe's not entirely alone on that last point; former presidents like Barack Obama also have come down on allies like Canada for not spending enough on defence, arguing the U.S. has to do too much of the heavy lifting.\nCanada appeared at first to be responding to Trump's goading on defence spending. The Trudeau government released its defence policy in 2017, promising a 70 per cent increase in defence spending over a number of years.\nBut that timeline is important. A lot of that spending is contingent on whether projects go ahead as planned. The nightmare that is military procurement in this country (ships, jets - you know what I mean) doesn't exactly bode well for any timetable.\nCanada's spending on defence this year amounts to 1.23 per cent of this country's GDP. There was a loose agreement among NATO members to shoot for the 2 per cent mark.\nWe aren't the only ones missing that mark, of course. According to NATO's latest analysis, only seven of the 29 member countries hit that target. They include the U.S., the U.K. and Greece.\nThis stuff matters as far as the 'rules-based international order' goes - but will it matter in the next federal election? Traditionally, defence issues aren't a big factor for Canadian voters.\nI remember asking an expert about that in the midst of one of our fighter jet procurement controversies: billions of taxpayer dollars on the table, millions misspent - why wasn't it bothering people more? He told me Canadians like to see themselves as peaceful people (or at least they like the image), while the sums involved are too big, too abstract to really matter at the polls.\nWhat might lift the defence file to the level of an actual election issue in 2019 is the government's handling of the military itself. I'm thinking particularly of Mark Norman, the former second in command of the military, and everything that's happened in his case over the past few months.\nNorman was accused of leaking cabinet secrets, investigated, charged and suspended from his job. Ultimately, the charge against him was dropped. Along the way, his legal team accused the Prime Minister's Office of withholding evidence and meddling in the case. Norman's case had ended but it wasn't clear if he'd get his old job back. Turns out Gen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's top soldier, was going to reinstate Norman - and Norman's replacement wasn't happy with that.\nIn the end, Norman settled with the government (no details were released); he won't be going back to his old job. But the man who replaced him, Lt. Gen. Paul Wynnyk, was so put off by the whole experience he decided to leave his job early. Basically, it's all a huge mess.\nWill Canadians buy the Opposition's claim that this is a mess created by the Liberals, that the military is in disarray because of unnecessary politicking? I don't know, but disarray in the Canadian military certainly strikes closer to home than NATO and defence spending. Stability in the military's top ranks really matters to the men and women tasked with defending our country. It might also turn out to matter to voters in October.\u00a0\nVassy Kapelos is host of Power & Politics, weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on CBC News Network.\nThe Power & Politics Power Panellists on where the big parties will be focused this week\nAmanda Alvaro,\u00a0president and co-founder of Pomp & Circumstance\nLiberals and Justin Trudeau, at the 100-day countdown to Election Day, are launching the largest Day of Action so far of 2019. Hundreds of Liberal teams across Canada will be on the doorsteps connecting with Canadians about the clear choice in this election, between the Liberal plan to invest in the middle class and the Conservative plan to go backward with cuts to vital services.\nRachel Curran,\u00a0senior associate at Harper & Associates Consulting\nThe Conservatives will be focused next week on an emergency meeting of the Public Safety Committee, which Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer pushed for, to discuss the massive data breach at Desjardins Group. They will also be highlighting agricultural issues, including ongoing trade access problems between Canada and China, ahead of the mid-July FPT Agriculture Ministers' Conference in Quebec City.\nKathleen Monk,\u00a0principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group\nNew Democrats will be in Canada's manufacturing heartland this week. The manufacturing sector has been dealt some serious blows in 2019 and folks are frustrated that politicians keep pointing fingers at one another. Jagmeet Singh will campaign alongside NDP candidate Malcolm Allen in Welland, Ont. to announce a plan to return those good, family-supporting manufacturing jobs to Canada.\n\u00c9ric Grenier's weekly look at key numbers in the political public opinion polls.\u00a0\nThe gap between the Conservatives and Liberals is narrowing \u2014 and it's mostly because of Ontario.\nA couple of polls this past week gave the Liberals the national edge over the Conservatives. It's possible that the political environment has flipped from the Conservative lead that has prevailed for the past five months.\nBut some caution is called for here. Mainstreet Research and Nanos Research, the two pollsters that put the Liberals ahead last week, have tended to post better results for the Liberals than other polling firms.\nConfirmation of a Liberal lead would have to wait until more pollsters weigh in \u2014 particularly those that have been less bullish on the Liberals in the past.\nNevertheless, the Poll Tracker is moving and the margin between the two parties is now just 2.9 percentage points. In the June 10 update, that gap was 5.7 points.\nMost of the shift can be chalked up to Ontario. The Conservatives have slipped 2.7 points there since June\u00a010, while the Liberals have gained 3.1 points \u2014 a total swing of nearly six points that's responsible for most of the movement we've seen in the national numbers.\nThe Liberals now lead in Ontario with 36.7 per cent in the Poll Tracker, compared to 32.4 per cent for the Conservatives.\nThe dial also has moved in a similar direction in most other parts of the country, particularly in Alberta, the wider Prairies and in Atlantic Canada. But it's Ontario that has the biggest electoral implications.\nThat's why \u2014 despite the Conservatives still leading by just under three points nationwide \u2014 it's virtually a toss-up as to which party would win the most seats if an election were held today.\nThey don't call Ontario \"seat-rich\"\u00a0for nothing.\nTap here to go to the full poll tracker\u00a0\nWe want to know what YOU want to know\nIrene Beaupr\u00e9 asks: What are the Conservatives, NDP and Greens promising on Indigenous issues? Are they committed to following the recommendations of the TRC? Are the Liberals promising to continue with their commitments to First Nations?\nHistorically, federal political parties haven't done all that much to court Indigenous voters. The First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit demographics have seen some of the lowest voter turnout rates \u2014 no doubt owing to a legacy of mistrust between many of them and a federal government that didn't always have their best interests in mind (the Indian residential school experience and the Inuit tuberculous policy are two obvious cases in point).\nIndeed, status Indians\u00a0\u2014\u00a0First Nations peoples with 'status' under the Indian Act \u2014 weren't even allowed to vote until reforms were pushed through by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in 1960 to extend the franchise.\nIn the modern era of reconciliation, ushered in by the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) final report documenting the horrors of residential schools, there has been a shift in Indigenous voting patterns.\nIn the 2015 federal election, First Nations members living on reserve voted in record numbers, recording a massive 14 point jump in participation, from 47.4 per cent in 2011 to 60.2 per cent in 2015. While that's still much lower than the overall voter turnout rate of 69.1 per cent, a new generation of First Nations people was clearly motivated to vote. In 2015, Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde reversed what he called a long-standing practice and cast a ballot in a federal election.\nTo that end, political parties, particularly those on the centre-left, have made more of an effort to champion Indigenous policy options to court a growing voter bloc. The 33 federal ridings with substantial Indigenous populations could be very important to the fates of all the major parties, especially with Liberals and Conservatives deadlocked in the most recent polls.\nLiberal Party\nThe current Liberal government has had a mixed record on Indigenous issues. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau clearly made reconciliation a top priority, investing billions of dollars in new money in program spending (in the last federal budget alone, 25 per cent of all new spending was earmarked for Indigenous-related initiatives). His government has lifted 58 of 105 long-term drinking water advisories on-reserve, committed $333 million over five years to revitalize Indigenous languages, passed legislation to begin reforming a badly broken child welfare system, signed a host of self-government agreements and made a series of apologies for past wrongs against Indigenous people.\nIt's a good record by many measures \u2014 but it's undermined by Trudeau's conflict with former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, the first Indigenous person to hold such an important cabinet position, and by the government's championing of some natural resources projects (hello, Trans Mountain!) against the will of coastal First Nations in B.C. And even with the new investments, Indigenous activists have argued that much more money is needed to end persistent inequities.\nLook for the Liberals to propose further, deeper reforms to the Canadian state during the election campaign, including measures to enact the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) inquiry's \"calls for justice\" to address systemic levels of violence.\nConservative Party\nThe Conservatives have not been as vocal on the Indigenous file \u2014 Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said the word \"Indigenous\" only seven times in the House of Commons over the last four years \u2014 but former Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose signalled a shift early in the last Parliament by dropping the party's longstanding opposition to an MMIWG inquiry.\u00a0\nThe party's Indigenous critic, B.C. MP Cathy McLeod, said that while the party doesn't agree with the inquiry's final \"genocide\" finding, a government led by Scheer would draw up its own proposal to implement those \"calls for justice.\"\nTrue to form, the Conservative Party also has said that it will champion oil and gas projects \u2014 and energy infrastructure initiatives like the Indigenous-led Eagle Spirit pipeline \u2014 to bring more wealth and prosperity to remote Indigenous communities that have few economic opportunities beyond the natural resources sector.\nIn 2015, the Conservative platform had three pages of specific Indigenous proposals \u2014 including a promise to establish a property ownership regime for those reserves that want it, and pitches to expand anti-gang programming and rural broadband services. Scheer could very well recommit to those promises and build on them.\nThe NDP\nThe New Democratic Party has been a champion of Indigenous issues in this Parliament, with the party's MPs frequently lambasting the prime minister and his ministers for perceived inaction. They successfully pushed the government to begin fully implementing 'Jordan's Principle' to ensure equal funding for Indigenous kids in health care and other social services, and to end discriminatory practices in the child welfare system.\nJagmeet Singh will likely look to continue the party's strong legacy on the First Nations file by promising to introduce government legislation to enact the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (as the Liberals also have promised to do) and kill pipeline projects they think lack sufficient Indigenous support. The most important aspect of the NDP's Indigenous policy platform is the idea of spending more to tackle the on-reserve housing 'crisis' that has left so many First Nations people without adequate shelter.\nThe Green Party\nElizabeth May's Green Party also has said it will act on Indigenous issues if elected but their proposals to this point have faced criticisms. Robert Jago, a prominent Montreal-based Indigenous writer, businessperson and member of the Nooksack Tribe and Kwantlen First Nation, called them \"thin, unrealistic and riddled with embarrassing errors\" in a piece for the B.C.-based online news outlet The Tyee. The party's \"Vision Green\" platform proposes a phase-out of the Indian Act, \"ideally in less than 10 years,\" and better accommodation of Indigenous interests with respect to natural resources projects.\n\u2014 John Paul Tasker, senior writer\nHave a question about the October election?

Sign-up for the newsletter and receive it every Sunday.\nVassy Kapelos, host of Power & Politics\n\"Told you so.\"\nThat's what the president of Tibet's government-in-exile said when I asked him if Canada's current diplomatic standoff with China surprised him.\nLobsang Sangay wasn't being glib, but his message to the Canadian government was blunt: they should have seen this coming.\nLet's review where things stand with China. Back in December, Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver. She was arrested because American authorities asked their friends north of the border to do so. They say she violated sanctions against Iran. Canada agreed to arrest Meng because we have an extradition treaty with the U.S.\nThis did not go over well in China. Meng isn't just anyone - she's the chief financial officer of telecommunications giant Huawei. Her dad is the company's founder. And Huawei isn't just any company - it's a Chinese corporate titan that does business all over the world. The company itself is under heavy scrutiny right now over the ties it insists it doesn't have with the Chinese government. Much of the world, including Canada, is struggling to decide whether Huawei can take part in the next-generation communications infrastructure of our countries - whether that would make it easier for Beijing to spy on us.\nChina took Meng's arrest badly. Not long after, Chinese authorities detained two Canadian men doing business in China - Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig - and eventually accused them of stealing intelligence. But the legal system works very differently over there; we don't know what evidence the authorities have against Kovrig and Spavor, if any, and the two men haven't been permitted to see a lawyer.\nNext target: canola. China blocked some Canadian shipments of canola seed, claiming something was amiss with them. Contamination? We don't know - because China still hasn't cleared the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to send a delegation there to check it out.\nAnd Beijing isn't just freezing out our agricultural inspectors. It also won't return Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland's calls. The minister even went on CBC radio recently to essentially plead for contact. \"If Chinese officials are listening today, let me repeat I would be very ... I'm very keen to meet with Minister Wang Yi or speak with him over the phone at the earliest convenience,\" Freeland told host Matt Galloway.\nMaybe government officials here can meet with the Chinese ambassador to Canada in the meantime? Not soon. Ambassador Lu Shaye - the diplomat you probably remember for suggesting Canada's complaints about China's justice system were based on an attitude of \"white supremacy\" - has been promoted. He's moving to Paris.\nAll of which restates the obvious: this is a deep diplomatic impasse. Now think back to about four years ago, when the Liberals were campaigning and promising to \"explore deeper trade relationships with emerging and established markets, including China ...\"\nAbout a year later, in September of 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier Li Keqiang held a joint press conference and announced they wanted to double bilateral trade by 2025 and look toward negotiating a formal free trade agreement.\nThat was then, this is now. And to be fair, it's not as if previous federal governments perfected the Canada-China relationship. Stephen Harper's distaste for China's human rights record abated to a degree over time; he made two trips there during his mandate and signed a number of economic agreements with Beijing.\nAll governments face the same challenge. The lure of a massive market like China's is difficult to ignore, especially after we're offered proof of how problematic our reliance on the U.S. market can be (the NAFTA negotiations over the past two years, the steel and aluminum tariffs).\nBut this has gone far beyond some conflict over market access or crop inspections. Two Canadians are being held against their will in a foreign country, with no idea if or when they'll be set free. The policies Canada decides to pursue with China won't just affect markets for our pulse crops, pork and beef. They'll affect lives - as they've affected the lives of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor already.\nThere's no way this won't be an issue during the election. Meng's extradition hearing isn't set to happen until early 2020, and most experts we've talked to on the show think the diplomatic dispute won't end until her extradition is resolved.\nThe parties have sketched out some policy points. The Liberals have backed away from pursuing formal free trade in favour of a sectoral approach, and they're reviewing whether Huawei will take part in Canada's high-speed 5G internet infrastructure. Conservatives say it should be a hard no to Huawei and a hard no on free trade.\nWill either party present detailed policy on China in time for the election campaign? Now more than ever, it seems that's exactly what Canada needs.\nNobody said dealing with China would be easy - but people like Lobsong Sangay did warn us it would be harder than we thought.\nVassy Kapelos is host of Power & Politics, weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on CBC News Network. \u00a0\nHave a question about the October election?

Scroll down to see the answer to this week's question. \nThe Power & Politics Power Panelists on where the big parties will be focused this week.\u00a0\nAmanda Alvaro\u00a0\u00a0president and co-founder of Pomp & Circumstance\nThe Liberals are staying focused on growing the economy. They will continue to promote the fact that Canadians have now created more than 1 million jobs since they took office in 2015 and that unemployment has hit a new record low. They will draw a contrast, using these gains to illustrate how Andrew Scheer and Doug Ford's Conservative cuts would hurt the middle class and put Canada's economic progress at risk.\nRachel Curran\u00a0\u00a0senior associate at Harper & Associates\u00a0Consulting\nThe Conservatives will be arguing that Trudeau does not have a credible environmental plan; instead, he has a tax plan that increases costs for families while falling well short of Canada's Paris targets. Scheer will outline his plan this month\u00a0- a plan one that takes meaningful action to protect the environment while protecting Canadian taxpayers.\nKathleen Monk\u00a0\u00a0principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group\nNew Democrats\u00a0have been rolling out their offer to Canadians in the dying days of this Parliament, setting up a summer of campaigning on these policies before this fall's election.\u00a0Look for Jagmeet Singh to continue this next week to play to a traditional NDP strength: consumer protection and standing up to big telecoms.\n\u00c9ric Grenier's weekly look at key numbers in the political public opinion polls.\u00a0\nThis time four years ago, pundits and strategists were furiously re-thinking the coming election.\nJustin Trudeau's Liberals had been leading in the polls for nearly two years, but the upset victory by Rachel Notley's Alberta New Democrats in May 2015 sent support for the federal NDP soaring. On Jun. 8, 2015, the Poll Tracker put the NDP at the front of the pack for the first time that year, with 31 per cent to the Conservatives' 30 per cent and the Liberals' 27 per cent.\nThe fall election was suddenly looking unpredictable. Voters were on the move \u2014 and they kept on moving straight through to the Oct. 19, 2015 vote.\nCanadians are looking a lot less mobile these days.\nVoting intentions swung significantly in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin story in February, but since the beginning of March \u2014 now running on three months \u2014 the trend lines have been fairly static. The Conservatives have led by between three and six percentage points over the Liberals, while the New Democrats have been stuck somewhere around 16 per cent.\nThe only party on the move has been the Greens, but while they have put themselves in a position to win a few more seats \u2014 and are polling ahead of the NDP in Atlantic Canada \u2014 their numbers are a long way from forcing another complete re-think of the fall election.\nVoters can certainly move quickly in a matter of weeks. That shift in the spring of 2015 toward the NDP was followed by another shift away from them and to the Liberals in the fall.\nSo there is still plenty of time for things to change between now and October.\nBut the polls don't always move. Campaigns don't always change people's minds. They did in 2006, 2011 and 2015, but they didn't in 2004 and 2008.\nWe don't know where 2019 will end up. For now, it seems that Canadians are staying put.\nTap here to go to the full poll tracker\nWe want to know what YOU want to know\nJames Miller asked: I would like someone to ask our politicians what can be done about getting an answer to questions that are asked. Avoiding answering happens all the time. Could the Speaker of the House ensure an answer? \nPeople on Parliament Hill like to say there's a reason it's called \"question\" period and not \"answer\" period. If you're looking for a straight answer, you're not likely to find it in QP. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule.\nThe whole daily question period exercise is less a genuine effort to solicit answers from the government and relevant ministers on issues - and more a chance to score partisan potshots as the cameras roll. As my colleague Aaron Wherry once wrote, the session is \"only vaguely a place for questions. Generally, it's a time for invective and accusation.\"\nAnd because it's such a politically charged environment, governments typically stick to their scripts to avoid saying anything that could be used against them down the line. They turn to the comfort of talking points, largely drafted by a team of political staffers and MPs at 'QP prep' sessions ahead of the hour-long verbal slugfest. This isn't a practice unique to Conservatives or Liberals or New Democrats \u2014 they all do it.\nMost historians point to the introduction of parliamentary broadcasting as the beginning of the end of genuine debate. TV cameras went live in the Commons for the first time in 1977. The constrained timelines \u2014 questions and answers typically can be no more than a minute \u2014 see to it that detailed answers are rare. Most MPs are just interested in scoring a good clip that will make it on the nightly news or into tightly-edited video packages for dissemination on social media channels.\nThat's not to say it isn't still a useful exercise. It's a chance for the opposition parties to hold the government to account each and every sitting day \u2014 to press them on scandals or instances of incompetence, or to demand action on files that matter to constituents. And because most of the parliamentary press gallery tunes in to QP regularly, it's a chance for the opposition benches to draw attention to issues important to them and their parties in the hopes that journalists might write a story or two.\nIt's hard for governments to ignore issues raised in QP outright; they'll often make changes to policies simply to make a particular line of questioning go away. A recent example is the outrage over the transfer of child murderer Terri-Lynne McClintic from a traditional penitentiary to an Indigenous healing lodge. After weeks of questioning, the Liberal government made changes to the transfer process.\nWhile journalists might tire of hearing the same questions and answers for days on end, it still serves as an exercise in political messaging. Repetition is the parties' way of connecting with voters who may be paying only vague attention to the daily cut-and-thrust of Parliament Hill.\nThat's how the Trudeau government exposed voters to their oft-cited claim that they're working for \"the middle class and those working hard to join it.\" That's how the Conservatives shifted the terms of the carbon pricing debate to a verbal brawl over a \"job-killing carbon tax.\"\nThe prime minister, a supremely powerful figure in a majority government, still has to face his critics directly in QP \u2014 something a president in a republican system, with a separate legislative branch, seldom has to worry about.\nAnd Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has given himself the added task of fielding virtually every question on Wednesday during \"the prime minister's question period,\" a British tradition that requires the PM to be on his feet throughout the hour as opposition and backbench MPs quiz him on matters of the day.\nSo while you might be frustrated by the flurry of non-answers, remember that question period offers at least a measure of accountability.\n\u2013 John Paul Tasker, senior writer \u00a0\nHave a question about the October election?

All were presented with the same questions.\u00a0Clicking the candidate's name above will take you to their survey responses. The candidates were told they had a 200-word limit for answers.\nCandidates who did not provide surveys by the deadline are invited to still do so and their responses\u00a0will be added to this story when they are received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nMy goal as your MP will be to continue to listen and engage with our community to ensure our economy is strong, life is affordable, and we are protecting our environment for future generations.\nA Liberal government will continue to work to make life more affordable for Canadians. We lowered taxes on middle class Canadians and have a plan to give a hand-up to the most vulnerable in our society by making the first $15,000 of earned income tax-free, saving the average family nearly $600 a year and lifting 40,000 more people out of poverty.\u00a0\nBy working with communities, we created the National Housing Strategy and the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive to respond to concerns about affordable housing.\nI meet with students regularly and know one of Waterloo's greatest strengths is our post-secondary institutions. A Liberal government will make university or college education more affordable, providing $1,200 more each year in Canada Student Grants. Additionally, to ensure the fiscal situation of students, we will assist with interest relief until graduates are earning $35,000/year.\nWe have a plan that looks out for middle-class Canadians and the most vulnerable, not one that gives tax cuts to millionaires.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nOur plan to invest in the middle class and build an economy that works for everyone has had remarkable results. Since our government was elected in 2015, Canadians have created over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014 about 75 per cent of them full-time \u2014 pushing unemployment to historic lows.\u00a0\nThanks to the tax-free Canadian Child Benefit and the middle-class tax cut, the typical middle-class family has more than $2,000 extra in their pockets every year. Our debt-to-GDP ratio continues on a downward trend and Canada's fiscal position is among the best in G7.\u00a0\nThere's no place like Waterloo to start a business, and that's why we've supported small businesses by lowering their tax rate from 11% in 2015 to 9% in 2019. Canada now has the lowest small business tax rate in the G7.\u00a0\nWe've also enhanced support for research and development which is especially important in a tech community like ours. If we are re-elected, we will create the Canada entrepreneur account to provide up to 2,000 entrepreneurs with as much as $50,000 each to launch their new businesses. Small businesses are our job creators and we are committed to working with them.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nToday in Canada, if you pollute, you pay. We've taken the bold step of putting a price on pollution with 90% of the money returning to the pockets of individuals and families to make greener, cleaner choices more affordable.\u00a0\nWe acknowledge that we need to do even more. If re-elected, we have committed to legally-binding, five-year milestones, based on the advice of the experts and consultations with Canadians, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. When it comes to fighting climate change, one thing is clear: doing less costs people more. We are committed to transitioning to greener energy sources. To support this in a responsible way, we will ensure energy workers and communities shape their own futures by introducing a Just Transition Act, giving workers access to the training, support, and new opportunities needed to succeed in the clean economy.\nThe best way through the climate emergency is action, not inaction. We are committed to planting an additional 2 billion trees within the next 10 years and we will increase land and ocean protections by 25% by 2025. We must take climate change seriously to keep the world our children and grandchildren grow up in safe and liveable.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nUpon election four years ago, I chose to move the MP's office to Waterloo City Hall. Waterloo is the only riding that I know of in Canada where the MP, the MPP, and the mayor are all located in the same building. I believe that all levels of government should work better together for the good people of Waterloo.\nI've called Waterloo Region home all my life. I'm proud to be the child of immigrants and to have been educated right here in Waterloo. I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Science and have been employed since.\nOur government brought back the long-form census and we have returned to making decisions based on evidence, not ideology.\nWe have an incredible community. Over the past four years, I have connected our community's expertise in the work we have done as a country because as I always say, Canada needs more Waterloo. Over the past four years, we have worked together to bring investments to our community and showcased Waterloo and Canada to the world. I ask for your support and commit to continue working hard for you to represent our riding's interests in Ottawa as your MP.\nWebsite\nResponse not yet received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI've spoken to people across Waterloo over the last several months and the vast majority of them are nervous about the future and ongoing threats related to the climate crisis.\u00a0\nThe Trudeau Liberal government hasn't done enough to fight the climate crisis and their purchasing of a pipeline was frankly irresponsible. And the Conservatives have no plan to do anything meaningful to address climate change and its consequences.\nWhen I speak to people, they're hopeful about the NDP's plan to address the climate crisis without leaving anyone behind. We will set our emissions target based on what scientists say is required to meet our Paris Agreement targets to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and invest in the jobs of the future.\nOur plan involves continuing to put a price on carbon, immediately ending fossil fuel subsidies, retrofitting homes and buildings across the country, transitioning to fully-electric transit and incentivizing the building and buying of electric vehicles.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nHere in Waterloo, people are feeling the pressure of the increasing cost of living, in part because of stagnant wages and rapidly increasing housing costs.\u00a0\nThe NDP has a comprehensive plan to address affordability. We would focus on reinvesting in public services like universal pharmacare and education. With universal pharmacare, families can save up to $500 per year. And by removing the interest on federal student loans, we will ease the transition of students from post-secondary education to the workforce.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the NDP has put forward a plan to invest in affordable housing, building 500,000 new units in the next 10 years. As MP, I would make sure that Waterloo gets its fair share.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe federal government needs to be doing so much more to tackle the climate crisis. Our collective future relies on it.\u00a0\nFirst, we need to get serious about meeting our Paris Agreement targets. We need to use scientifically based targets so that we have the highest chance of avoiding the catastrophic effects of climate change.\u00a0\nSecond, we need to start thinking about how we are going to transition our society to become net-zero. The federal government can be a leader here, starting with retrofitting all federal government buildings, electrifying government vehicles, and being a partner with municipalities to electrify and expand public transit fleets across the country.\u00a0\nThird, and most importantly, this transition needs to be just. Indigenous people need a seat at the table and the economic opportunities need to be spread fairly across society so that no one is left behind.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm Cree-Metis, with family roots in Montreal Lake First Nation in Treaty 6 Territory.\nI have years of experience fighting for meaningful change by advocating for social, economic, and environmental justice issues. Every day, I refine my advocacy skills by taking every opportunity to listen to and learn from those around me.\nI have a strong work ethic and I work hard to amplify community voices. If elected, my main priority as MP would be to listen to constituents, amplify their voices in Ottawa, and work in a non-partisan way to get good things done for Waterloo.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address\u00a0it?\nWe are one of Canada's technology champions. We need to attract and hold talent to build our lead. To do\u00a0this, we need to promote a system-level strategy that improves transportation the regional transportation network and helps control housing costs at the same time.\nWe need to support the universities that are actually driving regional growth and continue to build an arts and culture sector around our high-tech lead to attract more talent and more jobs.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe cost of living problem is primarily in the housing/transportation nexus.\nThe key is to continue our forward-looking urban and regional planning and to win federal and provincial support for our infrastructure needed. More broadly, we in the region need to support a high speed rail system for the entires Quebec-Windsor corridor.\nWe also need to implement a national housing policy focused a massive expansion of social\u00a0 housing. I will work to strengthen our links with he relevant Federal agencies and decision makers.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe have to be clear \u2014 the climate emergency is the big threat\u00a0for the world and for K-W.\nAll our other great initiative will be undermined if we don't pick up our game in Canada and Ontario. My immediate task is to help people understand that we already have all the tools and technology we need, and that we can and must set much more ambitions targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a young mother and a systems design engineer. The first makes me very committed to improving the world and the other teaches me to look for and find solutions that really work.\u00a0\nSerious problems take serious thinking and serious commitment.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI thought long about the top issue facing our riding and my thoughts kept going back to it depends who you ask. I've addressed the tax burden and our landfill crisis below.\nFor the commuters the biggest issue is our transportation infrastructure. It is mind-boggling why K-W does not have high speed transport to the Pearson International Airport, and throughout the Toronto to Montreal corridor. We must stop expecting our big government to provide what for decades it has failed to do and look at handing the challenges over to the private sector to deliver.\u00a0By doing so, we eliminate the need for tax increases and only those who choose to use it will pay.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe PPC has a plan to balance the budget in two years, a plan for bold tax reform and policy to reduce prices of dairy, poultry, eggs and all goods produced in Canada and sold to neighbouring provinces. The PPC will also eliminate all capital gains taxes allowing investors big and small to make money while stimulating the economy.\nThe PPC will balance the budget by eliminating the billions of dollars spent on corporate cronyism, bail-outs, subsidies and all forms of corporate welfare; and by eliminating the billions of Canadian taxpayer dollars that are sent to other countries for unaccountable social causes. This foreign aid rarely ends up in the hands of those in need.\nThe PPC will increase the personal exemption to $15,000 and have a flat tax of 15% on income up to $100,000 and a flat rate of 25% on income over $100,000.\nThe PPC will eliminate supply management, the dairy cartel, which makes Canadians pay 400% more for milk, eggs, dairy and poultry.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe PPC will end inter-provincial trade barriers so we can buy product made in Canada without the punitive costs and barriers to trading among provinces.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur region is facing a trash and landfill crisis. As a community our biggest issue is what is going to happen in a few short years when the Erb Street landfill permanently closes. There is no rational back-up plan.\u00a0\nOur federal government doesn't know what to do with our trash other than to drive it to our port cities, put it in shipping containers and send it to third world nations who either send it back (the Philippines), burn it producing toxic fumes, or dump it in the ocean (which is why our Canadian recycle products are floating in the south Pacific).\u00a0\nThe green energy proponents have no plan for the end of life disposal of highly toxic electric car batteries, solar panels and windmills.\nThe PPC will focus on local solutions to local environmental issues. Accountability only works when power is decentralized. The PPC policy prioritizes clean and safe drinking water for all, and clean and safe air for all. On these issues we have seen that our federal government tends to stand in the way of innovation, stuck in old infrastructure and old way to do things, and simply not doing anything.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nIn 2018, the average Canadian family paid a whopping $40,000 in taxes while it paid only $32,000 toward food, shelter and clothing. We also know that\u00a0the average Canadian household is within $200 per month of bankruptcy. Household and government debt are at an all-time high.\u00a0Many families are struggling to make ends meet with no income left to pay for emergencies, job loss, prescription drugs, never mind a vacation. It is wrong that so much is paid for taxes with little access to social services and healthcare.\nI would like to get busy implementing the People's Party platform, policy and principles.\u00a0I would like to come back in four\u00a0years as your MP with a record of having accomplished what the People's Party's set out to do. We need bold reforms and to get back to our basic values as Canadians.\nI would be honoured to serve as your Member of Parliament for the riding of Waterloo.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The candidates: Hay River South", "description": "Rocky Simpson challenges Wally Schumann in Hay River South riding", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-votes-hay-river-south-candidates-1.5287580", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287601.1568759432!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hay-river-south.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 17, 2019 10:00 PM CT", "2019-09-19T21:11:23.493Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Election day in the Northwest Territories is Oct. 1, and CBC North is working to bring you all the information you need to cast your ballot. As candidates were announced, CBC provided each an opportunity to answer a questionnaire tackling a wide range of subjects, from their own qualifications to themes impacting their riding and the territory as a whole.\nRead their responses below, presented in the order they were received by CBC.\nSome answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nI want to build on the work I have done with my community to get Hay River on the road to a more prosperous future. There is also a critical need to steer the Northwest Territories toward a brighter economic future in which every community can thrive. The 18th Legislative Assembly set some important groundwork to help make this happen.\nI'd like to help keep the momentum going and work to make sure every one of us, and our future generations to come, can find success in the Northwest Territories\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nIn both my community and the greater Northwest Territories, concerns about our economic future is top of mind for many people. My past experience as a business leader was invaluable to me in my dual role as MLA for Hay River South and cabinet minister in the last term, and will no doubt continue to benefit my community and the N.W.T., should I be re-elected on Oct.\u00a01.\nIn addition to founding the largest sign manufacturing business in the Northwest Territories, I advocated sustainable, community-driven economic opportunities as a director for the Hay River Chamber of Commerce, a member of the N.W.T. Chamber of Mines Aboriginal Participation Committee, and a Director for the N.W.T. Manufacturer's Association.\nFurthermore, I believe a leader is only as strong as their ability to work with others and collaboration is crucial to success. I lived this in my two years as president of the Hay River M\u00e9tis Government Council, where I led a large-scale community consultation to develop a community wellness contribution funding agreement with the GNWT\u00a0(Government of the Northwest Territories). It was also essential to my roles as MLA Hay River South and cabinet minister to help get Hay River and the greater Northwest Territories back on the road to prosperity.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nI see my accomplishments as MLA\u00a0 as community successes, because each one involved the voice and dedicated engagement of my constituents. I'm proud that Hay River is headed toward a more prosperous future, thanks in part to the GNWT's purchase of Marine Transportation Services, which helped keep the local transportation sector vibrant and dozens of jobs secure. We've also created more opportunities for health, economic success and dozens of local jobs by securing plans to build a new fish plant and a 48-bed long term care facility.\nI'm also proud of a number of accomplishments that will set the Northwest Territories toward a brighter future, including crucial infrastructure projects such as plans for the Slave Geological Province Corridor and the completion of the Mackenzie Valley all-season highway, and a bilateral agreement with the federal government to secure nearly $760 million for infrastructure improvements.\nThese wins are multifaceted as they will help connect communities, create new local jobs, improve the skill set of our workforce, and make it easier for local businesses and people to find opportunities to prosper in the North.\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nRight now, people across the Northwest Territories are wondering if their families and children will be able to find opportunities to thrive in the North. Whether that's finding meaningful employment, good health, or education needed for long-term success. There has never been a more critical time to make sure our territorial economy will flourish now and into the future.\nThe solution is two-fold.\nWe must address the immediate need to sustain a core part of our current economy and GDP by keeping our mines working as long as possible and ensuring reclamation efforts are driven locally. At the same time, we have to make strategic investments to sustain an economy our future generations can grow into.\nThis\u00a0means growing strong and diverse local economies across the territory and making sure northerners have opportunities to lead the charge on solutions for a greener future. It is absolutely critical for the 19th Legislative Assembly to make sure that every person in every community \u2014 now and in the future\u00a0\u2014\u00a0has incredible opportunities to build healthy, prosperous lives in the North.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nAs a community, we've accomplished a lot over the last four years to set Hay River back on the road to prosperity. By working with constituents, the Town of Hay River, Indigenous leaders, and our territorial and federal partners, we have helped jumpstart the local economy with the GNWT's purchase of Marine Transportation Services, the launch of the Maritime\u00a0Training Centre, plans for a new fish plant, a new 48-bed long-term care facility, and much more.\nBut our work has just begun. Just like people across the North, Hay River residents want to know that every one of us and our future generations can find health and success in the Northwest Territories. We've already laid some important groundwork to make this happen, and we have to keep the momentum going. This means creating more jobs and opportunities for local businesses through continued support to develop growth of the local transportation and fishing industries and working toward the re-opening of Pine Point mine.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nI want to help the Northwest Territories \u2014 including Hay River \u2014 to become a strong, united, and self-sustainable territory in which every person in every community can find opportunities for long-term health and success. A territory that is both in control of its future, and able to find success with the ever-changing demands of the economy and environment.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nPeople across the Northwest Territories care about the future of the environment, but they also want to be able to keep the lights on and their houses warm.\nGiven my past role as cabinet minister in the last Assembly, I am confident the GNWT developed a strong climate change strategy focused on adaptation and mitigation with these concerns in mind. It will be important for the 19th Legislative Assembly to build on this work to ensure that living in the North is affordable as we move to a greener economy less dependent on fossil fuels. One way to do this is to make sure northern workers and businesses have opportunities to lead the charge in solutions to proactively combat climate change.\nProtecting our environment also means working in partnership with Indigenous communities, particularly in the remote regions that are on the frontline of climate change. This collaboration is key to keeping our land healthy and prosperous for generations to come.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nWhen it comes to building a brighter future for the Northwest Territories, everyone in every community can bring something to the table. I would like to see the GNWT continue its efforts to be more in tune with the voices of communities. The 18th\u00a0Assembly\u00a0took important strides toward a more open government by holding open houses with the premier and cabinet members in regional centres across the North.\nI would like to see the 19th Legislative Assembly build on this work and expand ways it can make itself more accessible to all communities in the Northwest Territories.\nGiven the tight fiscal reality of the next Assembly, collaboration will also be a critical part of making sure we're building a future that works for everyone. This means continuing to work in partnership with constituents, Indigenous groups, municipalities, the federal government and neighbouring territories and provinces to strengthen our ability to achieve common goals.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nTo build a self-reliant, prosperous territory we need to empower our people, businesses and communities with ongoing opportunities to contribute to our evolving economy. This means working now to grow strong, diverse and sustainable local economies, giving northern businesses opportunities to lead the charge on climate change solutions, and promoting 'buy North, hire North' policies to keep more dollars in the territory.\nAs we work toward long-term sustainability, it will also be important to support staples of our present economy to keep the territory on an upward trajectory over the next decade. This includes keeping operating mines in production as long as possible, continuing to work on the Slave Geological Province Corridor including the Taltson Hydroelectricity Expansion Project, making sure northerners drive mine reclamation projects, and continuing core infrastructure projects to connect communities.\nWe already have the businesses and workforce that can perform much of this work. These opportunities will help keep northerners employed as we transition to a more diverse economy that keep the territory prosperous for generations to come.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nI think it's really important that we support our Indigenous leaders and help groups settle outstanding land claims and self-government agreements. It will also be important to continue the work the GNWT is currently doing to be more inclusive involve all residents in when it comes to decisions about the future of the Northwest Territories, and making our strategies to grow healthy, prosperous communities across the North work for everyone.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\u00a0\nYes.\nWould you like to be premier?\nIf I have the honour of getting a second term as MLA for Hay River South, I would meet with the new members of the Legislative Assembly and learn about their issues and priorities before making a decision on whether I would consider putting my name forward as premier.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nI decided to run for office because our local economy is struggling, and many residents are very concerned about the future of Hay River. If we focus on community's strengths and capitalize on opportunities in our region, we can mitigate many of the negative impacts that we are experiencing and create a solid economic foundation for our future generations.\nUnfortunately, many people in Hay River feel that our current government has not taken these concerns seriously and has done little to address them. I am running because Hay River South needs a representative that is approachable, accessible and will listen to the concerns or all our residents while standing up for our community.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nI believe that my business and political experience, along with my education, would be of great benefit to my work as an MLA.\u00a0\nMy past roles as the president of the Hay River M\u00e9tis Local 51 and as a councillor and deputy mayor of the Town of Hay River have given me insight into the issues faced by Indigenous and municipal governments. One area that I feel is very important is my work assisting and promoting non-profits, as they provide a service that is so very important to our community.\nFor the past 16 years, I have owned and operated a Hay River-based business that has provided employment and training opportunities to hundreds of residents, so I am aware of the issues facing small businesses and their employees in the N.W.T. My work in the oil and gas industry and with electrical utilities has also made me familiar with challenges, concerns, and potential of our extractive and energy industries. As a practicing lawyer, I am familiar with many of the policies and pieces of legislation that govern our territory, and with the challenges that our residents often face when dealing with the legal system.\u00a0\nAfter completing my elementary and secondary schooling in Hay River, I earned a diploma in petroleum engineering technology from the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, degrees in business and computer science in the United States, and a law degree from the University of British Columbia. In addition to providing me with technical knowledge, this education has provided me the skills to research and analyze any topic from a variety of viewpoints. Given the vast and diverse nature of information that MLAs must be familiar with, I believe these would be invaluable skills.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\u00a0\nRaising a family that understands the importance of helping others in need and showing respect to all.\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nThe N.W.T.'s faltering economy is the biggest issue facing our territory.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile there is much concern about Hay River's current and future economic situation, the biggest issue affecting many residents daily is the state of our healthcare system and our community's lack of doctors.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\u00a0\nIf I could accomplish only one thing for Hay River while in office, it would be to ensure that our community recruit and retain an adequate number of doctors and that residents receive timely access to quality medical care.\u00a0\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nParticipate in action-oriented solutions to immediately address the problems. We need community, government and industry buy in to be effective. Although the issue is global, we can continue to do our part to minimize the impact.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nThe government needs a renewed focus on respect. There must be greater respect shown in the legislative assembly so that the voices of those elected to represent residents from across the territory can be heard. There must be greater respect shown to the public service.\nWe have many qualified people employed by the government and these people must be respected by and have the support of their leaders if they are to do their jobs effectively. Finally, the GNWT needs to understand that is serves the residents of the N.W.T. The politicians in charge of the government need to listen to and be accountable to the residents and need to ensure that they apply fairness in all aspects of the decision-making process.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nThe GNWT must do a better job working with and supporting Indigenous governments with the goal of completing claims and self-government processes. This will provide certainty and clarity that will help attract new investment to the N.W.T. and help local businesses grow.\nWe must continue to promote and look to improve our returns on our renewable and non-renewable resource industries and must be done in ways that minimize damage to our environment. We must also put greater efforts into diversifying our economy so that we can be better prepared for slowdowns in the mining and oil and gas sectors. This can be done by making better use of legislation and policies, such as the Business Incentive Policy, to ensure that businesses that have a real presence in the N.W.T. are able to grow, provide sustainable employment to locals, and contribute to the territorial economy.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nThe GNWT needs to recognize that the Indigenous peoples have constitutionally entrenched rights that must be fully recognized and supported. It is through the recognition of these rights and working for a common goal that the North will become stronger politically, economically, and socially.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\nI would be very interested but need to work at being elected first.\nWould you like to be premier?\nNo \u2013 if elected, a decision as to who I would support would be made through discussion with potential candidates and the residents of Hay River.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The candidates: Yellowknife South", "description": "Caroline Wawzonek and Gaeleen McPherson vie for Premier Bob McLeod's former seat", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-votes-yellowknife-south-candidates-1.5281946", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5285746.1568663675!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/yellowknife-south.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 16, 2019 10:00 PM CT", "2019-09-17T04:00:00.783Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Election day in the Northwest Territories is Oct. 1, and CBC North is working to bring you all the information you need to cast your ballot. As candidates were announced, CBC provided each an opportunity to answer a questionnaire tackling a wide range of subjects, from their own qualifications to themes impacting their riding and the territory as a whole.\nRead their responses below, presented in the order they were received by CBC.\nSome answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\u00a0\nI am running for office because I think change is needed in my community and the territory. I believe I have the necessary skills, background and experience to help provide some of the solutions to the many challenges we face including an uncertain economic situation, the need to improve our public services, providing education and training opportunities for our youth and addressing the social issues that affect too many of our residents.\u00a0\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\u00a0\nI was born, raised and educated in the North.\u00a0My family lives here and I am raising a family here. I've worked for much of my career in the mining industry and have held a number of progressively senior positions, including most recently vice-president of corporate affairs and a member of the executive committee for Dominion Diamond Mines.\u00a0\nIn those roles, I have had to work with senior executives from multinational corporations, with territorial and federal politicians and officials, with Chiefs and communities, and with working folks trying to make ends meet.\nMy ability to work with people, build positive relationships and craft solutions to complex problems are the most important attributes that I would bring to the role of MLA in the service of the people of Yellowknife South. And frankly, I think our legislature needs more of that.\u00a0\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\u00a0\nOf course, on a personal level, being a mom is my greatest accomplishment, and always will be.\nHowever, on a professional level, I would say that being recognized by the Canadian Institute of Mining in 2018 with the CIM-Bedford Canadian Young Mining Leaders Award confirmed to me that the choices I made as a young, Indigenous woman to work and make a difference in the mining industry was the correct choice.\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\u00a0\nOur territory faces many challenges, but I think the biggest issue is an uncertain economic future.\nI say this because I think a stronger, more vibrant economy provides us with more flexibility to address other important challenges, such as building a stronger education system \u2014 including the polytechnic institute\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or to invest in public services, including the training and recruiting of more health care professionals to staff the state-of-the-art new hospital that we have built.\u00a0\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\u00a0\nFrom what I have heard so far in visiting constituents, the people of Yellowknife South worry about the state of the economy, how long they will have secure employment, when affordable day care will be made available, when we will adequately resource our health care facilities and provide adequate health care, what the government is going to do to support small business, services and programs for seniors, and the social issues that we just can't seem to get a handle on.\nThere are a broad range of issues being identified; the next government has a lot that they will be taken to task on.\u00a0\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\u00a0\nI would hope that when I left office, I would leave a community better off economically and a government that provides improved public services to all residents and that we can better take care of those in our society most in need.\u00a0\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\u00a0\nI've focused a great deal on the economy in previous answers but as an Indigenous northerner, I feel strongly that we must ensure the environment and our wildlife are protected for generations to come. We need development, but it has to be done in such a way as to minimize the impact on our environment.\u00a0\nThe one area that I would focus on immediately if elected is reducing our reliance on fossil fuels for industry and communities. We need to make additional investments in renewable energy, such as wind, solar and biomass, both in the short and long-term.\nMore importantly, we need to work with the next federal government\u00a0to expand our hydroelectric capacity. A grid interconnect between the North and South Slave regions, and ultimately between the N.W.T. and the southern Canadian grid, will be one of my top priorities if elected. This will help to lessen our impact on the environment and to reduce our high cost of living.\u00a0\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\u00a0\nGiven the size and makeup of our territory, I am generally supportive of the consensus system of government. However, it seems clear that more must be done to address the increasing divide between cabinet and regular members.\nI don't have a simple answer to this question, but a start is to elect more people that bring a collaborative approach to politics. Secondly, we need to use the committee structure in better ways to ensure regular members have input earlier in the legislative and policy development process.\u00a0\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\u00a0\nWe need to ensure that we continue to support the mining industry. Mining has brought many benefits to the Yellowknife region and with the right focus and incentives we can ensure that we see these benefits for many more years.\nHowever,\u00a0we also need to focus our efforts on diversification of our economy, including the development of a sustainable tourism plan that attracts tourists to stay longer, encourages visits during current \"off seasons\" and results in more spending remaining in the North. The GNWT must shift focus from marketing to creating the right incentives for private sector tourism product development and improve our tourist infrastructure, such as improving and expanding the airport in order to accommodate international flights.\u00a0\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\u00a0\nWe need to prioritize building collaborative partnerships with Indigenous governments. To do this, we need better forums that allow for a government-to-government dialogue to resolve some of the issues that exist.\u00a0\nWhile I also understand that more needs to be done to resolve outstanding lands and resource\u00a0negotiations, I also appreciate that these are complex issues that will take time to bring to a full resolution.\u00a0\nI think my personal and professional background provides me with the skills needed to build and improve the relationships we have with Indigenous governments.\u00a0\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\u00a0\nMy complete focus at this time is on talking to the people of Yellowknife South, understanding the issues facing them and earning their trust to represent them as their MLA. While I understand that the selection of cabinet and premier are important issues, it is important that consideration of those offices wait until the people of Yellowknife South have made their choice.\u00a0\nWould you like to be premier?\u00a0\nSee above.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nWhen I realized that this is an opportunity to bring my knowledge of different sectors and industries and my advocacy work together into a powerful new arena.\nFor over a decade, I have helped individuals, businesses and community organizations solve problems by navigating laws, regulations and policies. Sometimes I read a policy and wonder what connection it has to the goals of the government vision it came from; other times I read a law and wonder where the action is to act on the vision and be accountable for the outcomes.\nNow I hope to be on the other side to support a strong vision for the N.W.T. and help drive the laws and policy to deliver on that vision.\u00a0\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nI have knowledge and experience across industries and sectors. My professional work has ranged from criminal law and child welfare to our environmental regulatory boards and boards of education.\nMy community level roles include serving as president of the Law Society of the NWT, on the Executive Committee of the NWT. Chamber of Commerce and being a director on the boards of the NWT YWCA, NWT Montessori Society and Avens.\nIn terms of specific skills, my career is built on an ability to identify issues, gather information, make strategic decisions, advocate for an outcome and, throughout these processes, communicate with people. I work professionally with boards, tribunals and other government decision makers to help them develop fair and transparent processes and to make reasonable and ethical decisions.\nI have trained a variety of organizations on the use of fairness when developing processes and on how to come to decisions that are accountable to the parties involved. I have also worked with community organizations to improve their governance through policy reviews, bylaw updates and projects that engage the perspective of the broader community.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nIn preparing for the election, I have been humbled to hear many people tell me that they know me by reputation. Throughout\u00a0my career, I approach my advocacy, whether in court or as a community advocate, with integrity, commitment and passion while treating others with respect and fairness. I am proud of the reputation I have built.\u00a0\nOn a personal level, I feel a sense of pride watching my children engage others with compassion and respect. I cannot take credit for all of their behaviour, but I do lay claim to some.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nBoth short and long-term economic growth. The N.W.T.'s GDP is flatlining and exploration investment has decreased, despite increasing in our neighbouring territories. New mineral resource projects seem to remain ever on the horizon. Access to land remains uncertain for investors and challenging for municipalities, while land and self-government negotiations appear to stagnate.\nThe N.W.T. has long had both higher costs of living and higher operating costs for business compared to Canadian averages; these high costs of living put pressure on business for wages while high operating costs get passed to consumers in a cycle that we need to break.\nMeanwhile, the impacts of a warming climate are being felt acutely from melting permafrost to eroding coasts and changing biodiversity. All of these realities need to be addressed and balanced for the N.W.T. to become a Canadian leader in economic development and prosperity.\u00a0\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nAfter a week of knocking on doors, there are two key issues that my neighbours are talking about: economic development and how to positively impact the social challenges being seen on the streets of our downtown, especially homelessness, mental health and addictions.\u00a0\nSomething that I think links these issues is the need for effective leadership that is accountable for measurable results. Four years ago, we already knew that our economy would face challenges when the diamond mines close with only smaller operations in the pipes and slow exploration investment.\nAs well, better supports for mental health and addictions was a key issue in the last election and in the government's mandate. From the outreach I have done over the last few months, I believe there are strong ideas and existing initiatives across sectors but there is a lack of confidence in effective leadership to follow through with outcomes.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nIn consensus government, I believe it is better to go in with more than one \"key deliverable\" so you have flexibility to engage with the other MLAs about shared priorities.\nI am reasonably confident we will agree on the need for continued efforts to bridge infrastructure gaps and settle land claims. I also suspect we will agree that mental health and addictions must again be a priority.\nOne issue where I would like to see change is for better results monitoring,\u00a0so that after four years we will see not only what processes may be underway, but also clearly identify what measurable impacts have been achieved.\u00a0\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nFirst, reduce our reliance on diesel fuel by: expanding both large and small scale hydro power; supporting biomass retrofits; and encouraging local equity partnerships for community-scale renewable projects.\u00a0\nI believe that the GNWT should take a leading and coordinating role in responding to climate change impacts and challenges. I believe the GNWT should lead an effort to include analysis of the impact of climate change on community and territory-wide infrastructure in order to be able to include these risks or realities in current and future planning for research, personnel and budgets.\u00a0\nFinally, I also believe we should try to use these challenges as an opportunity. In moving forward with a polytechnic\u00a0university, the territory\u00a0should be taking a leading role in initiating and supporting relevant research in Arctic climate science and related fields.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\u00a0\nReal accountability for measured outcomes as identified through evaluation and data.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nI believe we need to revitalize our mineral resource sector, support growth among northern-owned small and medium sized enterprise, and continue to seek opportunities to help diversify our economy.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome of the specific ways I believe we can accomplish these goals include:\u00a0\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\u00a0\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\u00a0\nIf elected, my first priority will be to build relationships with the other MLAs so we can work together to create not only the best possible cabinet based on our respective experiences and strengths, but also have the right group of MLAs ready to hold cabinet accountable.\u00a0\u00a0\nWould you like to be premier?\nI think it would be helpful for the premier to have some institutional knowledge about the Legislative Assembly that is most feasible for a returning MLA. In addition, as noted above, my first priority if elected is to learn about my fellow MLAs so we can work together to identify who is best suited to different roles.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Perth-Wellington candidates on environment, cost of living and top issues in this election", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/perth-wellington-federal-election-candidate-survey-1.5313132", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5315794.1570677080!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/candidates-in-perth-wellington.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-13T09:00:00.823Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Voters will head to the polls on Oct. 21 and in Perth-Wellington, people will have a choice between six candidates.\nThe candidates in Perth-Wellington are:\u00a0\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has asked the candidates to answer a survey. All were presented with the same questions.\u00a0Clicking the candidate's name above will take you to their survey responses. The candidates were told they had a 200-word limit for answers.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nTrust is the most important consideration facing residents of Perth\u2013Wellington in this election. Voters should consider two equally important questions.\nFirst, we must ask which leader, and which party, should we trust to take on serious national challenges.\u00a0Who do we trust to help make it possible for all of us to get ahead? Who do we trust to budget responsibly? Who do we trust to be a leader the world can take seriously?\nSecond, we must ask which local candidate has shown the ability to represent our values and capably serve our community. Which candidate do we trust to be accessible when we need them most? Which candidate has the experience we need to represent every community in Perth\u2013Wellington?\nTo earn voters' trust, I will continue doing what I have always done over the last four years: serving people to the best of my ability.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you return as the MP?\u00a0\nOver the last four years, we've been paying more for gasoline, home heating, hydro, housing, and much more. We must address the rising cost of living. As an MP, I would do what the Liberals did not do: I would oppose any measure that does not respect this reality facing too many Canadians.\nWe can start by trusting people with their own money. With the Conservatives' universal tax cut, the average Canadian family will save over $850 per year.\nAlso in our plan: tax credits for children's fitness and arts programs; tax-free maternity benefits; increasing the age credit for seniors by $1,000; and removing the federal tax on home heating.\nWe would also introduce four new measures to make it easier for first-time home buyers to buy a home.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nClimate change is real and requires immediate action. Andrew Scheer's plan would require the biggest polluters to reduce their carbon emissions or invest in new green technologies.\nIt is also a global problem requiring global solutions. For that, we must restore Canadian leadership on the world stage. We need a prime minister the world will take seriously.\nImposing additional taxes on people in our riding \u2014 who may have no choice but to drive to work or transport their crops to elevators \u2014 will make no meaningful difference in reducing emissions. It will just make life even more expensive.\nYou can read the Conservative plan for the environment at the website arealplan.ca.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nRaised on our family's farm near Mitchell, I learned early the importance of hard work. I believe in public service and our capacity to build strong, healthy communities\u00a0and a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I'm running to serve every person in every corner of Perth\u2013Wellington.\nService means representing our values and interests. That's what motivated me to introduce a bill to protect young people and those with disabilities from exploitation.\nIt's also why I have championed rural communities, stood up for local small businesses\u00a0and challenged the government to respect the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system.\nI'm running because I know we can build a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I will continue to be accessible to every constituent, no matter where they live, whether one-on-one or at community events. I ask for your support to continue serving everyone in Perth\u2013Wellington.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nSustainability is the top issue facing Perth-Wellington. I will work to ensure that life in Perth-Wellington is both economically and environmentally sustainable.\nWe owe it to our children and grandchildren to find solutions that are good for both the environment and the economy. The Liberal climate action plan is both ambitious and realistic. It includes innovation, research, clean technology, and putting a price on pollution. I am proud to support the Liberal plan that is committed to encouraging lower greenhouse gas emissions without putting a financial burden on households.\nWhen the Ford government cancelled Ontario's successful cap and trade system, the federal government implemented a carbon price (so-called \"carbon tax\") and a corresponding rebate called the climate action incentive payment.\u00a0\nLiberals value the small businesses in rural communities that create good jobs and the farmers that feed Canada and the world. We will help our family farms stay strong, help connect rural communities with high-speed internet, and continue to make rural success a priority with a dedicated minister of rural economic development.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Liberal government's plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class is working. It helped Canadians create over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014\u00a0most were full time positions \u2014\u00a0and brought the unemployment rate to a 40-year low. Despite that, many Canadians struggle to make ends meet given the high cost of living.\nA re-elected Liberal government will:\nCanada has the lowest debt to GDP ratio among G7 countries and this ratio has been reduced each year we've been in office. That means we will have the capacity in whatever economic situation to deal with that situation appropriately. To keep our economy strong and growing, we will also move forward with modest and responsible increases to immigration, with a focus on welcoming highly skilled people.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe've seen the impact of climate change, with floods and fires destroying entire communities in Canada. Our children are scared, because they know this will become their mess to clean up.\nThe Liberal plan isn't perfect, but it is both ambitious and feasible. Progress has already been made \u2014 putting a price on pollution, protecting our oceans, phasing out coal, banning single-use plastics. Canada is on track to reduce our emissions by 30 per cent\u00a0by 2030 and Liberals are committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That means not putting any more carbon emissions into the air than we take out.\u00a0\nA re-elected Liberal government will cut corporate tax in half for zero-emissions clean tech companies. We are committed to moving Canada forward \u2014 building a country where clean tech companies can thrive, where businesses and citizens are encouraged to go green, and where workers can succeed in the clean energy transition.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nPublic service means working to create a better community and country for our children and grandchildren \u2014 that is what motivates me to become the MP for Perth-Wellington. I will work to improve the environment, reduce the cost of living, and strengthen social services.\nMy varied work experience includes hosting a children's talent program on CFPL-TV in London; teaching special education students with the Thames Valley District School Board; and ministering to United Church congregations in St. Marys, Stratford, and Palmerston. My wife Ruth and I are residents of St. Marys; we have five children and three grandchildren.\nAs a former town councillor in Parkhill, I have political experience at the municipal level. I helped establish the London Convention Centre and was an early supporter of the Stratford Perth Rotary Hospice. I was a member of Stratford's Housing Committee looking for housing solutions for homeless people, and a co-organizer of St. Marys' Community Dinners.\nMy life's work has been focused on helping people in need. I will always stand up for the little guy. I know that public service is about addressing tough challenges, and I'm committed to continuing my work serving the citizens of Perth-Wellington at the federal level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nOne of the most important issues to citizens of Perth-Wellington is the climate emergency.\u00a0\nWe are keenly aware of the threat posed by climate change to the planet and our way of life. Extreme weather events like flooding, heavy rain, forest fires and intense hurricanes are seen across the country and we've felt the effects here in every part of the riding, both rural and urban. We have a number of active environmental groups such as Climate Momentum in Stratford, The Maitland Valley Carbon Footprint Initiative, and the City of Stratford itself has been a leader in a number of sustainability projects.\nI am inspired by the leadership of young people and was pleased to participate in the student-led climate action here in September.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy first order of business would be to press for action on affordable housing. Many people in Perth-Wellington can't afford to wait for solutions to the housing crisis.\nWe need the federal government to get back to work building social and non-market housing and supporting co-ops. I would work with colleagues from all parties to expedite the funding and assistance needed for municipalities, co-ops or social enterprises to get projects off the ground.\nDealing with precarious employment is a priority for the NDP. As a member of the NDP caucus, I will support the party's re-institution of a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour.\u00a0\nWe will work toward a living wage for all federally regulated workers which will set a standard for employers in every sector. We will give temporary and part-time workers access to the same compensation and benefits as their full-time counterparts.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe NDP knows that we don't have the luxury of time in taking action on climate change. On Day One, an NDP government would cancel the billions in fossil fuel subsidies as well as the Trans Mountain pipeline project.\nWe also stand firmly behind working people and will create 300,000 new jobs in our first mandate in the clean energy sector. Confronting climate change will require a massive mobilization of labour and resources to train and retrain Canadians.\nPriorities in a new energy economy include:\u00a0building a sustainable auto sector by manufacturing electric and zero-emission vehicles right here in Canada; retrofitting every home and public building by 2030 so that they are net zero ready; and expanding the availability of low-cost, zero-emission and accessible public transit.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI have been a social activist and a member of the NDP for the past 17 years. I\u00a0grew up in Markham and have an honours degree in political science from the University of Guelph. I was a member of the board of the Guelph Campus Co-op for five years, as well as serving as president of both the federal and provincial Guelph NDP riding associations. While in Guelph, I was the host of Words and Music\u00a0on 93.3 CFRU FM.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am also a person living with cerebral palsy. As such I know what it is to face and overcome challenges. I also know what it is to confront inequality and succeed.\u00a0\nIn Stratford, I am on the executive of the Rotaract\u00a0Club and have been working on the 211 database through the United Way of Perth Huron. I am committed to building a society where human need comes before corporate greed.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nClimate change is the world's biggest issue, but locally we won't see major frequent impacts until it's too late.\u00a0\nWe need to act because our cumulative emissions will continue to act for decades. To meet our 2030 goals, we have work to do, and only the Green Party's plan meets those goals. The Liberal government (and the Conservatives before them) continue to support the oil and gas industry despite the fact that continued resource extraction at this level will hasten the onrushing climate catastrophe. In 2017, just to extract the oil and gas, 200 of Canada's 700 megatons of CO2 were emitted.\nWe cannot maintain the status quo policy and have a livable planet. The Green Party will declare a climate emergency, work with the other parties in an inner cabinet, cancel all fossil fuel subsidies, ban fracking, support the adoption of electric vehicles, bolster public transportation, replace coal and natural gas electricity generation, modernize and expand the national electric grid, complete a national building retrofit, switch to biodiesel, ban foreign oil imports, and restore natural carbon sinks such as the soil and forests. It is all possible, we just need the political and personal will to do it.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nLife is expensive, and wages haven't kept up with costs. People are worried about making sure their families have what they need to get by and be happy. The Green Party wants to help financially with the things that matter the most.\nWe plan to abolish tuition at post-secondary institutions, expand public transportation (low cost and electric), and mandate a livable minimum wage ($15/hr).\u00a0 We will limit credit card interest rates to 10% and encourage competition in the cellular phone and internet markets to lower costs for everyone.\nGood health is currently a luxury and it shouldn't be; poverty directly affects your ability to care for yourself properly.\u00a0 We are proposing a guaranteed livable income (GLI) to replace the patchwork of federal and provincial programs that assist people who cannot work or are in low income situations. To pay for these programs, we will close tax loop holes used by the very wealthy and large corporations, so that they pay their fair share.\u00a0 Tax breaks for huge corporations don't help everyday people.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe climate crisis is the most important issue for Canadians, whether they realize it or not.\u00a0 The climate crisis requires a concerted effort at all levels of government and grass roots action by everyone.\u00a0\nFor the government to act in the long term best interest of the people of Canada, we need increased transparency and accountability.\u00a0The oil and gas industry is the largest source of emissions in Canada. The federal government needs to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry and put those funds into environmentally sound energy.\u00a0\nThe Transmountain Pipeline expansion should be stopped. The BC Liquid Natural Gas project should be stopped. We need to transition to 100% renewable energy sources. We need to do what is best of the health of our population and planet, not what makes the fossil fuel industry the most money.\u00a0\nThe argument that it is either\u00a0the economy or the environment is invalid, as there are more jobs in a renewable and sustainable economy (estimated 3 times\u00a0more). Corporate influence must be removed from politics and the science must be respected.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm a doctor and anesthesiologist. I've put my practice on hold to run for office\u00a0because I think climate change is the most important issue facing the country.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce I read the IPCC\u00a0(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate report last fall, I knew I had to get involved.\u00a0\nAt my regular job, I deal with sick people in complex situations as part of my routine work.\u00a0 For most people that would be stressful. After examining the evidence for climate change, I was losing sleep thinking about ways to change my personal environmental footprint.\u00a0 We need to make changes at the federal level because they control the sectors where the largest emissions occur.\nI got involved to try and make the changes we need to keep our planet in a livable condition.\u00a0The Green Party is the only political party with the ethics and conviction to stand up to the old parties and corporations, to get things done.\nI'm doing this so we have the best chance to maintain a livable planet, so my kids have a chance at a reasonable existence.\u00a0To not act given the current evidence will be disastrous, and future generations won't understand why we seemingly chose self-destruction because it was more convenient than change.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nHealth care is top of mind. Although this is a provincial responsibility, we can see that wait times and quality of care have been long time concerns without question. No one has been able to assist with changing this.\nThe People's Party of Canada understands that one of the issues here is that provinces have had an unreliable source of federal funding year to year, making it difficult for them to plan and deliver the necessary services. Ottawa's health care transfers to the provinces have doubled since 2006 from $20 billion to $40 billion this year with nothing to show for it.\nWe will give up the GST, which is expected to be around $40 billion and send it to the provinces each year in order to stabilize health care funding. Ottawa will stop meddling in health care\u00a0and allow the provinces to be fully responsible for delivery of this service as the Constitution states.\n2.\u00a0People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nPersonally, I will stand up as the MP for Perth-Wellington and speak out for what the residents of this riding need. Our party policies are extremely helpful in this regard.\nTo assist with the cost of living we will abolish the carbon tax, which is going to impact the cost of everything that we need from groceries to shelter and etc, and replace the tax with nothing.\nWe will simplify the income tax system by raising the personal exemption to $15,000, charging only 15% tax from $15,001 to $100,000,\u00a0and charging 25% for $100,001 and over. This will help the more vulnerable while assuring that more fortunate citizens will pay their fair share of tax.\nWe will end supply management which will allow Canadians to access nutritious food at a reasonable price. To assist the Canadian economy, one step is to ensure that pipelines get built by using the Constitutional laws and we will do that.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change has always happened, thankfully, as we could not live here in Perth-Wellington without it. Twelve thousand years ago, this area was under ice and the earth warmed up. It did not warm up due to human activity.\nWe do not believe that there is a climate emergency. Due to the fact that there is no scientific consensus on this issue, we will not invoke costly taxes that will hurt our prosperity. Until such time, if ever, there is clear consensus, our approach to climate change will be to assist those most vulnerable to flooding and other natural disasters.\nWe do believe in a clean environment and all of us need to assist with that each day, we can all do our part. What will you do? Give up single-use plastics? Walk and bicycle more? Stop burning large amounts of fossil fuels on personal vacations? Will you drink municipal tap water? Will you plant trees? Will you conserve electricity? All of these actions will help us build a cleaner environment.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a lifelong resident of Perth County, having grown up on a dairy farm. I built a successful tool and die business in Stratford and retired financially independent at the age of 38. I ran as an independent candidate in this riding in 2015.\nI am thrilled to be part of this grassroots movement, the People's Party of Canada, whose policies I align with. I stand for fiscal responsibility and a vibrant Canadian economy. I stand for secure Canadian borders and our rights as a sovereign nation. We must uphold the rule of law and I believe in putting Canadians first.\nI believe we need to stop sending billions of dollars overseas for various reasons while so many Canadians, such as our veterans and etc., are experiencing difficulty making ends meet. I believe we need to stop or minimize UN funding. I believe in ending corporate welfare in Canada, a policy which only makes the wealthy\u00a0wealthier. I stand for a bold, new, proud Canadian future for all of us.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThe national debt and interest payments of $70 million a day!\u00a0 We would treat the debt as a mortgage and begin paying it down.\nFamily breakdown is leading to a housing crisis and CHP CANADA would strengthen the traditional family unit by providing income to the parent, either or, who stays home to raise the children or care for disabled, elderly or others in their own home.\u00a0\nFibre [internet]\u00a0to the home is important and CHP Canada offers infrastructure loans to move this project forward.\nCHP Canada wants to maintain our borders, protect our sovereignty and slowly extend legal immigration to those most able to assimilate into our Canadian culture that was and still is, based on \"The Supremacy of God and the Rule of Law.\"\nOur Christian heritage protects the freedom of religion for all people while secularism and humanism would deny religious freedom to Christians.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nCHP Canada would eliminate the income tax \u2014\u00a0completely freeing Canadians from the associated compliance costs. Replacing the income tax would be a fair tax\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a national sales tax on NEW goods only. This would allow both rich and poor to decide when to pay tax.\u00a0\nFor example, the rich buy a new car and pay a higher tax, the poor buy a used car and pay no tax. It will lead to economic advantages! Strengthen the traditional family unit and teach individuals how to manage money. Playing the game Cash Flow with my preteen grandchildren has taught them to get out of the rat race and avoid doodads.\nIt is a shame that the government preys on people's weakness by the get-rich quick scheme of the lottery.\u00a0 If five\u00a0per cent\u00a0is returned to the town, then, after expenses, big bucks left town for big business profits.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change, and associated alarmism, is a financial movement in favour of big business and increased control over people all around the world.\u00a0\nC02 is not a pollutant. Farmers buy it to put into their greenhouses to make the flowers grow. Farmers inject it into soil to beneficially create plant growth.\u00a0\nThe more C02 the better everything grows. Canada was once much greener than today as the fossil records show. We will adapt as changes are slow! CHP Canada would protect water, air and soil by fighting nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulates.\u00a0\nOf greater concern is Canada's moral environment which is creating family breakdown.\u00a0The porn industry is harming everyone's ability to maintain strong family ties ... The lack of respect for life, from the not-yet born human beings who are not granted human rights, to the elderly and disabled who may be coerced to assisted suicide because of their life's circumstances. The moral compass of our nation is eroding leading to a weak and vulnerable populace.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI am a farmer and small business owner with my husband. We raised four children to be healthy adults and have grandchildren.\u00a0I love to read and learn and I read legislation, court cases and alternative news sites. I like to garden and scrapbook and play with grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Vassy Kapelos, Emily Haws", "title": "Full transcript of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's year-end interview with Power & Politics", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-power-lunch-full-transcript-china-alberta-national-unity-1.5403368", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Dec 19, 2019 8:35 PM ET", "2019-12-20T01:44:16.361Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sat down with CBC News Network's Power & Politics host Vassy Kapelos for a year-end interview in which the Liberal leader discussed Canada's relationship with China, trade, frustrations being expressed by Alberta and Saskatchewan, his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump and much more.\nHere is the full transcript of that interview, edited for length and clarity:\nVassy Kapelos (VK): Hi Prime Minister Trudeau.\u00a0\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau (PMJT): Hello\u00a0Vassy.\nVK:\u00a0 Great to see you. Thank you for doing this.\nPMJT: No. Glad to. Glad to welcome you to a great restaurant in the riding.\u00a0\nVK: Yes, a great restaurant. Normally we start off the Power Lunch by asking why\u00a0we are eating where we are, but as I was saying to you a little bit earlier, I feel like the 30,000 members of my extended Greek family are going to be deeply offended that we're at an Italian restaurant, as lovely as it is.\u00a0\nPMJT: We did a Greek restaurant last time.\nVK: We did, we did. So this time is somewhere different. Speaking of last time, I remember asking you what, at the time, what kept you up at night and your answer was NAFTA. What keeps you up at night right now?\nPMJT: Still Canada's role in the world, Canada's trade opportunities, Canadians' prosperity. We know that there is a lot of anxiety that people are feeling out there, we know there are potential challenges in the global economy, and focusing on Canadians continuing to be ambitious engaged, optimistic about their future. That's my focus.\nVK: Let me ask you about some of the Canadians who feel particularly challenged in that area. I'm speaking of those who live in economies that are challenged right now in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Do you think, or what is your assessment, of the current state of unity in this country right now?\nPMJT: I think people, obviously as you say in Alberta and Saskatchewan, have faced some very difficult years and are worried, like so many people are, about their future, about their kids' future, about where their jobs are going to come from. It's just particularly poignant in Alberta where the dominant industry is one that is directly challenged by the reality of climate change and how we need to\u00a0transform our economy to be greener. But the point and the perspective that I have is: Absolutely we need to make sure we're supporting Albertans in Saskatchewanians, but we can't just support them. We need them to be successful to help us develop these new energy solutions. The innovation, the leadership, thoughtfulness that Albertans, in particular, have always brought to bear on creating prosperity and solutions, is something we need them to do again, and we need to get them to a place where they can do that, and that means investing.\nVK:\u00a0 I want to ask you specifically how you're going to do that in a second, but do you, as the leader of this country, think that national unity is at risk right now?\nPMJT: I think Canada is a country of differences, of diversity. There's always different regional dynamics going on. I think we need to take very seriously the very real anxiety and frustration that people in Alberta and Saskatchewan are facing. But I also know that they remain Canadians who want to be contributing to the country, want to be building a better future for their kids, and we need to do a better job of showing them that the future doesn't just include them, but it needs them.\nVK: With respect though, that didn't really answer whether or not you think national unity is at risk. I ask only because many others, and other leaders in this country, are saying that it is. In fact, after the election, they said it's never been this bad. Do you share that assessment?\nPMJT: I do not share the assessment to the extent that others have. I think there is, there is a level of\u00a0rhetoric that is maybe not as reassuring as it could be. I think there are very real frustrations. I think there is very real anger that needs to be dealt with in Alberta and Saskatchewan. But I see that as problems to be solved when we all work together, and I don't think Albertans suddenly don't care about Canada, for example. I think they just want and know that they have a strong future and that's what we need for them too.\nVK: The anxieties that you referred to -- do you think you caused some of them?\u00a0\nPMJT: I think, quite frankly there's a lot of different reasons for it. There's a transforming global economy, there's the difficulty we've always had in getting our resources out to new markets other than the United States. I mean, Stephen Harper tried to do that for 10 years, was unable to do that. We're finally moving forward on getting a pipeline to market --\nVK: -- It's very late though --\u00a0\u00a0\nPMJT: Well, we did in three or four years what\u00a0Stephen Harper was unable to do in 10 years. So --\u00a0\nVK: But you haven't done it yet, to be fair, the pipeline is not built. The construction is underway, but it still faces a court challenge.\nPMJT: Well, there's always going to be people in the courts, but that pipeline is getting built. The shovels are in the ground, and we have put our entire government energies behind moving that forward because it's an important project not just for Alberta and Saskatchewan, but for the whole country.\u00a0\nVK: Can I ask you how you view the realities of the economy, or the realities that the economies in Alberta and Saskatchewan face? In 2017, you said we can't shut the oil sands down but we have to phase them out. Do you believe that the oil sands will be phased out?\nPMJT: I think there is a need to move to a different energy mix. I think we're always going to need fossil fuels in different forms probably for the coming centuries, but we're going to be far less reliant on them. But, we've already seen a lot of energy companies, including in Alberta, investing in renewables, developing much cleaner approaches, more innovative things, as Albertans have always done.\u00a0\nThere's just a need to continue that work and realize that as people buy more and more electric cars, as we're trying to reach net-zero by 2020 -- by 2050, sorry -- we have a different kind of industry that's going to be developing. There's going to be great jobs in Alberta well into the future because Albertans are going to be creating them as we continue to build great new solutions.\nVK: Do you believe, though, that the oil sands will eventually shut down?\u00a0\nPMJT: I think we're always going to need hydrocarbons, we'll just need less of them, and in different ways. And I know that that's not going to happen anytime soon, but we do need to manage better alternatives.\u00a0\nVK: When you talk about that transition -- there are 200,000\u00a0people, the best estimate I can find, directly employed by the oil patch. And up to half a million others indirectly employed. There are a lot of people looking to your words, and kind of hanging on them wondering 'at what point does that phase out happen, at what point am I out of a job? I know I'm hearing from politicians saying that there will be training programs for me' but can you really guarantee any of those 200,000 people that they are going to have a job?\nPMJT: I think one of the issues is, this isn't a decision by Ottawa that suddenly, you know, climate change is something you have to deal with. We're seeing the floods, we're seeing the forest fires, we're seeing the extreme weather events, you know, hitting us hard around the world. The world is looking at the reality of global warming and saying we need to shift our energy mix. We need to innovate. We need to reduce our carbon emissions.\u00a0\nThese are factors that exist around the world that are going to intensify over the coming years.So I am saying, and I have been saying, we can get in front of that. We can use the resilience, the resourcefulness, the innovation that Canadians have always shown -- including people in Alberta and Saskatchewan around energy -- and we can help develop what that path is forward. We cannot simply just hope that it won't happen if there's a change of government in Ottawa, and suddenly everyone will go back to consuming all the oil that we used to.\nI know consumption is still going up, but there is a recognition that the world is looking for different solutions and either we are part of shaping that in a way that supports people through this transition -- that will take the coming decades -- or eventually, there is a wall that we hit that is going to be a lot harder to deal with than an orderly transition.\u00a0\nVK: I get that, and I'm not trying to take away from the effects of climate change, but I'm thinking if I'm one of those 200,000 Canadians, and Canada has, you know, 1.6 per cent of global emissions, and I'm being told my job is in jeopardy, and don't worry there, you know, we can still work something out.\u00a0\nThere's really no specifics being offered to that, and I get it that it's not you making that choice about climate change, but there's no specifics being offered other than 'we'll try to help you through the transition.' But what does that help look like?\nPMJT: I've actually sat down with Premier [Jason] Kenny and Premier [Scott] Moe and said 'Look my focus is on supporting Albertans concretely. Not just because we need to support Canadians who are in difficulty, but we need Albertans to be part of the solution.\u00a0\nNow, there is a political context where over the past while there have been a lot of people saying that 'we can't fight climate change because your job is going to disappear if we do.' I don't think that's been a responsible frame that a number of local leaders have had --\nVK: -- Is it true that they'll lose their job though?\nPMJT: No...We're going to continue to need to rely on oil for many years to come. We're building a pipeline, they're moving forward on continuing to deliver our oil to markets, and to Canadians while we need it.\u00a0\nBut we also have to be clear-eyed about the fact that over the coming decades, there's going to be a different energy mix that is going to create new opportunities for new jobs that we need to start preparing for now. And that's part of the reflection that I want to have with folks in Alberta, with folks in Saskatchewan.\nVK: Let me broaden it out a bit and ask you about the election. I want to look ahead, but just for a second look back toward the election. When you think of the results and your government's reduced mandate, how much of that is on you?\nPMJT: I think politics is very leader-centric, so I certainly take part of that responsibility, there's no question about it. But Canadians also sent a message that they want better collaboration, more partnership with other parties, with the provinces, on the big priorities they put forward. Canadians said to two-thirds of us 'we want more action on climate change' and we're going to do that. But two-thirds of us also said 'we want that Trans Mountain pipeline expansion,' and we're going forward with that. So there are lots of things that we're doing that are representative of the desires that\u00a0Canadians want and I take responsibility for paying very close attention to these election results and working differently because of it.\nVK: I want to ask you about something specific, then, on what happened during the election and how you dealt with it since, and that is the emergence of those photos of you in blackface. I remember, I think it was in Winnipeg, when you acknowledged that growing up you had a blind spot partly because of your upbringing.\u00a0 When I look at the composition of cabinet right now there's one black minister, there's to my knowledge only one black chief of staff, three of the top positions other than Minister Freeland -- Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Justice -- all occupied by white men. Have you really learned from the experience, and have you really addressed it in your actions?\nPMJT: Well, I think there is always a lot more to do, and one of the things we've talked about is the need to step up on unconscious bias and systemic discrimination. And that means changing our hiring practices,\u00a0 changing how we reach out to bring in more diverse candidates so there can be more cabinet ministers down the line. This is a process --\nVK: There are four black MPs, with respect, there could have been more black ministers.\nPMJT: Listen, we're always going to make decisions based on what the right fit is. There's a lot of things that go into it, and we're going to keep looking for opportunities to present judges, cabinet appointments across the government that look more like Canada.\nVK: The UN Decade for People of African Descent Push Coalition says that your cabinet choices leave it questioning your commitment to improve the lives of black Canadians. Do they have a point?\nPMJT: I've worked with the committee, I've worked with the Federation of African Canadians on the UN Decade, we've put forward significant amounts of money for community programs, for educational programs not just, you know,\u00a0society in general, but within our government as well, making sure that where we're understanding the kinds of unconscious biases that exist. There's lots more to do, I certainly agree that, and we're going to work with the community to do that.\nVK: I guess my question is though, could you, given what happened during the campaign, done more, even just through the selection of your cabinet?\nPMJT: I think there's always ways to do more, but I don't think we can limit to just one choice or, you know, one area. It needs to be much broader than that. I'm pleased to have an extraordinarily diverse Cabinet, and we're going to continue to do that. We're going to continue to make sure that our appointments across the government, and that our staffing choices all reflect the diversity of Canada including fighting anti-black racism.\nVK:\u00a0 Taking a bit of a turn on an announcement that your government made today around vaping. The announcement was to restrict advertising because of the negative effects of vaping that we're seeing so predominantly among Canadian youth. Why didn't your government go further and announce restrictions on the nicotine level and just ban flavoured vaping altogether?\nPMJT: This is definitely a first step, and that's certainly what the health minister talked about. There's a lot more information to gather, there's a lot more understanding to know. We know that restricting access and restricting advertising, particularly in its impact on young people, is a significant step, but we're very worried about the reports of extremely negative impacts of vaping.\nVK:\u00a0Are you worried about the industry suing the government? Like what would hold you back right now from moving further and faster?\nPMJT: I think we need to leave room for proper science. We're a government that works on evidence-based decisions --\u00a0\nVK:\u00a0 -- With respect, Health Canada has known since 2014 that it was having a really negative impact on the health of youth. This isn't necessarily a new revelation for Health Canada.\u00a0\nPMJT: Yeah, and there's more to do and we're going to keep doing it.\u00a0\nVK: And when --\u00a0 Is there a timeline for those decisions?\nPMJT: As you saw, I sent out very strong instructions to our health minister to move forward on keeping Canadians protected.\nVK: Okay, you said at the beginning that you think a lot about Canada's place in the world. When you think of Canada's foreign policy towards China, how would you describe it at this point?\nPMJT: At this point, we are very much challenged because\u00a0our position is that these two Canadians who have been unfairly detained need to be returned home. And we have done nothing but stand up for the rule of law and abide by our international obligations. And we certainly hope that China understands that and we can come to solving this situation.\u00a0\nVK: If you were\u00a0to articulate though, what our foreign policy is beyond just being strained with China, like, what is the foreign policy that you want to pursue as prime minister with China?\nPMJT: Well, we recognize that China is one of the most important economies in the world, that it is a potential market for Canadian goods, it is a potential partner in investments. But the challenge of human rights, the challenge of these detained Canadians, is always something that we have to be very, very aware of. China has a different approach towards the rules-based order than Canada does, and we have to have our eyes open to that even as we look to engage in ways that benefit Canadians.\u00a0\nVK: Is it just the Canadians who are detained, though? I mean they've got one million Uyghurs set up in what look like concentration camps right now --\nPMJT: -- Concerns with Hong Kong and the 300,000 Canadians, their concerns with the situation. The Weavers which I brought up with Premier Li last time I met with him. These are a range of concerns we have\u00a0when we talk about human rights, and the approach that China has on that as being something that is of concern to us.\u00a0\nVK: Your defence minister said that China is not an adversary. Do you agree?\nPMJT: I think in some ways there is an adversarial context in that we want them to release those Canadians who've been unfairly detained. In other areas, we're able to work on trade and work through issues like the beef and pork issue we were able to resolve this summer. There's obviously a multifaceted, complex relationship with China, as there has always been, but right now it is dominated by the fact that they have unfairly detained two Canadians.\nVK: Does it have to be so multifaceted though? I think for a lot of Canadians it's hard to rectify. Okay we want to do more business with you, but at the same time, you've got these two Canadians detained, you've got a million Uyghurs, what's happening in Hong Kong -- should we be pursuing a bigger relationship with China, given that country's record?\u00a0\nPMJT: Well, talk to our canola farmers about that, talk to the lobster fishermen on the East Coast who are seeing exports to China being incredibly good for their communities. Talk\u00a0to the cherry farmers and the cherry growers in the Okanagan. You know, China is a really important market for many of our natural resources. We just have to be careful, as we always have, that as we engage, we say strong on standing up for human rights. As we look to create mutual benefits through greater trade.\nVK: How do you stay strong on human rights, though, if you're sending the message that you want to do more with them?\u00a0\nPMJT: Listen, if Canada only ever spoke with countries who share our values we'd only talk to like six countries around the world.\nVK: I'm not just saying just talk, I'm saying trade--\nPMJT: We are the one country in the world, the one G7 country in the world, that has free trade deals with all other G7 countries. Canada is a trading nation. We've always had more resources than we have a domestic market to fully benefit from them. We're always going to be reliant on trade. And trade is a way of having an influence and having an importance to countries that we want to see make changes. And that's been a longstanding position around China, but it's one that we continually re-evaluate and continually\u00a0focus on.\nVK: Given how they've treated this country over the last year, would you ever pursue a formal free trade agreement again with China?\nPMJT: I think we're a long way from that. I think there is a role that Canada can play in helping China understand and play, perhaps in a more positive way, according to the international rules-based order. But China will make its own decisions. And until there is room to find that common ground, I don't think that greater free trade with China is really something we can explore.\nVK: But you haven't, you won't rule it out if the situation were to be resolved with those two Canadians?\u00a0\nPMJT: Oh if the situation were to be resolved with these two Canadians and we were to see significant, positive motion in other ways, this might be interesting. But it's not for anytime soon.\nLook at the NAFTA principle, right, of signing labour deals with Mexico to bring up the quality of life and the quality of labour conditions for workers in Mexico. That is one of the goals, one of the side benefits, of having trade agreements with countries who have very different approaches, or resources, or even standards than us.\nVK: If my memory serves me right though, when you tried to bring that up with China when you were there for those initial free trade talks, they balked.\nPMJT: Yeah, they were resistant to it. And that was one of the reasons we realized 'okay maybe there's not a path we're at for a greater trade agreement right now.'\nVK: Do you believe that there is a path out for those two Canadians that does not involve the end of the case involving Meng Wanzhou?\nPMJT: I certainly hope so, and that's certainly what we're working for. We've been very, very clear that this is a context where Canada is simply applying the rule of law and a long-standing extradition treaty with our closest partner and for China to have detained two Canadians in retaliation demonstrates that they don't entirely appreciate how our justice system works.\u00a0\nVK: Another big relationship we have of course is with the United States. Yesterday the president of the United States was impeached by the House of Representatives. Many Canadians, I'm not sure but I'm guessing you among them, watched that unfold to a certain degree. What's going through your head as you're watching that unfold?\nPMJT: My focus is on what matters for Canadians. And what matters for Canadians is us moving forward with the Republicans and the Democrats on the ratification of the new NAFTA deal.\nVK: So you had no thoughts when you saw the President of the United States impeached?\nPMJT: I don't engage on the domestic side with that. My role is to stand up for Canada's interests. And Canada's interests is to make sure that Americans are able, and the American Congress is able, to move forward with ratification so we can give the certainty to investors, a certainty to businesses, but also the reassurance to the millions of Canadians whose jobs depend on free trade with the United States.\nVK:\u00a0 Do you think the president was wrong to ask a foreign country to investigate a political rival?\nPMJT: That's the conversation going on right now in the United States. My focus is on the ratification for Canadians.\nVK: Would you ever ask a foreign country to investigate Andrew Scheer?\nPMJT: I never have.\nVK: Would you ever?\nPMJT: No.\nVK:\u00a0That video of you at NATO talking about President Trump -- were you making fun of him?\nPMJT: No, I was talking about what happened in my day. We were talking about whether the president was going to be late for this event. I said 'well, he does press conferences, that I'm happy to be part of, at every time so it's possible he's gonna be running late. And oh, by the way, in mine, in case you're interested, fellow G7 countries, he announced that we're going to Camp David\u00a0and it surprised his advisers.' It was a conversation about how my day went and how my afternoon went amongst colleagues.\nVK: Were you surprised, then, that he called you two-faced because of that?\u00a0\nPMJT: You know, I think we've been through\u00a0interesting moments in terms of the relationship with the president before. We were able, just a few days later, to talk about the ratification, or the approaching signing\u00a0of the new NAFTA. We were ready to sign it a few days after that. We're staying focused on the big things despite the other things.\n.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JustinTrudeau</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EmmanuelMacron</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a> and other VIPs shared a few words at a Buckingham Palace reception Tuesday. No one mentions <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realDonaldTrump</a> by name, but they seem to be discussing his lengthy impromptu press conferences from earlier in the day. (Video: Host Pool) <a href=\"https://t.co/dVgj48rpOP\">pic.twitter.com/dVgj48rpOP</a>\nVK: It looks like NAFTA will be voted on by the House, I think, today. When will it be introduced for ratification here in Canada?\u00a0\nPMJT: We've already started the process in the House last week.\u00a0\nVK: So when do you expect ratification will be up for a vote?\nPMJT: We're going to do it as quickly as we can. A lot will depend on the other parties in the House. We're reasonably comfortable that we're going to have the support to pass it because the Conservatives were in agreement and approval of it last year even before we got all the improvements we got to it through working with the Democrats. So I'm confident it's going to pass, but we still need to make sure that it passes quickly.\u00a0\nAnd that's what we're calling on all parties in the House, and indeed all Canadians, to tell parties in the House that it needs to be moved quickly because their jobs --\u00a0 so many Canadian jobs -- rely on trade with the United States.\nVK: When you talk about your place, and Canada's place more specifically, in the world, that video that I just referenced, the pictures of you in blackface, the trip to India. Do you ever feel like you've embarrassed Canada?\u00a0\nPMJT: I think on the side of actual serious accomplishments, having been able to win an election in talking about putting a price on pollution in a compelling way where there is a majority of Canadians -- two-thirds of Canadians saying yes we want more action on climate change -- is an example to the world that the world has noticed that I have many conversations about in NATO. How we've been able to sign. As many trade deals and enact them, as we have. As I said we now have privileged access to two-thirds of the global GDP. All other G7 countries. These are the kinds of things that the world looks at and says 'wow we're in a moment of real protectionism and you're welcoming in immigrants and you're able to sign big trade deals and you're able to move forward on fighting climate change.' The world is really noticing the things we're able to do.\u00a0\nVK: So do your actions not take away from that at all? Do you ever feel like they have?\nPMJT: No, I think there's\u00a0always challenging moments in every country and every democracy and every leader's experience. But I think my responsibility and certainly what I share with Canadians and with others is that I'm going to stay focused on the things that really matter to Canadians' day to day lives.\u00a0\nVK: Have you asked Rona Ambrose to be the next ambassador to the United States?\nPMJT: I am going to allow the Conservative leadership to unfold as it will and I'm not going to interfere in one way or another.\nVK: Well, the story about whether or not she might be the next ambassador proceeded the start of that, proceeded Mr. Scheer's resignation. Are you interested in her serving in that role?\nPMJT: Rona did a very good job on our NAFTA panel and has some reflections to make about what she wants in her future and I wish her well.\u00a0\nVK: Does that mean that you have asked her to serve in that role?\u00a0\nPMJT: I'm not going to comment on that, but no I haven't asked her.\nVK: You haven't asked\u00a0her. Are you worried about the possibility of her as leader of that party?\nPMJT: You know, I think the Conservative Party has some big reflections to make about whether or not they're going to stand up for women's rights and LGBT rights, whether they're going to call for real action on climate change and understand that there is a path forward to grow the economy and fight climate change at the same time, and those are pretty foundational questions that don't really hinge on which leader they choose.\u00a0\nThese are fundamental questions the Conservative Party is going to have to grapple with. I'm going to allow them to go through that process and I'll stay focused on the mandate and the agenda that we're putting forward for Canadians.\nVK: I ask because exactly what you just described is what your party was able to zone in on during the campaign, particularly Andrew Scheer's stance on social issues as well as the climate file. Ms. Ambrose, at least at this point, is viewed as someone who would be less vulnerable to those criticisms and I wonder if that is a worry to you given the current context of a minority government?\nPMJT: I'm not going to weigh in on who the Conservatives should or shouldn't have as leader. That's a decision for Conservatives to take, and I wish them luck. I know we've had some difficult leadership elections, we've had some successful leadership processes, some that didn't lead to the rebuild that we would have liked. It's a process the Conservative Party has to go through.\nVK: Do you think it was the right decision for Andrew Scheer to step down?\nPMJT: That was his decision and I respect him for taking it and wish him the best.\nVK: Speaking of decisions, the next fixed election date is in October 2023. Do you plan on serving that mandate? Will you leave it to the opposition to put that mandate in jeopardy? Would you ever do anything to cause an election?\nPMJT:\u00a0 Listen, our focus is on getting big things done for Canadians, continuing to work on affordability, on fighting climate change, on keeping Canadians safe, on working on health care. There's a lot of things to do. We're going to take as much time as we have to deliver for Canadians and I'm going to let Parliament decide when the next election is.\nVK: But what about from your party's perspective? Essentially, are you committed to serving until that date, until 2023, unless you lose a confidence vote to the opposition?\nPMJT: We have a fixed election date. I respected it last time. I intend to respect it, if it's at all possible, this time. But we know that minority governments have things happen and we need to be ready for an election as soon as possible, which is something that we're working on.\nVK: Okay, I'll leave it there. Prime Minister, thank you.\nVK:\u00a0Who is your political hero?\nPMJT: My father.\nVK: Who is your personal hero?\nPMJT: My mother.\u00a0\nVK: Donald Trump or Joe Biden?\nPMJT: I'm Canadian so I don't have a vote.\u00a0\nVK: Rona Ambrose or Peter MacKay?\u00a0\nPMJT: I'm a Liberal so I don't have a vote.\nVK: I handed that one to you. And do you have a new year's resolution?\nPMJT: You're already seeing it. More collaboration, more thoughtful engagement. Looking for common ground instead of forging through with my own perspective.\n"}]
