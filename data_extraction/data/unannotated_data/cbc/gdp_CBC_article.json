For comparison purposes, the U.S. economy shrank by five per cent over the same time frame.\nWhile the vast majority of the contraction came in March when the pandemic hit, January and February's numbers weren't overly strong to begin with due to pre-existing drags such as rail blockades across the country, and a teacher strike in Ontario in February.\u00a0\nIn absolute terms, Canada's gross domestic product was 2.1 per cent smaller over the three months\u00a0than it was at the end of 2019. But much of that came in March alone, as GDP declined by 7.2 per cent during the month. That makes March 2020 the worst month for Canada's economy since record-keeping began in 1961.\nJust about everything got walloped, as 19 out of the 20 sectors the data agency monitors got smaller. The one exception was utilities, which eked out a gain of 0.4 per cent.\nWhile March shattered the previous monthly record for slowdowns, early data suggests April's numbers will be even worse, showing an 11 per cent contraction from March's already depressed level.\nBy sector, the slowdown in March was striking, including:\nEconomist Doug Porter at Bank of Montreal found some reasons for optimism amid the gloomy numbers, noting that many parts of the economy did better than initially feared.\n\"The new news here is that the figures were a little less dire than feared,\" he said. \"Consumer spending\u00a0fell only nine\u00a0per cent in the quarter, while business investment was down a mild 2.7 per cent\u00a0(less bad than Q4 in fact), and housing dipped just 0.4 per cent.\"\nOverall, Porter said the 8.2 per cent pace of contraction\u00a0puts Canada right in the middle of its G7 peers. Canada's economy did worse than Japan's, which shrank at a 3.4 per cent pace, over the period. But Canada is faring much better than\u00a0Italy and France, which\u00a0saw their economies shrink at paces of 17.7\u00a0 and\u00a0 21.4 per cent in the same period.\nAlicia Macdonald with the Conference Board of Canada said \"the numbers this morning leave no question that Canada is in the midst of its deepest recession in decades.

The Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.\nGross domestic product increased at a 2.1 per cent annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of third-quarter GDP. That was up from the 1.9 per cent pace estimated last month. The economy grew at a 2.0 per cent pace in the April-June period.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast third-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at 1.9 per cent.\nThe upward revision to GDP reflected more inventory accumulation than initially thought, as well as a less steep pace of contraction in business investment. Inventories increased at a $79.8 billion US pace instead of the $69.0 billion rate reported last month.\nWhen measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.4 per cent rate in the last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a rate of 0.9 per cent in the second quarter.

The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies.\nGrowth has slowed from the 3.1 per cent rate notched in the first three months of the year. The slowdown is largely blamed on the Trump administration's trade war with China, which has eroded business confidence, contributing to the second straight quarterly decline in business investment.\nThe fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also sapping momentum from the expansion, now in its 11th year. But there are some hopeful signs for business investment.\nThe Commerce Department said on Wednesday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3 per cent last month as households spent more on electricity and gas, offsetting a drop in new motor vehicle purchases.\nWith consumer spending rising moderately, inflation remained benign in October. Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% last month, lifted by food, energy goods and services prices. The PCE price index was unchanged in August and September.\nWages increased 0.4 per cent in October after climbing 0.1 per cent in September. Wages were boosted by a $7.2 billion adjustment to account for General Motors strike pay and payments associated with a new contract for members of the United Automobile Workers union.\nWith spending outpacing income growth, savings fell to $1.29 trillion from $1.34 trillion in September.\nOrders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 1.2 per cent last month, the largest gain since January, after falling 0.5 per cent in September. These so-called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery, computers and electronic products and fabricated metals.\nEconomists had forecast core capital goods orders would drop 0.3 per cent in October. Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.8 per cent last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.\nCore capital goods shipments fell 0.8 per cent in September.\nBusiness investment dropped at a 2.7 per cent rate in the third quarter, rather than contracting at a 3.0 per cent pace as previously reported. The declines in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells, were not as steep as previously estimated.\nA report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Nov. 23. Claims had been stuck at a five-month high over the previous two weeks, pointing to some easing in the labor market.\nStill, the labour market remains on solid footing, helping to underpin consumer spending.

The virus has brought almost 34,000 deaths, social isolation, job loss and deep worry about the country's economic future.\nAs pandemic restrictions were lifted this past week,\u00a0with Italy opening its borders to EU travellers and allowing inter-regional travel,\u00a0the country's world-renowned museums and cultural sites also reopened. With only a trickle of EU tourists arriving, Italians have a\u00a0historic opportunity: the chance to see their own masterpieces free from throngs of tourists\u00a0and by booking just days in advance, rather than weeks or months.\n\"I've been here six or seven times, but this is first I've ever seen these works of art without battling the hordes,\" said\u00a0Patrizia Poggi, who works as a custodian at Rome's nearby Capitoline Museums. She was also among the first visitors at the newly reopened Vatican Museums.\nLike many taking advantage of the drop in numbers, Poggi was keen to see the Michelangelo-frescoed Sistine Chapel near empty, and also to gaze upon the ancient sculpture of\u00a0Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons, a stunning, life-sized marble of a Trojan priest and his sons attacked by sea serpents excavated in the early 16th\u00a0century.\nNormally, the Vatican Museums see an average of 20,000 people stream through its galleries each day \u2014\u00a0and in peak times, as many as 29,000, said director Barbara Jatta.\nReservation numbers for the initial days of reopening, by contrast, hovered between 1,000 and 2,000. The three-month closure has cost the Vatican an estimated $38 million in lost ticket sales. Jatta admitted with a chuckle that she misses the crowds. But for locals, she said \"this is the moment of a lifetime to come visit the museum.\"\nTo cater to their new target audience, the Vatican has shifted opening hours later in the day to make it easier for Rome's inhabitants to visit after work; it now closes at 8 p.m. on\u00a0 most weekdays and 10 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays. It has also limited group visits to 10 and lengthened intervals between them to 15 minutes in order to manage the physical distancing regulations.\nThe museums, which include\u00a0a research component, took advantage of the lockdown to improve their website and online archives; forward work on an Egyptian coffins project; and complete the five-year-long restoration of two frescos believed to be the last works of the Renaissance master Raphael, Jatta said.\nThe\u00a0Uffizi\u00a0Gallery in Florence\u00a0is also encouraging Italians to visit. Before the pandemic, as many as 10,000 visitors passed through famous Renaissance galleries in a day.\u00a0The first week after reopening, reservations and daily visits averaged about 1,000 a day, reaching a peak of 2,100 the first Sunday after reopening.\u00a0\n\"We haven't seen these low numbers since the 1950s,\" said Eike Schmidt, director of the Uffizi. Like Jatta, he is doing his best to put a positive spin the loss in ticket sales \u2014\u00a0$18 million for the museum's 85 days of closure.\u00a0\n\"For this type of tourism where you can see masterpieces without others in your way, you have to go back to the times of Dostoevsky, Rilke and Nathaniel Hawthorne,\" he said, referring to three famous visitors from the 19th\u00a0century.\nIndeed, the unusual nature of a pandemic makes the reopening a\u00a0historical anomaly. The Uffizi has been closed only three times before: during the Second World War, the 1966 Florence flood, and a Mafia bombing just outside the museum in 1993. After each closure, said Schmidt, \u00a0the numbers of visitors surged. But he doesn't expect to see that until there is a\u00a0vaccine for COVID-19.\nFor Italy as a whole, it's bad economic news. Tourism makes up 13 per cent of the country's GDP.\nBut, Schmidt, along with Florence's Mayor Dario Nardella, is hoping to leverage the current situation to help shift\u00a0how tourists visit the city and its treasures.\nTickets to the Uffizi, for instance, are now bundled to include a number of lesser-known, but world-class museums, with in built-in discount for those who stay longer and see more sites.\n\"In a city like Florence or Venice, people come from all over the world yet go to see a very limited set of attractions. So it's very important to put other attractions on their maps,\" he said.\nSchmidt cited the much less visited archeological museum and the Museo Opificio delle Pietre Dure, a workshop of marble-inlay founded by the Medici family in the late 1500s and still operative today. Both are now part of the Uffizi ticket. He also plans to increase the number of theatre and musical events held in the lesser-known museums.\n\"Rather than just go through your bucket list and check off Michelangelo's David and Botticelli's Venus, you can see more and more in depth,\" Schmidt said. \"It's a little like fast food and slow food. You get much more with slow food.\"\nThe allusion to slow food \u2014\u00a0the Italian-born movement to protect traditional foods that erupted in opposition to McDonald's going into Rome's Piazza di Spagna in 1986 \u2014\u00a0is no accident.\nWATCH | Florence's mayor on the benefits of 'slow tourism':\nNardella, along with mayors across Europe, have hoisted the banner of \"slow tourism\" to describe their goals post-pandemic, and\u00a0are pushing the European Commission to create a specific fund to help cultural and tourist cities become sustainable, resilient and livable.\n\"We want to use culture to send a message that after this crisis we want to change lifestyle models, the economy and model of tourism of the city,\" Nardella said, through a tri-coloured Italian flag mask the day the Uffizi re-opened.\nHe said with its thriving manufacturing and fashion industry, Florence is not solely dependent on tourism, like Venice. However, he says, tourism has overrun its historic centre, purging it of a diverse local life and economy.\nTo change that, Nardella has launched a new strategy\u00a0with financial incentives to open businesses in the city centre, especially artisanal activities; for young couples to buy homes; and for international universities to set up campuses.\nThe city, he says, will also ban daily tourist buses from the centre, block the building of new hotels and place a three-year ban on new restaurants and pubs. Like Milan and Rome, kilometres of cycling paths will be laid down.\n\"We have to sell a new kind of tourism and slow tourism is a good strategy,\" Nardella said. \"We don't want daily tourists only for three hours who take some photos and don't go into a museums or restaurants ... If you want to know Florence, you must stay in this city, living the sensations and experiences. This is the new view we understand after the terrible pandemic.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1732957251767", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "John Last", "title": "6 experts' advice for saving the northern tourism industry", "description": "Economists, industry leaders weigh in on options for helping Canada's \u2018hardest hit\u2019 industry", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/experts-tourism-advice-north-1.5600575", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5538862.1587414924!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canadian-river-expeditions-and-nahanni-river-adventures.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 06, 2020 7:00 AM CT", "2020-06-06T13:00:00.910Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "With borders closed and gatherings banned, Canada's tourism industry is one of the country's hardest hit sectors.\n\"It's just the biggest, single impact that tourism has had since its initial ... growth after World War 2,\" said Patrick Brouder, who holds a research chair in tourism and rural development at Vancouver Island University. \"There's never been anything like this.\"\nBut in the North, where mandatory self-isolation orders are still in place and borders remain closed to most non-essential travel, this bleak situation is doubly grim.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in all three territories saw tourism as a key driver of economic diversification, offering opportunities for small businesses and community governments away from the boom-bust resource economy.\nAnd for a while, it was working \u2014 in 2018-19, the N.W.T. and Yukon both counted record numbers of visitors. Neil Hartling, the chair of the Tourism Industry Association of Yukon, estimates the value of tourist spending there at a quarter of a billion dollars. In the N.W.T., the government set a target of $207 million by 2021 \u2014 and almost surpassed it three\u00a0years early.\nWhile tourism accounts for just a small percentage of GDP in both places, it punches above its weight in employment. Statistics Canada numbers from 2014 show that while tourism accounted for just 1.7 per cent of GDP in the N.W.T. and 2.7 per cent in Yukon, the sector employed 4.7 per cent and 7.5 per cent of residents respectively.\nYet since the pandemic put many of those employees out of work, only the Yukon has been proactive in targeting support for the sector.\n\"We were the first to be hit, the hardest hit, and we'll be the last to be saved across Canada,\" said Keith Henry, president and CEO of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada (ITAC).\nWhat options are left for governments to support the ailing tourism industry? CBC spoke to six experts on northern tourism to hear what they think.\nThe pandemic has created a \"crisis of consumer confidence\" in tourism \u2014 and that means it won't rebound like other sectors as economies reopen, according to Richard Forbes, a senior economist with the Conference Board of Canada.\n\"It's never going to return completely to normal,\" he said.\nThat means governments need to be prepared to offer tangible support to the sector well after the pandemic's worst phases are over.\n\"Businesses are going to be on life support for the foreseeable future,\" said Forbes.\nTo date, that support has come mostly from the federal government, though Yukon has created dedicated funds to cover tourism operators' fixed expenses, reimburse companies for event cancellations\u00a0and support the arts sector.\nHartling, with Yukon's tourism association, said extending that relief through to next summer will be \"absolutely critical.\"\nEven if they open, many operators won't be able to break even until next year at the earliest, he said, and those that do open will be limited by public health orders.\nThat means many will remain closed. But Steven Nitah, a \u0141utsel K'e Dene First Nation member who spearheaded the creation of Canada's newest national park, said that doesn't need to mean they're inactive.\n\"Now's the time to work with them,\" Nitah said. \"Invest in those [businesses] and create local employment.\"\nNitah said facilities like \u0141utsel K'e's Frontier Fishing Lodge need upgrades and renovations to be brought up to code. Government investment could create jobs to do that work.\nHenry, with ITAC, agrees that for many of his members, just extending that relief is not enough.\n\"There needs to be some liquidity injected into businesses across the country,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"The challenge we've got with Indigenous tourism is it's relatively young industry,\" Henry said. \"So a lot of these businesses \u2026 just don't have the cash flow and the financial security to survive a lengthy delay.\"\nITAC is lobbying for $20-30 million in short-term grants for tourism companies, combined with a further $557 million in long-term lending offered through Indigenous financial institutions.\n\"Part of what we were hoping would happen \u2026 is some of the provinces and territories would also partner,\" said Henry. \"That hasn't happened at all, nor has there been any outreach to make it happen.\"\nWhile borders remain closed to non-essential travel, federal and territorial governments have redirected spending to encourage \"staycations\" in Canadians' own backyards. That could be a boon for the North, where the largest group of travellers already comes from Canada.\n\"I think if you think about tourism in the North, there's huge potential,\" said Brouder, the researcher. \"The idea of something like Aurora viewing \u2026 is also still appealing to Canadians, most of whom still haven't really had that real experience.\"\nThe North tends to attract adventurous travellers, said Hartling, the chair of Yukon's tourism association. They may be willing to travel sooner than other tourists.\nPlus, the North's relatively low traffic and COVID-free status is an advertisement in itself, said Nitah.\n\"When travel opens up, people might want to be visiting remote locations like Northwest Territories,\" he said.\n\"I don't think it'll be a windfall for anybody,\" said Hartling, \"but it'll \u2026 probably mean the difference between a slow death [and] making it through.\"\nHere, too, Yukon has been more proactive, announcing the end of border restrictions with B.C. as early as July 1 \u2014 what Brouder calls an \"evidence-based approach.\"\n\"They're looking at the numbers of [COVID-19] cases in British Columbia, and they're saying it's not a major issue there,\" he said \u2014 while the benefits of opening to B.C., where most trips to Yukon originate, outweigh the risks.\nWhile the N.W.T. and Nunavut are planning to allow travel between the two territories, Forbes, the economist, cautions that is unlikely to have much of an effect.\n\"The biggest thing, for sure, is to first let people from outside the territories in\u00a0to visit,\" he said.\nIf the plan is to boost travel within the North, Nitah said, territories could still be doing more.\n\"Every year, northerners that travel South get a tax deduction,\" he said. \"Let's see what can be done to get that deduction for travel in the North.\"\nForbes agrees some support for air travel will be necessary. With passenger capacity limited during a public health crisis, airlines may be forced to raise already high ticket prices, he said, which could present a big barrier to attracting Canadian travellers.\nRight now, experts say, it looks like territorial tourism policy is being developed in a vacuum. That needs to change.\n\"The Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon should be looking to each other to see what can we learn from our other northern partners who are facing [an] extreme drop in tourist numbers,\" said Brouder.\n\"The way the reopening across the country is happening is certainly not consistent,\" said\u00a0Henry, with ITAC. \"It's creating a lot of confusion.\"\nAdding to that confusion, Henry says, is that many northern communities are instituting their own travel bans that may outlast territorial ones.\nUnravelling that jurisdictional mess will take a lot of communication and cooperation \u2014 something Nitah, in \u0141utsel K'e, says is lacking.\n\"There seems to be no communication,\" he said. \"That lack of communication adds to the burden and stresses that they're facing.\"\nFor operators, banding together may be the best approach, Brouder said.\n\"The general trend we're seeing \u2026 is providers trying to think, how can we work together so we come out of this better than we went into it?\" he said. \"It's a long road, and it's not going to be over in one season.\n\"To get through that you want to have \u2026 many quality providers who are working together,\" he said, \"so that when the numbers pick up you have an even better tourism offering to make.\"\nTerritories, meanwhile, can expand their research. Pat Maher, a professor at Nippissing University who studies polar tourism, said other Arctic nations are months ahead in this pandemic, and provide examples to follow.\n\"We tend to look around domestically and [say], 'Let's just copy the guy next door,\" he said.\n\"I look towards Iceland and possibly even Norway where they're starting to see some opening up,\" he said. \"You're starting to see that domestic tourists putting some money back into the tourism economy.\n\"What can we spin that they've done there to work in our situation?\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description":

"source": "CBC News", "content": "With at least two million jobs lost across Canada due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy\u00a0officially in recession, more stimulus is expected from the federal government to get the economy moving again.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo date, the\u00a0government has spent more than $145 billion on direct support for Canadians related to COVID-19.\u00a0\nBeyond what has already been pledged for stimulus, experts say additional\u00a0investments in infrastructure, especially related to clean technology, are one of the best ways to get people back to work and to leave a lasting legacy.\u00a0\nFollowing the Great Recession of 2008, for example, Washington provided $983 billion US in stimulus spending but received little in the way of faster trains or better infrastructure, according to figures tabulated by Graham Allison, a Harvard University professor and former senior U.S. government adviser in his book Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides's Trap?\nChina, in contrast, used its stimulus to build a network of high-speed trains and other major projects, Allison noted.\u00a0\nTo create tangible, long-term benefits and get people back to work, here are five stimulus projects engineers, clean energy advocates and other experts say should be launched.\nTransportation accounts for 25 per cent Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, according to government data.\u00a0\nMany consumers are keen to transition to electric vehicles \u2014\u00a0but who wants to own a car you can't drive on a long-distance road trip due to a lack of charging stations on major highways?\u00a0\n\"It's a chicken-and-egg situation,\" Kasun Hewage, a professor of engineering at the University of British Columbia, said in an interview. \"People are not buying electric cars because they're worried about the infrastructure.\"\nWATCH | Slow uptake for electric cars in Canada:\nThe government has announced $130 million in funding, over five years ending in 2024, to develop a national recharging network.\u00a0\nBut that alone won't create enough charging stations to allow someone to drive an electric car from coast to coast, Hewage said, and the private sector is currently apprehensive about putting up the additional\u00a0cash for installation.\nBruce MacKay, a managing director of Hatch, a Mississauga, Ont.-based engineering firm, said current programs for charging stations could be rolled out more quickly if subsidies for electric cars were reintroduced by provinces like Ontario, and taxes on gasoline were increased.\u00a0\n\"A standardized, major roll-out of electric charging stations ... would accelerate the conversion of the vehicle fleet to electric,\" MacKay said.\u00a0\nBuilding a network to cover 25 per cent, 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the country would cost roughly $1 billion, $2 billion and $5 billion, respectively, said Hewage.\u00a0\nCost: About $5 billion for electric charging stations to cover the whole country, Hewage said.\nClimate change is expected to exacerbate flooding across Canada, and current water infrastructure \u2014\u00a0especially in big cities like Toronto and Montreal \u2013\u00a0isn't ready for the additional pressures.\u00a0\n\"Canada's wastewater management system has a $50 billion deficit,\" said Rehan Sadiq, a professor of civil engineering at the University of British Columbia. \"It's a major piece of green infrastructure from the perspective of climate resilience and Canadians' well being.\"\u00a0\nFixing and improving aging pipe, sewage systems and treatment facilities would be a great way to create jobs and meet environmental targets, he added.\nWater infrastructure is normally owned by municipal governments, but they often don't have the money needed for the upgrades, Sadiq said.\nThe federal government has been spending some money on improving the system,\u00a0he said, but the financing could use an additional shot in the arm. Provinces and municipalities might also pledge new funds if the federal government got the ball rolling, he said.\u00a0\nCost: $3 billion initially from the federal government, Sadiq estimated.\u00a0\nProvinces are currently spending about $1 billion annually on subsidies and other programs to make homes more energy efficient, according to calculations from Efficiency Canada, an Ottawa-based advocacy organization.\u00a0\nFor that funding, about 0.6 per cent of buildings in Canada can be retrofitted annually, said Brendan Haley, the group's policy director.\u00a0\n\"That could be ramped up significantly,\" he said in an interview. He said doing so wouldn't create new bureaucracy, as the provincial programs, assessment criteria and disbursement plans for subsidies or loans to homeowners already exist.\nEnergy consumption for homes and buildings accounts for 17 per cent of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, according to government data.\nThe total cost of retrofitting every building in Canada by 2050, a necessary shift in order to meet climate change commitments, would be about $300 billion, Haley said.\u00a0\nEnergy-saving retrofits for most houses include techniques such: installing better insulation, improving windows to reduce heat loss, installing a zero carbon heating system, and in some cases, solar panels.\u00a0\nWATCH | Pandemic won't be a cure-all for climate change:\nAs a job creation strategy, retrofitting old buildings is especially effective, Haley said because about 60 per cent of the cost of a retrofit is spent on labour.\u00a0\nWith residential construction expected to drop by about one-third this year compared to 2019 due to the pandemic, keeping construction workers employed with retrofits makes economic sense, Hewage said.\u00a0\n\"Go small\"\u00a0costs: $11 billion in seed capital upfront for a green infrastructure bank, $500 million for training new workers.\n\"Go big\" costs: $300 billion over the next 15 years, Haley said.\u00a0\nBroadly, Canada's infrastructure deficit is more than $150 billion, according to the Canadian Federation of Municipalities, a coalition of city governments.\u00a0\nFollowing the Second World War through the 1950s, Canada was spending roughly three per cent of the GDP on infrastructure, compared to about 0.4 per cent today, said UBC's Sadiq.\u00a0\nThis lack of spending means the quality of key transportation links is deteriorating, causing safety fears and increased travel times, among other problems.\u00a0\nFor bridges and tunnels, the infrastructure deficit is about $21\u00a0billion, according to the 2019 Canadian Infrastructure Report Card, a report from engineers and municipalities.\u00a0\u00a0\nForty per cent of bridges and roads are not in good condition and about 10,000 bridges need immediate attention, said Shahria Alam, a\u00a0professor of engineering at UBC.\u00a0\nCost: An initial investment of about $3 billion from the federal government, Alam said.\u00a0\nThe federal government\u00a0recently announced $1.7 billion to help clean up orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells in Western Canada.\u00a0\nA similar program should be launched for abandoned mines, said Sandro Perruzza, CEO of the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers.\u00a0\nIn Ontario alone, there are some 5,000 known abandoned mines, closed prior to 1991, which have no current ownership, he said.\u00a0\n\"These abandoned sites are an enormous environmental concern, such as ground water contamination of leachate, and pose additional health and safety risks to surrounding communities,\" Perruzza said in an interview.\u00a0\nTaking on the issue would improve land and water quality, especially in northern and rural communities, and would employ thousands of people, he added.\nCost: In Ontario alone, at least $2.59 billion, Peruzza said.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Joel Dryden", "title": "With $20B Alberta deficit possible, Kenney warns province won't be able to 'insulate everyone'",

many, it won't be enough.\n\"We cannot save every business that is going to be distressed right now,\" Kenney said during a Facebook livestream. \"What makes me emotional and gives me an enormous amount of anxiety is \u2026 realizing there is not enough fiscal power in the government in Alberta to insulate everyone from the economic adversity we are going through.\"\nKenney said Alberta is likely to hit a deficit somewhere in the range of $20 billion this fiscal year\u00a0\u2014 an entirely reasonable figure given the situation the province now finds itself in during the pandemic, said University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe.\nBut though COVID-19\u00a0has presented new challenges for\u00a0Alberta, Tombe said it's important to remember that the province was already experiencing a significant period of no growth.\n\"Basically, Alberta has been experiencing a rising level of debt-to-GDP [gross domestic product] since the financial crisis,\" he said, referring to the ratio between what a government owes to its economic output.\u00a0High levels of debt-to-GDP mean countries and provinces are not generating enough money to pay off their debts.\n\"In 2007, we had net assets equivalent to 15 per cent of GDP, where we actually owned more than we owed\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we had negative net debt. Then the financial crisis turned the corner, and our financial situation has been deteriorating ever since.\"\nAlberta has been accumulating debt for well over a decade now, Tombe said. He estimates\u00a0the coming fiscal year could see deficits hit somewhere between $15 and\u00a0$20 billion.\n\"So you have to borrow to cover that, when you're spending more than you're bringing in,\" Tombe said. \"In addition, the government borrows for capital investment projects,\u00a0and that could be about $3 billion\u00a0to $4 billion more, and that's not counted as a deficit that still needs to be borrowed.\"\nOn top of that, Tombe said it's possible that the economy could shrink.\nProjections vary, but taking a real gross domestic product figure at a rate of eight per cent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0paired with a drop in oil prices\u00a0\u2014\u00a0could mean a shrinkage in the entire total income in the province by about 15 to 20 per cent.\nPut it all together, and Tombe said it would roughly double Alberta's debt-to-GDP ratio from just under 10 per cent to just under 20 per cent at this time next year.\nOn Twitter, Lindsay Tedds,\u00a0an associate professor of economics at the University of Calgary, said that debt-to-GDP ratio would\u00a0still allow the government to support more Albertans than Kenney suggests.\nRestarting this.

There's pros and cons to every choice, and so reasonable people can disagree,\" Tombe said.\n\"But if we're going to raise revenue, then I would recommend doing it in a way that hurts the economy the least, and that's through sales taxes.\"\nTombe said Alberta will also have to re-evaluate its fiscal plan given its reliance on oil prices, which he said were \"very optimistic numbers even at the time the budget was realized, but now [are] just crazy.\"\n\"We have now been experiencing large economic shocks for many, many years in a row, and we haven't fundamentally changed policy in this province,\" Tombe said.\u00a0\"If this crisis is not the moment for us to take a hard look at how we've been doing things, I don't know what is.\"\nThis week, Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews was authorized to borrow up to $25 billion for government programs and services and the COVID-19 response, nearly four times what was expected.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Ottawa Tourism getting $5.2M to help weather pandemic", "description": "Local tourism sector stands to lose out on $1.4B this year, agency predicts", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-tourism-federal-funding-1.5592966", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5170370.1560256868!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ottawa-tourism-byward-market-weather-york-street-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 01, 2020 10:50 AM ET", "2020-06-01T14:52:44.058Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The federal government will provide $5.2 million to Ottawa Tourism to help the city promote its beleaguered tourism industry.\u00a0\nThe investment, announced Sunday by Economic Development Minister M\u00e9lanie\u00a0Joly, comes from a larger $213-million fund run by the regional development agency FedDev Ontario, which supports small- and medium-size\u00a0businesses in the province.\u00a0\nThe funding marks a shift in the federal government's tourism promotion strategy\u00a0toward encouraging Canadians to travel within the country as international borders remain largely closed due to COVID-19.\nThe funds will be disbursed through the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario, which supports the province's tourism industry, and will \"help it bring visitors back to the National Capital Region as the economy reopens,\" the government said in a news release.\n\"Our tourism sector and the 1.8 million people it employs across Canada have been hit hard by COVID-19, and we're here for them,\" said Joly. \"During National Tourism Week, our message to the sector and those whose livelihoods depend on it is clear: we're working with you to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.

A government can accumulate and carry debt without necessarily\u00a0having to worry about ever fully settling the tab.\nThe federal government, for instance, has always carried some debt. At Confederation, with the new national government taking on the liabilities of the provinces, the federal debt stood at $75.7 million. The first budget was balanced, with $14 million in expenses matched by $14 million in revenue. But the federal government ran an annual deficit in three quarters of its first 150 years, according to a 2017\u00a0history of federal finances written by Livio Di Matteo, an economist at Lakehead University.\nBy 1914, the federal debt was $336 million. In 1945, after the Second\u00a0World War, the debt had reached $11.3 billion. By 1972, after the post-war expansion of social welfare programs, the debt was $26.2 billion.\nThere was much excitement recently over the prospect\u00a0of the federal debt reaching $1 trillion as a result of recent pandemic relief measures. But the accumulated debt almost certainly would have reached that mark at some point in the near future anyway.\nBy 2006, the debt was $481 billion. A decade later, it was $634 billion. Heading into this crisis, the debt stood at $685 billion.\nNone of those numbers constituted a crisis. But the fact of public debt is not a licence to spend without limits.\nIf a government's debt begins to grow faster than the national economy, public finances can become unsustainable. Financial markets can lose faith in that government's ability to repay its loans, while higher interest rates can make it more expensive to carry the debt. Higher spending and debt-to-GDP levels also can\u00a0limit a government's ability to respond to a crisis \u2014 like\u00a0the one we're experiencing now.\nIn the 1990s, for example, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio reached 66 per cent\u00a0and borrowing rates were nearly 10 per cent. Under pressure from international markets, Jean Chr\u00e9tien's Liberal government implemented deep cuts to get federal finances under control.\nOur current situation is not nearly that bad. Not yet, at any rate.\nHeading into this crisis, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio was 30.9 per cent. In April, the parliamentary budget officer projected that \u2014 even after a sudden drop in economic activity and a surge in federal spending \u2014 the ratio would reach 48.4 per cent. Borrowing rates are around one per cent and are likely to remain low for the foreseeable future.\nAnd there's little controversy right now about the need to spend public funds to support Canadians and keep the economy on life support. In fact, with a few exceptions, opposition MPs \u2014 including the Conservatives \u2014 have been calling on the government to do more and do it faster.\nStill, some are beginning to express concerns about the rapid accumulation of debt and asking what might need to be done once this crisis has passed.\nWatch: Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer calls on government to offer an economic plan\nIn the short term, priority has to be given to fighting a deadly virus and helping people and businesses get through the resulting interruptions to normal life. Failing to provide that support now would only make the situation worse.\nBut it's hard to know how events will unfold,\u00a0or what the fiscal situation will look like once the health crisis has passed. In an op-ed published\u00a0last week, economists\u00a0Paul Boothe and Christopher Ragan\u00a0explained why they see \"good reasons to worry about Canada's emerging fiscal situation.\"\u00a0As a counterpoint, three former analysts from the office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer argued that the\u00a0federal government's finances should remain sustainable\u00a0and concerns to the contrary are \"unwarranted.\"\nThe last time there was a real focus on reining in federal\u00a0spending was from 2010 to 2015, when Stephen Harper's Conservative government made a concerted effort to re-balance the books after the Great Recession.\nThat restraint might have given the federal government a bit more room to act now, but the Harper government's cuts in federal spending actually undercut economic growth at the time, as an analysis co-authored by former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge in 2016 demonstrated.\nThe Conservatives could boast during the 2015 campaign that they had balanced the budget, but the price was an economy that was more sluggish than it needed to be, while income inequality\u00a0and other pressures on households were allowed to linger.\nBeyond Canada, the post-recession push for austerity has been linked to deepening inequality.\nThat doesn't mean that fiscal restraint is bad, of course \u2014\u00a0but it might remind us\u00a0that balancing the budget should not been seen as\u00a0an end in itself.\nThe Conservative government's focus on quickly eliminating the deficit lined up with Harper's desire to reduce the reach of the federal government. It also fit within\u00a0a post-1990s consensus in and around federal politics that still focuses intently on whether the government's ink is red or black.\nJustin Trudeau shook up that consensus, but the Trudeau years haven't proved\u00a0that restraint is unnecessary, or\u00a0that the voting public doesn't care about balanced budgets any longer. Some of the Trudeau government's pre-pandemic spending might look wise in hindsight (one of the larger increases in spending was for Indigenous programs) but even Liberals might struggle to justify every additional dollar they've spent.\nThe post-pandemic years also might require a capacity for restraint that the Trudeau government has not yet demonstrated.\nBut the federal deficit isn't going to be the only thing worth worrying about in the wake of this pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has exposed the failings of long-term care in Canada and highlighted the importance of child care. Women and low-income earners have been hit hard by the economic shutdown and could face lasting setbacks.\nClimate change will still be a profound threat. Indigenous reconciliation will still be an unfinished project.\n\"The choice isn't to carry a debt [or] austerity,\" said Lindsay Tedds, an economist at the University of Calgary. \"There are way more choices than that.\"\nThe path forward might, for instance, involve both a review of federal spending and new investments. The focus, Tedds\u00a0suggests, should be on \"inclusive growth\" \u2014\u00a0a notion that emerged in recent years in response to concerns about income and gender inequalities and existing barriers to greater economic growth.\n\"In the aftermath of the recession, and as the calls for austerity mount, the question that will, in my view, be important\u00a0is how that austerity\u00a0is addressed,\" said Miles Corak, a Canadian economist who has done influential work on income inequality.\n\"If we have concerns about inequality, and particularly its long-run consequences, then it will be important that spending on government services \u2014\u00a0municipal governments, education, housing\u00a0and health care \u2014 are all adequately supported.\"\nTo that end, Corak said,\u00a0it could be worthwhile\u00a0to look at the revenue side of the equation to see\u00a0whether the federal tax system is \"progressive and fair.\"\nIdeally, the threat of this virus will\u00a0subside in time to give us all a moment to take stock. When that moment arrives,\u00a0it might be good to remember that the measure of this country's health can't be reduced to how close the budget is to balance.\n"}, {"author": "Kerry Campbell", "title": "COVID to push P.E.I. into record deficit territory, says premier", "description": "Opposition questions government projection employment numbers will recover by fall", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-covid-deficite-june-2020-1.5597531", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5585673.1590526114!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/may-26-2020.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 03, 2020 8:34 PM AT", "2020-06-03T23:34:24.183Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The P.E.I. government is set to table its operating budget in three weeks, and Premier Dennis King says the deficit could reach $175 million.\nThat would be the largest deficit for the province going back to at least 1999 \u2014\u00a0as far back as the province's online financial records extend.\nFor the past week,\u00a0MLAs in the legislature have been questioning government's spending in response to COVID-19, as outlined in a document that also looks at forecasts from major banks predicting P.E.I.'s economy could shrink anywhere from three to eight per cent in 2020.\n\"If you look at the world, for the last 12 weeks the world has stopped,\" King told reporters Wednesday. \"The economy has stopped around the world.\"\nAccording to preliminary figures released this week from Statistics Canada, P.E.I. led the country in economic growth for the second straight year for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, with real GDP growth of 4.5 per cent.\nNow faced with an economy that could shrink by the same amount in the current fiscal year, King said \"I'd be hard-pressed to believe there's been a time in the last 100 years where there's been such a fluctuation in such a short time.\"\n\"I think we're in a very, very difficult place and we should be prepared to dig in for a long road back.\"\nKing said the province is facing shortfalls in many of its major revenue sources including income, corporate, sales and gas taxes.\n\"People aren't moving around spending money so our revenue will be down, and we're needing to spend more money.\"\nAdditional spending nears $100 million so far this fiscal year.\nAccording to the province's report on COVID financing under debate in the legislature, the P.E.I. government had spent $44,680,000 on COVID-related supports for individuals so far this fiscal year; $39,361,000 on supports for businesses; and an additional $23,318,000 in medical expenses, partially offset by expected savings within the health-care system of $8,955,000, as some services and procedures have been cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic.\nThe province says those figures were current as of May 15.\nDuring question period Wednesday, interim Liberal Leader Sonny Gallant questioned the province's estimates around job losses.\nThe province projected COVID-related employment losses would peak at nearly 24,000 in May \u2014\u00a0more than a quarter of the Island's workforce before the pandemic hit \u2014\u00a0but that by October job numbers would have recovered to be even higher than they were at the same time in 2019.\n\"I think it is fair to say your projections of an employment boom in four months appears very much on the side of extreme optimism,\" Gallant said.\n\"So what is it?

The central bank cut its rate in an attempt to encourage borrowing and investing to stimulate the economy, but those rate cuts weren't the only thing it did to try to buttress the economy from the unprecedented hit of COVID-19.\nThe bank also started a number of bond and debt-buying programs\u00a0in order to make sure there is enough cash in the system.\nIt announced on Wednesday it will tinker with\u00a0two of them because things are starting to look up, but it is still buying up government bonds at a record-setting pace in order to make sure banks have enough cash on hand to lend to credit worthy borrowers.\n\"The Bank's programs to improve market function are having their intended effect,\" the bank said. \"After significant strains in March, short-term funding conditions have improved.

But it began seven years ago this month, on the stage of a Korean music show, as the seven members of BTS gave their debut performance.\nNow the band, who sing and rap mostly in Korean, inspire the kind of global cultural influence that has people regularly comparing them to The Beatles. Last year, they accounted for an estimated $4.65 billion of South Korea's GDP. Their latest album, Map of the Soul: 7, is their fourth consecutive to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Artist 200 chart in the U.S.\nBTS stands for Bangtan sonyeondan in Korean, which translates to \"Bulletproof Boy Scouts,\" a reference to the resilience of youth. As with all K-pop acts, their fandom also has an official name: ARMY, an acronym for Adorable Representative M.C.s for Youth.\n\"The brand that BTS has is super interesting because it consists of a message more than a musical style or a visual aesthetic,\" said Michelle Cho, an assistant professor of East Asian Studies at the University of Toronto.\n\"Their core message continues to be one of a youthful struggle against an adult world that can feel intimidating, forbidding, and the way that young people can come together to overcome the stresses and challenges of growing up. As long as you stay true to yourself and you credit the community that you're a part of, which in BTS' case is the fandom community, the sky's the limit.\"\nThough the message is youthful, its sincerity resonates with fans of all ages. This includes ARMY fans beyond Korea's borders who diligently search for translations of the lyrics as soon as new music drops. What they find \u2014 beyond a charisma generally reserved for the divine \u2014 is a coming-of-age story.\n\"It's more than, 'They're so cute!' And they have cool clothes and cool choreography. I mean, that's part of the appeal of the group,\" said Cho.\n\"But what fans will self-report\u2026 is that BTS has really helped them mentally and emotionally come back from difficult challenges or found them at moments where they needed encouragement.\"\nZaiyan Chowdhury, a Toronto-based ARMY, says that sentiment resonates with her. She grew up in Canada, immersed in predominantly white culture, anxious about her South Asian roots.\nThese feelings hit their peak in middle school when Chowdhury, then 11, visited an American mall wearing traditional Bangladeshi clothing.\n\"When my mom left me alone to wait on a seat while she went into a store, I saw these random people. They would directly look at me and would literally whisper about me, right in front of me,\" said Chowdhury, who is now an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto.\n\"From then on, I became very insecure about my culture. I even found myself wishing I was born white.\"\nBut she says BTS songs like Idol \u2014 with the hook \"You can't stop me loving myself\" \u2014 have completely changed her perspective.\n\"The message and the meaning behind that one sentence was them expressing that they are going to continue to sing their music completely in Korean. They're going to continue advertising and showing off their own cultural roots and that touched me personally because it also helped me get comfortable with my own culture,\" said Chowdhury.\n\"I realized, I want to be me. I'm very comfortable with my skin colour. I'm very comfortable with my features. I'm just very happy where I am. My mental state is so much better.\"\nFor Cho, who studies Korean popular culture, the rise of BTS has made an impact on her personally as well as professionally. As a Korean American born and raised in the Chicago area in the 1980s and 1990s, Cho was sometimes asked, \"Oh, Korea, is that in China or Japan?\"\n\"Seeing Korean popular culture find mainstream success in North America, in an environment where there really aren't many examples of Asian representation in popular culture, is moving to me in ways that I didn't even expect,\" she said.\n\"It's sort of a visceral feeling of, 'Wow, there are all these other possibilities for how to inhabit an Asian body that don't have to conform to stereotypes.'\"\nHer favourite song is Spring Day, a poignant ballad about growing apart from a friend.\nAmelie Rols is an ARMY from France who is studying at McGill University. Her graduate thesis is about K-pop fans outside of Korea.\nShe discovered the BTS song Sea, a hidden track on the album Love Yourself: Her, while she was on an exchange in Japan and having a hard time coping with loneliness.\n\"In the song, they talk about that even if you go through hard times, reality just doesn't disappear, things don't magically get better. If there are hardships, then there must be hope as well. I realized that these two elements are really two sides of the same coin,\" she said.\n\"It was kind of my lifeline. I don't want to put everything on BTS. It's not like they cured my depression or anything. But they were a very important crutch, I would say.\"\nWhen BTS promoted their latest album earlier this year, the COVID-19 pandemic began to take hold of the world.

Canadian political leaders have taken unprecedented steps to slow the spread of COVID-19, including the closure of non-essential businesses, schools and universities. These measures, while necessary, have led to a severe drop in economic output and employment.\nIn response, governments in Canada, as elsewhere, are intervening in economic affairs in a manner not seen in generations.\nThe scale of the crisis and its exposure of woefully inadequate social safety nets\u00a0has led to even established conservative voices calling for a permanent growth of the role of government in the economy.\nThe approach of the Manitoba government has been restrained compared to other Canadian jurisdictions, particularly with economic measures and supports aimed at low-income Manitobans and workers who have lost their jobs.\nMany of the economic measures announced to date have taken the form of tax and payment deferrals, as opposed to flat-rate cash benefits that have played a role in the federal response.\nThis week, the provincial response appears to be moving from lacklustre to straight-up counterproductive.\u00a0\nTwo sets of austerity measures aimed at cutting provincial costs are planned: the first is reducing the employment and wages of public sector workers, with a target of $500 million (but under some scenarios discussed, that number would be as high as $900 million).\nThe second measure is to cut spending by $750 million through other spending control mechanisms. This has involved directing government departments to compile lists of service providers funded by the province, for the purposes of making cuts to these organizations.\nThe lack of support and cuts are in stark contrast to the way other provinces are responding. The Manitoba response is the opposite of what standard economic theory would suggest in a recession.\nMaintaining government employment and spending supports the overall \"aggregate demand\" for goods and services. This demand creates sales for businesses and supports jobs.\nEconomists statistically quantify these effects with multipliers reflecting how $1\u00a0in spending in the economy leads to more than $1 in economic activity, because that spending is revenue for someone else, and in turn stimulates more spending/revenues, etc.\nThe opposite is also true, with spending cuts having negative ripple effects throughout the economy. This is a big part of the reason the government of Canada has come up with several programs to flow money to Canadians during this crisis.\u00a0\nWe can use multipliers to estimate the overall impact of the proposed government of Manitoba cuts on labour incomes, income tax revenues and economic activity in Manitoba.\nTo cut public sector employment, the government is proposing a federal work-share program where \"non-essential\" government workers would be reduced to working two or three days a week, while the federal government would pay benefits for the remaining two or three days at 55 per cent of salary, up to the maximum annual insurable earnings of $54,200.\nFor the public service as a whole, we estimate they will keep on average 67 per cent and 78 per cent under the two scenarios.\nUsing the multiplier approach, we estimate that the combined impact of the proposed work-share program and $750 million in additional cuts will result in:\nThe provincial government claims that COVID-19 expenditures and lost revenue will require a $5-billion increase to the provincial deficit, pushing us to the edge of a looming \"fiscal cliff.\"\nThis $5 billion fear-mongering assumes that the monthly deficit increase being experienced now will continue for the entire fiscal year.\nThis is not consistent with economic forecasts that predict the impact to be concentrated in one or two quarters of 2020, as social distancing measures are gradually relaxed.\nAs a comparison, the $5 billion works out to approximately $3,650 per Manitoban, while all of New York state, with\u00a0a current infection rate 70 times that of\u00a0Manitoba, is\u00a0estimating a fiscal impact of $770 US per person.\nEven giving the province the benefit of the doubt on the questionable $5 billion estimate, what would be the actual impact of fully funding this $5 billion deficit through government borrowing?\nThis is an important question, as the government should be borrowing at this time.\nOur debt is currently at $26.7 billion. The most widely accepted measure of the effect of debt on the economy is the debt to GDP ratio (debt/GDP).\nGoing into 2020, GDP was around $74.8 billion, so our debt/GDP was 34.3 percent. Although this is higher than what it was 10 years ago, it is a perfectly manageable ratio.\nThe $5 billion extra debt will put our debt up to $31.7 billion.\nWe know that our economy, like every other economy in the world, is going to shrink. Assuming a 3.1 per cent reduction, our GDP could fall to $72.5 billion.\nThat will bring our debt/GDP to 44 per cent. A 44 per cent debt/GDP ratio is underwhelming given the enormity of the crisis we face. In fact, this new ratio is still less than some other provinces had in 2017.\nThere are also two moving parts to the debt/GDP ratio:\u00a0if the Manitoba government spends and allows the debt to increase, the economy is stimulated, increasing GDP. Shoring up Manitoba's economy now will increase our capacity to weather the crisis, rescue our businesses, grow in the future\u00a0and repay the debt later.\nHow much of a difference would this borrowing actually have on our debt servicing charges?\nAssuming we were to borrow the $5 billion at Manitoba's going rate of 3.2 per cent for a 30-year bond, we would incur debt servicing charges of $260 million/year. Dramatic as this number sounds, the PST cut in 2019 cost us $330 million in annual revenues.\nOnce the economy recovers, we can look at new taxes on high income earners taxes and reverse tax cuts, if necessary, to manage the debt.\nIt seems as if Premier Pallister thinks the real crisis is one of provincial government debt, whatever the amount turns out to be\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not the hardships people and businesses are facing as they lose customers, jobs, wages and security.\nThe premier insists that we need all hands on deck to deal with this calamity, yet is unwilling to commit his government to do its part.\nWhere our economy lands when we come out of the pandemic depends on him stepping up to the plate sooner rather than later. That includes using government borrowing for necessary expenditures rather than putting that burden on the backs of workers and business and, as a consequence, dealing the economy another blow.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Since then, said Giroux,\u00a0new\u00a0aid programs have been announced for commercial rent support, the agricultural sector, students and seniors \u2014 things he called \"very expensive measures.\"\n\"I think $252 billion is on the very optimistic side, as things stand now,\" Giroux said.\n\"In all likelihood the deficit will be higher than $252 billion.

Now, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has published data showing the magnitude of the decreases in both energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhile the findings are interesting, they come with stark implications for what it will take for Canada and other countries to meet their targets under the Paris agreement.\u00a0\nWithout far more drastic measures, those climate targets may well be out of reach.\nThe IEA found that global energy demand experienced its single largest decline since the Second World War.\nAt the height of the lockdowns, road travel was down over 50 per cent, air travel was down over 60 per cent and electricity demand was down by close to 20 per cent. For countries in full lockdown, total energy use dropped by 25 per cent, and for those in partial lockdown, by 18 per cent.\nThe largest declines came from fossil fuel sources: coal, oil and natural gas. Renewables were relatively unaffected by the COVID-19 lockdown measures, both because they are given priority in electricity grids and because there is little enough renewable supply that the full complement was still needed.\nWhen averaged over the first quarter of 2020 (January through March, preceding the height of the lockdowns), there was an overall decrease in global energy use of nearly four per cent. And with that came a drop in global CO2 emissions of over five per cent. Major emitting regions that experienced the earliest and largest COVID-19 outbreaks \u2014 China, the European Union and the United States\u00a0\u2014\u00a0accounted for the greatest decreases.\u00a0\nHowever, despite much of the world staying at home, an economic downturn rivalling the Great Depression and the near complete shutdown of international travel, the decline in emissions is still not enough to reach our targets under the Paris Climate Accord.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to the UN Emissions Gap Report 2019, economy-wide GHG emissions must be reduced by roughly 25 per cent relative to 2018 levels by 2030 if we are to keep global warming to two degrees by the end of the century.\nIf we want to keep warming to only 1.5 degrees, we will need a 55 per cent decrease in emissions. And we need to do this while world energy use is expected to rise 50 per cent by 2050.\nWhat does this mean for our GHG emission targets? The first implication is that there is a real chance that the Paris target will not be achieved.\nThe second implication is that behavioural changes in energy consumption are not enough.\nAlthough many people were willing to make extreme sacrifices to prevent an even worse pandemic, the severe personal and economic strain is not sustainable over an extended period. We need viable alternatives to the current global energy system that have at least as great an effect on emissions as the lockdowns, but without the pain.\u00a0\nNatural gas as a transition fuel will be essential; it was responsible for a three per cent decrease in emissions in the United States in 2019 alone, as power plants shifted from coal to natural gas.\nNuclear power has to be considered as a serious option. While nuclear power raises other problems, it is essentially GHG-free and avoids some of the problems associated with wind, solar and hydro, including intermittency and the need for a large land footprint.\u00a0\u00a0\nRenewables have many benefits, but they are not a magic bullet. Their advantages need to be weighed with sufficient attention to the new problems that their uptake creates.\n\"Clean\" hydro, for example, is the result of damming rivers, which substantially degrades upstream ecosystems and is often strongly opposed by communities. Solar, wind and batteries all require materials that are mined in conditions that cause substantial environmental and social damage. Establishing large solar or wind \"farms\"\u00a0on greenfield land can irretrievably damage biodiversity \u2014 another global crisis that is coming down the line.\u00a0\nThe lockdown has shown us many things: that governments can act rapidly if they feel a threat is imminent; that resilience in the supply of energy, food and other necessities is both fragile and critical; and also how strongly our emissions are tied to energy use.\nHow we apply these lessons to our energy future will determine our success in the fight against both COVID-19 and climate change.\nThis column is an opinion.

Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council declared Friday.\nThe council, which monitors recessions and recoveries in Canada, said the economy peaked in February, just before drastic measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 were implemented across the country.\n\"Members agreed that by applying the council's methodology to the preliminary data available, Canada entered a recession in the first quarter of 2020,\" the council said in a statement.\nThere are no hard and fast rules for declaring a recession, although one rule of thumb used by economists is that an economy is probably in one if it has shrunk for two three-month periods in a row.\nThe council rejects the \"two quarters\" rule and instead defines a recession as a \"pronounced, persistent\u00a0and pervasive decline in aggregate economic activity\" based largely on GDP and the job market.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is still less than two months old in Canada, but the council said Friday that the slowdown is already so swift and deep that it's safe to declare a recession already.\n\"The council agreed the magnitude of the contraction makes it extremely unlikely that any future adjustments will overturn the conclusion of a major drop in economic activity in the first quarter,\" the council said.\nDeclaring a recession is always controversial, since there is no\u00a0unanimous view as to what qualifies as one. By the \"two quarters of economic decline\" definition, Canada had a brief, slight recession in late 2014 and early 2015, as the price of oil crashed.\nBut the Business Cycle Council still says\u00a0that slowdown didn't meet the\u00a0bar as an official recession by their metrics.\nIn the council's view, this is the first recession Canada has seen since the financial crisis that began in 2008. And the data suggests this one is on track to be quite a bit worse than that one.\nThe March jobs report showed more than a million jobs were lost in the month, while a preliminary estimate by Statistics Canada suggested the economy contracted by nine per cent in the same month. Those are\u00a0the biggest one-month plunges in jobs and GDP on record in Canada.\nWhile the decline in March was record-setting, economists expect the data for April will show an even bigger drop, with the measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus in place for the entire month.\nThe eight-person council, which normally meets once a year in December, decided to meet twice last month, once it became clear that something dramatic was happening to Canada's economy.\nStephen Gordon, an economics professor\u00a0at Universit\u00e9 Laval and member of the council, says the current economic slowdown is a great example of how the \"two quarters of contraction\" definition of a recession is too dogmatic.\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, he noted that if the slowdown had started in April as opposed to March, the entire first quarter would have been excluded. And since a rebound in the summer is quite plausible, that would make the current recession only one-quarter long\u00a0\u2014 deep though it may be.\n\"This episode would fail the two-quarter test, even though it's obviously a recession,\" he said.\nThe current episode is a good illustration why the the \"2 quarters of declining GDP\" definition of a recession is not a hard-and-fast rule. 1/\nStatistics Canada reported Thursday that economic growth had stalled going into the crisis, with real gross domestic product essentially unchanged in February due to teacher strikes in Ontario and rail blockades across many parts of the country.\nThe official estimates of GDP for March and the first quarter of 2020 will be released on May 29.\n"}, {"author": "Jordan Press", "title": "Federal deficit could top $252 billion, says budget officer", "description": "PBO report assumes real GDP will contract by 12 per cent this year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pbo-deficit-covid-1.5550498", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5138746.1558027091!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/phoenix-pay-system.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 30, 2020 10:21 AM ET", "2020-04-30T17:03:05.669Z"], "source": null, "content": "Parliament's budget watchdog says it's likely the federal deficit for the year will hit $252.1 billion as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014\u00a0and could go even higher if emergency measures remain in place longer than planned.\nThe figure is an estimate based on the almost $146 billion in spending measures the government has announced to help cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, estimated declines in the country's gross domestic product\u00a0and the price of oil remaining well below previous expectations.\nParliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux's report assumes real GDP will contract by 12 per cent this year\u00a0and help push the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to 48.4 per cent.\n\"To date, budgetary measures announced by the government are intended to be temporary.

But the pandemic prompted the agency to produce what it calls a flash estimate of GDP for March on Wednesday, even before\u00a0several indicators for February are released.\u00a0\nStats Can said\u00a0its estimate indicates a decline of approximately\u00a09 per cent\u00a0in March,\u00a0the largest one-month decline in GDP\u00a0since the series started in\u00a01961.\nWATCH |\u00a0IMF lauds speed, generosity of donor countries in helping poor countries sideswiped by COVID-19\nCanada is also being hammered by collapsing oil prices, caused by a price war between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Russia, but made exponentially worse by world lockdowns.\nA report by the\u00a0International Energy\u00a0Agency (IEA) released Wednesday\u00a0said global demand for oil will drop by a further 29 million barrels per day\u00a0in April, a record decline\u00a0back to levels not seen since the mid-1990s. The IEA also said the buildup of unsold oil from the first part of the year \"threatens to overwhelm the logistics of the oil industry \u2014 ships, pipelines and storage tanks \u2014 in the coming weeks.\"\nCOVID-19 also caused Canadian home sales to plunge 14 per cent in March. But even that number is out of date.\nConsider early numbers for Toronto, Canada's largest real estate market, show a drop in listings of 64 per cent in the first two weeks of April\u00a0and sales down a staggering 80 per cent.\u00a0\n\"The people who are in the marketplace are serious buyers but just the sheer volume has dropped off significantly,\"\u00a0said Cailey Heaps Estrin, managing director of Heaps Estrin Real Estate in Toronto.\nShe said\u00a0they have had a number of\u00a0sales including one this week with three bidders that sold for more than $100,000 over asking. But she said\u00a0they're not proactively going out and bringing listings to market.\n\"We are having video meetings with people getting ready to launch their listings once the [lockdowns]\u00a0are lifted.\"\u00a0\nBut even when travel and social distancing restrictions are relaxed, few economists expect the overall economy to immediately spring back to life.\n\"It's pretty easy for us to turn a manufacturing plant back on and have widgets come out on a conveyor belt,\" said Manulife's Frances Donald. \"It's a lot harder to tell people 'go shake hands, go to a movie theatre, sit in a restaurant' when they still feel their personal safety is at risk.\"\u00a0\n\"This recession, the length of it, is really going to be dependent on the evolution of the virus.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2655700928", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Peter Zimonjic", "title": "Economy could contract by 25% in second quarter, deficit could soar to $112.7B: PBO report", "description": "PBO predicts that the economy will contract by 5.1% in 2020-21 \u2014 the biggest drop since 1962", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-19-pandemic-pbo-report-1.5512062", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5502583.1584622350!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-coronavirus-ottawa-business-close.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 27, 2020 8:49 AM ET", "2020-03-27T19:25:29.871Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Parliament's budget watchdog predicts the Canadian economy could contract by a staggering 25 per cent in the second quarter of this year, while the annual budget deficit could top $112.7 billion by\u00a0the fiscal year's end.\u00a0\nThat prediction is part of the Parliamentary Budget Officer's most recent report, which looks\u00a0at the economic impacts of the global pandemic and recent oil price shocks.\nThe PBO said that outlook is based on the assumption that social distancing directives to stop the spread of COVID-19 will remain in effect through August, and there will be no further global oil price shocks.\n\"We stress that this scenario is not a forecast of the most likely outcome,\" the report says. \"It is an illustrative scenario of one possible outcome.\"\u00a0\nThe report predicts the economy will shrink by 5.1 per cent in 2020-21, beginning with a 2.5 per cent decline in the first quarter, a decline of 25 per cent in the second quarter and a further decline of 1.4 per cent in the third quarter before a rebound in the last three months of the year, with growth of 3.8 per cent.\nThe decrease in the second quarter, the PBO said, is three times Canada's greatest previous\u00a0quarterly contraction of 8.7 per cent \u2014 which took place in the first quarter of 2009, during the global financial crisis.\nThe report also predicts that unemployment will rise to 15 per cent by the third quarter of 2020.\nThe PBO said that as things stand now, the budget deficit for 2019-20 would be $26.7 billion ($5.5 billion higher than initially predicted) and $112.7 billion for 2020-21, or 5.2 per cent of GDP ($89.5 billion more than predicted).\n\"To put this in perspective, the last time the budgetary deficit was near 5.2 per cent of GDP was in 1993-94,\" the report said.\nThe federal government has said repeatedly that despite deficit spending over the past few years, Canada has\u00a0a healthy debt-to-GDP radio.

Social distancing measures stay in place until May 2021, non-essential businesses are shuttered and\u00a0there is another global economic slowdown.\u00a0\nIn the worst-case scenario, GDP contracts 3.5 per cent in 2020 and a further one per cent\u00a0in 2021.\nEven the best-case scenario predicts\u00a0unemployment levels over 10 per cent in 2021 and at worst\u00a015.6 per cent that\u00a0year.\nThe report says the city's goals through the economic fallout from COVID-19 (beyond maintaining essential services such as police and fire) are\u00a0to \"sustain employment both privately and publicly\" in the short term and \"be prepared to identify major shovel-ready infrastructure projects\" in the long term.\nThose projects would be financed by either the provincial or federal governments.\nBowman says the commitment to maintain the city's capital spending on roads, sewers and other infrastructure\u00a0is \"incredibly important to the economic recovery.\"\nThat got support from the Business Council of Manitoba, whose\u00a0members have grown increasingly concerned about how a recovery would take shape.\n\"The important thing with infrastructure is you get something for your money,\" said business council president Bram Strain.\u00a0\n\"So you're not giving a subsidy, you're not giving out tax deferral. What\u00a0\u2026 you're actually getting is a solid return. You are\u00a0buying a product to improve the streets. You've improved the\u00a0sewer, you've improved the utility system.\"\nRegardless of which scenario unfolds, the city's revenue will drop\u00a0significantly and its\u00a0fiscal stabilization fund will be used\u00a0to make up for the lost income.\nThat's led to the suggestion of other cuts, such as\u00a0trimming back the Winnipeg Transit schedule. Bowman told reporters Tuesday a decision on that was due soon.\nThe head of the Amalgamated Transit Union says the city should find ways to deploy staff rather than making cuts.\n\"Service cuts at this point will hurt the local economy in the short\u00a0and long term, and could result in the city losing experienced personnel,\" said\u00a0ATU 1505 president Romeo Ignacio.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Ontario confirms 308 new COVID-19 cases, state of emergency to be pushed to June 2", "description": "COVID-19 death toll in Ontario sits at 1,733", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid-19-coronavirus-may-11-emergency-order-extended-1.5564397", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5543698.1587736372!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/to-lockdown.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 11, 2020 10:46 AM ET", "2020-05-11T14:47:42.294Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Ontario reported 308 additional cases of COVID-19 on Monday, the third straight day of that the growth rate in new cases has been below 2 per cent.\nThe province has now seen a total of 20,546 cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak began in late January.

Though as the economy recovers, the deficit is expected to decrease to $25.3 billion the following year\u00a0\u2014 still more than double last year's figure.\nFord also announced over the weekend that provincial parks will reopen Monday, though beaches, camping areas and playgrounds will remain closed and physical distancing must be maintained.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2676409153", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Bond rating agency downgrades N.L. outlook from stable to negative", "description": "Low oil prices and ongoing pandemic main factors, says Standard & Poor's", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/standard-poors-newfoundland-debt-1.5590770", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["May 29, 2020 6:33 PM NT", "2020-05-29T21:03:48.077Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Newfoundland and Labrador's fragile economic standing has taken\u00a0a turn for the worse with\u00a0one of the world's most influential financial companies downgrading\u00a0the government's credit rating.\u00a0\nStandard & Poor's, which has been ranking N.L.'s fiscal performance for decades, dropped the government's rating from stable to negative, citing disruption from the ongoing pandemic and deflated oil prices as the cause.\n\"The negative outlook reflects the heightened risk that the pandemic disruption and oil price shock could prove longer than expected, which could weigh heavily on the province's important tax and oil royalty revenues,\" reads the credit agency's report, released Thursday.\u00a0\n\"We will monitor these developments and look to Newfoundland's policy response to gauge how quickly the province can begin to reduce the very large after-capital deficit it will post in fiscal 2021.\"\nThe company said it could also lower the rating again over the next two years\u00a0if it expects persistent external pressures, or an insufficient response from the provincial government,\u00a0will result\u00a0in sustained high after-capital deficits over the medium term.\nShould Newfoundland and Labrador manage to limit the impact on its fiscal situation,\u00a0S&P Global Ratings said it could revise its outlook to stable, once again, over the next 12 to 24 months.\n\"In addition, a significant advancement in oil prices that leads to sustained real GDP growth and increased investment could bolster the province's fiscal performance,\" the report said.\n\"An improvement in budget performance leading to more moderate after-capital deficits and sustained liquidity, with cash and investments of more than 80 per cent\u00a0debt service, could lead us to revise the outlook to stable.\"\nMeanwhile, S&P\u00a0affirmed its 'A' long-term issuer credit and senior unsecured debt ratings on the province.\nThe company\u00a0also affirmed its 'A-1' short-term issuer credit and commercial paper ratings on the province, and its 'A' issue-level rating on Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro's\u00a0provincially guaranteed senior unsecured debt.\n\"The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is compressing provincial economies and undoing their fiscal gains of the past decade.

In order to prevent the collapse of the economy, aggressive fiscal and monetary policy become the order of the day.\u00a0\nThe Manitoba government, though, appears to disagree with the weight of historical evidence, preferring to focus on the costs to the provincial treasury rather than costs of the government's lack of action on the lives of Manitobans.\u00a0\nAs economist Joseph Stiglitz put it, when you are at war, you don't ask \"Can we afford it?\"\u00a0\nIn 1930, as the Great Depression took hold in the U.S., President Herbert Hoover infamously made the depression worse by focusing on balancing the budget. As the Great Depression wore on, deficit spending became widely accepted as a remedy to mitigate the crisis (as historian Michael Horn put it, \"only government could keep hundreds of thousands of Canadians from starving or freezing to death\").\nBut the spending was too parsimonious to actually end the Depression.\u00a0\nWhen the Second World War began, government spending expanded significantly, essential to winning the war and finally getting us out of the Great Depression. At the end of the war in the U.S. and Canada, the debt-to-income ratio rose to historic levels \u2014 in 1946, Canada's debt was 109 per cent of GDP.\u00a0\nIt declined over the next few decades while the economy prospered not because anxious post-depression governments cut public spending, but in part because they spent taxpayer dollars to develop our modern health and education sectors, making productive investments in infrastructure and research.\nRather, the government used the resulting growth in GDP to pay down the debt over time. Keynesian economics 101.\u00a0\nIn the 2008 Great Recession, the opposition parties forced Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper to pass a massive fiscal stimulus package to prevent unemployment and bankruptcy. The Bank of Canada contributed tens of billions of dollars to shore up our financial system.\nThe Bush and Obama administrations in the U.S. did the same to stave off a potential repeat of the Great Depression. In the early days of the crisis, conservative Republican George W. Bush argued that without a government bailout of the financial sector, \"this sucker could go down.\"\nThe treasury bailed out the financial system and Obama's $800-billion stimulus bill extended unemployment benefits, rebuilt roads and bridges, prevented teacher layoffs and provided temporary help for people who lost their jobs or needed other assistance because of the poor economy. For economists like Paul Krugman, while the stimulus prevented a deeper decline in the economy, it should have been much larger.\nIn the current pandemic crisis, Prime Minister Trudeau is clearly paying attention to these lessons of history by ensuring the needy will not freeze in the dark, that the federal public sector maintains its workforce and wages, and that businesses and their workers will get support.\u00a0\nHe understands that without this kind of government support, huge structural problems with the economy will prolong the pain well beyond the end of the pandemic.\u00a0\nLike Hoover, though, the Pallister government is rowing in the opposite direction by pursuing its long-standing desire to reduce the size of the government with plans to cut funding for charities and non-profit organizations, the public sector and the universities.\nThe province is threatening to lay off workers and cut wages in the middle of the pandemic.\nThus far, the provincial government's underwhelming support measures consist of hiring a local firm to set up a call centre to help Manitobans access federal money and a program to give eligible small businesses $6,000 each, neither of which suggests a government committed to addressing the massive economic downturn caused by the crisis.\nEconomists Jesse Hajer and Lynne Fernandez estimate that the proposed cuts would reduce provincial GDP by between $1.3 and $1.5 billion. Members of Manitoba's business community have described the province's approach as \"penny wise and pound foolish.\"\nAs Stiglitz suggests, such cutbacks in jobs and funding \"will show up in the unemployment statistics, but the deeper effects \u2014 on our economic growth and social fabric \u2014 won't be fully apparent for years to come.\"\u00a0\nNo other government in Canada has done more to damage \u00a0our future with less economic justification than the government of Manitoba.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs Asper School professor Shiu-Yik Au perceptively pointed out, while Ontario and Quebec face greater health costs from the pandemic, both provinces have taken much greater responsibility to help their citizens.\u00a0\nAmong its actions, Ontario increased payments to low-income seniors\u00a0and families with children, and funded Indigenous communities and municipalities. In Quebec, the government has provided emergency support to small and medium businesses, the tourism industry, and workers.\u00a0Both of these provinces have higher debt-to-GDP levels than Manitoba.\u00a0\nAusterity has failed as an economic strategy wherever and whenever it has been tried. The Pallister government is rowing against the tide of history, creating lasting damage for Manitobans to clean up for years to come.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

And for the first time in EU history, two-thirds of the money handed out would be grants \u2014 not loans \u2014 that the recipient countries wouldn't have to repay.\nIn fact, though, this was German Chancellor Angela Merkel's moment. Nine days earlier, she had launched this quiet European revolution along with French President Emmanuel Macron.\nTogether they said their countries would put up $750 billion Cdn in grants to help Italy and Spain climb out of the economic hole caused by COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. That sum is now the core of the announced EU program.\nSpain's central bank forecast last month that the country's economy could\u00a0contract by more than\u00a012 per cent this year, and unemployment could surpass 21\u00a0per cent. It has lost more than 27,000 people to COVID-19.\nItaly, meanwhile, where more than 33,000 people have died of the illness, could see its GDP\u00a0contract by more than\u00a0nine per cent in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund, and see unemployment close to 13 per cent.\nGermany and France, by comparison, are\u00a0expected to see GDP contractions of around seven per cent, with unemployment of around four and 10 per cent, respectively.\n\"Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures,\" Merkel said on May 18, and in European terms, that announcement was nothing less than what her finance minister called the \"Hamilton\" decision.\nThat's Alexander Hamilton, an American \"founding father.\" He lived a life of adventure, died in a duel and became the subject of a Broadway hit musical more than two centuries after his death.\nHe was also the man who set up the U.S. banking system and enshrined in law the concept that the American federal government would come to the financial aid of states in crisis.\nIn Canada, the concept goes by the name of equalization, where the federal government transfers money to poorer provinces. It's the economic backbone of a functioning federal system, but in the EU, even after the creation of a common currency in 2002, the euro, it didn't exist.\nThat's because Germany, at the head of a parade of northern European states \u2014 the Scandinavians, the Netherlands and Belgium \u2014 refused over and over to allow the EU to offer grants, equalization payments by another name, to states in trouble. They would have to ask for loans\u00a0and pay them back.\nMerkel led that penny-pinching coalition for almost 15 years. She once compared herself to a German housewife counting those pennies. That approach led to a major crisis in 2011, when Greece teetered on the edge of bankruptcy and threatened to pull out of the euro.\nMerkel and Germany tightened the purse strings and refused anything but loans with harsh conditions. Greece capitulated.\nBut Greece is small. Spain\u00a0and, particularly, Italy\u00a0are big, and they have been pleading for \u2014 and then demanding \u2014 such grants with no conditions in this crisis, warning of\u00a0dire consequences if they didn't get them.\nThe direst of those would be the shattering of the euro, the European currency, if Italy, say, dropped out of it. That would bring\u00a0financial ruin on top of economic depression \u2014 unthinkable. As Merkel put it in the German parliament in 2011, \"if the euro fails, Europe fails.\"\nAnd so the quiet, plodding chancellor suddenly ripped up decades of German policy, catching a whole continent by surprise.\nIt wasn't her first time. Five years ago, in September 2015, she suddenly threw open the doors and allowed hundreds of thousands of refugees to flow into Germany. It was, she said, the moral thing to do.\nHer neighbours in Central Europe such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Austria, chose the political thing to do and slammed their doors on the refugee flood.\nThere were cries of anger in Germany, a country of almost 84 million people, and the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative\u00a0f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party rose sharply in the polls. In the 2017 German elections, it took 12.6 per cent of the vote and became the third-largest party in parliament.\nBut in the midst of this latest crisis, the AfD's poll numbers have slipped back to below 10 per cent, and Merkel is once again phenomenally popular.\nShe will need that popularity to push through her proposed changes. She faces a coalition of \"frugal\" northern EU members and Central European states unhappy about the extra burden the new seven-year budget plan will place on them.\nThe \"frugal\" states, led by Austria, are still pushing for an all-loan deal for southern Europe. The Central European states, which have been supping richly at the EU trough for years, are vocally unhappy at the prospect of seeing some of their subsidies going to Italy and Spain.\n\"Solidarity has its limits,\" Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on May 19. \"I don't like the idea of Europe burdening itself with debts.\"\nA key limit to European solidarity is the need for unanimity of all 27 members to pass the budget that EU commission president van der Leyen has unveiled.\nBut the \"frugal\" coalition has a huge problem. Its leader has switched sides. Germany has joined France, whose president\u00a0has been arguing for two years for a Hamiltonian system in Europe.\nTogether the two countries are the biggest and richest political and economic engines of the EU, their weight even greater and their task easier since Britain pulled out.\nThey will lean very heavily on the smaller European states, which stand to gain in cash if they accept the new economic blueprint.\nMerkel has other aces in her hand. The EU commission president, von der Leyen, is her ally and point person, her former defence minister who Merkel manoeuvred into her present job last year. And in July, Germany takes over the rotating presidency of the EU for six months, giving the chancellor added clout in negotiations.\nThose negotiations will be detailed, difficult and long. But Merkel has announced she will leave her post after the next German elections in September 2021. She has little to lose and one last battle to fight for Europe and for her place in its history.\nShe is an\u00a0unlikely revolutionary. Most leaders who change the political landscape do it when they come to power. Merkel has waited until her final act to spring her biggest surprises and the biggest potential changes to the EU in decades.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1732927555961", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Adam Hunter", "title": "Sask. projects revenue loss of $1B to $3B as province faces 'pandemic deficit'", "description": "Finance minister says province will provide 'all financial resources necessary' to combat COVID-19", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-revenue-projection-1.5536393", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5502103.1584565439!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sask-budget-20200318.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 17, 2020 2:25 PM CT", "2020-04-17T23:55:39.405Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Saskatchewan's finance minister says revenues could decline by between $1.3 billion and $3.3 billion in 2020-21 as the province faces a \"pandemic deficit.\"\n\"The 2020-21 deficit is not a structural deficit,\" Donna Harpauer said Friday. \"It is a pandemic deficit.

position\" and could\u00a0borrow due in part to its strong credit rating.\nOn Tuesday, Moody's Investor Service released its Credit Opinion, maintaining Saskatchewan's AAA stable rating.\nMoody's based its rating, in part, on:\n\"Our liquidity, the cash we have maintained and our ability and capacity to borrow is very important, as the pandemic is having an understandable impact on our

Di Matteo says there are a\u00a0 few\u00a0ways to look at the debt. There's the gross debt, or the total debt, and that's everything the federal government owes. There is also the \"federal debt,\"\u00a0which is the difference\u00a0between the government's total liabilities and total financial and non-financial assets.\nThose non-financial assets,\u00a0however, include things like the Parliament Buildings, Di Matteo says,\u00a0which are unlikely to be sold off any time soon. So\u00a0the net debt takes\u00a0everything the federal government owes and subtracts\u00a0the government's financial assets.\nAccording\u00a0to the Department of Finance, the government posted a budgetary deficit of $14 billion\u00a0for the fiscal year that ended on March\u00a031, 2019. (Compare that, for example, with the U.S., which just recorded a deficit topping a trillion dollars.)\nThe federal debt (the difference between total liabilities and total assets) stood at $685.5\u00a0billion and Canada's net\u00a0debt is $768 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. debt is more than $22 trillion.\nThe debt-to-GDP ratio is the\u00a0the federal debt\u00a0compared to the gross domestic product of the country. In other words, taking the debt and dividing it by the GDP.\n\"There is no official number of what it should be. But generally, the higher it\u00a0is the larger the debt burden,\" Di Matteo said.\u00a0\nCurrently, Canada''s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at\u00a030.9. According to Liberal projections, it will shrink to\u00a030.2 per cent of GDP in 2023-2024.\nFor a comparison, before Chr\u00e9tien and Martin embarked on a series of cuts,\u00a0the federal debt-to-GDP\u00a0ratio was 66.8. It was at its highest in 1946 at 108.9 per cent\u00a0and at its lowest in 1913 at 11.3 per cent.\nThe reason the Liberals like to focus on this measurement is that Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio is the lowest among the G7 countries. For example, the figure for Japan is 237.5 per cent of GDP, 106.7 per cent for the United States and 99.2 per cent for France.\nBut the figure used by the Canadian government doesn't include the debt from all levels of government, like the provinces and municipalities. When those figures are included, the ratio, according to the International Monetary Fund,\u00a0jumps to 88 per cent.\nThat may be an easier way for people to understand our debt. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation calculated that every Canadian's share of the debt is a little over $18,000. (Compare that to the U.S., which, according to the U.S. Debt Clock, estimates debt per citizen at just under $69,000 US)\nThe Liberals promised in the 2015 election campaign that they would run temporary deficits, but by 2019, Canadians could expect a balanced budget.\u00a0\nThat never\u00a0happened\u00a0and isn't expected to happen in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0According to the campaign platform they released, their government, if re-elected, would\u00a0increase the deficit to $27.4 billion next year. It then projects deficits of more than $20 billion over the next three years. The party has not offered a firm timeline as to when it\u00a0would balance the books.\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said his government would take five years to balance the budget, but his party has not yet released its campaign platform, or any figures on the deficits they expect to run.\nNDP Leader\u00a0Jagmeet Singh\u00a0hasn't been clear on how his government would tackle the federal deficit. The party's platform isn't fully costed and doesn't include\u00a0deficit estimates\nBack in September, at a campaign event in Ottawa, Singh would\u00a0say only that his approach would be different from the one Justin Trudeau's Liberals have chosen and that his priority is helping Canadians now.\nHis party platform does say his government would\u00a0\"manage debt and deficits responsibly, borrowing when required to defend the services that Canadians and their families rely on, and moving to balance when prudent.\"\nGreen Leader Elizabeth May has committed to returning Canada to budgetary balance in five years. For the 2021-2022 fiscal year, a Green government would run up a\u00a0$22.7-billion deficit, cut that down to around $19 billion the next year and come up with a $400-million surplus by\u00a02023-24.\nPeople's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier\u00a0has vowed that his government would present a balanced budget within two years of taking office.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/681088579524", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/michael-s-essay-on-mind-boggling-wealth-1.5479858", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada's economy shrinks 0.1% in October, StatsCan reports", "description": "UAW strike weighted down manufacturing sector which declined for the 4th time in 5 months", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gdp-october-2019-stats-canada-1.5406578", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5406602.1577110028!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/statcan-gdp-20191223.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 23, 2019 9:19 AM ET", "2019-12-23T18:11:51.424Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada's economy slightly shrank in October with real gross domestic product edging down 0.1 per cent, Statistics Canada reports.\u00a0\nThis marks the first decline in eight months.\u00a0\nEconomists had projected a flat GDP report for October compared with September, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nThe manufacturing sector was down\u00a0for the fourth time in five months, declining by 1.4 per cent with transportation equipment manufacturing contracting the most at 2.5 per cent.

There's still a lot that they \u2014 and we \u2014 don't know. But the picture they're painting for Canada's financial future\u00a0is already bleak.\nAt a minimum, the Conference Board of Canada is assuming that most industries across the country will be essentially shut down for at least six weeks.\nIf they take an optimistic view and assume that's enough to contain the outbreak, even that short term pain will make a major dent in the country's total output, a metric known as the Gross Domestic\u00a0Product, or GDP.\nShould this relatively mild scenario come to pass, Canada's economy would eke out a tiny 0.3 per cent growth for 2020\u00a0as a whole as things ramp up in the latter half of the year. That's far from booming \u2014\u00a0Canada's\u00a0economy grew by 1.6 per cent last year, for example \u2014\u00a0but it's\u00a0preferable to other alternatives.\nUnder a more pessimistic scenario, the board sees lockdowns and quarantines stretching for up to six months, until August.\u00a0If that happens, the GDP hit would be massive \u2014 an annualized contraction rate of 9.6 per cent in the second quarter, which is worse than what we saw in the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. The economy shrank at an annual pace of 8.7 per cent at its worst stage, in early 2009 before rebounding starting in the spring.\n\"Brace yourself for some horrible data in the near-term, as there's little doubt that the second quarter will produce some painful and likely historic figures on ... economic contraction,\"\u00a0the economics team at TD Bank said in a note to investors.\nEconomists tend to focus on GDP in their modelling, but when you ask Canadian workers how they think the economy is doing, they tend to focus on whether they have jobs that pay the bills.\nIt already looks like the recession caused by COVID-19 will be one for the record books when it comes to joblessness.\nIn any given week, Canada gets about 45,000 claims for jobless benefits, according to the economics team at TD Bank.\nBut the numbers for\u00a0March 16-22 came in at more than 20 times that, with 927,000 Canadians tossed out of work in a single week.\nDavid MacDonald, an economist with Ottawa think-tank the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said those numbers are likely just the start.\n\"The situation is still moving rapidly: people who may have been employed and surveyed on Monday could easily have been laid off by Wednesday,\" he said. \"It's likely not until the April data is collected and released at the start of May that we will see the full picture of what happened in the second half of March.\"\nBy the time all is said and done, MacDonald thinks roughly two\u00a0million Canadians will at least temporarily lose their jobs in the current panic. That would cause the jobless rate to spike to more than 13 per cent.\nTD's forecast is only slightly more positive, predicting the rate to rise to nearly 12 per cent before hopefully levelling off to about half that by the end of the year.\u00a0\nBut that's only if the unprecedented steps being taken now do any good.\n\"If fiscal and monetary policies prove successful, and social distancing tactics gradually ease, the unemployment rate should level off after one to two months and quite possibly fall just as fast if workers are called back to work,\" the bank said.\nThe cure for the disease may be widespread shutdowns and social distancing efforts, but that underlines a fundamental paradox of the disease: the cure for the virus is precisely what makes the economy even sicker.\nAt least Canada's jobless rate was close to a record low before all this started.\nEven officials in Ottawa are willing to admit they're expecting a record-setting flood of job losses to hit home, and soon.\n\"We have enormous job losses right now,\" Finance Minister Bill Morneau told the Senate on Wednesday. \"We hope and expect it will be temporary.\"\nNot everyone is sure they will be.\nThe Canadian Federation Of Independent Business says its monthly measure of small business confidence fell to the lowest level in its\u00a032-year history\u00a0this week. Normally, a reading of 65 suggests an economy that's basically operating close to its full potential. But the CFIB's gauge fell\u00a0to a record low of 30.8 in March. That's lower than the 39 it hit in the depths of the 2009 financial crisis.\nRoughly 50 per cent of small businesses say they expect to lose workers this year. Only five per cent are planning to expand, according to the CFIB's\u00a0small business barometer.\n\"March 2020 has turned out to be a month like no other in Canada's economic history,\" said Ted Mallett, CFIB's chief economist.\nIf there's good news in these bleak numbers, it may be that the depth and breadth of the slowdown may be so sharp and sudden that it can't help but spur a big rebound.\nThis\u00a0recession is looking to be what economists described as \"V-shaped\" \u2014 meaning one that plunges quickly down and then quickly back up the other side. That differs from a \"U-shaped,\" which is slower and less dramatic in both directions, or even a dreaded \"L-shaped\" recession where the economy falls off a sudden cliff and never bounces back to its previous level.\nDoug Porter at Bank of Montreal notes that numerous countries have been through economic shocks as bad as the Canadian economy's current one. And they all emerged stronger on the other side.\nMexico's peso crisis of 1995, Russia's debt default in 1998 and South Korea the previous year during the Asian currency crisis all saw those economies shrink by more than 20 per cent.\u00a0\n\"In all three cases, activity bounced and forcefully within two quarters,\" Porter says.\n\"All different conditions, true,\" Porter said. \"But very rapid rebounds from hard stops have and can be done.\"\nIf a rebound is coming, it's likely to be fast. And stock market investors are tentatively showing signs of believing that could be the case. Since falling to its lowest level in more than a decade on March 23, the TSX has quietly jumped back up almost 20 per cent since then, including its best day in more than 43 years on Tuesday.\u00a0\nStock markets tend to peak before recessions start but they also tend to bottom before they end, Manulife\u00a0Investment Management said in a note to clients on Thursday. Which means anyone willing to buy in when things look this gloomy could be getting in on the buying opportunity of a lifetime.\n\"The economic data will get precipitously worse over the next month\u00a0but don't bother looking at that, it will only confirm what we already know,\" the money manager said. \"Rather, we believe now is the time to focus on the market fundamentals and start to take advantage of the valuation opportunities across asset classes as they present themselves.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/696273987765", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2679797386", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "What a 'well-being budget' could look like in Canada", "description": "The government may focus on mental health, climate change and housing, says Jennifer Moss", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/well-being-budgeting-happiness-1.5455821", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5456001.1581096757!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fiscal-update-20191209.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 09, 2020 7:00 AM ET", "2020-02-09T12:00:00.761Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The federal government is\u00a0looking at a new way to measure economic success ahead of their spring budget.\nMinister of Middle Class Prosperity,\u00a0Mona Fortier, has been asked to look at so-called \"quality of life measurements.\" Those measurements are supposed to translate into the government's decision making and budgeting.\nIt's something other countries are already doing. Last year, New Zealand unveiled its \"well-being budget\" with billions of dollars for some of the country's most vulnerable.\u00a0\nBut what exactly does it mean \u2014 to budget for well-being? CBC Happiness and Well-being columnist Jennifer Moss, who sits on the UN Global Council for Happiness, explains to CBC Kitchener-Waterloo's The Morning Edition.\u00a0\nCraig Norris: Why incorporate well-being into federal budgets?\nJennifer Moss:\u00a0This has actually been a long time in the making. Some of the most respected economists in the world believe that GDP should have been obsolete a long time ago. We really need to see countries expand their current way of showing economic success.\nIt's really just been this main tool for measuring a country's economy, but it's morphed into this planning tool and that provides really a risk for us defining our country's success and it just makes us look through a very narrow lens.\nCN: So I assume you agree with the economists that the GDP is too narrow a way to define economic success. Why is that?\nJM:\u00a0Even the man behind the concept said that it should not be used as a welfare measure and if used as a planning tool, it just makes really the wrong assumptions. We have a pretty varied socioeconomic spectrum in our country. Take for example \u2014 2008, the big crash. Roughly 91 per cent of those gains went back to the top one\u00a0per cent, but GDP would say we have a robust economy and so that's really not accurate.\nAnd then there is an example of how the idea of GDP actually isn't understanding our modern economy. They didn't understand that Internet would be free. So it's hard to map that. And you have families that would have spent money on going to the movies or going out for dinner and now they're binge watching Netflix or\u00a0Prime or Disney Plus or whatever. And so GDP would say they're not better off. But that's arguable. So we're really you know missing a lot of that grey area data.\nCN: So is using GNH or the Gross National Happiness \u2014 is that a better way to measure this?\nJM:\u00a0The\u00a0GNH \u2014 probably why it's been hard for a lot of countries to adopt it is that idea of measuring happiness is so nebulous. But it was developed about 20 years ago by Bhutan, it tracks 300 items. The Global Happiness Council has started to modify that since 2012 and they created this happiness index and then they mapped it over the Gallup World Poll. And the thing with the Gallup World Poll is it tracks\u00a0and continually surveys citizens in 160 countries. It actually measures 98 per cent of the global population and it looks at stuff the GDP is looking at too.\nSo you merge those two things and then what happens is that you could analyze how clean drinking water can both be socially beneficial as well as financially beneficial. And you're looking at the value of cultural inclusion and trust in government. Loneliness epidemic \u2014 it costs a lot of money. But what if we could improve loneliness.\u00a0I mean we're looking at some of these things that are social impacts, but they have very expensive costs if we don't handle them.\nCN: What other countries might Canada would look at to make this a reality?\nJM:\u00a0Scotland and Iceland have been doing a pretty big effort. Brexit has slowed down their budgeting, now that should probably change. But what they've done is create this well-being economy government initiative and so the three prime ministers \u2014 all three women I should add \u2014 what they've done is they've created this framework. And so they're looking at creating this sort of objective. And Canada will be looking toward them as this framework to create more of an economic policy that shaped around collective well-being, to show that happy and healthy can also equal wealthy. One doesn't have to come at the expense of the other.\nCN: So if Canada were to develop a well-being budget, what do you think they would focus on?\nJM:\u00a0Well, I think they'll follow similarly to what New Zealand is\u00a0looking at because there are similar issues. And often these issues for everyone are the most expensive band aids. The most expensive issues are the ones that we want to tackle first because we can basically show that there's\u00a0a quantified reason for it.\nWe'll look at mental health and solving for that as much as we can. Obviously housing is a big one in Canada and solving for\u00a0not just homelessness but adequate housing. And\u00a0we'll also look at making sure that there is some sort of way of looking at climate change. Obviously it's important to be able to manage prosperity in climate change and also just you know the other factors that play into that.\nCN: So let's say the government does do these things. How then did they measure whether or not they're successful?\nJM:\u00a0The thing is that they're already doing a lot of this prevention stuff now. But it's not inside of that budget, it's sort of buried in different places. And so what that means is\u00a0Canadians can't actually see how that's being impacted. So taking it into a well-being budget basically says \"OK, we're going to tackle these issues.\"\nLet's look at New Zealand for example, their domestic violence issue \u2014 it's a big one. They actually have police called every four minutes to someone's home. I mean that's huge. It's costing them $4-billion to $7-billion a year, unchanged it could cost $80-billion in the next 10 years. So if we look at that they're going to put $500-million dollars annually in that year and they're going to say how much are we getting back from that. And so right away, it's an upstream investment which is scary for a lot of politicians. But we show it over time that it does actually make an impact.\nCN: So in essence is that what this is? It's just placing the budget investment further upstream?\nJM:\u00a0Yeah, that's exactly what it is. So you know it's scary, like I said.I mean New Zealand right now they had a 3.1 per cent prediction of their GDP,\u00a0it's now 2.1 per cent. And so obviously they're going to blame it on a well-being budget when there's a lot of factors. So they have to really own this and say you've got to trust us, but it's going to play out\u00a0in the long run. But Canadians, we are one of the happiest countries in the world. We do care about social justice. So it makes sense that we would be taking this this next step.\nEdited for clarity and brevity.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1699928131709", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "England tiptoes out of lockdown as economy dives", "description": "U.K. economy contracted by a record 5.8 per cent in March from February", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/england-lockdown-1.5567345", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5567352.1589365190!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/1224544629.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 13, 2020 7:30 AM ET", "2020-05-13T13:51:40.106Z"], "source": null, "content": "England tentatively began easing its coronavirus lockdown on Wednesday\u00a0with some people who cannot do their jobs at home urged to return to work, as stark economic data showed the disastrous impact of the pandemic.\nThe worst-hit country in Europe with more than 40,000 deaths from COVID-19\u00a0\u2014 including 275 health and care workers, according to official data\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Britain has been in lockdown since March 23.\nThe government is loosening restrictions only gradually\u00a0for fear of triggering a second peak of infections.

Please keep social distancing and stay at home as much as possible,\" he wrote. \"If you have to make an essential journey by public transport, wear a non-medical face covering to protect others.\"\nThe government has faced a barrage of criticism that its new guidance \u2014\u00a0\"stay alert, control the virus, save lives\" \u2014\u00a0was confusing and that people were being given mixed messages about how safe it was to have contact with others.\nAppearing on Sky News TV, Transport Minister Grant Shapps was asked why estate agents were being allowed to resume house viewings when people could not have relatives to visit.\n\"The truth of the matter is, you have to start somewhere. The lockdown message was very straightforward \u2014\u00a0it was just stay at home. Now as we start to unlock, of course, there have to be decisions made,\" Shapps said.\n\"There is no perfect way of doing this, and we'd ask people to use their common sense ... Right now, there has to be a cut-off somewhere.\"\nWorkers were being advised to avoid public transport if possible, and schools remained closed, prompting questions about how parents and people who could not get to work by other means should apply the new guidance.\nEmployers faced the daunting task of creating safe environments for staff, with detailed guidance on one-way systems at entry and exit points and in stairwells, spacing out workstations and other minutiae.\nFor those working from home or unable to work, there was little change. People were now allowed out to exercise more than once a day, and two people from separate households were allowed to meet outdoors if they kept two\u00a0metres\u00a0apart.\nFines for transgressions have been increased.\nAnyone hoping to alleviate the tedium by planning a summer holiday would be taking a risk, Shapps told the BBC.\n\"Right now you can't travel abroad. If you are booking it then you are clearly, by the very nature, taking a chance on where the direction of this virus goes and therefore where the travel advice is in the future,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "New Zealand plans spending spree to counter virus job losses", "description": "Finance Minister Grant Robertson unveiled a budget Thursday unlike any in nation's history", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-zealand-budget-1.5569118", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5569130.1589434734!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/new-zealand-budget.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 14, 2020 2:47 AM ET", "2020-05-14T10:49:58.433Z"], "source": null, "content": "New Zealand's government plans to borrow and spend vast amounts of money as it tries to keep unemployment below 10 per cent\u00a0in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\nFinance Minister Grant Robertson on Thursday unveiled a budget unlike any in the nation's history. Debt would shoot up from just over 20 per cent of GDP to 54 per cent by 2023, and thousands of jobs created by putting people to work building homes and improving the environment.\nStill, the increased spending will not be enough to offset the economic devastation caused by the pandemic. Unemployment is expected to rise from just over four\u00a0per cent\u00a0to nearly 10 per cent\u00a0by June. And Robertson acknowledged that tourism, which had accounted for about 10 per cent\u00a0of the economy, was not going to be the same for many years to come.\n\"We face a global economic and health crisis not seen since the Great Depression,\" Robertson said.\nThe budget was released on the same day the nation lifted most of its lockdown restrictions.\nMalls, retail stores and restaurants all reopened, and many people returned to their workplaces. That reflected the country's success to date in its attempts to eliminate the virus. Health authorities on Thursday reported zero new infections for the third day in a row. New Zealand has reported a total of about 1,500 confirmed infections and 21 deaths.\nUnder the budget plan, the government will spend 50 billion New Zealand dollars ($42\u00a0billion Cdn) over four years to help boost the economy.\nThe government had entered the crisis running a surplus and with its books in good shape compared to many other countries. Robertson said the crisis called for increased spending rather than cutting back.\n\"I'm not a fan of austerity,\" he said.\nMore than half of all workers in New Zealand are currently being subsidized by the government under a scheme that was quickly set up as the nation went into a strict lockdown in March. The budget would extend the scheme for hard-hit businesses.\nThe plan also calls for 11,000 environmental jobs to be created, some of them temporary. People would be put to work killing pests and restoring wetlands. And up to 8,000 new homes would be built, creating thousands of construction jobs. Spending would also be increased on everything from health care and education to school lunches and the postal service.\nLawmakers were expected to approve the budget later Thursday.\n"}, {"author": "Aidan Geary", "title": "COVID-19 not the only economic headwind on the horizon for Manitoba, budget warns", "description": "2020-21 spending plan includes $300M more for rainy-day fund, $57M more for emergency expenditures", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-budget-economy-2020-1.5495540", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5501833.1584747523!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/forks-market-empty.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 19, 2020 3:34 PM CT", "2020-03-19T20:34:25.166Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The latest Manitoba budget warns of potentially gloomy economic headwinds on the horizon, from the impacts of COVID-19 to international trade uncertainty.\nBut the Progressive Conservative government insists its plan will enable the province to weather a significant economic downturn \u2014 now a far more likely scenario than when the budget was originally prepared.\nThe 2020 budget, which was delivered Thursday after being held up more than a week by procedural delays in the Manitoba Legislature by the Manitoba NDP, now comes with a supplementary document that takes into account the remarkable economic shift since the first cases of COVID-19 in the province were announced a week ago.\nThe revised spending plan released Thursday now calls for $229 million of a planned $300-million injection into the province's rainy-day fund to occur this month, with the rest by the end of the next fiscal year. The cash will top up the emergency fund to $872 million.\nThe province's budget is now forecasting three consecutive quarters of economic decline, which meets the technical definition for a recession.\u00a0\nWhile COVID-19 is the economic factor that is top of mind right now, the budget documents point to international trade uncertainty, climate change, extreme weather events and wildfires, and overspending on major Manitoba Hydro projects as other potential economic stumbling blocks.\nThe financial performance of Manitoba Hydro is \"one of the single largest risks to our ability to balance the budget,\" the province's documents say.\nAs major projects like the Keeyask Generating Station and the Manitoba-Minnesota Transmission Project come online, carrying costs \u2014 including costs associated with amortization and interest \u2014 will affect Manitoba Hydro's bottom line, the budget documents say. As well, Hydro's revenue could be affected by factors like weather and energy export prices.\nPoor market conditions for mining and petroleum \u2014 Manitoba's third-largest primary resource industry \u2014 have kept commodity prices low, the province notes.\nGlobal trade challenges, meanwhile, cut Manitoba's international trade growth to 2.1 per cent in 2019, compared to 11.6 per cent growth in 2018. A hard crop season last year and China's restriction on Canadian canola imports bit into canola and soybean sales.\nThe 2020 budget breaks down the potential positive or negative impacts of certain factors on the province's bottom line:\nIn addition to boosting the province's rainy-day fund, the Manitoba government will also spend more on its emergency expenditures fund, increasing the annual allotment to $100 million \u2014 an increase of $57 million over 2019.\nUnlike the rainy-day fund, emergency expenditures are set aside to prepare for challenges like flooding and forest fires \u2014 events that are anticipated each year, but vary in their severity.\nLast week, Finance Minister Scott Fielding touted the 2020-21 spending plan as \"the most emergency-ready budget in Manitoba history.\"\nThe commitment to top up the province's rainy-day fund will make good on the goal of keeping the fund's balance at five per cent of provincial GDP, Fielding told reporters, who agreed to keep budget information under embargo, on March 11, when the provincial spending plan was supposed to be released.\nThe fund is \"liquid cash,\" he said, set aside for unforeseen emergencies.\n\"I want Manitobans to know that our government is prepared and we have a plan to deal with any downturns in the economy,\" he said last week.\nBut a lot has changed in succeeding days. On March 12, the province identified its first cases of coronavirus. Temporary business closures and mass layoffs quickly followed, potentially upending the provincial economy.\nIn Thursday's addition to the budget, the government suggests Manitoba's diversified economic base can withstand the pandemic, even if the tourism, oil and gas production and supply chain-dependent sectors are negatively affected.\nBased on preliminary estimates, the first three quarters of 2020 will see economic declines \u2014 real GDP drops of 1.3 per cent in the first quarter, 0.7 per cent in the second and 0.1 per cent in the third.\nThe province expects a turnaround will begin by the second quarter due to federal initiatives to stimulate the economy. Growth is expected to strengthen in the second half of the year as pent-up demand from consumers and businesses lifts the economy.\u00a0\nThe government is now reluctant to make estimates about its bottom line for the upcoming fiscal year because of the rapidly changing situation around COVID-19.\u00a0\nIn a worst-case scenario, the province's preliminary estimates say revenue could drop $682 million more than originally projected, due to higher health-care costs and other hits to the economy.\nHowever, even before Manitoba's first coronavirus case was reported, the province's budget took a more conservative estimate of economic growth than usual, Fielding said. It includes $500 million in spending that could be saved if necessary by delaying planned projects, the finance minsiter said \u2014 although he didn't say which projects might be deferred.\nHe said there's reason for optimism thanks to Manitoba's diversified economy, which he said could insulate the province from economic downturns around the world.\n\"Manitoba has the most diverse economy in Canada, by far,\" Fielding said. \"What that means is in times of crisis, we are a little bit more insulated. We have a very resilient economy here.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada's long-term care home system 'designed to produce mediocrity,' says health policy expert", "description": "Staffing shortages, most felt in for-profit care homes, lead to poor care and working conditions: Tamara Daly", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/checkup/how-can-we-fix-long-term-care-in-canada-1.5588412/canada-s-long-term-care-home-system-designed-to-produce-mediocrity-says-health-policy-expert-1.5592037", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5585898.1590533490!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/care-home-military.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 31, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-05-31T08:00:00.198Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "The Canadian military's report of dismal conditions and treatment in long-term care homes is tragic and shocking \u2014 but not surprising, according to health policy expert Tamara J. Daly.\n\"I think we have a system that is designed to produce mediocrity,\" said\u00a0Daly, a political economist and health policy researcher at York University in Toronto.\n\"I've been to some fantastic long-term care homes, but they're often fantastic despite the system, and not because of it.\"\nThe military's report detailed horrific conditions at five care homes in Ontario hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u00a0including accounts of residents being bullied, drugged, left in soiled bedding for hours and days.\nA similar report detailed conditions at 25 homes in Quebec. In many cases it described staffing and personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages that have since improved.\nHugh Armstrong, a professor emeritus from Carleton University, isn't surprised either. He co-authored a 10-year study of the conditions of residential care, which published its findings in April.\nThe study's research period ended before the pandemic began, but Armstrong says its recommendations are even more relevant now.\n\"We are, of course along with everybody else, very upset that it took this devastating set of disasters \u2026 to bring the issue to public attention,\" he told Checkup.\nThe report's short-term recommendations include urging governments to take a more hands-on approach to long-term residential care, stockpiling personal protective equipment, bolster the number of staff and to move away from a private or for-profit system of centres in favour of publicly owned care homes.\nMore than 80 per cent of all of Canada's COVID-related deaths are connected to care homes, according to an early May report from the National Institute on Aging.\nDaly said one of the most important factors for ensuring proper treatment and living conditions for residents is maintaining better working conditions for staff \u2014\u00a0a requirement that has often fallen short.\nSimply put, when there aren't enough people working in a care home to attend to residents, the ones that are working suffer from burnout, and cannot properly care for all residents' needs.\nShe said that based on the available data, for-profit homes were less likely to hire more staff, which leads to weaker care.\n\"What we see with the non-profit and the public homes is that they put money back into the system, and they have higher staffing ratios. But for-profits staff at the level the province provides, and it's not enough,\" she explained.\nFour of the Ontario homes detailed in the military's report are run by for-profit companies. The fifth is a private non-profit run by Holland Christian Homes.\nArmstrong's pre-pandemic study bore out much of the same conclusions.\n\"The for-profit homes tend to have more deaths and more outbreaks because they have less staff, and because they have lower quality [care] than the not-for-profits. And then the not-for-profits tend to be not quite as good as the public [homes],\" he said.\n\"If the for-profits are to make profit \u2014 if they are to extract profit from their operations \u2014 it's got to come from somewhere. Well, where it comes from is care. The others pour whatever they make on a daily basis \u2026 back into the facility.\"\nDaly noted that Ontario, in particular, previously had a minimum staffing standard for personal care workers.\n\"We don't have that anymore. That was done away with under the [Mike] Harris Conservatives.\"\nSenior care has been a peripheral issue in Canadian politics. As detailed by CBC's Aaron Wherry, this has resulted in a patchwork of systems that mix public and private options.\nArmstrong said that reforming the system will likely be a federal-provincial collaboration, partly thanks to Ottawa's deep coffers.\n\"Think about it now. They're spending billions [in pandemic relief], and no one is concerned terribly because they've got the Bank of Canada. They might have a much higher debt-to-GDP ratio for a few years, but it'll work itself out, as it did after the Second World War,\" he said.\nDaly believes the provinces and territories will likely have to take a more hands-on approach to managing long-term care, instead of leaving private and especially for-profit companies to run the business, only intervening when a complaint is made.\n\"We can decide that we want national standards in this country that speak to the type of system that we want: that is dignified, that provides decent work, and that creates a joy that honours people at the end of their lives,\" she said.\nWritten by Jonathan Ore with files from\u00a0Kirthana Sasitharan and\u00a0Steve Howard.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2674794546", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada's economy grew 0.1% in August, Statistics Canada reports", "description": "Gross domestic product edged up slightly, but fell short of expectations", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gdp-august-2019-statistics-canada-1.5342340", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5342378.1572527899!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/statcan-gdp-august-20191031.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 31, 2019 9:22 AM ET", "2019-10-31T14:03:38.406Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada's economy grew slightly in August, with real domestic product edging up 0.1 per cent after showing no change in July, Statistics Canada reports.\nEconomists on average had expected growth of 0.2 per cent for the month, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nFollowing two months of declines, good-producing industries were up 0.2 per cent, led by manufacturing, while service industries grew 0.1 per cent.\u00a0\nStatistics Canada found there was growth in 14 out of 20 industries that month.\u00a0\nLooking at the three-month rolling average, real GDP rose\u00a00.5 per cent in the three-month period ending in August, compared to 0.8 per cent in July.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1703950915660", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Edmonton economy to improve only slightly in 2020, city's chief economist says", "description": "Capital city can expect \u2018very modest\u2019 growth, John Rose says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-economy-alberta-outlook-1.5412999", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5096383.1555097286!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/edmonton-downtown-skyline-night-drone-spring-2019.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 02, 2020 12:00 PM MT", "2020-01-02T19:00:00.511Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "After a year marked by stagnant growth and weak job numbers, Edmonton will see \"sluggish\" growth in 2020, says the city's chief economist.\n\"We're coming off a very difficult year in 2019 and we've seen significant weakness in several key areas,\" John Rose said in an interview Thursday with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM.\n\"I think people really have to manage their expectations.

If the federal estimates are copied over to the territory, it could mean $500 million wiped away from the GDP.\u00a0\nThe economic effects of COVID-19 are being felt everywhere. Here's a look at the big picture across Canada\u00a0\n\"Customer bases are gone, no one's spending money, airlines, retail, auto, you name it,\" said Michael Miltenberger, who served as finance minister from 2007 to 2015 and now runs a consulting firm in Fort Smith, N.W.T.\u00a0\n\"I lived through 2008 as a finance minister, where the markets crumbled,\" he said. \"It was a major impact, but nothing like this.\"\u00a0\nThough small businesses are critical to the N.W.T. economy, its three diamond mines are its engine. Miltenberger estimates they produce at least $1 billion to the territory's GDP each year.\u00a0Though two, Diavik and Gahcho Kue continue to operate at full capacity,\u00a0Ekati has been shuttered since March 19.\nIf the others shut down too, either for health reasons during the pandemic or because of the economic downturn after the fact, the fallout could be catastrophic, Miltenberger said.\u00a0\nKatrina Nokleby knows this. She knows business owners can't make their payments and she knows what could happen if the diamond mines close. It's on her to do something about it.\u00a0\nSix months ago, she was an engineer. Now she's the territory's minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment, responsible for steering the N.W.T. economy through the pandemic.\u00a0\n\"This is the largest project I've ever managed,\" she said. \"I'm still in the same role of bringing people together, gathering the information where it needs to be and making strong, science-based, evidence-based decisions.\"\u00a0\nSince March, Nokleby has announced\u00a0two aid packages, representing up to $21.5 million in low-interest loans, deferred payments and waived fees.

But the economy also got a bigger-than-usual boost from the Toronto Raptors' run to the NBA championship.\nThe economy grew by more than economists were expecting during the month, thanks in small part to a 0.5 per cent jump in the arts and entertainment industry,\u00a0and a 0.4 per cent bump in accommodation and food services.\nThose are two sectors that would include spending on things like playoff tickets, or at restaurants and bars for those not lucky enough to snag a seat at the big game.\nThe data agency credited \"higher attendance at spectator sports\" with the spending bump, and it's not hard to see how it added up.\nThe Raptors' run to their championship that captivated the entire country was in full swing during the month, something that can't be said of the three Canadian NHL teams that made the playoffs: the Winnipeg Jets, the Calgary Flames and the Toronto Maple Leafs were all bounced in the first round, which ended in April.\nBefore that happened, though, \"bars, restaurants and hotels were among the spinoff beneficiaries of the Raptors' playoff success and the three Canadian NHL teams that were in the playoffs,\" as Scotiabank economist Derek Holt put it.\nOnce Canada's Stanley Cup hopes were dashed for the 25th year in a row, the Raptors were the only game in town, and the fan spending seems to have really taken off.\u00a0\nBy the NBA Finals in June, tickets to the game were going for $120,000 a pair, money that filtered down into the GDP numbers.\nWhile all that playoff money\u00a0may have been a nice shot in the arm for any bar with a TV and sports package, in terms of the overall economy, the bump can't possibly last, Holt warned.\n\"The sectors that benefited through stronger than typically seasonal activity probably face greater than seasonally normal downside risk in subsequent months as this sports effect drops out,\" he said.\nEven stripping out the Raptors' impact, there were lots of other positives in the monthly GDP report.\nThe closely watched manufacturing sector grew by 1.2 per cent, the third straight month of growth for a key part of Canada's economy.\nConstruction activity grew by 0.9 per cent, led by the strongest month for residential home building in more than a year.\n\"Much of the strength in today's report can be put down to two sectors (manufacturing and real estate) coming back to life after earlier setbacks,\" TD Bank economist\u00a0Brian DePratto\u00a0said. \"That said, a recovery is a recovery.\"\nTransportation and warehousing grew by one per cent, led by the rail sector, which grew by 4.9 per cent on the back of increased demand to ship car parts, coal, petroleum, chemicals, metals and\u00a0minerals.\nThe rebound in the rail sector is noteworthy, IHS Market economist Arlene Kish said, because it is \"making up for a slowdown at the start of the year, partially from adverse weather conditions.\"\nOn the down side, wholesale and retail trade both shrank, as did the mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector.\nThe finance and insurance sector shrank, as did utilities. But those declines were offset by slight growth in agriculture, forestry and fishing, and the aforementioned bump in arts and entertainment.\nOn an annualized basis, the economy grew at a 1.4 per cent pace during the month. That's slightly better than the 1.3 per cent that economists were expecting.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Statistics are great unless they measure the wrong things: Don Pittis", "description": "Statistics Canada looks to Big Data to size up Canadians, but are the numbers biased?", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/statistics-canada-bias-1.5429156", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5431432.1579293068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-canada-trade-companies.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 20, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-01-20T09:00:32.906Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "If prices are rising by\u00a0about two\u00a0per cent, as\u00a0inflation\u00a0data is likely to show this week, why did one of my newspaper subscriptions just go up by 17\u00a0per cent?\nAnd if wages are rising at about four per cent, as recent jobs data has shown, why are some provincial governments insisting that\u00a0wage increases be held below one per cent?\nAs\u00a0house prices go through the roof, the fact that the price of the biggest purchase Canadians make in their lives is not included in our inflation statistics makes it easy to see why many young people have expressed doubts about the accuracy of those figures.\nIt is a struggle that Statistics Canada faces every day as it tries to sketch out with numbers an authentic\u00a0picture of the reality Canadians experience. But Oxford fellow and bestselling author of Age of Discovery\u00a0Chris Kutarna says the task is far more complicated than many statisticians like to admit.\nKutarna\u00a0worries that Statistics Canada's\u00a0plan\u00a0to plunge into the ocean\u00a0of \"Big Data\" so\u00a0beloved of\u00a0retailers and credit card companies \u2014 described last week by chief statistician Anil Arora\u00a0\u2014\u00a0will inevitably create bias in the results simply because we are measuring the wrong things.\u00a0\n\"One of the\u00a0terrifying and most fundamental sources of risk is that we only consider what we're now measuring as real,\" said Kutarna, on the phone from London, England.\nFor example, long-standing data sets built on debt, spending, prices and gross domestic product simply close the door on\u00a0values such as family, respect, happiness and species\u00a0extinction.\n\"There is far more that is real and not being measured than there is that is real and we are measuring it,\" said Kutarna.\nOne practical example from his book is the failure of modern statistics to measure the value of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia which, despite providing value to billions, adds less to GDP figures than the old Encyclopedia Britannica which reached far fewer people.\nIn a recent speech, Stephen Poloz, governor of the Bank of Canada, described an economy changing so fast that our statistical models fail to grasp it.\nPoloz paraphrased the Solow Paradox, the observation by economist Robert Solow that\u00a0computers had led to an increase in productivity everywhere but in the statistics. Poloz suggested GDP is\u00a0being understated by as much as two\u00a0per cent.\nOne example he offered was the\u00a0way so many companies are distributing computer services to the cloud, turning whole computer divisions into a budget line item.\n\"How does StatCan deal with that?\" asked Poloz.\nLast week,\u00a0Arora\u00a0boasted to a gathering of the Empire Club that Statistics Canada was respected everywhere as a global leader, but he acknowledges\u00a0it is constantly struggling to keep up with changing technology and the shifting understanding of\u00a0how the world works.\n\"Look, that's what statistics is, right? To take what are evolving concepts, nebulous concepts, things that haven't even taken a lot of shape and then quickly try to turn them into numerics,\" said Arora in an interview.\nThe statistics chief calls it a \"team sport\" where governments and individuals need to decide which of the millions and millions of things that could possibly be measured should\u00a0be addressed by the some 5,000 employees at Statistics Canada. Their job, he says, is to bring scientific rigour to the process, so that the numbers are as accurate as possible.\n\"This is always going to be a journey,\" said Arora, adding\u00a0that finding and incorporating into our figures\u00a0what have so far been labelled intangibles may be a never-ending task.\u00a0\nPart of that journey that those employees are now undertaking is the attempt to mine the immense bodies of information embedded in Big Data, those\u00a0traces of activity we leave behind when we do almost anything on the internet\u00a0from buying to searching. Not only are they readily available for quick analysis but they reduce the employee hours required in traditional surveys.\u00a0\n\"Alternate sources of data are increasing exponentially and we\u00a0have the technologies and the mechanisms to convert them to public good with high quality statistics,\" said Arora\u00a0in his speech.\nWhen it comes to the inadequacies of GDP, a big part of the problem has less to do with Statistics Canada than how we continue to use familiar indicators that may be out of date.\nArora says the University of Waterloo's Canadian Index of Wellbeing\u00a0includes 200 indicators \u2014 from crime and safety to sustainable growth \u2014 most of which come from Statistics Canada data. But it's GDP that gets the attention.\nStatisticians are always groping to find the data sets that matter. But even in areas we think we know and understand, statistics are merely an indicator \u2014 an estimate, of reality. Things we don't understand are, by definition, even harder to measure.\n\"We live in this culture where what is real is what we measure,\" said\u00a0Kutarna, \"That\u00a0the things we measure are reality.\"\nIn which case, a certain amount of healthy skepticism, whether\u00a0about this week's inflation numbers,\u00a0about GDP, productivity or the many other financial statistics that are often offered as solid immutable facts, may well be in order.\u00a0\u00a0\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "How the coronavirus has thrown interest rate plans out the window", "description": "40 banks around the world have already cut interest rates \u2014 and Canada could be next", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-rate-cuts-1.5478258", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5479882.1582910916!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/poloz-wilkins-smile.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 29, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-01T15:09:02.881Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Central bankers are waking up to dramatically overhauled expectations about interest rates, as the coronavirus that started in China and is now creeping around the world rewrites\u00a0their plans as quickly as the virus spreads.\nInvestors are betting that there's better than a two in three\u00a0chance of a rate cut from the Bank of Canada as soon as next Wednesday, when Canada's central bank is poised to reveal its next decision on interest rates. Not everyone believes it's a sure thing, but the probability goes up as the illness spreads.\nAt the start of the year, the odds of Canada cutting its rate\u00a0at the March meeting were barely one in 20. Even a\u00a0week ago, the odds of a cut were barely\u00a0one in six. But that was before the virus that causes COVID-19 started its spread around the world, infecting markets everywhere with something almost as dangerous as the pathogen itself: fear.\nBoth Canadian and U.S. stock markets are in correction territory, meaning declines of more than 10 per cent. Supply chains at technology companies like Apple\u00a0have been disrupted as Chinese factories shut down, making it impossible for manufacturers to get finished products to market.\u00a0\nAirlines have seen their ticket sales plunge\u00a0as consumers decide to stay home. Businesses around the world are cancelling conferences and other events that require people to meet face to face. And if coronavirus\u00a0becomes widespread here, many businesses will struggle with shortages of workers and supplies.\nAll things being equal, central banks raise interest rates when they want to cool down overheated economies. They cut when they want to stimulate an economy that needs a little warming up.\nFaced with the potential of a sickly economy because of coronavirus, central banks around the world are expected to try to flood the system with cheap\u00a0money in the hope that it's the shot in the arm the economy needs to get better.\u00a0\nChina, Brazil, Russia, the EU, Indonesia, India and Mexico have all cut in recent months.\nTypically in times of uncertainty, investors flock to the relative safety of the U.S. economy. But\u00a0the world's largest economy also is going to be dealing with the spread of coronavirus. And despite lowering rates three times in the past year, it's\u00a0not immune to the\u00a0trend toward lower rates.\u00a0\nTraders are pricing in effectively a 100\u00a0per cent chance of a U.S rate cut next month, and there's a 50/50 chance of up to two more cuts after that.\u00a0\nThose odds are three times\u00a0as high as they were as recently as Wednesday, before U.S. President Donald Trump appointed vice-president Mike Pence to head public health efforts to contain the virus' spread.\nThe U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve,\u00a0has been signalling for months that it thinks the\u00a0underlying numbers in the U.S. economy are strong, and telling investors not to expect any more rate cuts unless something drastic happens.\nReaction to the coronavirus suggests something certainly has. Even if the Fed is inclined to sit tight, it is under pressure to do something for the sake of looking like it is doing something.\n\"The Fed's desire to be data-dependent may capitulate to market sentiment,\" as Jon Hill, an interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets put it.\nThat goes for Canada, too. While most economists who study trends at the Bank of Canada expect the bank to stand pat next week, almost half of them think the bank should cut, according to a survey by rate comparison site Finder.com.\nBrett House at Scotiabank is among them. \"Our call\u00a0is for two cuts in 2020, which we've been saying since August of last year,\" he said in an interview. That call was based on underlying weaknesses in the economy, something that was borne out by Friday's GDP release that showed economic growth slowed to its slowest annual pace in almost four years at the end of 2019.\n\"And that was\u00a0all before the coronavirus,\" he said.\nSince that call, more than 40 major central banks around the world have moved to cut rates, he notes. \"If anything Canada has\u00a0been one of the tardiest to the [rate cut] party.\"\nOthers aren't sure the coronavirus will be enough to compel the bank to take action \u2014 yet. \"Although we think a certain degree of easing is warranted, two cuts priced by the end of 2020 seems somewhat unrealistic,\" CIBC's economics team said in a note this week.\u00a0\nThe bank thinks a cut is coming, but possibly not until the next meeting in\u00a0April.\n\"We are reluctant to pencil-in an additional cut as we don't know how long the associated uncertainty will last,\" CIBC said.\nSherry Cooper, chief economist with Dominion Lending Centres, says the panic in the stock market right now shows the central bank is under pressure to do something, even if it's just for the sake of doing something.\n\"None of this is good for psychology or the economy,\" she said.  \"The Bank of Canada meets next Wednesday, and clearly, their press release will address these issues. It's unlikely the bank will cut rates in response on March 4, but if the economic disruption continues, rate cuts could be coming by mid-year.\"\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Coronavirus could be the global shock that economists have feared: Don Pittis", "description": "But avoiding panic over the disease's economic impact will prevent a worse result", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-economy-canada-1.5458155", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5458662.1581367576!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/switzerland-china-outbreak.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 11, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-02-26T15:56:21.813Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "For those\u00a0who worry about the world's wealth and wellbeing, the term \"economic shock\" has a special meaning.\nAs defined by people like the Bank of Canada's governor Stephen Poloz, while economies are always in a state of flux, occasionally an outside force, usually\u00a0unforeseeable, or at least unexpected, will sweep in and put everything awry.\nIt seems increasingly certain that the outbreak of coronavirus\u00a0spreading from Wuhan, China, is such an unanticipated disturbance to the global, the North American and Canadian economies. And yesterday Canada's finance minister Bill Morneau\u00a0said Canada would inevitably be affected.\nAs the death toll\u00a0\u2014 mostly in China\u00a0\u2014 passes 1,000, the business press has begun to tally the effects on the country's gross domestic product and estimate what impact that will have on the wider global economy.\nThere is so much unknown about the virus and its potential that the numbers can only be educated guesses, but experts interviewed by credible sources such as the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal offer estimates that China's GDP growth will fall by two or more percentage points. That would\u00a0represent a decline in growth of more than one-third.\nMany of those calculations are based on extrapolating from the economic impact of SARS, which killed nearly 800 people during its eight-month run 17 years ago. The fact that the new, related\u00a0virus has killed more people in only three months is only one of the many differences.\nFor one thing, the Chinese economy is much bigger than it was in 2002 when the SARS outbreak began. The\u00a0\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0estimates that in 2020 that economy\u00a0represents nearly 17 percent of global activity compared to around four\u00a0per cent in the era of SARS. Thus the global\u00a0coronavirus effect will be much larger.\nIn an integrated global economy operating on the strategy of just-in-time\u00a0delivery, shortages of key parts caused by the shutdown of Chinese factories\u00a0have already stopped industrial production in the automotive and technology manufacturing sectors.\nAs the world discovered during the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, finding replacement parts when specialized factories go down can be impossible in the short term.\nTourism has already taken a hit as big-spending Chinese tourists stay home\u00a0and, as Morneau said yesterday in Calgary,\u00a0the outbreak\u00a0has already hit the Canadian oil business. And such spreading effects are insidious.\u00a0From Nova Scotia there are reports that lobster prices are down 20 per cent due to the collapse of the crucial Chinese market.\nThe U.S. economy that Canada depends upon is also feeling the effects in its currency as its dollar surges, making its products more expensive in overseas markets. The virus has pushed down the price of coffee and mortgages.\nIn the past the Bank of Canada governor has warned that economies can be like a cracked tree waiting for a shock to blow it down.\n\"Macroeconomic shocks happen all the time and economies adjust to them,\" Poloz once said in a briefing describing the hazards of an uncertain world. But a shock that is big enough or sudden enough\u00a0can reveal hidden cracks in an economy.\n\"If significant vulnerabilities are present, the effects of those shocks on the economy and the financial system can be magnified,\" said Poloz.\nAnd that is the danger here. The Canadian oil business, already suffering, may be shocked into a new perilous state as cheaper producers hog a bigger share of shrinking world demand.\nA global economy already close to recession\u00a0may be pushed over the line.\nPlaces like Europe, already glutted with monetary stimulus, may demand more with uncertain results. Already China has delayed\u00a0attempts to get borrowing under control, cutting rates to boost the sickened economy.\nAnd the shock may not be over. As we learn more about the new coronavirus, we are learning how much we don't know.\u00a0\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, warned that cases in France and the United Kingdom with no known contact history with\u00a0existing outbreaks may show our understanding of transmission is flawed.\n\"The detection of this small number of cases may be the spark that begins a bigger fire,\" he said.\nThere are worries about what will happen if that bigger fire begins to break out in places that do not have Canadian-style medical facilities such as North Korea that shares a large border with China, or places in Africa where Chinese business travellers continued to visit after the outbreak but before China threw up its cordon sanitaire.\nCertainly the fact that Wuhan authorities tried to suppress\u00a0Li Wenliang, the doctor who tried to warn authorities of the dangers before dying himself of the virus, does not reassure us that China has been as forthright as it claims. The age of some high-profile victims, including Li who was 35, does not support what we have been told so far.\nAs well as warning of the coronavirus\u00a0impact on Canada's economy yesterday, Morneau hinted that there may be more news to come and that we must be \"prepared for any eventualities.\"\nPart of those preparations must be to keep money flowing to\u00a0Canada's medical system that learned so much during the SARS\u00a0outbreak, including funding Canadian research, which will be money well spent whether or not this virus spreads in Canada.\u00a0\n\"Globally, volatility remains a key risk and obviously that has been illustrated vividly over the last couple of months,\" Morneau told the Calgary gathering of the Economic Club of Canada.\nAnd whether he was referring to the coronavirus, its impact on the global economy or the Alberta oil industry, the finance minister said that Canada must have the economic resiliency to face the unexpected.\n\"Challenges,\" he said, \"that we many not be able to see right now.\"\nFollow Don\u00a0on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Alberta economy to improve ever so slightly after tough 2019, according to ATB",

growth of 0.9 per cent leading to a relative boom in 2021, with GDP forecast to grow by 2.1 per cent.\u00a0\n\"Bottom line, it's going to be a pretty sluggish year for Alberta's economy,\" said Todd Hirsch, ATB's chief economist.\u00a0\n\"We do expect it to be a modest improvement over 2019, but still likely to feel pretty sluggish, a lot of still discouraging attitudes and feelings in the province simply because growth is not bouncing back up to where most Albertans feel like it's normal.\"\nThe outlook points to a familiar culprit for the economic doldrums: pipeline capacity and the ripple effects of oil production curtailment and the reluctance of investors to finance\u00a0additional production and exploration.\u00a0\nATB says others are predicting a stronger economy in 2020, but it's cautious and says although oil and gas exports are anticipated to rise, it doesn't believe new investment will immediately follow.\u00a0\nRetail sales also struggled in 2019, down in seven of the first nine months, according to ATB.\u00a0\n\"It's unlikely that retail sales will improve over the short-term as consumers hold back due to high levels of personal debt, unemployment, and concerns over the general state of the economy,\" reads the outlook.\nIt notes that unemployment will continue to be high,\u00a0forecast to remain at an average\u00a0of 6.9 per cent next year and 6.7 per cent in 2021.\nEmployment in construction and oil and gas has dropped, while the \"largest absolute increase was in the health care and social assistance sector.\"\nResidential construction did tick up in the latter part of the year, but remains lower than in previous years.\u00a0\nAlso battering the economy is China and its appetite, or lack thereof,\u00a0for Alberta crops.\u00a0\nATB notes there was good news for local producers when China lifted its ban on Canadian meat, but a prohibition on canola continues.\u00a0\nThat just happens to be Alberta's largest crop export to China and resulted in a 13.1 per cent decrease in crop exports over the first nine months of the year \u2014 a value of $493.5 million.\n\"Despite the continued challenges posed by insufficient pipeline capacity, Alberta's real GDP is forecast to grow next year,\" concludes the outlook.\u00a0\n\"The easing of oil production limits, modest increases in pipeline capacity, an uptick in natural gas prices, a strong tourism sector, a growing tech sector, improvement in manufacturing sales, and ongoing population growth will help boost real GDP by 0.9 per cent in 2020 followed by growth of 2.1 per cent in 2021.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Diverting water from Lake Diefenbaker could help expand Sask. agriculture, Ralph Goodale says", "description": "Conduit infrastructure would cost about

Millions more have lost most of their work hours. In total, 5.5 million people have either lost their jobs or have been working far less since the week of April 12.\n\"These numbers tell us what we already knew \u2013 that right now, Canadians are hurting because of this pandemic,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday.\u00a0\nThe hurt likely goes even deeper than those numbers suggest.\nAlready, 7.7 million Canadians are getting\u00a0cheques\u00a0through the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, while 1.7\u00a0million workers have qualified for the federal emergency wage subsidy. \u00a0More than 45\u00a0per cent of the labour force is now receiving some sort of federal government support.\nWatch: The pandemic and essential workers\nEven as some provinces inch toward\u00a0reopening their economies, there are few signs of rapid economic improvement. The PBO's office projects the economy could shrink by as much as 30 per cent in the second quarter.\nIn a recent article for Policy Magazine, former parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page said the staggering economic data left the government with two clear choices: run up the debt to help households and businesses and increase the odds of recovery\u00a0and longer-term growth \u2014 or offer less help, minimize debt growth and diminish the chances of recovery.\n\"All countries will wake up after the global pandemic with much higher debt levels. Canada is fortunate because we are starting at a much lower net debt-to-GDP level,\" Page wrote. \"If low interest rates are maintained, there is no good policy case for rushing to austerity \u2014 either spending cuts or tax increases. The economic recovery will likely be much too weak and fragile for austerity.\"\nFederal bureaucrats are in the middle of a review of pandemic-related aid programs, primarily to see if they need to be tweaked or extended. What could emerge from that process is what the senior\u00a0official described as a \"glide-and-launch phase,\" where some direct aid programs slowly wind down while economic stimulus programs are launched.\nTrudeau revealed\u00a0one of the first steps of that review on Friday when he announced that the wage subsidy program would continue beyond June to help kick-start the reopening of provincial\u00a0economies\u00a0and allow people to move from the CERB to paid work.\n\"We need an economy to come back to and direct support is a key part of that,\" said a finance official speaking on background.\u00a0\"Everything is going to be largely dependent on where we are and what the needs are.\"\nBut even as the federal government prepares for the next phase of its pandemic response, it's\u00a0still busy trying to deal with the first wave of challenges. The already-extended wage subsidy is still in the getting-money-out-the-door phase. There's also the\u00a0unfulfilled promise of direct financial help for seniors to address. And hard-hit sectors such as airlines, energy and hospitality will need some kind of sector-specific bailouts.\n\"The big business bailout is the hardest one to do out of all of them,\" said the senior federal official. \"How do you bridge people to a better time and what do you get in return for that?\"\nPart of the government's\u00a0concern here is the risk of being seen bailing out companies that use tax havens or engage in tax avoidance. There's a desire at the federal level\u00a0to make sure that any bailout includes a degree of public oversight and can support\u00a0the argument that it was done in the public's interest.\n\"We will, over the coming days, start looking at specific sectoral supports,\" Trudeau said Friday. \"But even then, our focus will be on the workers \u2026 and not on the corporate well-being of an industry or sector.\"\nAnd while airlines have been promised some sort of help, public transit companies are also knocking on Ottawa's door.\u00a0The Trudeau government is a big booster of mass public\u00a0transit and a big spender\u00a0when it comes to capital investment to boost transit capacity.\nBut transit operations are largely a municipal responsibility. Ottawa is trying to find a way to help that sector without becoming a long-term player in transit policy.\nAs this crisis continues, jurisdictional lines are blurring. Many municipal and provincial governments were in\u00a0precarious\u00a0financial situations going into the pandemic and will be even more\u00a0vulnerable as they emerge from it. The Bank of Canada already\u00a0has launched a multi-billion dollar program to buy provincial government bonds because provinces like Newfoundland and Labrador have had trouble borrowing on the open market.\nAll of this will require Ottawa's attention when the dust settles \u2014 and billions of dollars more in federal spending may be required.

Those government scenarios examined how Alberta would fare:\n\"What they found is that there is healthy economic growth and healthy job creation under all of the scenarios from 2020 to 2030,\" Harrison said.\u00a0  And she said the data showed even with a carbon tax rising to $50 a tonne, the difference in effect on the province's GDP would be marginal.\n\"The difference in the average growth of GDP at the maximum is a difference between 2.57 per cent [growth]\u00a0per year and 2.5\u00a0per cent per year,\" said Harrison, who in addition to a doctorate in political science, holds a masters degree in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nBut job creation would be affected by a carbon tax, Harrison said. The government report said the Notley carbon tax would reduce the number of jobs created by between 10,000 and 16,000 a year.\nIn an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Alberta Environment Minister Jason Nixon did not address the government analysis filed as part of its court challenge.\u00a0\nInstead, she referenced the government report that said Alberta's average annual GDP growth, under the Climate Leadership Plan with a carbon tax rising to $50 per tonne, would be reduced by between 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points, which is about $2 billion to $3.9 billion a year.\u00a0\nThe statement also maintained the UCP government's position that the carbon tax imposed an unacceptable financial burden on individual households.\nSimon Dyer of the Pembina Institute said the reduction in GDP growth under the Notley government carbon tax was insignificant.\u00a0\n\"The carbon tax was misrepresented in the most recent provincial election in Alberta,\" Dyer said, adding that the tax \"hasn't had a significant impact either on consumers or on industry.\"\nDuring cross-examination in October as part of Alberta's challenge to the federal carbon tax, Alberta assistant deputy minister for energy Robert Savage seemed to admit the Alberta government chose Pembina's modelling knowing it produced emissions-reduction data that was better for the government's case.  \"So you had information that the Pembina Institute's modelling provided significantly smaller differences [in emissions reduction] because it had a more optimistic 'business as usual' approach?\" B.C. government lawyer Gareth Morley asked Savage.\n\"My understanding is that there were some differences in the forecast,\" Savage replied, adding that he believed Navius Research, the firm hired by the Alberta government to model the effects of a carbon tax, was working with the Pembina Institute on that issue.\nUnder questioning, Savage also conceded the general consensus among economists is that a carbon tax is one of the most economically efficient ways to curb emissions.\nSavage however, resisted a line of questioning that sought to establish that the Notley government's carbon tax had resulted in a significant reduction in emissions.\nThe environmental model Pembina used to forecast emissions reduction was developed by a San Francisco policy firm. The Alberta government used a draft version of that model to forecast that a $30-per-tonne carbon tax on building and transportation emissions would only reduce annual emissions by 1.4 megatonnes in 2020, and 2.7 megatonnes in 2030.\nAs part of the Paris climate agreement, Canada has committed to lowering its greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. That means lowering emissions to 513 megatonnes from 732 megatonnes.\nThe Alberta government's own environmental modelling data, produced in court after the government filed its initial legal documents, forecast the carbon tax would reduce annual emissions by one megatonne in 2020, and by five megatonnes in both 2025 and 2030.\nDyer said the Pembina model is a \"rigorous but simplified\" model that doesn't consider how carbon-tax revenues could be used to drive further emissions reductions, for example through investment in public transit.\nHe said while carbon pricing isn't the only solution to reducing emissions, it is a critical and relatively low-cost tool that has proven effective.\n\"Carbon pricing works. It works for consumers in terms of helping them make different choices, especially if you provide rebates to ensure that they're not out of pocket,\" Dyer said, adding it is also necessary for industry.\n\"If we don't have strong enough carbon pricing in place, this industry is never going to be able to innovate fast enough to compete in this global market that is demanding low-carbon oil,\" he said.\nUnder the former NDP government's climate leadership plan, about 60 per cent of households were eligible for carbon-tax rebates.\nUniversity of Calgary researchers found four out of 10 households received a rebate that was greater than their carbon-tax costs. The federal government has said that under its system, that figure would be eight out of\u00a010 households.\nNDP environment critic Marlin Schmidt said the Kenney government misled the public about the carbon tax.\n\"I think what we saw during the election campaign was an attempt to misdirect Albertans,\" Schmidt said.\n\"We know that Albertans have been going through a really tough economy over the past few years, and Kenney used the carbon tax as a simple but wrong explanation as to what was going on with Alberta's economy.\"\nIf you have any information for this story, or information for another story, please contact us in confidence at cbcinvestigates@cbc.ca\nFollow us on Twitter: @charlesrusnell @jennierussell_\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Retailers foresee holiday joy \u2014 even as Poloz looks to hold line on rates: Don Pittis", "description": "While the world cuts interest rates, the Bank of Canada likely won't if we keep shopping", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-poloz-retail-1.5381037", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5381165.1575312823!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winter-toronto-real-estate.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 03, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-03T09:00:00.543Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "South of the border, there was much hand-wringing that a shortened holiday spending season this year just wouldn't give our American cousins enough time to shop till they drop.\nAccording to some retail analysts, a late Thanksgiving meant a late Black Friday, viewed as the starting gun for the U.S. Christmas spending frenzy.\nOf course, Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving a month earlier and don't quite have that same special Friday to shop, shop,\u00a0shop.\u00a0But there is reason to think the season of retail therapy\u00a0that is also a phenomenon here will give Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz one less reason to cut interest rates.\nMost analysts expect Poloz to hold rates steady at 1.75 per cent tomorrow, and sturdy consumer spending is part of the rationale.\nFigures released last week\u00a0show\u00a0that despite an overall decline to 1.3 per cent in Canadian GDP,\u00a0housing, consumer activity, construction and business investment were all\u00a0holding up well.\nExports were down, but that could be partly blamed\u00a0on a leaky\u00a0pipeline that interrupted oil shipments and a General Motors\u00a0strike that reduced the need for Canadian parts.\nFinal holiday retail figures don't\u00a0come out till the new year, but there are several signs Canadians remain in a spending mood. And that's despite Retail\u00a0Council of Canada research that shows 18 per cent of Canadians plan to spend less\u00a0than they have in the past.\nClearly, what you say to someone taking a survey doesn't always pan out.\nFigures from last year show\u00a0more than one-quarter (27%) of those surveyed\u00a0ended up spending more in 2018\u00a0than they had planned. Only six per cent spent less.\nOverall spending is expected to rise substantially in 2019, says the council's Michael LeBlanc.\nAccording to\u00a0Statistics Canada, consumer spending picked up in the three-month period ending in October. We can't be certain that consumer optimism will continue, but a long run of job creation and growing wages seem to point in that direction.\nCertainly, analysis from Adobe Analytics\u00a0shows that fears of a short U.S. shopping season seems to have\u00a0only increased\u00a0appetite for a consumption binge, as shoppers spent record amounts online.\nIn the U.S.\u00a0too\u00a0consumer spending has been one of the mainstays of the economy, even as trade and business investment weakened.\nWhile frigid weather and storms\u00a0can drive people away from the shops, a layer of snow\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like what landed on parts of the country\u00a0this week\u00a0\u2014\u00a0seems to stimulate the holiday shopping impulse.\nA spendy holiday season is\u00a0important to retailers, those who invest in them, and to people who worry whether consumers can keep the economy afloat for a few more months as we wait for what some foresee as an economic revival. A\u00a0rule of thumb says that one-quarter of overall retail sales during\u00a0the entire year come in the days before Christmas as people splurge on themselves and others.\nThere are signs that so long as housing remains\u00a0on the rise and consumers keep spending,\u00a0Poloz will be in no mood to cut Canada's interest rates. As he and his deputy, Carolyn Wilkins, have warned in the past, lower rates\u00a0that make borrowing cheaper may not be good for Canadians,\u00a0who, as a group,\u00a0have already borrowed too much.\nIf the next round of stimulus must come from fiscal spending, as the OECD has suggested, Poloz may decide to delay rate cuts well into the new year to see what impact government spending will have. (Thursday's speech from the throne may give a better idea of fiscal spending to come.)\nSome economists have said that if Friday's unemployment numbers show us that the recent trend toward more jobs and fewer jobless is interrupted, it\u00a0may be the first sign that the Canadian economy really does need\u00a0a rate cut. So far, retail bank economists have offered wildly different predictions on whether the economy will gain or lose employment this time around.\u00a0\nAnd in the\u00a0way that economies are recognized as self-reinforcing, expectations of a bumper holiday retail season will help contribute to economic strength\u00a0\u2014\u00a0particularly as retailers shake the branches for extra staff in an economy where workers are, so far, still in short supply.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Economy flat in July as oil and gas sector down, Statistics Canada says", "description": "Economists had expected growth of 0.1 per cent, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-gdp-canada-july-1.5303938", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2567217.1405009376!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hibernia-platform.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 01, 2019 8:58 AM ET", "2019-10-01T13:39:32.486Z"], "source": null, "content": "Statistics Canada says the country's real gross domestic product was essentially unchanged in July as weakness in oil and gas extraction offset gains in service industries.\nEconomists had expected growth of 0.1 per cent, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nThe flat reading for the month came as goods-producing industries fell 0.7 per cent for the month.\nThe mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector pulled back 3.5 per cent in the month, the largest decrease in the sector since May 2016.\nOil and gas extraction fell 3.0 per cent in July due in large part to a shutdown of some of Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore production facilities for a large part of the month as a result of maintenance issues.\nMeanwhile, Stastics Canada says the services-producing industries rose 0.3 per cent.\nOne economist suggested not reading too much into the overall flat growth seen in July.\n\"Today's headline was definitely soft, but the underlying story was not,\" TD Bank senior\u00a0economist Brian DePratto said in a commentary.\u00a0\n\"If it weren't for the drag from the energy/mining sector, we'd have had a repeat of June's solid performance, even with the relative lack of growth breadth.\u00a0 If you're looking for generalized weakness in Canada's economy, today's report ain't it,' he wrote.\nDePratto also said the latest report on the economy isn't likely to produce movement by\u00a0Bank of Canada on interest rates.\n\"Governor [Stephen] Poloz and company are looking for signs of the global trade and manufacturing slowdown manifesting in the Canadian data.

Europe has had about 170,000 deaths and the U.S. has seen nearly 100,000. Experts say the tally understates the true toll of the disaster.\nIndia, with a population of over 1.3 billion, saw a record single-day jump in new cases for the seventh straight day. It reported 6,535 new infections Tuesday, raising its total to over 145,000, including close to 4,200 deaths.\nThe virus has taken hold in some of the country's poorest, most densely populated areas, underscoring the challenges authorities face in trying to contain a virus for which no vaccine or cure has been developed.\nMost of India's cases are concentrated in the western states of Maharashtra, home to the financial hub of Mumbai, and Gujarat. Infections have also climbed in the east as migrant workers stranded by lockdowns returned to their native villages from India's largest cities.\nDespite this, India allowed domestic flights to resume Monday following a two-month hiatus, but at a fraction of normal traffic levels.\nIn Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro has raged against state and local leaders enforcing stay-at-home measures, the WHO warned that before reopening the economy, authorities must have enough testing in place to control the spread of the virus.\nBrazil has 375,000 coronavirus infections \u2014 second only to the 1.6 million cases in the U.S. \u2014 and has counted over 23,000 deaths, but many fear Brazil's true toll is much higher.\nRyan said Brazil's \"intense\" transmission rates mean\u00a0it should keep some stay-at-home measures in place, regardless of the damage to the economy.\n\"You must continue to do everything you can,\" he said.\nBut Sao Paulo Gov. Joao\u00a0Doria has ruled out a full lockdown in Brazil's largest state economy and plans to start loosening restrictions on June 1.\nA U.S. travel ban was set to take effect Tuesday for foreigners coming from Brazil.\nIn Europe, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the postponed military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the Allied victory in the Second World War will take place on June 24. Victory Day has become the most important holiday in Russia, marked every year on May 9 with a show of armed might in Red Square.\nPutin said the country has passed the peak of the outbreak.\nRussia reported a record one-day spike Tuesday of 174 deaths, bringing the country's confirmed death toll to over 3,800. Russia's coronavirus caseload surpassed 360,000 \u2014 the third-highest in the world \u2014 with almost 9,000 new infections registered.\nThe country's comparatively low mortality rate has raised questions among experts. Russian officials vehemently deny manipulating any figures and attribute the low numbers to the effectiveness of the country's lockdowns.\nThe question of who can travel where and when remains a dilemma in many places.\nSpain's foreign minister said that European Union members should collectively agree to open borders and determine which non-EU countries are safe for travel.\n\"We have to start working with our European partners to retake the freedom of movement in European territories,\" Arancha Gonzalez Laya told Cadena SER radio.\nSpain is eager to welcome tourists to shore up an industry that accounts for 12 per cent\u00a0of the country's GDP.\nAiming to entice travellers, Greek authorities will introduce cheaper tickets for sea travel from the mainland to Greek islands on June 1.\nThe Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia struck a deal to open their borders for 48 hours of travel without quarantines among their citizens starting Wednesday.\nIndonesia said it will deploy 340,000 security forces in 25 cities to enforce health rules as the world's fourth-most populous nation prepares to reopen shopping centres and other businesses in the capital Jakarta on June 4.\n\"We want to get into a new normal and enter a new order,\" Indonesia's President Joko Widodo said after inspecting moves to reopen Jakarta's subway and a shopping mall in Bekasi.\nSouth Korea began requiring people to wear masks on public transit and in taxis. The country is tracing dozens of infections linked to nightclubs and other venues as it prepares for 2.4 million students to return to school on Wednesday.\nSouth Korea's Health Ministry said beginning in June, \"high-risk\" businesses such as bars, nightclubs, gyms, karaoke rooms and concert halls will be required to use QR codes to register customers so they can be found more easily when infections occur.

That 7.4 percent is slightly higher than most other cities in Ontario and will account for almost 10 per cent of all jobs lost in the province.\u00a0\nCrawford predicts unemployment will be at its worst right now, in the middle of the second quarter.\n\"Employment, we forecast, will contract by almost six per cent in the second quarter alone,\" he explained.\n\"It's really concentrated in this period of forced closures for businesses right now and it's really not a huge surprise things are declining.\"\nThe city said it was dealing with a\u00a0pandemic-related\u00a0$23-million budget shortfall in the middle of April.\nAlso not a surprise for Crawford, hotels and\u00a0restaurants are being hit the hardest. He said the industry could contract by 40 per cent.\nThe report notes real estate and population growth have been stunted by COVID-19 as well.\n\"The pandemic and its resulting travel restrictions will slow Hamilton's recent strong growth in net in-migration, which hit 8,325 in 2019\u2014the highest level since 1989. This year we expect 6,520 net new arrivals\u2014a 21.7 per cent decline compared with last year. This will cut Hamilton's population growth to 8,094, down from 9,133 in 2019,\" reads the report.\n\"The local retail trade sector will contract in 2020, as a depressed economy, a weak labour market, and slower household disposable income growth force nervous consumers to tighten their purse strings. Retail sales are forecast to fall by 3.3 per cent, leading retail trade output to contract by 3.8 per cent. A rebound of 5.2 per cent is expected in 2021.\"\nHamilton's GDP is set to decline by 3.2 per cent this year but will jump by 6 per cent and kick off a steady and strong resurgence \u2014 as long as the pandemic continues to become less of a threat and there isn't another set of shutdowns.\n\"When economic activity contracts so swiftly, on the other side of it you will have a stronger rebound,\" Crawford said.\nHe added Hamilton was in a great economic position before the pandemic, which has softened the impact.\nThe city is also planning an economic recovery task force to deal with the aftermath of COVID-19.\nBy summer, if the virus hasn't rebounded, Crawford thinks people will begin spending more as businesses open up and restrictions fade away.\n\"If cities like Hamilton, which have seen very strong population growth, which do have a strong and vibrant housing market, which do benefit from high-paying jobs \u2026\u00a0can just get through this lockdown period and successfully navigate the re-opening hopefully we can all put this in our rearview mirror and start the recovery in mid-summer moving on into the fall.\"\n"}, {"author": "Peter Armstrong", "title": "Why are stock markets soaring amid so much uncertainty?", "description": "Despite gloomy forecasts and slow growth, it doesn't take much to spur investors", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-market-trump-uncertainty-1.5347006", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4795916.1535029348!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/frontpagenationalbullmarket.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 05, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-11-05T09:00:00.792Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "All three major U.S. stock market indexes hit record levels to start the week.

Spend your money well!\"\nBut there's something of a paradox at play. In spite of Trump's enthusiasm, most forecasts remain gloomy. Uncertainty still dominates the global landscape. Global growth has slowed.\nYet\u00a0it doesn't seem to take much more than a hint of good news to spur investors.\nFor example, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had said early on Monday that trade talks with China have \"come very far along.\"\u00a0It was\u00a0a vague statement and made no allusion that anything is final. It was\u00a0also not the first time investors have heard that sort of thing from either the U.S. administration or the Chinese. Still, that sliver of positivity helped drive\u00a0up markets around the world.\u00a0\n\"It is fascinating to see equity investors, like Pavlov's dog, respond over and over again to the same piece of news,\" David\u00a0Rosenberg, chief economist at the investment firm Gluskin Sheff\u00a0wrote in a letter to clients.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, one of the biggest forces in global economics right now is uncertainty \u2014 over the state of the U.S.-China trade war, over a slowing global economy. China recently posted its lowest\u00a0quarterly growth in 26 years. Europe is struggling too.\u00a0And some of the gloomiest signals are coming from bond markets around the world.\nBank of Nova Scotia's deputy chief economist Brett House says \"erratic policy from the White House\" has weighed on growth. So,\u00a0even a small step toward removing some of that uncertainty, like Ross's comment about China,\u00a0is bound to drive up stocks.\n\"While it doesn't roll back\u00a0much of the damage that's been done,\" he says. \"It takes some of the uncertainty on the forward outlook away.\"\nHouse says all those unknowns have\u00a0shaved as much as 0.75 per cent off U.S. GDP growth.\u00a0\nAnd it's weighed on stock market returns as well. The Dow and the S&P have made notorious\u00a0gains since Trump won the presidency. It's part of the longest bull run in history. But those gains levelled off over the past two years. At the beginning of October, the S&P stood about where it had in January\u00a02018. The more recent highs have broken through that plateau, but there just doesn't seem to be as much wind in the sails of optimism any more.\nRosenberg points out that indexes like the Dow and the S&P which trade in larger, more globally oriented companies are making gains. But indexes that cater to smaller companies aren't doing as well.\nRosenberg mused whether those bigger companies are doing better because they benefit from a perception of a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions, while indexes more tied to the domestic U.S. economy aren't gaining nearly as much.\u00a0He says the Russel\u00a02000 is still nine per cent\u00a0off its all-time high.\n\"The [smaller companies]\u00a0derive 79% of their revenue from the U.S. economy,\" he wrote. \"Q4 GDP estimates now show a US economy sputtering\u00a0and catching down\u00a0to the rest of the world.\"\nThe other major factor here is the cost of money.\u00a0\n\"The vast majority of the worlds' major central banks [are]\u00a0lowering interest rates and making money even cheaper,\" said House, at Scotiabank.\u00a0\"That provides a further lift to real economic activity\"\nBut, House adds, it also means the alternative to investing in\u00a0stocks doesn't\u00a0look terribly attractive to investors.\nUsually, the bond market acts as a sort of safe haven for investors worried about risk. In North America, bond yields are at historically low levels. Worldwide, the bond market is increasingly dominated by bonds with a negative yield. Instead of paying investors a small amount, negative yielding bonds actually charge investors for the privilege of investing.\u00a0\nRight now the amount of bonds with a negative yield has ballooned to a record $15 trillion worldwide. That's a whole lot of money very worried about the future.\nSo stock markets and bond markets are telling us dramatically different things about the economy right now. There's nothing inherently wrong with them sending different signals. But they won't remain at odds for ever. Eventually, either the optimistic stock market or the deeply troubled bond market will be proven right.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Rising home prices encourage consumers to borrow and spend, giving economy a boost", "description": "Bank of Canada study analyzes spending triggered by borrowing against the house", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/home-price-heloc-spending-1.5291558", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5291618.1569007249!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedbudget-renos-20090128-topix.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 20, 2019 2:30 PM ET", "2019-09-20T19:59:08.012Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As Canadian home prices rose from 2014 to 2017, many households tapped the growing value in their homes for other spending, according to study by Bank of Canada\u00a0economists.\nAbout two million households used home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), but another 380,000 got mortgage financing to raise equity, taking advantage of interest rates that fell in 2015, the researchers say in an analysis released Friday.\nThat led to an increase of 0.5 per cent in GDP annually because of increased spending, proving the importance of home values to boost consumption and renovation spending, according to researcher Anson Ho.\n\"Total equity extraction peaked at $89 billion in 2017. Of this, $49 billion was through HELOCs and $40 billion through mortgage refinancing,\" the study found.\nIt's generally been a good thing for the economy. Household spending would have been materially lower without equity extraction, the researchers say.\nAbout 25 per cent of the spending went to home renovations and another quarter went to consumption of other big-ticket items, including cars and furniture. Only about 28 per cent went to debt consolidation, with another 22 per cent going to investments.\nThe study found household spending tends to rise with home prices. Canadians find it easier to borrow against their homes as values rise.\nIn 2017, household spending jumped 3.5 per cent, while house prices rose an average of 13 per cent across the country.\nStarting in 2015, Albertans were big on tapping HELOCs and refinancing mortgages to tide them over the drop in oil prices.\nConversely, house prices stalled or fell in 2018 and stock markets stumbled. That led to a decline in consumer spending and in borrowing against homes. That could have had a negative impact of 0.1 per cent on the GDP, the researchers found.\n\"If this collateral effect is strong, it could leave the economy more vulnerable to adverse events, such as a large decline in house prices,\" the study said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Recession or depression?

Roosevelt]\u00a0got elected that there was really an aggressive policy response.\"\nDecades later in\u00a0Canada, the federal government and Bank of Canada moved quickly to respond to the impact of COVID-19,\u00a0pouring tens of billions into the economy, while slashing interest rates.\nWhile the stimulus will significantly add to Canada's debt load, the financial pain for Canadians could be much worse without it.\nIn terms of the longer term impact on the economy, the so-called \"Great Recession\" of 2008-2009 might be a better point of comparison, even though\u00a0on the surface, the numbers Canada faces\u00a0right now are much worse.\nCanada's economy went into recession in 2009, and contracted by 3.3 per cent over a nine month period.\nThat\u00a0number is a much smaller contraction than we are likely to\u00a0see this spring, but in 2009 it was stretched out over the course of nearly a year.\n\"A\u00a0lot of the reason these numbers look so bad on the surface is that we're compressing what would typically take eleven to twelve months to pull down on the economy into a much shorter period,\" said Frances Donald, chief economist at Manulife Investment Management.\n\"So the total extent of the damage on the economy might be similar to 2009 but we're going to go through it much more quickly and for that reason almost every economic figure that we've seen so far and we'll continue to see we'll be quite literally off the charts.\"\nWhatever phrase we use to describe our current downturn is far from the most important question. What does matter is how Canada's economy recovers.\nThe general expectation at the moment is for recovery in the summer, but how strong that recovery will be depends on health measures such as the level of physical distancing still required to fight the pandemic.\nThere is a lot of pent up demand in the economy already.\nFor example,\u00a0people will want to go for dinner or get a haircut after weeks of services being unavailable.\nBut\u00a0there are\u00a0also problems looming which are particular to Canada's economy.\n\"There's another important part of this story which is that Canada, unlike the United States in 2009, did not experience the same sort of pop in their housing bubble in 2009,\" said Manulife's Frances Donald.\nThat overhang of debt could make Canadians less likely to spend in the coming months.\nAs a result, people could\u00a0change their approach toward savings and spending after this crisis, according to researcher David Rosenberg.\n\"Because the one thing that we found out is that nobody had any cash on hand.\u00a0So the old saying about saving up for a rainy day. Well\u00a0all of a sudden, we had not just a rainy day.\u00a0We had a hurricane and there is no cash to draw from.\"\nWritten and produced by Tracy Johnson.

We'll worry about that tomorrow or the next day, or maybe someone believes they'll never have to worry about it. Well,\u00a0for\u00a0me, I'm very worried about it and very concerned.\"\nThe federal government is in no danger of running out of money, but Trevor Tombe, one of Canada's leading authorities on federal aid to have-not provinces like New Brunswick through the equalization program, says Higgs is not wrong to be nervous.\n\"I think the premier may have some legitimate concerns around the size of the equalization program,\" Tombe, an associate professor of economics at the University of Calgary, said in an interview. \"Exactly how the feds balance the debt pressures that they'll be under, you know that's an important thing to think about.\"\u00a0\nExpanding Canadian prosperity\u00a0over the last decade that\u00a0was not matched by economic\u00a0growth inside New Brunswick\u00a0 has triggered\u00a0a windfall of federal aid for the province under Canada's $20.6 billion equalization program.\u00a0\nThe no-strings-attached payments from Ottawa to Fredericton this year to assist with providing basic services will be a record $2.2 billion, up 25.6 per cent in just three\u00a0years.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's the single largest source of funding the New Brunswick government has \u2014 greater than its own collection of personal income or sales tax \u2014 and it has been providing the majority of revenue growth to the province in recent years.\u00a0\nThe $450-million jump in federal aid to New Brunswick over its last three budgets has grown at\u00a0triple the rate of inflation, the largest increase, in percentage terms, of the five equalization-receiving provinces, which also include Quebec, P.E.I., Nova Scotia and Manitoba.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut economic\u00a0turmoil caused by COVID-19 will almost certainly halt those rapid increases in equalization and may well throw them into reverse. according to Tombe.\nThe $20.6-billion equalization pool from which have-not provinces are paid comes from a formula that grows based on growth in the Canadian economy over a three-year rolling average.\u00a0But a significant contraction in the national economy in 2020 could easily overwhelm increases in 2018 and 2019 and trigger the first reduction in the funding pool in 17 years.\n\"The total number of equalization dollars is indexed to the [gross domestic product] growth rate in Canada and 2020 is almost surely going to be a year of some significant contraction,\" said Tombe.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\"If we have a 10-plus per cent contraction in\u00a0GDP in Canada, which is not an unreasonable expectation right now,\u00a0that might be enough to even pull down a three-year average.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nTombe said it is impossible to know where economic growth numbers for 2020 will land, and so the final effect that will have on the equalization pool is speculative, but a $350 million reduction next year is not inconceivable.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis year New Brunswick's share of the pool is 10.7 per cent, so a\u00a0reduction that size would cost New Brunswick $37.6 million in aid, if its economy performs in a similar way to other have-not provinces.\nBut that's if the equalization remains as it is.\nA critical issue, according to Tombe, is the federal government alone is in charge of equalization and if it decides changes are required on the other side of the pandemic to deal with its own elevated debt level, or to accommodate growing demands for inclusion from provinces not covered by the program, anything might\u00a0happen.\n\"I want to emphasize this,\" said Tombe. \"The feds can easily decide not to follow the current formula and can enact an ad hoc change to legislation anytime.\n\"This is a program that is 100 per cent federal and they have full unilateral authority here. And so in principle, there could very well be changes, and there does not need to be any consultations be done.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "A month after Dorian, the Bahamas still needs aid \u2014 but officials say it needs tourists even more", "description": "'If we're going to help those islands rebuild ... people need to visit our country,' says tourism minister", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/trump-s-odds-for-re-election-house-hippos-are-back-empire-strikes-door-bahamas-tourism-after-dorian-more-1.5306553/a-month-after-dorian-the-bahamas-still-needs-aid-but-officials-say-it-needs-tourists-even-more-1.5306557", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5308919.1570219202!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/1167518221.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 04, 2019 5:06 PM ET", "2019-10-04T21:06:17.011Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "As parts of the Bahamas continue cleaning up a month on from Hurricane Dorian, the country's tourism minister says they're still open for business.\nDionisio D'Aguilar says media reports about the hurricane's devastating effects have focused on the Bahamas as a whole, rather than just the two affected islands.\nThat's pushing away travellers and much needed tourism revenue to help support rebuilding efforts, he says.\n\"We're a country based almost exclusively on tourism. Sixty\u00a0per cent of our GDP comes from tourism. It employs two-thirds of the workforce,\" D'Aguilar told Day 6 host Brent Bambury.\n\"If we're going to help those islands rebuild and help those individuals impacted to rebuild their lives, people need to visit our country and come here and have a vacation.\"\nThe Bahamas are made up of 700 islands spread out across 1,000 kilometres from north to south. When Hurricane Dorian ripped through the area in early September, only the Grand Bahama and Abaco islands were hit.\nThe storm levelled homes and businesses, causing an estimated $7 billion US in property damage. A temporary death toll sits at 56, and nearly 600 people remain missing.\nAs both islands slowly recover, D'Aguilar says that visitors can help speed up recovery by staying at the country's many resorts.\n\"By coming to our country and experiencing that, you are indirectly helping those people that have been impacted by the storm,\" he said.\nCarmel Churchill, a lifelong resident of Grand Bahama Island, president of Doncar Management Services, a company that provides marketing consultant services for the Grand Bahama Island Tourism Board,\u00a0says that the island is slowly coming back online.\nPower has been turned back on for 80 per cent of the island, she says, and water is running, though it is not yet safe to drink.\nChurchill, who lost her own home due to flooding from the hurricane, agrees that a return of the country's main industry is crucial to helping residents.\u00a0\n\"There's basically no tourists here at all,\" she told Day 6.\u00a0\"For the remaining islands in the Bahamas, we understand that their numbers have dropped off tremendously because people feel that all of the Bahamas was affected.\"\nLast month, in an effort to get tourists travelling down south, she promoted her home island at a Detroit trade show.\u00a0\n\"Those tax dollars are going to mean a lot to us,\" Churchill told Day 6.\u00a0\nFundraisers and crowdfunding programs have also been providing support to the affected islands, she said.\nAid packages, including building supplies, that have made their way to the islands are appreciated, Churchill says. But money is ultimately what's needed to rebuild, she says.\n\"It's great that we receive building supplies, however, we are going to need people to physically do the work to get people back in their homes,\" she said.\nD'Aguilar says that despite Dorian's devastating effects on the Bahamas, the country's tourism sector has recovered from hard times before.\n\"We have travel advisories, we have storms, we have many things that impact the tourism industry, not only in the Bahamas but throughout the Caribbean,\" he said.\n\"But what we find is over time these memories fade and people decide, 'OK, I want to go on a holiday in the Caribbean, specifically I want to come to the Bahamas,' and it bounces back very quickly.\"\nAs the Atlantic hurricane season continues through the fall, the MP says he's \"optimistic\" that the Bahamas will be spared another serious weather event.\u00a0\n\"We've had our fair share,\" he said.\u00a0\nTo hear the full interview with\u00a0Dionisio D'Aguilar, download our podcast or click Listen above.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/a-month-after-dorian-the-bahamas-still-needs-aid-but-officials-say-it-needs-tourists-even-more-1.5309524", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Alex Soloducha", "title": "Many Sask. restaurants might permanently close due to COVID-19", "description": "Owner of two Regina restaurants says business is down 90%", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/many-sask-restaurants-might-permanently-close-due-to-covid-19-1.5560661", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5560689.1588896405!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tony-yang.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 07, 2020 7:03 PM CT", "2020-05-08T01:03:50.509Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Many Saskatchewan restaurants have temporarily closed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

O'Toole\u00a0is suggesting a government led by him would entirely eliminate oil imports from outside of North America.\nMacKay\u00a0said a government led by him would\u00a0direct Canadian trade commissioners to promote natural resources products in countries where \"they are under attack by environmental activists.\"\nBut both leadership candidates have offered some new ideas to bolster an economy on the ropes.\nMacKay and O'Toole are pitching plans to restore Canada's manufacturing base, with promises to build domestic capacity for making medical equipment so that Canada will be self-sufficient if it's hit with another pandemic.\nCanada has relied on China and the U.S. throughout the pandemic for masks and ventilators.\nO'Toole said Canada needs domestic supplies of these goods so we \"no longer need to rely on supply chains stretching to China to supply critical life-saving needs in future emergencies.\"\nThe manufacturing sector in Ontario has lost some 200,000\u00a0jobs in the last 15 years,\u00a0thanks to new technologies and operations moving offshore.\nMacKay said a mix of tax cuts \u2014 such as a 100 per cent capital cost allowance write-off\u00a0for equipment purchases \u2014 and programs to retrain\u00a0workers for technologically advanced factories will help a manufacturing sector\u00a0that was once the economic bedrock of the country's largest province.\nMacKay, a former defence minister, is also promising to spend much more on the military \u2014 and get Canada to the 2 per cent of GDP spending goal\u00a0set by NATO \u2014 something he said would benefit\u00a0the aerospace, defence and technology industries.\nO'Toole is proposing\u00a0a \"new hire incentive\"\u00a0which would reduce the employment insurance premiums that small- and medium-sized businesses pay if they add new workers.\nO'Toole, a former veterans affairs ministers, said he\u00a0wants Canada to become self-sufficient in food production as well. He's\u00a0promising \"a\u00a0program to build clusters of greenhouses\" across the country to grow crops year round.\nThe two men are also taking a hard line on China's involvement in the Canadian economy, with promises to strengthen foreign investment\u00a0reviews to keep \"state-owned entities from non-free countries\"\u00a0from buying Canadian companies and resources.\u00a0(O'Toole\u00a0said such investments could get a green light if\u00a0\"there is a compelling reason to approve.\")\nBoth have said they will keep Huawei, the Chinese tech giant with close ties to the Communist regime in China, out of Canada's 5G network.\nBoth candidates also promise to tackle\u00a0a deficit that has soared to well over $260 billion this year.\nMacKay is promising to rein in the size of the federal government and put \"Canada on a path to return to balanced budgets.\" O'Toole is vowing to bringing the budget to balance \"on a prudent timeline\" through an ordered \"step down\" of COVID-19 measures that have caused the deficit to balloon.\nMacKay's plan was criticized by Ken Boessenkool, a former campaign strategist for Stephen Harper, for offering little in the way of support\u00a0for families who will be looking to rebuild their finances after the pandemic ends.\n\"Not a single word about childcare or helping families cope with the post-COVID recession? Nothing at all? Because without a family recovery plan, you don't have an economic recovery plan,\"\u00a0he tweeted after MacKay released his plan.\nThe pandemic has triggered what some are describing as a\u00a0\"she-session\" \u2014 a term coined by labour economist Armine Yalnizyan to describe the pandemic's disproportionate economic effects on women in the service sectors.\nWith schools and child care centres shuttered, returning to work is a lot harder for women with children than it is for most men.\nO'Toole, who released his plan a day after MacKay\u00a0did,\u00a0mentions support for families with children. He is proposing a \"family action plan\" which would convert the existing child care expense deduction to a refundable tax credit.\nUnder his plan, families would get a refundable tax credit for up to $16,000 for child care expenses for children up to six years old,\u00a0and $10,000 for children aged 7 to 17 (the current limits are $8,000 and $5,000, respectively).\nThe federal government hasn't yet proposed any new initiatives to jump-start the economy \u2014 its focus has been on managing a pandemic that is still very much alive \u2014 but it has asked the private sector to suggest \"big ideas\" to help the Canadian economy bounce back.\nThe government recently posted a $3.75 million contract on its procurement website asking firms to put together\u00a0plans for \"economic stabilization and resiliency.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Sonia Furstenau announces she's running for leader of B.C.

But, as a group, the board was comfortable describing its 2019 forecast for Alberta as a \"mild recession,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"The whole year is a slight contraction and so, yes, we would define that as a recession.\"\nConstruction and drilling will be \"hit the hardest\" this year, the report says, with expected declines of 10.4 per cent and 30.3 per cent, respectively.\n\"Both declines are in large part due to the position of companies in the oil and gas sector regarding the uncertainty regarding pipelines,\" it adds.\nIn particular, the report highlights the latest obstacle for the Enbridge Line 3 pipeline. In June, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled that state regulators must conduct a further review of the project because its environmental impact statement didn't address the possibility of an oil spill into the Lake Superior watershed.\nThe \"only chance of additional capacity being built,\" the report says, depends on whether a $3.7-billion government rail contract \"is picked up by the private sector.\"\u00a0\nThe previous NDP government contracted CP and CN Rail to move crude by rail, in the absence of pipeline expansion, but the new UCP government has cancelled those deals and is working to move them to the private sector.\u00a0\nIf there's a silver lining to the province's economic forecast, the Conference Board says job growth will continue in 2019, albeit at a subdued pace.\n\"Labour markets will feel the impact of the contraction in real GDP growth, but there will still be job creation,\" the report says.\nThat's due in part to the construction of new petrochemical complexes, which the report says will add \"fire power to Alberta's economic engine despite its energy sector being clouded with uncertainty.\"\nBecause of job-cutting in the oil and gas sector during the 2015-16 recession, the Conference Board notes, many major companies are now lean and highly productive.\n\"With much of the turmoil concentrated in the energy sector,\u00a0where output per worker has sky-rocketed in recent years ... the number of layoffs in the energy sector [in 2019] will not be significant.\"\nOverall, Antunes expects little change in the province's unemployment rate through the end of 2019.\n\"We have seen a bit of a rebound in some areas in the province that has allowed, essentially, employment to stabilize,\" he said.\nThe report forecasts that Alberta's economy will return to growth in 2020, with a two per cent expansion of GDP.

Any step away from the brink is good for everyone.\nMany were worried about the impact of the next round of tariffs, which\u00a0would have hit American consumers just ahead of Christmas.\nThe now-cancelled tariffs would have targeted Chinese-made goods including\u00a0smartphones, clothing and toys.\nSal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO, says the partial deal means those new tariffs are off the table.\nBut more surprising, he says, the agreement will cut existing tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese imports. It will\u00a0roll back the tariff rate imposed in September on items ranging from televisions to\u00a0bed linens.\n\"The rollbacks, if realized,\u00a0could revive business sentiment and add a couple of tenths to U.S. GDP growth next year,\" Guatieri said in a note to clients. \"At the very least, the de-escalation in\u00a0trade\u00a0tensions, if sustained, would shift the economic risks to the upside.\"\nIn return for the elimination of tariffs,\u00a0China has promised to buy large quantities of U.S. soybeans, poultry and other agricultural products.\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u00a0says the Chinese have agreed to buy $50 billion\u00a0worth.\n\"And I say, affectionately, the farmers are going to have to go out and buy much larger tractors, because it means a lot of business, a tremendous amount of business,\" Trump told reporters.\nMarkets went up Friday on the news of the\u00a0agreement. But they did the same thing last week and last month when negotiators said a deal was coming.\nRosenberg isn't sure investors fully understand just how limited\u00a0this agreement is.\nThe core of the U.S.-China dispute is over what the Americans consider unfair subsidies for Chinese industries and the need for stiffer protections for\u00a0intellectual property and against currency manipulation.\nThe Phase 1 deal addresses none of those issues.\nIn a note to clients, Rosenberg says Phase 1 deals with a \"tiny portion of issues,\" while the much more important ones, such as subsidies and technology transfers, \"have been left for another date.\"\nThat skepticism didn't keep\u00a0Trump from hailing the agreement as a\u00a0\"phenomenal deal.\"\n\"This is a very large deal,\" he\u00a0told reporters at the White House. \"The China deal. It covers tremendous manufacturing, farming, a lot of rules, regulations, a lot of things are covered. It's a Phase 1\u00a0deal, but a lot of big things are covered.\"\nWe have agreed to a very large Phase One Deal with China. They have agreed to many structural changes and massive purchases of Agricultural Product, Energy, and Manufactured Goods, plus much more. The 25% Tariffs will remain as is, with 7 1/2% put on much of the remainder....\nBut even Trump admits some of the biggest blocks of tariffs\u00a0remain in place.\n\"The tariffs will largely remain at 25 per cent on $250 billion,\" he\u00a0said. \"And we'll use them for future negotiations on the Phase 2 deal, because China would like to see the tariffs off.\"\nThe partial deal is\u00a0Trump's\u00a0second trade victory of the week.\u00a0On Tuesday, Canadian, American and Mexican negotiators finally agreed to a revised deal to replace NAFTA.\nAnd in the U.K. election this week, the\u00a0Conservatives secured a majority government, which should dramatically reduce the chances of a no-deal Brexit.\nThe possibility of Britain leaving the E.U. without a formal divorce agreement\u00a0has raised serious concerns and uncertainty about how trade might\u00a0be affected in Europe.\nNo one knows exactly how the U.K.'s departure from the EU\u00a0will proceed, but with the election result, at least some of the uncertainty seems to have been\u00a0removed.\nFor the first time in a long time, the news about global trade isn't a total disaster.

The Canadian health care system has, so far, held up much better than the system in the United States.\nBut this pandemic also showed us where we're failing as a country \u2014 in particular,\u00a0how\u00a0we care for the oldest\u00a0and most vulnerable among us.\n\"I recognize the system is broken and we are going to fix the system,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said this week.\nOther issues have come to the fore over the last month and a half: the importance of child care, the need for better and faster health and economic data, the limited fiscal capacity of some provinces, the fragility of international supply lines.\u00a0But the most glaring problem to emerge is the one in our long-term care centres.\nIn Ontario, 573 residents of long-term care facilities\u00a0have died \u2014 that's 75 per cent of the province's death toll. In Quebec, 1,045 residents have died \u2014 nearly 80 per cent of the provincial total.\n\"I think the tragedy of COVID-19 is that it's exposed a number of the weaknesses that have been long-standing,\" said Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Mount Sinai hospital and the University Health Network Hospitals in Toronto.\nGovernments in Canada have responded to the immediate crisis with a number of short-term measures.\u00a0The government of British Columbia took over staffing for some nursing homes around Vancouver \u2014\u00a0in part\u00a0to track workers who may be employed at more than one facility\u00a0and can become vectors for the virus\u00a0as a result.\nCaregivers are often not well paid, Sinha says,\u00a0which can lead them to take jobs at more than one centre.\u00a0Both B.C. and Quebec have increased pay for front-line workers, a measure the federal government has said it is willing to support. Both Quebec and Ontario have asked the federal government to task the Canadian military to help with staffing shortages.\n\"But this is not a long-term solution,\" Trudeau said Thursday. \"In Canada, we shouldn't have soldiers taking care of seniors.\"\n\"We've never funded the system with the same consideration that we fund the hospital sector,\" Dr.\u00a0Sinha\u00a0said.\nDr. Sinha notes that COVID-19 is a new and fast-moving disease \u2014 a significant challenge under any circumstances \u2014 and containment measures have been implemented gradually.\nFiguring out\u00a0how so many residents of long-term care facilities lost their lives to the pandemic\u00a0will involve\u00a0examining many possible factors. But last fall, Dr. Sinha co-authored a report that identified a number of issues with the way care is delivered in this country \u2014 issues that now seem like ripe targets for reform.\nLong-term care was not enshrined in the Canada Health Act, the federal legislation\u00a0that sets out the parameters of public medicare. Existing long-term care services are a patchwork of public and private options.\nDemands on providers are increasing, but front-line workers have been, in the words of that report,\u00a0\"underappreciated, overworked\u00a0and underpaid.\" Unpaid caregivers \u2014 family members and friends who take care of loved ones \u2014 are struggling with their own burdens.\nAs a share of GDP, Canada's annual public spending on long-term care \u2014 approximately $24 billion \u2014 is below the average of 15 other\u00a0OECD countries that report long-term care expenditures. Countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Norway spend twice as much.\nCanada also devotes a much higher percentage of its spending to facilities like nursing homes than it does to community-based care: 87 per cent versus\u00a013 per cent. In Denmark, the ratio is almost the reverse: 64 per cent of public spending there goes to home care, while 36 per cent goes to designated facilities.\nHealth care delivery is a provincial responsibility, but the federal government plays a significant role in funding, assisting and overseeing those services.\nA report by the Canadian Institute for Health Information in 2017 estimated that 22 per cent of seniors in nursing homes might be able to live at home \u2014 and recent federal interventions have been aimed at making that easier.\nIn 2015, the Conservative government introduced a tax credit to provide as much as $1,500 toward renovations to make a home more accessible for seniors. In 2017, the Liberal government introduced a caregiver benefit through employment insurance and committed $6 billion over ten years to help provinces improve home-care services.\nBut overall health spending remains a point of friction between the federal and provincial governments. Between 2004 and 2016, the federal transfer for health care increased at an annual rate of 6 per cent. Since 2017, the annual increase has been tied to GDP, with a minimum rate of 3 per cent.\nIn 2018-2019, the Canada Health Transfer grew by 3.9 per cent. Last fall, the provinces renewed their demand that the annual increase be set at 5.2 per cent.\nThat debate likely will play a big part in any discussions about the future of long-term care in Canada. But Dr. Sinha said there's\u00a0an opportunity here for the federal government to provide leadership and direction.\nHealth crises in Canada have led to changes in public policy before. The federal Department of Health was created in the aftermath of the Spanish flu epidemic in 1919. This week, federal ministers at least seemed willing to acknowledge a need to do something.\n\"I think there should be a long term national project to examine long term care homes and how we can better support [them] at every level of government, to make sure people who are living there are protected and can live their lives in dignity and safety,\" Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Thursday.\nIn the wake of so much death, a renewed focus on long-term care \u2014 and public\u00a0demands for action \u2014 might force politicians to stick to such commitments.\n\"We've had [more than] a thousand older people die,\" Dr. Sinha said. \"And if that's not a call to action, to fundamentally reform the entire way our country provides long-term care, then I don't know what is.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jason Proctor", "title": "'We make zero': How COVID-19 is likely to impact B.C.'s economy", "description": "Extent of damage largely dependent on the time it takes to contain the virus, economists say", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/economy-british-columbia-covid-1.5527995", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5528046.1586455242!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/gabriel-stratulat.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 12, 2020 1:00 AM PT", "2020-04-12T08:00:00.145Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of The COVID Economy, a CBC News series looking at how the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic is affecting jobs, manufacturing and business in regions across Canada.\nThere are the statistics, graphs and charts that provide a snapshot of B.C.'s economy in the face of COVID-19. And then there's Gabriel Stratulat's day-timer.\nAt the start of March, the Vancouver-based\u00a0tour guide had 22 bookings for the summer. He was banking on at least 80 more by the end of August.\nToday, he says, they're all cancelled.\u00a0\n\"And of course, because of the travelling ban, no one will come to Vancouver. So this is how bad we are affected,\" said Stratulat, who runs a private tour company called BC Grand Tours.\n\"From making $60,000 to $70,000 to $100,000\u00a0a year, we make zero. Not $1,000\u00a0\u2014\u00a0zero. So this is how we are affected.\"\nSurveying the months and possibly the years ahead, at the moment, Stratulat says\u00a0he's depressed.\nHe's not alone.\nThe tourism sector is just one of the drivers of a B.C. economy that's been quickly\u00a0ravaged by the novel coronavirus, as the pandemic has shuttered borders, disrupted supply chains and thrown health-care systems into chaos as the entire world looks to clamp down on its spread.\nFrom forestry and\u00a0film, to mining and manufacturing, economists say it's hard to predict the depth of the damage or the length of the time it will take for the province to recover.\nThat's if it can be predicted at all.\n\"This is totally unprecedented, so thinking about it really requires opening one's mind and being creative and flexible,\" said\u00a0Ken Peacock, chief economist for the Business Council of British Columbia.\n\"Traditional models just are not calibrated to come up with estimates and to model what's going on.\"\nAccording to Statistics Canada, B.C.'s gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 the total value of goods and services produced in the province annually \u2014 was around $264\u00a0billion in 2018.\nExperts across the board say determining by just how much COVID-19 may shrink that figure is,\u00a0at this point, too difficult; no one can say for certain\u00a0how long the measures needed to combat the virus will be in place.\nProvincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has hinted that even when restrictions start lifting, some measure of physical distancing will still be needed to keep the disease in check.\nBut what will that mean in terms of going to the restaurants, bars and hotels that employed nearly 200,000 people in the province in 2018?\nWill universities still be able to open their doors to the international students who provide a good portion of their funding?\u00a0\nAnd will the borders be open for the export of the billions of dollars worth of forestry and industrial products that B.C. needs to sell?\nAs Peacock explains, the B.C. economy is primarily driven by the goods and services sold to markets outside the province. That brings money into B.C., with\u00a0other domestic businesses in turn providing\u00a0goods and services to those exporters.\nNatural resources \u2014 forestry, the mining sector and related products like aluminum \u2014 have traditionally been the keystone of the province's economy. But the real estate, housing and leasing markets are also huge generators of GDP, as is the construction industry.\nAnd in recent years, as the forestry sector in particular has lagged, other sectors, like tourism, have expanded.\nB.C.'s tourism industry generated $20.5 billion in revenue in 2018.\nAccording to WorkBC, the sector employs about 160,000 people, mostly through\u00a0locally owned small- and medium-sized businesses like the one Stratulat has been building since 2014.\nOriginally from Romania, Stratulat left a career as a mechanical engineer behind to become a tour guide. He has steadily developed a solid reputation through both his own company\u00a0and\u00a0ToursByLocals, a platform that connects tourists and guides, which was\u00a0rated one of B.C.'s top\u00a0employers last year.\nA lot of his business comes through cruise ship passengers wanting to spend a few hours \u2014 and a few hundred dollars\u00a0\u2014 in the Vancouver area.\nBut all that has\u00a0currently dried up, and with it, the money Stratulat needs to pay off the two Mercedes vans he uses to whisk travellers off to picturesque places, like Whistler, Banff, Victoria and Jasper.\n\"I have huge payments and, actually,\u00a0I cannot make the payments,\" said Stratulat.\u00a0\"Luckily, my wife works, so she pays the mortgage. But for me, I have zero income and it's very emotional for me. I might lose everything.\"\nPeacock and his business council have come up with predictions\u00a0around the impact of COVID-19\u00a0on the B.C. economy based on two different scenarios.\nThe first would see the economy contract by about seven per cent in 2020, based on a return to some kind of normal this summer. But the second would involve an 11 per cent decline based on longer closures, widespread job losses and a deep global recession.\nBy contrast, Bryan Yu, deputy chief economist with Central 1 Credit Union, says he's expecting B.C.'s economy to shrink by about 3.5\u00a0per cent for the year.\nThat's still a lot, but Yu says the province has some large-scale infrastructure projects\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like the Site C dam and the development of LNG Canada's liquefied natural gas project in Kitimat\u00a0\u2014 that could provide a buffer for some of the loss.\nHe also points to recent diversification of the economy that has seen growth in the high tech and agricultural industries.\nYu further expects unemployment to rise to between eight and 10 per cent in 2020. \"But in our view, a lot of this is expected to be temporary,\" he said.\nUnder both of Peacock's scenarios, the hardest hit sectors are expected to be arts, entertainment and recreation, and accommodation and food services. And construction, manufacturing and wholesale trade can all still expect to contract by double digits.\nSo why can't British Columbians \u2014 and Canadians in general \u2014 put the economy on some kind of a hold while they weather the COVID-19\u00a0storm?\nEven if the question sounds naive, both Peacock and Yu say it's one a lot of people have been asking.\nThey both say the federal and provincial governments have effectively been trying to hit the pause button by providing tens of billions of dollars in money to help out-of-work Canadians and businesses\u00a0bridge the gap.\nBut this is where a time element comes in.\n\"When you're talking timelines of pausing for a month or two months\u00a0\u2014\u00a0maybe three at the outside\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it's kind of doable,\" said\u00a0Peacock. \"It's another thing to pause for six or seven months: Governments cannot fill the hole that is created by the downturn. They just don't have enough resources.\"\nAnd the longer people are disconnected from their jobs, he says, the more difficult it will become\u00a0for them to re-enter the workforce.\n\"A lot of the businesses that people were hoping to return to may not exist,\" he said.\n\"Then there's the whole question of rent payments and mortgage payments. You can postpone them and delay them, but eventually, you have to pay them back.\"\nAnother part of the COVID-19 economic equation comes down to the way other countries handle the virus.\nAbout half of B.C.'s exports are to the United States, with the rest\u00a0divided\u00a0between China, Japan, the rest of Asia and some other countries. China is slowly reopening to business, but the U.S. faces an uncertain future as far as both its economy and the public health battle\u00a0are concerned.\nIf there's such a thing as a growth industry in this\u00a0pandemic, the Business Council of B.C. is projecting it to be government.\nPeacock's projections estimate the public administration portion of the province's GDP could grow by\u00a0six to nine per cent, depending on the length of the crisis.\nIglika Ivanova, a feminist economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, says she hopes that any tax hawks in favour of shrinking the government will remember the role the province and Ottawa have played in trying to salvage the economy.\nShe also believes British Columbians should ask themselves what kind of an economy they want to see on the other side of the pandemic.\nThat may include things like restructuring a long-term care system that has proven vulnerable to the virus. Or providing better pay to the janitors, health-care aides, delivery drivers, grocery store clerks and other front-line workers whose labour is proving itself priceless amid the storm.\nAnd Ivanova said she believes the province should\u00a0invest\u00a0in renewable energy and green industries intended to withstand future economic shock.\n\"We all know that we have to make an energy transition,\" she said. \"Over the medium to long run, why not kick-start it now that we're going to be likely providing a lot of support to business?\u00a0\u2026 Why not support the kind of business investment that we know is going to benefit us in the long run?\"\nIn the meantime, people like Stratulat can do little more than follow the ever-changing news\u00a0around COVID-19 and hope for the eventual return of their portion of the B.C. economy.\u00a0\n\"If this thing doesn't stop, with all the social distancing and all that, not [until]\u00a0October of this year will people book tours for the next summer,\" he predicts.\nAnd if longer?\n\"It could be\u00a0a year,\u00a0it could be more. I don't know.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Ontario introduces $17B COVID-19 package; more than doubles deficit in fiscal update", "description": "Finance Minister Rod Phillips will table a full budget by Nov. 15", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/2020-fiscal-update-1.5510186", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5510215.1585172272!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fiscal-update-ontario-20200325.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 25, 2020 5:47 PM ET", "2020-03-25T21:47:34.232Z"], "source": null, "content": "Ontario introduced a $17-billion package Wednesday to support the province through the COVID-19 outbreak, including an influx of cash for the health sector, direct payments to parents\u00a0and tax breaks for businesses.\nFinance Minister Rod Phillips said the government is confident that every dollar invested through the plan that saves a life or a job is a dollar well spent.\n\"COVID-19 is an extraordinary threat to the health and economy of Ontario \u2014\u00a0the greatest we've faced in my lifetime \u2014 and it demands an extraordinary response from all levels of government and civil society because we're all in this together,\" he said while tabling the emergency one-year fiscal outlook.\nHow COVID-19 blew up the Doug Ford government's budget\nThe spending boost includes a $1-billion COVID-19 contingency fund, nearly $1 billion more for hospitals, and more personal protective equipment for front-line workers.\nMeasures also include a one-time payment for parents of $200 per child 12 years old and under, doubling payments for low-income seniors and suspending student loan payments for six months.\nThe plan includes both $7 billion in new spending and $10 billion in tax and other deferrals.

But underpinning all of the budget numbers is one key assumption: that the province's economy will not contract overall in the coming year \u2014an assumption that could prove quite wrong.\u00a0\n\"The COVID-19 outbreak has had a negative impact on the global, Canadian and Ontario economies,\" says the document, stating the obvious. \"The severity of the economic impact will depend on how widespread the outbreak becomes and how long it lasts.\"\u00a0\nIn other words, it's impossible to forecast what will happen to Ontario's economy over the next year, and the ripple effect on government revenues. But the government's spending plan must be based on forecasts, so the Ministry of Finance makes this one: that the province's GDP will neither grow nor shrink in 2020-21, but stay stagnant.\u00a0\nA senior finance ministry official says that forecast was made last week, and was pegged slightly below the average growth rate predicted by private sector economists at that time. But a week is an eternity in the rapid-fire spread of COVID-19, and that forecast is already looking rosy.\u00a0\nThe major banks have issued new updates in the past few days, all predicting economic contraction in 2020.\u00a0\nOn Wednesday, Scotiabank revised downward its forecast for Ontario, predicting the province's economy will shrink by 5.6 per cent in 2020. Also Wednesday, TD issued a new forecast for the Canadian economy, a 4.2 per cent retraction. RBC's latest forecast came on Tuesday, calling for a 2.5 per cent drop in Canada's GDP.\u00a0\nHere's the\u00a0problem for Ontario's budget: its revenue predictions are already based on outdated forecasts.\u00a0\nSome of the most optimistic assumptions in the fiscal plan are that COVID-19 will do relatively little to reduce government revenues in the coming year, compared with 2019-20.\nThe fiscal update forecasts a 0.8 per cent drop in personal income tax revenues, meaning just $300 million less in provincial coffers, despite the widespread layoffs announced in the past few weeks.\nThe government is predicting a 1.3 per cent drop in corporate tax revenue, just a $200 million hit to the treasury.\u00a0\nIf the economy does contract in 2020, those tax revenues could be billions less, making the deficit far higher than the $20 billion already forecast.\u00a0\nOntario is clearly hoping the economic hit from COVID-19 will be a very short, albeit sharp, shock, to be followed by a big rebound as non-essential businesses fire up again, driven by pent-up demand from consumers freed from the constraints of social distancing.\u00a0\nThere is also reason to believe that measures from the Bank of Canada, as well as Ottawa's $107\u00a0billion COVID-19 rescue package, will keep the bottom from falling out.\u00a0\nFinally, Ontario does have a strong, diversified economy when it isn't locked down by a virus, and it is well positioned to bounce back once the worst of the pandemic\u00a0is over. \u00a0\nBut the impact on provincial finances won't be clear for months. In the next two years, it will be fascinating to watch how the PC government deals with running a deficit that is far larger than Doug Ford likely ever dreamed would exist even under a spendthrift Liberal government.\u00a0\nOntario 2020-21 spending plan highlights\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Budget watchdog slashes economic growth projections, partly blames coronavirus", "description": "Coronavirus could shave 0.3% off Canada's first quarter economic-growth, says PBO", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pbo-economy-slowed-sharply-1.5463217", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5463250.1581630400!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-outbreak.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 13, 2020 4:54 PM ET", "2020-02-13T22:25:28.375Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada's economy slowed \"sharply\" in the final quarter of 2019, the parliamentary budget office said Thursday in its February economic and fiscal report.\nAnd the new coronavirus outbreak, combined with lower-than-expected business spending, will likely push economic growth lower in the first quarter of 2020, the PBO projected.\n\"We expect real GDP to grow by 1.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2020,\" on an annual basis, the report said.\n\"While some of the impact of the disruptions is expected to be reversed, we project slower growth due in part to the coronavirus and weaker business investment.\"\nThe outbreak, which has directly affected China the most but has also been felt by a number of countries including Canada, could shave 0.3 percentage points off Canada's economic-growth prediction for the beginning quarter of 2020, although the PBO said that was not a certainty.\n\"Estimates of the overall impact of the coronavirus are highly uncertain at this time.\"\nThe country's overall annual growth rate dropped to an annualized 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, the PBO said, a projection that was \"significantly weaker\" than the 1.6 per cent growth rate predicted in its fall report.\nParliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux blamed the fourth-quarter weakness mainly on what he described as temporary disruptions in the mining, oil and gas, motor vehicle and rail transportation sectors.\nThe report also predicted the federal budgetary deficit for fiscal year 2019-20 will reach $23.5 billion \u2014 roughly 10 per cent higher than projected in November \u2014 as a result of new government spending announced in the December economic and fiscal update.\n\"An additional $800 million in fiscal developments adds to the budgetary deficit due to higher operating expenses, which are partially offset by stronger revenues,\" the report said.\nThose additional operating expenses were largely the result of higher current service costs for pension and other future benefits that were not factors in the PBO's November report.\n"}, {"author": "Karen McColl", "title": "While Yukon businesses brace for lack of tourism, the pandemic's impact on mining is less clear", "description": "'The economic spinoff of tourism is not to be underestimated,' says territory's wilderness tourism association", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-covid-19-economy-1.5537456", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5537958.1587338519!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/empty-whitehorse.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 21, 2020 2:00 AM CT", "2020-04-21T08:00:00.915Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of\u00a0The COVID Economy,\u00a0a CBC News series looking at how the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic is affecting jobs, manufacturing and business in regions across Canada.\nTourism is everyone's business.\nA sticker with that message, produced some years back,\u00a0can still be seen on the odd bumper in Yukon, invariably covered with some degree of dirt and dust, part and parcel with driving here.\u00a0\nWhile the slogan is not unique to the territory, it's particularly meaningful during the COVID-19 pandemic,\u00a0and not just to tourism operators \u2014 although they, more than some others, are uncomfortably aware of its very real implications.\u00a0\n\"The economic spinoff of tourism is not to be underestimated,\" said Kalin\u00a0Pallett, president of the Wilderness Tourism Association of the Yukon, which represents about 70 adventure operators in the territory.\n\"Everything from from Air North [airline], to the hotels and the restaurants, the taxis, the gift shops, the tour operators themselves. The grocery stores \u2014 the list goes on and on.\"\u00a0\nThat ripple effect extends all the way to things such as\u00a0quilting materials.\nRuth Headley\u00a0at Bear's Paw Quilts in Whitehorse said\u00a0tourists buying northern lights-themed fabrics and other souvenir designs\u00a0make up a good chunk of her summer revenue, when fewer local quilters are buying supplies.\u00a0\nRead other stories in the series:\nTourism and mining are Yukon's two biggest private\u00a0sector industries,\u00a0and while industry insiders say both\u00a0will feel the impacts of the pandemic, the hit to Yukon's tourism industry is already very evident.\nA 2017 business survey report by the Yukon Bureau of Statistics determined that 4.4 per cent of the territory's 2016 GDP,\u00a0about $117 million, was attributable to tourism.\u00a0\nIf the Tourism Industry Association of the Yukon is right about how much cruise ships contribute to that amount, then\u00a0roughly half of those dollars have already flown out the window for this year.\nLast week, when Holland America said it was\u00a0cancelling\u00a0almost all of its Alaska cruises\u00a0for the summer, including all of its excursions into Yukon, Neil Hartling, the chair of the Tourism Industry Association of the Yukon, said that represents a $40 to $60 million loss to the territory's\u00a0economy.\u00a0\nHartling\u00a0said it's also foretelling of more hits coming to Yukon's tourism industry, especially as people look to cut spending amid the economic downturn.\n\"Tourism is a luxury and it's one of the first things that you can easily shed from your spending,\" he said. \"And that's going to be happening around the world.\"\u00a0\nYukon's summer tourism season, which starts in May, is typically the bread\u00a0and butter of\u00a0many tourism operators.\n\"They've got\u00a0a 90-day window to make 365 days worth of money,\" said Pallett, president of Yukon's\u00a0wilderness tourism association.\nHe said some operators have already decided to throw in the towel for the\u00a02020 season and try to find work elsewhere.\u00a0Others\u00a0are turning their focus to shoulder season operations, in\u00a0late summer and fall.\u00a0\nPallett said the unknown timeline of when COVID-19\u00a0restrictions will lift\u00a0adds\u00a0to the uncertainty.\u00a0\n\"Unlike a retail store or a restaurant that can simply turn on the lights and open the doors and start generating revenue right away, tourism needs longer lead times.\"\nThese challenges come after what the Yukon\u00a0government called a \"banner\" tourism year in 2018 (the year of the most recent tourism report), with records set for the number of visitors and total spending. According to its visitor exit survey, 62 per cent of visitors to the Yukon came from the U.S., about\u00a028 per cent were Canadian and the remaining 10 per cent came from countries other than the U.S.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Yukon Chamber of Mines\u00a0says\u00a0it's too early to know what impact COVID-19 will have on the mining industry, the territory's\u00a0largest private sector employer. In 2018, mining\u00a0and oil and gas development\u00a0made up 5.7 per cent of Yukon's GDP.\u00a0\n\"We could expect to see some slimming of that [mining revenue],\" said Samson Hartland, executive director of the\u00a0chamber. \"Just how much is anybody's guess.\"\u00a0\nYukon has two mines in operation. Victoria Gold, which poured the first gold bar from its Eagle Gold Mine near Mayo in September, said earlier this month it is\u00a0proceeding with its operational ramp-up. It said it expects\u00a0gold production to increase \"substantially\" over the coming months.\nSara McPhee-Knowles, an instructor at\u00a0Yukon College's School of Business and Leadership who holds a PhD in public policy, said the economic downturn\u00a0could have a positive impact on metal prices.\u00a0\n\"In the last recession, in 2008 and 2009, the price of gold went up because investors view it as a safe bet,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf that happens again, she said, it could benefit Yukon.\u00a0\nVictoria Gold continues operations despite a plea made last month by the\u00a0Na-Cho Nyak Dun First Nation in Mayo, asking the\u00a0Yukon government to put a stop to mining and staking in the territory during the COVID-19 pandemic. The First Nation said the\u00a0hundreds of workers rotating in and out of the nearby Eagle mine put the community at risk.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe company responded by saying it is\u00a0taking appropriate precautions\u00a0and following the Yukon government's requirement that all workers entering the territory self-isolate for 14 days at a place other than a mine or camp. Some of those workers are staying at hotels in Whitehorse.\u00a0\nHartland, with the Yukon Chamber of Mines, said keeping communities safe is a priority, but noted the 14-day quarantine requirement could be challenging for the \"dozens and dozens\" of smaller field and exploration programs that take place in the territory every summer.\nHe said work delays and added costs could be a deterrent for companies coming from out of the territory, especially if they were only planning to do a couple of weeks of work.\u00a0\nHartland said one thing that would\u00a0help the mining sector is a relaxation of regulatory requirements in the form of extensions on permitting and consultation deadlines.\u00a0He said the limited capacity of some government offices because of the pandemic could otherwise delay processes and result in a\u00a0slowdown of mining and exploration activities.\nWhen the Yukon government announced a business relief program earlier this month, Economic Development Minister Ranj Pillai, touted it as the\u00a0\"most comprehensive\"\u00a0business relief program in the country to date.\nThe program is for\u00a0businesses that have seen a\u00a0reduction in revenue of at least 30 per cent during the pandemic. It will cover up to $30,000 per month for fixed costs\u00a0including rent, water, sewage, electricity, internet, or insurance.\nThe program was announced after the Whitehorse Chamber of Commerce said only half of the businesses\u00a0it surveyed thought they'd be able to recover from the economic impact of the pandemic.\nAt this time last year, Yukon boasted the highest employment rate in the country. Now, the situation in the territory is anything but rosy, though the number of jobs lost as a result of the\u00a0COVID-19 crisis won't be known for several weeks.\nBecause of Yukon's small population, employment numbers are calculated\u00a0based on a three-month moving average, meaning numbers that reflect the full hit of the pandemic won't start coming out until June.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Alex Brockman", "title": "'We weren't prepared': N.W.T. economy in a battle for survival amid COVID-19 pandemic", "description": "N.W.T. businesses struggle as they wait for more support from federal and territorial governments ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/covid-economy-northwest-territories-1.5536350", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5536392.1587148570!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/one-time-use-fort-good-hope.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 20, 2020 2:00 AM CT", "2020-04-20T08:00:00.559Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of\u00a0The COVID Economy,\u00a0a CBC News series looking at how the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic is affecting jobs, manufacturing and business in regions across Canada.\nAnne Jackson could always count on springtime to bring guests to her bed and breakfast in Fort Good Hope, N.W.T.\u00a0\nThat's the time every year when the territorial government always seemed to send up officials to the fly-in community on the Mackenzie River, about 800 kilometres from Yellowknife. Lawyers, health officials, housing workers, accountants \u2014 they'd arrive in Fort Good Hope like clockwork.\nUsually, they'd stay at Jackson's Bed and Breakfast, where Anne's dad, Wilfred, is quick with a story, a joke or piece of wisdom learned out in the bush, shared over tea or bacon and eggs. Those springtime guests helped sustain the business through the lean seasons.\u00a0\nBut no one is coming this spring.\u00a0\nWith all but the most essential travel and gatherings banned to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Northwest Territories is very nearly locked down. It's starving an already lean\u00a0economy even further\u00a0and it's left many worried about how bad things can get.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It's been slow, and when I say slow, there's nothing, no guests,\" Jackson said. \"We weren't prepared for this.\"\u00a0\nLike business owners across Canada, Jackson is poring over her accounts.

The fear is that if it does, it will affect everybody. That's what's on everybody's mind.\"\u00a0\nSo far, COVID-19 has yet to gain a strong foothold in the Northwest Territories. There have been five confirmed cases and all have been isolated. There is no evidence of community spread at this time.\nBut officials have been aggressive, issuing strict orders that have forced most businesses to close and banned nearly all gatherings of people.\u00a0\n\"It's going to hurt a lot of people,\" said Dave Ramsay, a business consultant in Yellowknife who was\u00a0the Northwest Territories' minister of industry from 2011 to 2015. He estimates up to 50 per cent of businesses won't survive without adequate relief.\u00a0\n\"These are small, medium-sized businesses that can't weather the storm,\" Ramsay said.\u00a0\u00a0\nRead other stories in the series:\nThe economic fundamentals for the Northwest Territories weren't particularly strong before the pandemic.\u00a0\nIts\u00a0$5-billion GDP is driven by\u00a0its three diamond mines and government. Its budding tourism industry, which relies heavily on tourists from Asia, has been shut down. Its\u00a0tax base is small \u2014 about 75 per cent of the government's revenue comes from Ottawa.\n\"We're a ward of the state,\" Ramsay said. \"We have been for some time.\"\nThe mining industry, which already had problems, continues\u00a0but not at full steam.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne mine, Ekati, has shut down and sent its workers home. The other two remain operational but at a limited capacity. They've sent some workers home with pay to protect their remote northern communities from the virus, and are taking on extra costs, such as chartered flights, to bring employees in from southern Canada. It remains unclear whether they are eligible for federal aid.\u00a0\nIf those mines close, either because of health concerns or because of the global economic downturn following the pandemic, Ramsay and others say\u00a0the results could be catastrophic.\u00a0\n\"If we don't have mining here in the N.W.T., we don't have much of an economy,\" Ramsay said.\u00a0\nThough it's difficult to predict how the diamond industry will react to COVID-19, stocks have tumbled and analysts suggest the diamond supply will drop between 10 and 12 per cent next year.\u00a0\nRamsay also serves on the board of directors for Fortune Minerals, a company developing a mine project near Whati, N.W.T., and is already seeing investors shy away.\u00a0\n\"It's almost impossible to raise money out there in the markets,\" he said. \"It was tough before, and you throw a global pandemic in the mix, it becomes really tough.\"\nRamsay's hopeful the territory will convene an economic task force made up of business leaders and former politicians to come up with creative solutions.\nThough the Conference Board of Canada does not yet have an outlook on how COVID-19 will affect the northern economy, it predicts Canada's GDP will contract by 4.3 per cent in 2020. If that number is applied to the Northwest Territories' $5-billion GDP, that translates to a loss of about $250 million.\nIt's not just the diamond mines facing an uncertain future. Northern airlines, which are lifelines to remote communities such as\u00a0Fort Good Hope, all face questions about their long-term viability.\u00a0\nWatch | Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces a $130-million northern relief package:\nThe federal government has announced $8.7 million to help those airlines hire back employees, but it doesn't replace the revenue that will be lost if flights are still grounded during the summer exploration and tourist season.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMichael Miltenberger, a former Northwest Territories finance minister, now runs a consulting business and works with airlines such as\u00a0Air Tindi, which operates medevac, resupply\u00a0and commercial passenger flights between Yellowknife and the territory's smaller communities.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe says what he's seeing now is much worse than the 2008-09 financial crisis.\u00a0\n\"It was one thing in 2008 when money became an issue and credit became an issue,\" he said. \"This is many, many orders of magnitude worse. You've lost your customer base literally overnight.\"\nIn Fort Smith, N.W.T., where Miltenberger lives, nearly all businesses are shuttered: restaurants, hair salons, anything in the service industry.\u00a0\nHe's concerned about how long-term economic hardships and anxiety will affect families, possibly making the territory's well-documented social problems worse as time goes on.\u00a0\nSo far, the Northwest Territories has offered businesses an aid package worth $21.5 million, mostly in waived fees, deferred payments and low-interest loans. That's in addition to existing federal programs and a $130-million northern aid package Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced last week.\u00a0\nFor the most part, the $21.5 million represents money the territory is not taking in, and it's unlikely to have much room to borrow more for future relief. That's because of the federally imposed debt cap. The territory is only able to borrow $30 million before it hits its $1.3-billion limit.\u00a0\nInterested in how the debt cap works? Learn all about it and how it affects government spending.\u00a0\nN.W.T. Industry Minister Katrina Nokleby recognizes that if left too long, the territory's economy may not recover from the coma it's in now. She describes her work as triage,\u00a0as she balances health and safety with the territory's grim economic reality.\u00a0\n\"Triage unfortunately is probably the best word for it,\" Nokleby said. \"Where are the priorities? What are the critical pieces? Where are we going?\u00a0\n\"If we pack up shop right now and bunker everybody down under lock and key, we won't have an economy to come back to.\"\nIn the short term, Nokleby is looking at what businesses can be leveraged to help in the pandemic relief, delivering medical supplies, equipment or personnel. Long-term, she's looking at approved government construction projects to see if they're still safe to go ahead.\u00a0\nAmid these dire predictions, Nokleby does hope whatever the new normal is, will leave the territory more self-sufficient, with a stronger economy than before.\u00a0\nBut to do that, the Northwest Territories' economy needs to survive first.\n"}, {"author": "Liam Britten", "title": "Why B.C. is not rushing toward a 'lockdown' on non-essential businesses", "description": "'Saying lockdown, saying shutdown, is very easy to do but it\u2019s difficult in reality,' premier says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-covid-19-coronavirus-1.5507657", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5507662.1585016230!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-vancouver-empty-streets.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 23, 2020 7:23 PM PT", "2020-03-24T02:23:18.705Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Premier John Horgan\u00a0told\u00a0reporters Monday that shuttering non-essential businesses during the coronavirus crisis was not an approach he preferred.\nAfter unveiling plans for a $5-billion relief package, Horgan was asked whether he was considering an order to close non-essential businesses, a course taken by Ontario and the United Kingdom on Monday to reduce human contact and slow the spread of the disease.\n\"That, in my opinion, would create more confusion, rather than less,\" Horgan said. \"Saying lockdown, saying shutdown, is very easy to do but it's difficult in reality.\"\nHorgan said the government's efforts are focused on going sector by sector to make sure critical workers are in place in areas like health care, child care and retail as the crisis drags on.\nAnother focus is ensuring WorkSafeBC is looking at work sites to make sure they are safe.\n\"All of that requires a methodical, thoughtful, science-based approach,\" Horgan said. \"It may well be satisfying to say we're going to shut something down but need to make sure we're doing it in a way that makes sense.\"\nMany workers, he said, are already self-isolating and following the advice of health officials.\u00a0However, he said, no options were off the table.\nIn Ontario, businesses deemed non-essential will be forced to close Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. for at least 14 days to help slow the spread of COVID-19.\nThe definition of non-essential businesses will be released Tuesday.\u00a0\nPremier Doug Ford said people will be able to buy food and medicine and other essential products:\u00a0\"the power will stay on\" and telecommunications tools will continue to run.\u00a0\nThere are no plans to close the LCBO and the Beer Store, according to a senior Ontario government source.\nIn the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered Britons to stay home except to to shop for basic necessities, exercise, for a medical need, to provide care or travelling to and from work where absolutely necessary.\nThe government ordered non-essential shops like clothing stores to close as well.\nSpeaking earlier in the day, Health Minister Adrian Dix cautioned against\u00a0drawing conclusions about the strength of any jurisdiction's approach just because it claims to be under a \"lockdown.\"\n\"Industry sectors that have been excluded from what's sometimes called the California lockdown represent about 65 per cent of the GDP of California,\" he said at an earlier media availability.\nProvincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said B.C. has already moved to close many businesses, like restaurants, where people gather closely in enclosed spaces.\n"}, {"author": "Murray Brewster", "title": "How NATO's defence spending benchmark turned into an international PR exercise", "description": "It was meant as a measure of burden-sharing.

In 2014, Ottawa pledged\u00a0to meet that level of spending within a decade.\nIt hasn't. In fact, at\u00a01.27 per cent of GDP, Canada's defence spending is nowhere near that level; it didn't even reach it during the height of the Cold War. The Canadian government makes no pretence of meeting that benchmark \u2014 but routinely points in its own defence to how much it contributes to the military alliance in terms of personnel and leadership in high-profile missions.\nStill, the show-me-the-money reflex in Washington these days is strong.\n\"U.S. taxpayers are spending almost four per cent of our GDP to defend ourselves and our allies, and two per cent is a fair minimum of what our allies should be paying,\" Robert O'Brien, White House national security adviser, said recently at the Halifax International Security Forum.\nIt was a rare public rebuke from the Americans \u2014 reasonably polite but pointed.\n\"We're grateful for what Canada has done,\" O'Brien said, \"but we would like to see Canada meet that commitment, because it's not just great for Canada, it's great for the free world.\"\nAhead of this week's NATO leaders' summit in London, Germany became the latest high-profile nation to announce it will aim to get to two per cent defence spending by the early 2030s.\nAnd while the U.S. would like to see Germany move faster, O'Brien said, \"at least they have a plan to get there.\"\nCanada doesn't \u2014 not one that's public, at least. Which\u00a0is where shaking the couch cushions comes in.\nEvery two years, NATO carries out what's known as the \"defence capability survey,\" which inventories what each country spends on defence and what it can contribute to its allies.\u00a0The latest one was completed this year.\nThe definition of what constitutes defence spending has become more elastic over the last few years, as Trump's demands for higher contributions from allies have\u00a0grown more strident.\nIn early 2018, NATO's definition was updated to include \"all payments, including pensions, made by a national government to meet the needs of its armed forces, regardless of the ministerial budgets from which those payments are made.\"\nWith that in mind, starting\u00a0in 2017\u00a0Canada began including in its estimate of defence expenditures its spending on: pensions (both military and civilian defence); the country's electronic spy service (the Communications Security Establishment); veterans\u00a0benefits, including death benefits for survivors; Global Affairs and RCMP expenses for peacekeeping; and the costs borne by other government departments when they support the Department of National Defence.\nThat added another $4.9 billion annually to Canada's calculation of defence spending.\nNATO further revised its definitions in February 2018. That allowed Canada to begin counting as a defence expenditure the $5 million it spends on the Afghan National Army Trust Fund, which is intended to support and train the army of that beleaguered nation.\nOne set of documents, dated June 5, 2018, shows the alliance doesn't allow countries to get away with charging whatever they like \u2014 and has even declared some expenses submitted by Canada\u00a0to be \"ineligible.\"\nWhen it was originally conceived, the two per cent benchmark was meant to serve as a measure of burden-sharing, of what each nation brought to the table in the name of the collective defence of Europe.\nIt has since evolved \u2014 particularly since the arrival of Trump \u2014 into a somewhat tortured accounting exercise that drives nations to demonstrate their worth to avoid international naming-and-shaming.\nThe White House does recognize the needle has moved since Russia's\u00a0annexation of Crimea jolted the now-70-year-old alliance out of its post-Cold War celebratory haze.\nIt would never have happened,\u00a0O'Brien claimed, without American hectoring, mostly by the current president.\n\"NATO member states, other than the United States, have invested $120 billion more over a four-year period than\u00a0they otherwise would have,\" he said.\n\"It's a major success story, not just for the United States\u00a0but for our allies.

The Great Depression of the 1930s was another.\n\"Whenever you have these major events that have differential consequences for different kinds of people, where the rich don't actually seem to be suffering very much and the poor seem to be suffering very, very acutely, then you do tend to get kind of a backlash against a tax system that seems to mimic the market,\" said Heaman.\nWATCH | Wartime publicity trailer focuses on wartime inflation,\u00a0role of price control:\nShe said\u00a0the historical evidence is plentiful and the changes caused have been momentous.\nThe backlash against suffering during the Depression permanently remodelled the structure of Canadian taxation power, said Joe Martin, director of Canadian Business History at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\nBased on recommendations from the Depression-era Rowell\u2013Sirois Commission to expand federal taxation for redistribution from wealthy Ontario and Quebec to the drought-battered\u00a0Prairie provinces, the federal government used the crisis of the Second World\u00a0War\u00a0to expand personal and corporate income tax\u00a0at the expense of the provinces.\n\"[There was] strong opposition from both Ontario and Quebec, but it passed because of wartime conditions,\" said Martin. That transformation formed the basis of Canada's postwar welfare system and evolved into the current system of equalization payments that is still contested today.\nGeoffrey Hale, the Lethbridge, Alta.-based academic and author of The Politics of Taxation in Canada, said\u00a0that rather than taxing back the money the government is lavishing out now, Morneau\u00a0would rather coax the economy into growth so that debt shrinks gradually over a period of years, not in absolute terms but as a percentage of GDP.\nThat's why Hale doesn't see governments boosting corporate taxes: for fear of chasing investment\u00a0away. Similarly, he does not think there is a lot more opportunity for taxing the rich who would merely be driven toward tax shelters. Hale suggested\u00a0a more politically palatable source of revenue would be to go after foreign digital sales, which for a large part escape Canadian taxation.\nBut everyone interviewed\u00a0agreed that if finance ministers decide they need revenue, there are always places to find it.\nExpanded consumption taxes or increased premiums for employment insurance are two examples. But more radical innovations might include wealth taxes, increased capital gains tax, death duties, financial transaction taxes (a Tobin tax),\u00a0a flat tax or a poll tax, maybe aiming the revenue at a specific need, such as seniors' care or better overall health care.\nIn a simulated economy, an AI came up with a counterintuitive tax policy that led to a smaller gap between the rich and the poor. <a href=\"https://t.co/gavOrrBdLL\">https://t.co/gavOrrBdLL</a>\nThe experts said that projected borrowing so far is no danger to the country and has been higher before in relative terms. Some said we may be better placed than the United States\u00a0just now.\nBut as tax historian Shirley Tillotson from Halifax's Dalhousie University said, evidence from the past shows that government confidence or even cockiness when a financial crisis begins can turn into alarm if the crisis worsens over a period of months or years. That is certainly what happened in 1917 and at the start of the Depression.\nAs both she and Morneau said last week \u2014 though each with a slightly different meaning \u2014 these are early days yet.\nPerhaps, as optimists say,\u00a0the Canadian and global economy will bounce back soon. But if things do get worse, Tillotson said, Canada is luckier than most.\n\"We have the tools,\" she said. \"In the Canadian case, in particular, we have the fiscal capacity, both the scope for borrowing and if necessary, the scope for expanding some element of our tax system.\"\nRecovery may be around the corner. But early days or not, the time to begin exploring alternative tax options is before a financial crisis turns into something worse.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "David Shield", "title": "Sask.

It is also something of a warning to Canadians considering burying themselves in long-term debt that cannot be easily shucked off.\nThe trigger for that worst case is simply a more-intense bout of\u00a0the current drag on\u00a0the global, American and Canadian economies, said Poloz. Effectively, he said, the problem is uncertainty over global trade relations, which has been paralyzing businesses that would otherwise have invested and expanded their output.\nRather than outlining the chances of gloom, Powell seemed bent on encouraging Americans to spend and businesses to invest, pointing to recent signs of improving U.S.-China trade relations and the defusing of a disruptive no-deal Brexit. While they are positive signs, he said, any real effect on business investment would only come after a long delay.\nThough it may follow the Fed's rate cuts in the future, the reason the Bank of Canada is not lowering rates right now is twofold.\nNo. 1 is that despite the real damage that has already been done to the global economy following Donald Trump's hostile trade-negotiating strategy, the Canadian economy largely remains\u00a0resilient.\nThat resilience is founded on the dual pillars of consumer spending and real estate prices, which, in turn, are being held up by record Canadian job and wage growth and a population boosted by a constant\u00a0drip of new immigrants.\nThe second reason for not cutting rates\u00a0is that with confidence strong and Canadian inflation on target at the bank's two per cent level, the economy remains close to full capacity.\nPoloz worries that lowering the price of lending at this stage\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a rate cut Powell referred to as \"insurance\" against a downturn \u2014\u00a0could spur a new round of Canadian borrowing and mortgage-funded bidding wars at\u00a0the wrong time.\n\"Such insurance may come at a cost in the form of higher financial vulnerabilities and possible consequences for the economy and inflation in the future,\" Poloz told reporters.\nWhile\u00a0the U.S. also boasts strong wages, even lower unemployment and a booming\u00a0consumer sector, one of Powell's biggest worries for the American\u00a0economy is inflation that has remained\u00a0below the two per cent target.\nThe worry in the U.S. is that people will begin expecting lower and lower rates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something Powell promises to resist.\nIn fact, the U.S. central banker gave broad hints he will be revealing mysterious new plans\u00a0by the middle of next year to help push price rises up to the target range, though he didn't elaborate.\nSomething that deputy\u00a0Wilkins\u00a0raised \u2014\u00a0and Powell did not \u2014 was the widely held belief that monetary policy has run out of power to fix the economy. Like many others around the world, she observed it is possible\u00a0fiscal spending could do much more, without stimulating a\u00a0frenzy of\u00a0borrowing.\nAnd while Poloz\u00a0was willing to face the possibility that things may get worse, in observing the advantages of having relatively strong economy in a troubled world, he could have been speaking for both Canada and the U.S.\n\"We are not immune to these\u00a0global developments, but we think we're in a good position to cope with what comes our way,\" said Poloz. \"Healthy and fit people can still get sick, but they recover more quickly.\"\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Katie Breen", "title": "Hello, Dolly!

It is also something of a warning to Canadians considering burying themselves in long-term debt that cannot be easily shucked off.\nThe trigger for that worst case is simply a more-intense bout of\u00a0the current drag on\u00a0the global, American and Canadian economies, said Poloz. Effectively, he said, the problem is uncertainty over global trade relations, which has been paralyzing businesses that would otherwise have invested and expanded their output.\nRather than outlining the chances of gloom, Powell seemed bent on encouraging Americans to spend and businesses to invest, pointing to recent signs of improving U.S.-China trade relations and the defusing of a disruptive no-deal Brexit. While they are positive signs, he said, any real effect on business investment would only come after a long delay.\nThough it may follow the Fed's rate cuts in the future, the reason the Bank of Canada is not lowering rates right now is twofold.\nNo. 1 is that despite the real damage that has already been done to the global economy following Donald Trump's hostile trade-negotiating strategy, the Canadian economy largely remains\u00a0resilient.\nThat resilience is founded on the dual pillars of consumer spending and real estate prices, which, in turn, are being held up by record Canadian job and wage growth and a population boosted by a constant\u00a0drip of new immigrants.\nThe second reason for not cutting rates\u00a0is that with confidence strong and Canadian inflation on target at the bank's two per cent level, the economy remains close to full capacity.\nPoloz worries that lowering the price of lending at this stage\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a rate cut Powell referred to as \"insurance\" against a downturn \u2014\u00a0could spur a new round of Canadian borrowing and mortgage-funded bidding wars at\u00a0the wrong time.\n\"Such insurance may come at a cost in the form of higher financial vulnerabilities and possible consequences for the economy and inflation in the future,\" Poloz told reporters.\nWhile\u00a0the U.S. also boasts strong wages, even lower unemployment and a booming\u00a0consumer sector, one of Powell's biggest worries for the American\u00a0economy is inflation that has remained\u00a0below the two per cent target.\nThe worry in the U.S. is that people will begin expecting lower and lower rates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something Powell promises to resist.\nIn fact, the U.S. central banker gave broad hints he will be revealing mysterious new plans\u00a0by the middle of next year to help push price rises up to the target range, though he didn't elaborate.\nSomething that deputy\u00a0Wilkins\u00a0raised \u2014\u00a0and Powell did not \u2014 was the widely held belief that monetary policy has run out of power to fix the economy. Like many others around the world, she observed it is possible\u00a0fiscal spending could do much more, without stimulating a\u00a0frenzy of\u00a0borrowing.\nAnd while Poloz\u00a0was willing to face the possibility that things may get worse, in observing the advantages of having relatively strong economy in a troubled world, he could have been speaking for both Canada and the U.S.\n\"We are not immune to these\u00a0global developments, but we think we're in a good position to cope with what comes our way,\" said Poloz. \"Healthy and fit people can still get sick, but they recover more quickly.\"\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Janet French", "title": "Alberta finance minister authorized to borrow up to $25 billion", "description": "Budget planned for $6.8 billion in borrowing", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-finance-minister-travis-toews-borrow-1.5543342", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5333519.1571930537!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/alta-finance-toews-20190904.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 23, 2020 6:25 PM MT", "2020-04-24T02:04:02.901Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Alberta government has authorized Finance Minister Travis Toews to borrow up to $25 billion.\nThe sum is nearly four times the amount the government expected to borrow this year when it approved its 2020-21 budget in March.\n\"We expect the province's deficit to be significantly larger due to reduced revenues and additional COVID-19 related spending,\" Toews' press secretary, Jerrica Goodwin, said in a Thursday email.\nAlthough Toews may not need to borrow the full amount, he wants to be prepared,\u00a0given the volatile economic conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and an\u00a0oil price war, Goodwin said.\nLast month,\u00a0to\u00a0vociferous protest from the Opposition, the United Conservative Party government approved a $57-billion budget based on financial projections it knew were outdated.\nIt calculated oil royalties based on a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $58 US a barrel. Earlier this week, the price of benchmark WTI oil fell into negative values for the first time in history, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic and the global oil price scuffle.\nThe premier has previously said the government expects Alberta's deficit this year to be at least triple the $6.8 billion forecast in the provincial budget.\nGoodwin did not specify on Thursday about how the government intends to spend additional borrowed money. It's destined for government programs, services and the COVID-19 response, she said.\nBorrowing limits can stretch across multiple fiscal years, she said.\nAnalysts with the Fraser Institute projected\u00a0Thursday the province's relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to skyrocket as borrowing rises and the economy shrinks. The measure helps gauge how easily the province can pay off debt.\nOpposition finance critic Shannon Phillips said the government borrowing is understandable, given the unprecedented economic challenges facing the province.\nShe wants more detail from the government on how and when it plans to use the borrowed money.\n\"We need broad-based relief measures across the economy, whether it's in health care, education, training, post-secondary, small business support [and]\u00a0rental supports to keep the economy moving forward,\" Phillips said in a Thursday interview. \"It's the essential role of government right now.\"\nThe NDP released a list Thursday of 12 ways it thinks the government should spend the borrowed money. The\u00a0wish list includes extending a ban on evictions into the summer and financial support for Alberta landlords. Small businesses should receive commercial rent subsidies, too.\nThe province should reopen applications for emergency isolation support payments \u2014 a temporary relief program that came under fire when applicants hit technical and identification snags.\nHealth-care workers deserve a higher wage top-up during the pandemic, Phillips said. Earlier this week, the government said it would top up health-care aide wages by $2 an hour and recruit more workers for continuing care homes. Many assisted living facilities and long-term care homes have been hard hit by COVID-19.\nGoodwin said the government has launched numerous programs and payment deferrals for people and businesses to help them endure the pandemic's economic punch. They include a $500-million boost to health spending, expanded homeless shelters, funds for social service agencies, property tax and utility bill payment deferrals and a ban on evictions for non-payment of rent in the month of April.\nDuring its four years in power, the former NDP government gave its finance minister permission to borrow up to $68 billion. Phillips said the NDP ultimately borrowed about $50 billion for provincial spending, about 43 per cent of which paid for construction of schools, hospitals, roads and bridges.\nWith borrowing cheap at the time, Phillips said the government also borrowed $5 billion cash to have on hand for emergencies. It's a strategy the UCP government should consider, she said.\n"}, {"author": "Sam Juric", "title": "P.E.I. announces $4.7M to tackle potato surplus related to COVID-19 market conditions", "description": "'This will help to ensure no product is lost so that farmers are in good position for the 2020 growing season'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-potato-surplus-supports-announced-covid-19-1.5542885", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5184953.1561131858!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pei-spring-planting-potato-farming-2019.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 23, 2020 5:46 PM AT", "2020-04-23T20:46:42.358Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Ahead of the growing season, the government of P.E.I. has announced it will provide $4.7 million to address the Island's potato surplus as a result of\u00a0COVID-19 market conditions.\u00a0\nIn a Thursday afternoon news briefing, Minister of Agriculture and Land Bloyce Thompson said the province will be helping producers and processors with the cost of\u00a0shipping\u00a0and storing\u00a0potatoes.\u00a0\n\"This will help to ensure no product is lost so that farmers are in good position for the 2020 growing season,\" Thompson said.\u00a0\n\"It will help resolve the substantial market issues to ensure these potatoes will now be a source of safe, quality food for our food security.\"\u00a0\nThompson acknowledged the approximately 4,600 employees in the agricultural industry on P.E.I.

It also ignored the research on where the global economy is going, as other nations prepare green economic stimulus packages.\nIn May 2018, the International Labour Organization released a report that estimated\u00a024 million new jobs would be created by 2030 in the move to a green economy.\nIt also predicted a loss of six million jobs in the oil sector.

Colgan, who is Canadian, also predicted a high level of bankruptcies and mergers in the sector.\nWhile the oil industry has long depended on subsidies, some experts are now urging nations to invest in green energy, rather than recover jobs that will have to be replaced in a few years to meet 2030 climate goals.\nOne of the findings of the 2019 IMF study was that Canada invests $60 billion annually in oil subsidies. Notably, most of this money goes to oil operators and Tier 1 contractors that are headquartered outside of this country.\nOil subsidies largely do not go to supply and service companies that are homegrown and based in Newfoundland and Labrador. These are also companies that could easily transition into supplying lower carbon energy sectors, with fairly minimal supports.\nFrankly, our provincial trade associations should be doing a better job of advocating for transitional funding for local companies, rather than championing the cause of major multinationals.\nThe fact that the oil sector is in such desperate need of subsidies to survive demonstrates that it is not nearly as lucrative as it claims it to be. The data that proponents present on the economic benefits of oil never factors in the total costs of oil subsidies.\nOxford Dictionaries chose \"climate emergency\" as its word of the year for 2019. We can expect massive shifts in energy sectors globally during the coming decade.\nIn 2019, 11,000 scientists\u00a0across the globe\u00a0signed off on an article in\u00a0Bioscience,\u00a0based on climate data from the last 40 years. They recommended the following:\nIt has become increasingly clear since the Paris Accord was negotiated in 2015 that keeping an increase in global warming to two Celsius degrees\u00a0is not enough.\nWe also now know that we must keep global warming to\u00a01.5 degrees\u00a0above pre-industrial levels in order to prevent irreparable damage to the natural environment. Last year ended with a global average temperature of 1.1 degrees\u00a0above pre-industrial levels.\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has warned that we are way off track in meeting either the 1.5-degree\u00a0or two-degree\u00a0targets that the Paris agreement called for.\nTime is quickly running out for us to avert the worst impacts of climate disruption.\nCanada, notably, is a signatory to the Paris Accord and has ratified it at home.\nIncreasingly, there have been calls for green energy stimulus spending since the economic downturn caused by COVID-19.\nThe Oxford Review of Economic Policy has accepted a study that surveyed 231 financial experts across central banks, finance ministries\u00a0and economics experts throughout the G20.\nThese experts identified five areas of economic stimulus which could displace the fossil fuel intensive economy, rather than entrench it. These include:\nNotably, our government is cutting post-secondary education, in both the university and college systems, at a time when we need to be retraining people for the green economy.\nThe study also found that without a green recovery, it will be nearly impossible to meet the goals of the Paris Accord. However, if the world comes together on green stimulus, this will be nearly sufficient to mitigate the most disastrous impacts of climate change that are predicted within the next 10 years.\nThe European Union is now poised to announce the world's greenest economic recovery package. Proposals include:\nGovernments and oil companies should have been retraining and transitioning oil employees for some years now.\nIn Newfoundland and Labrador, we immediately need both jobs and training for workers who want to transition out of oil.\u00a0We must insist that the federal and provincial governments prioritize workers over oil companies and their major global contractors.\nIn their stimulus response, they must also prioritize the green economy over the oil economy, as many nations are already doing.\u00a0If we do this right, we can become a green energy centre of excellence in the global environment.\nHowever, for that to happen, we must act on building the green economy right now.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "New Brunswick projects $88.1M surplus for 2019-20 fiscal year", "description": "2nd-quarter results project net debt will dip below $14B by fiscal year end", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-finance-debt-surplus-financial-results-1.5361281", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5062670.1553014522!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/finance-minister-ernie-steeves.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 15, 2019 3:45 PM AT", "2019-11-15T19:45:26.024Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The New Brunswick government is projecting a higher than expected budget surplus for the 2019-20 fiscal year, the province announced Friday while releasing its second-quarter financial results.\nRevenue growth will help push the fiscal year-end surplus to $88.1 million, $55 million higher than initially budgeted, the province projects.\nThe province is also on track to decrease the net debt by $232.7 million, bringing the figure to below $14 billion \u2014 to $13.82 billion.\n\"Today's financial update shows that we remain on track for a surplus and the first reduction in the province's net debt since 2006-07,\" Finance Minister Ernie Steeves\u00a0said in a statement.\u00a0\n\"Despite these positive results, we need to remember that we are still not in a financial position to spend more.

It would be hard to call either scenario outlandish these days.\nIf a global recession were to take hold in the first quarter of next year, Alberta's resource revenues and income taxes would be lower by about $4.2 billion annually, according to the budget.\nFrom income taxes to AirBnB rentals: How Alberta's new budget will affect your personal finances\nIn a scenario where three key pipeline projects \u2014\u00a0Trans Mountain, Keystone XL and Line 3 \u2014\u00a0are\u00a0permanently cancelled, oil production is expected to fall. That would hurt investment and employment, too.\u00a0Under that\u00a0scenario, lost resource revenues and income taxes are estimated at over $5 billion between 2019 and 2023.\nThose are the gloomiest of scenarios.\nThe UCP government, however, has built\u00a0a budget that foresees\u00a0better times \u2014 though it doesn't assume a quick rebound.\nIt forecasts real GDP growth to slow to 0.6 per cent in 2019, and then improve\u00a0to 2.7 per cent in 2020, and then again to three\u00a0per cent over the medium term.\nThe plan, which includes cuts to public spending, is to halt growing deficits and produce a\u00a0surplus by 2023 of nearly $600 million.\nBut it's a plan that needs a little help.\nBudget 2019: Health care spending up one per cent\nThe government is looking for at least two of three pipelines to be built: Enbridge's Line 3 in early 2021,the Trans Mountain Expansion in late 2022, and Keystone XL in early 2023.\nIt's also anticipating rising revenues from bitumen royalties and other resource dollars. It forecasts resource revenues to grow to $8.6 billion by 2022-23, up from $6.5 billion\u00a0for 2019-20.\nUniversity of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe\u00a0said it's reasonable to assume two of the pipelines do get built. He said the government's forecast of greater\u00a0revenues from resource royalties makes sense, too.\n\"I have no concerns there, although I'll note that, of course, royalties are volatile and unpredictable,\" Tombe said.\n\"They're a key part of this plan. They need 12 per cent of the budget to come in the form of royalties in 2022. That's a significant share, although I'll note it's lower than the past.\"\nBudget 2019: Alberta's post-secondary budget reduced, tuition freeze removed\nThe government is also hoping to lure corporations \u2014\u00a0and investment \u2014 back to the province.\nOne way is by reducing the corporate income tax rate to eight per cent, from 12 per cent, over four years. The government introduced that strategy\u00a0earlier this year, but it received added emphasis again Thursday.\n\"The weight of historical evidence overwhelmingly shows that when we improve our corporate tax advantage, our provincial GDP goes up and our share of national GDP increases,\" Toews said in his budget speech.\n\"So do jobs. And so do government revenues.\"\nThe NDP has\u00a0challenged the strategy, branding it a giveaway to big corporations.\nEarlier this week, the NDP's energy critic,\u00a0Irfan Sabir, was critical of the corporate tax cuts, charging that the \"handout\"\u00a0hasn't stopped job\u00a0losses in the oilpatch.\u00a0\nA new deal with Canada? How about a new deal FOR Canada\nBut the UCP believes it's on a path to making\u00a0Alberta among the most attractive investment destination\u00a0in North America by 2022. This, along with improved market access for Alberta oil, \"will set the stage for improved investment.\"\nThe budget also confirmed a number of other promised initiatives intended to help the private sector, including efforts\u00a0to\u00a0reduce red tape.\u00a0\nHowever, economist Tombe\u00a0noted that the government also announced steps to eliminate five tax credits, including the\u00a0the Alberta Investor Tax Credit, which aimed to help diversify the provincial economy and create new jobs in fields like information technology and clean tech.\n\"I think that's something that will discourage activity in areas that were benefiting from the Albert Investor Tax Credit, for example,\"\u00a0 Tombe said. \"I would have preferred to see the program expanded.\"\nThe big election winner? The carbon tax\nThe government could well face questions about whether it's still leaning too hard on fossil fuels and whether it's doing enough to address climate change. Cuts to post-secondary education and tuition hikes will also raise concerns.\nTombe, meanwhile, cautioned about overstating what a budget can do.\u00a0\n\"I don't think we should view the budget as a tool to kick-start the economy,\" he said.\n\"The recovery is ongoing. Yes, it is slow and has been for a year and a half. But the pace of the recovery is expected to improve. And that's the case regardless of what changes were made in the budget.\"\nFor now, though, the Alberta government has its plan, one that its\u00a0finance minister is calling \"a turning point.\"\nMany Albertans will hope so.\n"}, {"author": "Taylor C.

Noakes, an independent journalist and public historian from Montreal.\u00a0For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the\u00a0FAQ.\nGiven our renewed national interest in pipelines and oil sands mines, consider some strange bedfellows: economists who agree with environmentalists that subsidizing the fossil fuel industry is a bad idea.\nEliminating fossil fuel subsidies would obviously help Canada achieve its emissions-reduction targets. What's less obvious is how these subsidies undermine our economy, add to the tax burden, and hinder innovation.\nIn testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology's energy subcommittee in 2015, for example, Mercatus Centre senior research fellow Veronique de Rugy argued all government subsidies to the energy industry \u2014 including those that benefit the fossil fuel sector \u2014 ought to be abolished.\nThe Mercatus Centre isn't an environmental organization, it's a libertarian think-tank of free-market fundamentalists. De Rugy's three-part argument is that:\nIn Canada,\u00a0consistent subsidy has failed to either\u00a0provide stability or kick-start major innovation when it comes to fossil fuels.\nExact numbers relating to Canada's total fossil fuel subsidy are difficult to come by, a fact exacerbated by a general governmental aversion to transparency. The industry isn't forthcoming, but the federal and provincial governments aren't insisting on accountability either. It's an unfortunate irony that Canadians in need of public assistance often face more exacting demands on their own accountability than the recipients of corporate welfare.\nA report by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) from 2018 was critical both of Canada's lack of a formal plan to phase out financial support for the oil and gas industries, and the general paucity of published reports detailing the support provided.\nThe ODI estimates\u00a0an annual direct subsidy of $4.73 billion\u00a0US ($6.3 billion Cdn) for\u00a02016, the highest level in the G7\u00a0\u00a0per unit of GDP. Other activities funded by Canadian taxpayers, such as the government purchase of the Trans Mountain Pipeline\u00a0and work to expand it, add up to billions more.\nA post-tax estimate includes direct subsidies, along with what fossil fuels cost in terms of their negative social impact, such as pollution and global warming. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) report places Canada's post-tax subsidy to the fossil fuel industry from private and public sources at an astounding $43 billion US\u00a0in 2015-16, an amount that would be equivalent to nearly one-fifth of the current federal budget.\u00a0(On a global scale the IMF post-tax estimate is astronomical: $5.2 trillion US in 2016, or 6.5 per cent of global GDP.)\nIt's an interesting point of common ground that both progressive environmentalists and economic libertarians oppose subsidies to the fossil fuel industry.\nGlobally, oil and gas producers are estimated to have lost $400 billion in market value over the past four years, and analysts running the gamut from Goldman Sachs to Jim Cramer are advising investors to put their money elsewhere.\nUnfortunately for market purists and environmentalists alike, the fossil fuel industry in Canada has become so thoroughly politicized that ever-more-generous subsidies are being demanded by companies as the cost of doing business.\nConsider the baffling pseudo-debate over Teck Resources' now-withdrawn proposal for the Frontier Mine. Before Teck pulled the plug on the project last week, CEO Don Lindsay had already indicated the cost of a barrel of oil would have to rise by nearly half to make the $20 billion mine profitable. Yet the Trudeau Administration was prepared to green-light the project despite the obvious environmental concerns if it could get Jason Kenney to agree to emissions reductions.\nWhile politicians euphemistically refer to subsidies as \"investment\" and insist they are facilitating a transition to clean energy, there's scant evidence this is the case. The entire idea of a 'transitional fuel' is absurd: if you burn it for energy, it's adding to the emissions problem. Worse, according to the International Monetary Fund, subsidies encourage excessive consumption.\nIn a\u00a02019 report, the International Institute for Sustainable Development minced no words: \"fossil fuel subsidies are a key barrier to this transition.\"\nEnergy companies have one responsibility: increasing shareholder value. How this value is created doesn't fundamentally matter. Energy companies don't have to limit themselves to fossil fuels, but subsidies that prop up struggling fossil fuels-based businesses create barriers to innovation, and to adaptation as markets change.\nInherently inefficient fossil fuel subsidies impede investment in clean energy technologies, ultimately undermining efforts to fight climate change.\nEliminating subsidies forces energy companies to transition to clean energy more quickly: innovative companies will swim while industry dinosaurs will sink. It's cold and hard, but that's the free market for you.\nAnd it's a false dichotomy that Canada must choose between fighting climate change and supporting jobs in Alberta. Both need to happen simultaneously.\nRather than pouring money down the hole of the fossil fuel sector, it could be used to retrain unemployed oil workers and build\u00a0solar arrays, wind turbines and hydro-electric generating stations, with an aim to providing new jobs in all the regions adversely affected by over-reliance on non-renewable resource extraction.\nThough this could also be considered a subsidy, the crucial difference is that renewable energy sources are a sustainable and growing industry, and don't carry the expensive social and ecological burdens of fossil fuels \u2014\u00a0no heightened mortality rates due to air pollution, no orphan wells in need of clean-up.\nGiven the severity of the climate crisis and the increasingly untenable relationship between the fossil fuel industry and Canadian society, it's unlikely axing subsidies alone will be enough\u00a0to bring about fast, meaningful change in the energy sector. After years of fossil fuels subsidies, government intervention is now necessary to quickly build a clean energy production and distribution infrastructure sufficiently large enough to get all of Canada off fossil fuels.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "All eyes on Canadian jobs numbers as election heads into 5th week: Don Pittis", "description": "Still few signs of Canadian recession, but this week's data may tell us more", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/jobs-economy-election-1.5298115", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309380.1570212742!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/now-hiring-cafe-at-st-lawrence-market-toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 07, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-10-08T16:40:39.065Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When Canada's jobs numbers come out on Friday there will only be 10 days before Canadians vote in the federal election.\nThose who are already a little sick of wall-to-wall election coverage may find that an encouraging milestone. But for politicians who have made the welfare of voters\u00a0a key plank in their platforms,\u00a0the fresh\u00a0data may give them new fodder to boast or complain about the state of the Canadian economy.\nQuite apart from the election, the latest\u00a0statistics come at a time of conflicting signals about the direction of Canadian, U.S.\u00a0and global growth.\nDire warnings from merely a few weeks ago that markets were about to\u00a0crash\u00a0and a feeling that the economy was heading into a recessionary tailspin have since dissipated, though a background wariness remains.\nLast Wednesday's market conniption was only the latest evidence of lingering worries that likely aren't over yet.\nCanadian gross domestic product numbers last week showed the economy was flat. That's a big change from the previous reading when the Canadian economy was still revelling in the impact of the Toronto Raptors win, and GDP indicated economic growth of\u00a03.7 per cent, a startlingly strong number in a low-growth world.\nAs I write about growth as a good thing, I feel a certain conflict after reporting recently\u00a0on Greta Thunberg and\u00a0the necessity of learning to live well in a low-growth world.\u00a0Evidently, like many others, I have not yet internalized that mental shift.\nFor good or ill, the economic growth figures for July offered\u00a0plenty of\u00a0signs that people were shopping more and gobbling up more in services. The hit to the economy came specifically in oil and gas, and within that sector the principal\u00a0blame fell on a sharp drop in production from the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore due to rig maintenance.\nOne confusing aspect of GDP figures \u2014 besides making us ponder\u00a0whether they are a sign of a planet in trouble \u2014 is that they are always out of date. Like seeing light from a distant planet, the data we are observing represents events that have already happened, and things\u00a0may have changed since.\nJust as the numbers that came out in August told us about the economy\u00a0Canadians were experiencing two months previous, last week's growth numbers reflect conditions in early summer before the mid-August gloom had arrived. As mentioned in the past, a little gloom can make people rein in spending, effectively compounding the effects of a slowing economy.\nCanada's deep connections to the U.S. economy\u00a0mean that chill winds there can blow north, and updated business investment figures released by the Commerce Department two weeks ago showed a sharper decline.\n\"The trade war is threatening the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year,\" reported the business wire service Reuters.\nBut since that report, the\u00a0picture has turned brighter, especially after Friday's trade data\u00a0and U.S. unemployment figures that hit a stunning new low.\nOn Friday we learned that the Canadian trade gap narrowed\u00a0and perhaps more important\u00a0the U.S. economy is still cranking out jobs.\u00a0The unemployment rate south of the border\u00a0hit a\u00a050-year low of 3.5 per cent last month as the economy created 136,000 new jobs.\u00a0\nThe advantage of the jobs figures\u00a0that came last\u00a0Friday in the U.S. and those coming Friday in Canada is that they don't feel quite so historical as many other measures. In that way they will offer the freshest indication of whether\u00a0Canada is losing steam.\nUnlike GDP, which is painstakingly collected from many sources and gradually assembled into increasingly accurate figures as more data is accumulated, the jobs number\u00a0is based on a series of telephone surveys in the weeks before the numbers are released. That make Labour Force Survey results up-to-date, but less accurate.\nStatisticians who watch those numbers often say the accuracy of the results in any month cannot be trusted. The chart above, which\u00a0begins after the\u00a0big weather-related\u00a0plunge in job creation in February\u00a02018,\u00a0swings widely from month to month. The trend over several months would be a more truthful reflection.\nThe other thing about employment data is that it is cumulative. While a single month's survey may indicate a fall in the number of jobs, over the past year periodic\u00a0job losses\u00a0\u2014 those points below the black line\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have been dwarfed by gains in other months.\nBut that is seldom how any month's numbers are perceived when they are released, especially during an election.\nInevitably a sharp rise in monthly job creation or a fall in the unemployed will be extrapolated to say\u00a0the economy remains on an upswing. The opposite will be read as a\u00a0warning of approaching gloom.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\nNeed help preparing for election day? We've got the information you need.

For the fiscal year of 2009-2010, the Harper government ran a deficit of $56.4 billion. Before they were done, the Conservatives ran six years of annual deficits, totalling $157.8 billion.\nStill, it was considered heresy when Justin Trudeau announced in 2015 that a Liberal government would run three years of deficits to boost a sluggish economy. One newspaper described the plan as \"political suicide.\" Shortly thereafter, Trudeau's Liberals won a majority.\nOnce in office, the Trudeau government pushed things further\u00a0\u2014 first because of economic circumstances, then because of its own choices and priorities\u00a0\u2014 resulting in deficits of $19 billion, $19 billion, $14 billion and $19.8 billion.\nHarper's deficits could be traced to his decisions to cut taxes\u00a0\u2014 the GST in particular. Trudeau's deficits had more to do with new spending on federal programs.\nWhile running for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2017, Andrew Scheer vowed to balance the budget within two years of forming government. But as the 2019 general election neared \u2014 and with budget cuts by Doug Ford's provincial government angering voters in Ontario \u2014 Scheer lost some of his enthusiasm for swift deficit elimination. In May, he announced that a Conservative government would instead take five years to balance the budget.\nThe Liberal platform released on Sunday nudges\u00a0the goalposts again. With promised new spending, a re-elected Liberal government would run larger deficits, starting at $27.4 billion in the first year and declining to $21 billion in the fourth.\nThe Conservative response was notable for what it lacked. Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre's primary argument was not that the deficits were themselves immoral or fundamentally unsound. Rather, he claimed the deficits inevitably would lead a Liberal government to increase taxes\u00a0\u2014 tax hikes the Conservatives claim\u00a0Trudeau is concealing now.\nThat attack might resonate more if the Harper government's deficits had triggered the same consequences.\nEconomists like Kevin Milligan\u00a0argue that the current deficit is not a matter for great concern\u00a0\u2014 that government debt is not like household debt, borrowing rates are low, the situation in 2019 is not what it was in 1995 and recent deficits have been relatively modest.\nThe debt-to-GDP ratio\u00a0\u2014 the debt as measured against the entirety of the national economy\u00a0\u2014 was 31.5 per cent in 2014-2015. The Liberals now project that, even after eight years of deficits, it will be 30.2 per cent of GDP in 2023-2024. (For the sake of comparison, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 66.8 per cent in 1996, when Jean Chr\u00e9tien\u00a0and Paul Martin were compelled to cut spending.)\nBut the bottom line still resonates in political news coverage and partisan debate. It's\u00a0an easy way to measure a budget or a platform, something that can be quickly understood\u00a0\u2014 unlike the relative value of the actual spending and tax commitments that a government or party makes. \"Is the budget balanced?\" is a much easier question to answer than, say, \"How much should the government be spending to help families?\"\nSpending into a deficit can be easily described as reckless. But it's not clear the public is much more concerned than the average economist.\nJust 13 per cent of respondents to an Ipsos Reid survey earlier this month said government debt was among their three most important election issues. An Angus Reid Institute poll found only three per cent of uncommitted voters considered it their top issue. In both polls, issues like climate change, the cost of living and health care rated much higher.\nThat combination of economic and public sentiment may have given Trudeau room to promise more. But it's also not clear how far the public's patience with red ink might last.\nThe most expensive item in the Liberal platform is the promise to raise the personal income tax deduction, but its new commitments also include a boost to the Canada Child Benefit for families with children under a year old, new breaks for post-secondary students, a boost to Old Age Security and new spending to mitigate climate change.\u00a0In all, the Liberals are effectively offering to push slightly harder in the direction they've set out over the last four years.\nScheer's Conservatives are still committed to a greater degree of frugality. That, along with a series of promised tax cuts, should compel them to present a different picture of what a federal government would do when they table their complete platform\u00a0\u2014 to present their own approach as a stark contrast with what the Liberals have planned.\nIn 2011, Harper's Conservatives promised $1.6 billion in new spending, while Michael Ignatieff's Liberals countered with a platform that included $5.5 billion in new initiatives, all of it covered by corresponding tax increases or spending cuts.\nIn 2019, instead of arguing within a box created by competing desires to both balance the budget and avoid broad-based tax increases, the platforms of the two main federal parties could be upwards of $20 billion apart.\nThat is not a small amount of money.\nIf the orthodoxy of the balanced budget has weakened, it has left room for a clearer choice.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Greta Thunberg was right: There is an alternative to 'eternal economic growth': Don Pittis", "description": "Climate activist called endless economic growth a 'fairy tale,' but it may depend on how you define growth", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/business-climate-strike-1.5293916", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5297204.1569440488!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/climate-change-un.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 26, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-26T22:15:22.815Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In a quote heard around the world this week a 16-year-old climate activist threw down the gauntlet.\nGreta Thunberg's passion reached deep into our hearts when she angrily called on our leaders to stop the suffering and dying, to stop entire ecosystems from collapsing.\nBut with the next sentence in that widely quoted appeal for action, Thunberg did something many of the most powerful people in the world will find harder to swallow: she thrust a knife into the beating heart of conventional economics.\n\"We are at the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!\"\nTo most economists, money and endless economic growth are no fairy tales, they are essential to how the world works, how lives are improved, how people earn their living.\nBut there is another way of understanding economics that comes under the general title of sustainable prosperity, and a Canadian economist is one of the world's principal exponents of how such a system would work.\nTomorrow, as students and many others participate in the strike for climate change, there are signs business would like to show support. Mountain Equipment Co-op will close its doors. Upmarket fashion brand Patagonia has offered space for sign-making. Amazon's Jeff Bezos has announced he will buy electric delivery vans once they become available. Canada's financial sector has expressed concern.\nAsked by host Laura Lynch on CBC Radio's The Current this week about talk of business contributions to the climate change fight, environmentalist Bill McKibben was skeptical.\n\"The talk is growing, but it's not about how the financial sector is fighting climate change,\" said McKibben, a founder of the group 350.org, \"It's about how the financial sector is continuing to propel climate change.\"\nMcKibben cited a list of the world's biggest banks that continue to invest in the carbon-intensive industries that are making climate change worse. Four of Canada's big banks \u2014 RBC, TD, Scotia and BMO \u2014 are in the global top 10.\nCanadian economist and author Peter Victor, who studied at UBC and taught at Toronto's York University, says that conflict between words and investment is the crux of the collision between the traditional way of thinking about business \u2014 the idea of investing for endless growth \u2014 that has to be overcome to stop climate change.\nAnd clearly, for most economic thinkers trapped in the long-held view that boosting GDP with industrial growth is the most important job for governments and business, Victor's newly revised second edition of his\u00a0book Managing Without Growth: Slower by Design, Not Disaster may be difficult reading.\n\"Most economists would really take the position that there is no choice: If you don't have growth, the system would collapse,\" said Victor this week from a cabin somewhere near Ontario's Algonquin Park.\nVictor has created a low-growth simulation model for the Canadian economy to demonstrate that there is a choice. Getting from here to there may be difficult, but in principle he says his work shows there are no economic reasons why Canada cannot be prosperous in the absence of traditional, industrial, GDP-style growth.\nAs he describes in a slightly out-of-date 2013 video lecture embedded below, the concept of economic growth is a relatively recent post-war invention. According to the 2016 book The Rise and Fall of American Growth, the growth era may be ending in any case.\nBut endless growth could be replaced by shifting growth.\n\"Even in an economy that is not growing, you can have a lot of dynamic change,\" said Victor. \"We need some sectors to grow if we're going to switch from fossil fuels to renewables, for instance.\"\nAnd we will still have to keep busy, not least in figuring out ways of making our economy keep ticking in the face of climate change. Building sea walls to protect a city does not increase output like building a new factory or increasing oil output, but it is useful.\nSo are many things that are not traditionally seen as helping the economy grow, including creating art, looking after friends and family, participating in political activity \u2014 things not properly captured in GDP and therefore not contributing to growth. Maybe economists can recalibrate our system to value those activities.\nStudies of well-being have indicated that faster growth does not give people more free time or make people happier. A low-growth economy could do that.\nRepeated analysis has shown that the current understanding of economic growth is using up the planet's resources at a rate that cannot be sustained. As the title of Victor's book implies, disaster would end growth one way or another, just more abruptly.\nAccording to Victor, adapting to a low-growth economy will be complex and demanding, but there will be many compensations, such as not destroying the planet and not driving the rest of the world's plants and animals into extinction. Of course, that was Thunberg's point.\nWATCH | Canadian economist Peter Victor explains his theory of ecological economics:\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Maryse Zeidler", "title": "'Stroller brigades' across B.C. make plea for national child-care strategy", "description": "All the major federal parties have committed to current levels of funding, but B.C. group wants more", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-affordable-child-care-rally-1.5310648", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5310693.1570309367!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bc-affordable-child-care.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 05, 2019 3:04 PM PT", "2019-10-05T22:04:43.710Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Parents and their supporters in 21 communities across British Columbia rallied on Saturday morning to call for a national child-care strategy.\u00a0\nThe protesters, many of them with strollers in tow, want the federal government\u00a0to provide affordable, universal child care for parents across the country.\u00a0\n\"Everybody depends on somebody who depends on child care,\" said Sharon Gregson at the rally in Vancouver.

The collapse of oil prices, however, presents a third crisis that is partly of our own making.\n\"Alberta's budget deficit this year may triple from $7 billion to almost $20 billion,\" the premier said, adding that we will soon face \"a great fiscal reckoning.\"\nThis isn't an exaggeration.\nWhile there remains a uniquely high degree of uncertainty right now, and both the premier's statement and my high-level analysis in this article should be seen in that light, there is no getting around the significant challenge that awaits.\nBut there are options. Alberta's economy and our budget can recover, but it will require hard choices and cross-party compromises that we too often resist.\nFirst, we should appreciate our current predicament. A $20-billion deficit is plausible.\nConsider three major sources of Alberta government revenue:\nIncome and Other Taxes: We were hoping for $23 billion this year. But a contracting economy and income losses from low oil prices together suggests nominal GDP may fall by 15 to 20 per cent. This means lower revenues \u2014 possibly $4 billion lower.\nInvestment Income: Alberta has large savings that generate returns. We were hoping for $2.6 billion this year, but\u00a0as anyone who has checked their RRSP recently knows, we're more likely to lose money this year. During the financial crisis we lost $1.9 billion. Today, losing $1 billion is possible, which would lower government revenue by $3- to $4-billion relative to our previous estimates. (Of course, how the market will perform\u00a0over the coming months is not known, and the government might book recent losses in 2019/20 instead.)\nResource Revenues: Alberta chooses to rely heavily on resource revenues to fund public services. And when energy prices fall, so do revenues. The government was hoping oil would fetch $58 per barrel this year; today it's less than $20. So instead of the $5.1 billion we were hoping for, we might see $2 billion (or less).\nWe could keep going, but these three items alone put us on track for a revenue hit of $11 billion. Add additional health-care spending of at least $500 million (possibly more) and other costs, and we're almost at a $20 billion deficit already, up from the original $6.8 billion.\nCombined with borrowing for capital projects and a smaller economy, we could be looking at a 20 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio \u2014 double our current level.\nThis short-term challenge is manageable, to be sure, and Alberta would remain the lowest-debt province.\u00a0\nThe trouble is, these fiscal challenges will continue for many years.\nOil prices are not projected to bounce back anytime soon.\nCurrent futures prices are roughly $20 to $30 per barrel lower than government forecasts by 2022-23. And to balance the books that year, the government was hoping for $8.5 billion in resource revenues. This is no longer in the cards. Not even close.\nBudget 2020 provides some clues of how bad it might be.\nThe budget reported \"high\" and \"low\" economic scenarios for 2022-23 that, roughly, corresponded to a $20 per barrel swing in oil prices (see page 73 of the budget). Such a swing may lower income tax and resource revenues by nearly $9 billion, they report.\u00a0\nThe shock we're facing today is slightly larger, so instead of a modest surplus by 2022, we may see a deficit of more than $9 billion.\nLet that sink in. After four years of significant spending restraint, we're on track for a larger deficit than the one we started with.\nThis is our fiscal reckoning. But, luckily, there are options.\nLet's start with the government's current policy: a freeze in program spending.\nWithout going into details, I updated\u00a0my own model of Alberta's budget to reflect most of what we know today from publicly available sources and display the results below.\nThe government's current fiscal policy suggests we'll balance four years later than planned: 2026 instead of 2022.\nThis is less than ideal.\u00a0\nAlberta would see $140 billion in taxpayer-supported debt, with interest costs of nearly $6 billion per year \u2014 or roughly triple our current amount. And, since prices and population will continue to grow, a freeze is effectively a nearly 30 per cent reduction in the inflation-adjusted per person level of spending. This would require a deeper reinvention of public services and is roughly double the government's previously planned restraint.\nBut there is\u00a0another side to the budget: Revenue.\nConsider a broad-based and efficient source of revenue like the sales tax. Alberta already has one, of course: it's called the GST. Except the federal government gets all of the revenue.\nAlberta could, if it wanted, raise the GST from its current five per cent and keep the incremental revenue (this is known as a harmonized sales tax, or \"HST\").\u00a0\nIf, starting next year, Alberta gradually phased in a four-point increase to the GST (which would be lower than any other province), then we'd be on track to balance the books by 2024. That would mean only two additional years of frozen spending, and would avoid roughly $20 billion in additional debt.\u00a0\nOf course, there are other revenue options.\nSome might prefer higher income taxes. Adding one point to all income tax brackets could add around $1.5 billion to revenues.\nSome might prefer pausing the corporate tax cut. This would add around $500 million.\nOthers might suggest Alberta take back carbon tax revenues from Ottawa. Once it reaches $50 per tonne, that would be $2.2 billion to Alberta \u2014 and if we kept rebates to lower income households, it might net $1.5 billion.\nWhatever the tool, to balance by 2024 with frozen spending requires we raise total revenue by roughly eight per cent. And if, after 2022, we allow spending to keep pace with population and inflation, revenue would have to rise by 15 per cent.\nEven with such increases, Alberta would still enjoy the lowest taxes in the country \u2014 by an extremely wide margin \u2014 but it would be challenging nonetheless.\nAll provinces are facing revenue shortfalls and spending pressures. And Ottawa will likely offer support. But it matters less than you might think.\nOttawa could cover some (or even most) of the direct COVID-19 related expenditures by extending the disaster assistance program to cover pandemics (it currently does not). If Canada supported provinces with funding in line with what the United States delivered for states, for example, Alberta might see over $2.5 billion this year.\nOttawa could also cover a share of revenue declines through a reformed Fiscal Stabilization Program (which Alberta has long demanded). If it fully acceded to Alberta's request for reform, Alberta might see $3 billion more this year.\nThere's a strong case to be made for such support, since it's cheaper and easier for the federal government to borrow and smooth out shocks like COVID-19 than it is for provinces. There are also many options for reform, from removing the current cap on payments to more fundamental reform.\u00a0\nBut even though these dollar amounts are large, and helpful for provincial balance sheets, such federal support would barely nudge Alberta's daunting longer-term trajectory.\nAlberta's fiscal reckoning is of our own making. We cannot look to Ottawa to fix it.\nThere are real political challenges with spending restraint and new taxes, to be sure. And there's no easy option. But cross-party compromise and a whole-of-budget approach to tackling this challenge is the best way forward.\nGovernment and opposition parties must both re-evaluate their approach to fiscal policy. And Albertans must give them space to do so.\u00a0\nAfter the dust from the health crisis settles, we'll need to have an open and honest discussion about our budget and our future. Our fiscal reckoning may look bleak, but we have options. We just need to choose wisely from among them.\nThis column is an opinion.

Only Germany and Canada have unanimous AAA credit ratings, because our plan is responsible and reasonable when it comes to our finances.\"\n\u2014\u00a0Liberal leader Justin Trudeau responds during Thursday's French-language debate to a question about the national debt, deficit and Canada's potential \"wiggle room\" in the event of a recession.\u00a0\nThe facts: The government of Canada is rated AAA \u2014 the best possible grade \u2014 by all four major international credit ratings agencies, S&P, Moody's, Fitch and DBRS.\u00a0\nTrudeau's contention that only the Germans have a similarly high rating is probably a slip of the tongue: Canada and Germany are only G7 nations rated AAA. But nine other countries, including Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Australia and New Zealand, currently enjoy the same status.\u00a0\nWhat is more debatable is the idea that the AAA rating is a ringing endorsement of Canada's finances, or the suggestion that it will offer some protection come the next recession.\nDuring the 2015 election, the Liberals promised that they would run three years of \"modest\" deficits before balancing the books in 2019.\u00a0\nFor the fiscal year that ended in March, the federal deficit was $14 billion. And the spring budget forecast a shortfall of $19.8 billion in 2019-20.\u00a0\nThe current Liberal platform, which promises billions in new spending, predicts that the deficit will rise to $27.4 billion in 2020-21\u00a0and then slowly shrink to $21 billion by the end of a second mandate.\u00a0\n(The NDP, Conservatives and Green Party are also planning to run large deficits, should they win power.)\nFor months now, Trudeau has been telling voters that the country can easily afford to spend and borrow more. Canada's net debt-to-GDP ratio is 30.9, he points out, less than half of what it was in the early 1990s. Already the lowest ratio in the G7, it is projected to continue to decline \u2014 marginally \u2014 hitting 30.2 in 2023-24.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"This question around deficits, obviously, has been one that has led to a lot of conversations, a lot of attacks or critiques from our political opponents, the legitimate questions from journalists and, quite frankly, worries from Canadians,\" Trudeau told The Canadian Press last December. \"Who are the experts in terms of sustainability of a fiscal plan? I'd suggest that the international bond ratings agencies \u2013 S&P, Moody's and those folks know what they're talking about \u2026 The fact that the international ratings agencies are giving us a thumbs up right now should reassure people.\"\nBut the credit rating agencies aren't quite as bullish on the Liberal plans as Trudeau suggests.\nIn March, Fitch issued a pointed warning about Canada's combined level of federal and provincial debt, saying that it increases the danger of a recession\u00a0and the chances of a rating downgrade.\u00a0\n\"Canada's gross general government debt, combining federal and provincial fiscal accounts, is higher than other 'AAA' rated sovereigns, excepting the U.S, and remains close to a level that is incompatible with 'AAA' status,\" the firm noted.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd the company's predicted growth rates for the Canadian economy\u00a0 \u2014 1.3 per cent in 2019, and 1.7 per cent in 2020-21 \u2014 are modest at best.\u00a0\nOther ratings services like DBRS have expressed concern about the overheated housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto\u00a0and the \"key domestic vulnerability\" of high household debt. Currently, Canadians owe $1.77 for every $1 they make \u2014 up from $1.09 in 2001. Sustainable for now, but a potentially huge problem should interest rates spike.\u00a0\nWhile it's obviously better as a country to be rated AAA when you're looking to borrow money, it's not exactly a guarantee of a soft landing in a recession.\u00a0\nFor example, Ireland and Spain were both rated AAA before the 2008-09 global banking meltdown. And while the United States managed to keep its top-tier status through that\u00a0financial crisis, the country was downgraded in 2011 due to its budget fights and persistent political gridlock.\nIt's also worth noting that the rating agencies are hardly infallible \u2014\u00a0the toxic mortgage securities that triggered the last global recession were almost all rated AAA until they proved to be worthless junk.\u00a0\nThe verdict: It's complicated. Canada is among the handful of nations that enjoy unanimous AAA status, but it's more a case of being the best of a bad bunch than the star status that Trudeau claims.\u00a0  Sources: Country credit ratings, Trading Economics; Sovereigns rating list, Country Economy; Choosing Investment Now: The Liberal Fiscal Plan and Costing, Liberal Party of Canada; Canada ends 2018-19 fiscal year with narrower budget deficit than forecast, Reuters; Federal government's deficit to grow to $19.8B in 2019-20 fiscal year, Canadian Business; A Responsible Fiscal Plan, Liberal Party of Canada; Liberals to boost spending and extend deficits while taxing luxury goods and internet giants, CBC News; What voters need to know about deficits and the debt, CBC News; Canada's credit rating should ease worries about federal deficits, Trudeau says, Globe and Mail; Fitch warns Canada's debt close to level incompatible with 'AAA' status, Bloomberg; Fitch Affirms Canada's Ratings at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable, Fitch Ratings, DBRS Confirms Government of Canada at AAA Stable, DBRS; Debt-to-income picture improved slightly in 2nd quarter, CBC News, Remaining countries with AAA credit ratings, NBC News; United States loses prized AAA credit rating from S&P, Reuters, The Credit Rating Controversy, The Council on Foreign Relations.\n"}, {"author": "Tony Davis", "title": "P.E.I. government increases emergency fund to $40M, offers property tax relief", "description": "P.E.I. in 'better position to bounce back' from economic devastation of COVID-19, says finance minister", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-government-releif-deficit-economic-update-friday-april-3-2020-1.5520849", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5521287.1585944203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/premier-king-covid-presser-april-3.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 03, 2020 3:42 PM AT", "2020-04-03T20:47:16.379Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The P.E.I. government announced new financial measures at its afternoon briefing Friday and gave an economic update for the province.\nAt the end of 2019, P.E.I.'s economy was outperforming the national average leading the country in GDP growth and that momentum was projected into 2020, according to the province.\nMinister of Finance Darlene Compton said because of that, P.E.I. is in a\u00a0good position to \"bounce back\" following the pandemic.\nHowever, COVID-19 has had an impact.

That may not have been the most dramatic thing that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Friday. It may not have been even the second-most significant he said.\nBut at any other moment, it would have represented\u00a0a massive shift in the Trudeau government's policy\u00a0stance on irregular migrants.\nThe issue of people crossing into Canada at Roxham Road \u2014 and, earlier, in Manitoba \u2014\u00a0has been a political football in this country\u00a0since 2017. In the wake of Donald Trump's election, thousands made their way across the border and claimed asylum.\nConservatives cried out for those asylum seekers to be turned back and described\u00a0the situation as a \"crisis\". The Liberals, even as they discouraged people from coming, were reluctant to turn anyone away and instead treated the influx as something that could be managed.\nBut the Trudeau government had already decided this week to ban all non-essential movement across Canada's official border crossings with the United States. And now it apparently has\u00a0decided that the irregular arrival of hundreds of people at Roxham Road is not something that can be easily managed in the midst of a global pandemic.\nPublic Safety Minister Bill Blair said on Friday that anyone crossing the border would now normally be expected to self-isolate for 14 days. \"Accommodating and managing that is a difficult challenge,\" he said.\nThese are, Trudeau said, \"exceptional times.\"\nMaybe some progressive voters will be uncomfortable with what the government has done. But nobody's going to be awarding prizes right now for maintaining perfect ideological consistency.\nOn Wednesday, the government announced $82 billion in aid for individuals and businesses \u2014 and the only question anyone was asking was whether it was enough.\u00a0\nFor much of the past four years, the idea of the federal government running a $20 billion annual deficit was the subject of heated\u00a0political debate (even if most economists were unconcerned).\nTaking into account this week's spending and a significant downturn in the economy, the federal deficit is now projected to approach $80 billion. Assuming there will be a need for further federal aid, Scotiabank is projecting a deficit of $100 billion for the current year.\nBut few critics, if any, seem\u00a0willing to bat an eyelash at those eye-popping numbers. The case for spending these borrowed sums now\u00a0is obvious, of course, and the alternative \u2014 leaving households\u00a0and businesses to fend for themselves \u2014 is clearly worse.\nThe announcement about Roxham Road on Friday was overwhelmed\u00a0by two other items.\nFirst, Trudeau said that manufacturing facilities would soon be refitted to produce medical equipment \u2014\u00a0a step that was immediately compared to a \"wartime effort.\"\nSecond, Trudeau reported that the federal government has received more than 500,000 applications for employment insurance this week, compared to fewer than 27,000 such applications during the same period last year.\nThat's a breathtaking figure, the enormity of which was captured in a graph by Trevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary.\nOn Friday, Deputy Prime Minister\u00a0Chrystia Freeland also thought it necessary to talk about\u00a0how hard this moment must be for children.\n\"Speaking very personally, I would like to thank Canada's children and sympathize with them,\" said Freeland, a mother of three herself.\nA minister thinking it's\u00a0necessary to address the strain on the nation's children does more than any statistic\u00a0to underline the gravity of this moment.\n\"I know this past week has been hard on people for many reasons. Working from home while the kids are running around, not being able to visit your parents at their nursing home, not hanging out with your friends. It can take its toll,\" Trudeau said, standing again in front of Rideau Cottage, where he is both overseeing the government's response and making sure his youngest son's bathtime is still enforced.\u00a0\n\"But it is in these challenging times that we also see what we're made of.\"\nThe issues and concerns that dominated the political conversation in this country\u00a0before this\u00a0crisis erupted were not trivial ones. And those problems will still exist whenever we emerge from this dark hour. Once we make it through this, those problems might seem a little less dire than they seemed not too long ago.\n\"This past week,\" Trudeau said, \"no matter how difficult, was further proof that Canadians are generous, kind and compassionate and that should give us all hope.\"\n"}, {"author": "Chitrangada Choudhury", "title": "India's COVID-19 lockdown is among the strictest in the world but has yet to slow the spread", "description": "Phase 2 of India's lockdown includes some loosening of restrictions, but much of the economy remains shut down", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/india-lockdown-covid-1.5534551", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5537524.1587255677!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus-india-poverty.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 18, 2020 11:58 PM ET", "2020-04-20T11:43:08.496Z"], "source": null, "content": "Shortly after extending what was already one of the strictest\u00a0COVID-19 lockdowns by almost another three weeks, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured those watching his televised address\u00a0this week that \"the country is in a very well-managed position.\"\u00a0\nThe situation on the ground, however, suggests otherwise: While proportional to its population of 1.38 billion, India's COVID-19 caseload is small, it's been rising despite the lockdown and has\u00a0surpassed 16,000, with 2,154 new cases reported Saturday, the highest increase in a single day.\u00a0\nThere had already\u00a0been\u00a0reports of hunger and distress among the poor, who have been hit hardest by the lockdown, and news that the 21-day countrywide shutdown\u00a0would be extended by another 19 days\u00a0to May 3 sparked further chaos.\nHundreds of migrant\u00a0workers \u2014\u00a0angry at being locked down\u00a0with little\u00a0access to daily essentials and no income\u00a0\u2014 protested\u00a0in\u00a0the streets of Mumbai and Surat, a textile manufacturing hub in western India,\u00a0demanding authorities transport them back to their villages.\u00a0\nMigrants labours are on street in Bandra, Mumbai today, demanding either give them proper shelter, food or let them go at their natives places in Uttar Pradesh , Bihar etc <a href=\"https://t.co/ckrPPB804W\">pic.twitter.com/ckrPPB804W</a>\nRestrictions on movement\u00a0have been\u00a0strictly enforced by police and include\u00a0the shutdown of passenger trains, buses and\u00a0all domestic and international flights, as well as schools and social and religious institutions.\nThe government has allowed \"select, necessary activities\" to resume in areas that are not COVID-19 \"hotspots\" as of April 20 in addition to those already deemed essential.

In the absence of mass testing, we do not know which patient might be carrying the virus, and we are working in conditions of great risk.\"\u00a0\nOne state that seems to have used testing effectively to contain the spread is Kerala.\u00a0\nThe coastal state of 35 million on the southern tip of India has the best human development indices and public health infrastructure in the country. As soon as its first case of COVID-19 was detected on Jan. 30, the state government moved swiftly to test and contact trace, set up quarantine facilities and institute containment measures in areas reporting multiple cases.\u00a0\nThe health measures have been backed by a welfare safety net, including financial support, food rations, community kitchens and special outreach for migrant labourers.\u00a0\nKerala's approach seems to be working, with the number of active cases coming down, and the disease curve starting to flatten, the state's finance minister, Thomas Isaac, tweeted this week.\u00a0\nCOVID-19 curve of Kerala has started to flatten.

In the absence of mass testing, we do not know which patient might be carrying the virus, and we are working in conditions of great risk.\"\u00a0\nOne state that seems to have used testing effectively to contain the spread is Kerala.\u00a0\nThe coastal state of 35 million on the southern tip of India has the best human development indices and public health infrastructure in the country. As soon as its first case of COVID-19 was detected on Jan. 30, the state government moved swiftly to test and contact trace, set up quarantine facilities and institute containment measures in areas reporting multiple cases.\u00a0\nThe health measures have been backed by a welfare safety net, including financial support, food rations, community kitchens and special outreach for migrant labourers.\u00a0\nKerala's approach seems to be working, with the number of active cases coming down, and the disease curve starting to flatten, the state's finance minister, Thomas Isaac, tweeted this week.\u00a0\nCOVID-19 curve of Kerala has started to flatten.

Hundreds of thousands of people die annually of preventable diseases, such as tuberculosis and malnutrition.\u00a0\n\"Malnutrition is a significant co-morbidity for the coronavirus. If the virus spreads to the poor, or to populations such as Adivasi (indigenous communities) areas, we will have a public health disaster on our hands,\" said Ray.\u00a0\nHe urged authorities to ramp up testing.\n\"The more you test, the more lives you will save, and the sooner you will bring the country out of the lockdown.\"\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Boeing's CEO inherits 737 Max crisis created under his predecessor", "description": "David Calhoun took over Monday as Boeing's 3rd CEO in 5 years", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-new-ceo-1.5425407", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5425504.1578950875!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/boeing-new-ceo.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 13, 2020 4:39 PM ET", "2020-01-13T21:39:05.726Z"], "source": null, "content": "Changing CEOs was the easy part. Now it's up to Boeing's new leader to deal with a crisis caused by two crashes and the grounding of the company's bestselling plane.\nDavid Calhoun took over Monday as Boeing's third CEO in the last five years, following the firing last month of Dennis Muilenburg.\nCalhoun will oversee Boeing's legal strategy as it deals with dozens of lawsuits by families of the 346 people who died in crashes of the 737 Max jetliner. Calhoun's to-do-list also includes repairing Boeing's strained relationship with its chief regulator, and overseeing compensation to airline customers who cancelled thousands of flights because their Boeing jets were grounded.\nMaybe most significantly, he must try to restore the company's battered reputation and the impression that it put profit over safety.\nIn an email to employees, which Boeing made available to the public, Calhoun spelled out several priorities for 2020. First, he wrote, is safely returning the Max to service, followed by restoring trust in the company.\n\"This is a crucial time for Boeing,\" Calhoun said. \"I see greatness in this company, but I also see opportunities to be better. Much better.\"\nCalhoun said he will spend his first weeks as CEO listening to employees, customers and regulators and assuring them Boeing is on the way to meeting their expectations. Boeing declined to make him available for interviews.\nCalhoun is an experienced executive who once ran General Electric's jet-engine business and served as chairman of the Boeing board for 10 years. His fellow directors described him Monday as the right fit for CEO.\n\"With deep industry experience and a proven track record of performance, Dave is the right leader to navigate Boeing through this challenging time in our 104-year legacy,\" said Lawrence Kellner, a former United Airlines CEO who is replacing Calhoun as Boeing chairman. \"We're confident Dave will take Boeing forward with intense focus on our values, including safety, quality and integrity.\"\nBoeing is halting Max production until it knows when the Federal Aviation Administration will approve fixes that company engineers are making to the plane's software and other systems. While Boeing says it will find other work for idled employees, employees at major suppliers are not so lucky. Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for the Max, said Friday it will lay off 2,800 people.\nBoeing is so big that the loss of exports from the Max grounding is weighing on the entire U.S. economy.\n\"There is no question that the Boeing situation, it is going to slow down the GDP numbers,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday, referring to the measure of economic growth. \"Boeing is one of the largest exporters, and with the 737 Max, I think that could impact GDP as much as 50 basis points this year.\"\nFifty basis points is one-half of one percentage point. Mnuchin said on Fox News that Boeing could reduce U.S. economic growth in 2020 from around 3 per cent\u00a0(higher than many private economists forecast) to 2.5 per cent.\nIn the latest black eye for Boeing, a new batch of documents released last week appeared to show that employees hid safety problems from regulators and doubted the safety of the Max while it was in development.\n\"This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys,\" one employee wrote. In another exchange, two unidentified employees agreed that they would not put their families on a Max.\nIt is not clear when regulators will let the Max fly again. Officials who are investigating crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia have focused on flight control software that was not included on previous versions of the 737. Before both crashes, the software pushed down the plane's nose based on a faulty readings from a single sensor.\nMore recently, questions have arisen about other problems on the Max including wiring bundles that could be too close together, raising a potential risk of fire. Separately, the FAA has in recent weeks announced it wants to fine Boeing $9.3 million US for installing substandard parts on the wings of some Max jets and other 737s \u2014 more than 300 planes in all.\nBoeing's problems aren't limited to jetliners, either. Last month a Boeing spacecraft that was to dock with the International Space Station flunked its mission when it couldn't reach the right orbit above Earth.\nBoeing announced on Dec. 23 that it would replace Muilenburg. An interim CEO took over for three weeks while Calhoun, who was most recently a private-equity executive, cut ties to other companies.\nCalhoun, 62, will get a base salary of $1.4 million but potentially several million more in bonuses and stock awards, including $7 million if he gets the Max back in service.\n"}, {"author": "Benjamin Shingler", "title": "Quebec unemployment rate soars to 17%, highest ever recorded", "description": "The province's economy lost an estimated 821,000 jobs in April", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-record-job-losses-april-1.5561165", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5561166.1588947063!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/marche-central-empty-business.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 08, 2020 10:20 AM ET", "2020-05-09T00:13:45.657Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The COVID-19 crisis has wreaked havoc on\u00a0Quebec's economy, with the province recording its highest unemployment rate since at least 1976, when the data was first tracked.\nThe province\u00a0lost an estimated 821,000 jobs in April, bringing the unemployment rate to 17 per cent.\nQuebec now has the highest unemployment rate of all the provinces, according to the Statistics Canada labour survey for April.\nOnly two months ago, in February, Quebec's economy was humming along with an unemployment rate of 4.5 per cent \u2014 its lowest ever since 1976.\nQuebec, which now leads Canada in COVID-19 cases, shut down all but essential businesses on March 23 in an effort to curb the spread.\nConstruction in Quebec was particularly impacted by that shutdown, with employment in the sector declining by 39 per cent in April.\nIn all, four sectors \u2014\u00a0construction, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade and accommodation and food services \u2014 made up 59 per cent\u00a0of total job losses as compared to April 2019.\nPremier Fran\u00e7ois\u00a0Legault\u00a0has been anxious to\u00a0reopen the economy.

Even housekeeping service is reduced to only once the client has checked out.\nBeing able to return the hotel industry to what it once was is unlikely with the border closed, travel restricted between provinces and physical-distancing rules still in place \u2014 rules that have nixed\u00a0activities such as business conferences or wedding receptions,\u00a0Par\u00e9\u00a0said.\nOnce the economy does reopen, she said, there is a concern that staff won't return to work.

Last month, the U.S. placed Huawei on its \"Entity List,\" which effectively bars American companies from selling components to Huawei without government approval.\nIn the meantime, American businesses, trade groups and individuals are pleading with the administration to drop its threat to tax the remaining Chinese imports that Trump hasn't already hit with tariffs \u2014 or at least spare the particular imports that they and their customers rely on. Some are appearing in person to air their grievances in seven days of hearings in Washington that began Monday.\nA common theme in their pleas is that American businesses \u2014 not China, as Trump often asserts \u2014 must pay the import taxes the president is imposing on Chinese goods. And in the end, many of these companies will pass their higher costs on to their customers.\nTrump has already imposed 25 per cent tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports. The goal is to pressure Beijing to stop stealing American technology, forcing U.S. businesses to hand over trade secrets and unfairly subsidizing Chinese tech companies.\nEleven rounds of negotiations have failed to resolve the dispute over China's aggressive drive to surpass America's technological dominance. Businesses and investors say they hope the negotiations will gain momentum if Trump and President Xi Jinping hold a face-to-face meeting at a Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan in two weeks.\n\"Most businesses are almost praying for a solution,\" said Patrik Berglund, who tracks global trade as the CEO of Xeneta, an Oslo, Norway, a firm that provides data on the shipping industry. \"These things will have enormous consequences. We're so connected in this global world.\"\nThis week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is sure to hear more complaints when he goes to Capitol Hill. Lighthizer is to testify Tuesday to the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday to the House Ways and Means Committee. Lawmakers from both political parties have been increasingly inclined to speak out against Trump's aggressive use of tariffs.\nThey were especially alarmed last month when Trump unexpectedly threatened to impose crippling tariffs on Mexico in a push to stop the flow of Central American migrants into the United States. Trump dropped the tariff threat after Mexico agreed to do more to block the migrants.\nBut the combat with China continues. And Chinese companies are being bruised. Huawei's founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei, likened his company to a \"badly damaged plane\" because of the U.S. actions against it.\nRen said Huawei will reduce capacity and expects revenue of about $100 billion annually for the next two years, compared with $105 billion in 2018. In February, he had said the company was targeting $125 billion in 2019. Huawei's overseas cellphone sales will drop by 40%, Ren predicted.\nThe Trump administration asserts that Huawei poses a national security threat because it is beholden to China's ruling Communist Party. But American officials have presented no evidence of any Huawei equipment serving as intentional conduits for espionage by Beijing. Huawei's placement on the Entity List is widely seen as intended to persuade resistant U.S. allies in Europe to exclude Huawei equipment from their next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G.\nThe action against Huawei marked an escalation in a yearlong dispute with China. Trump's earlier tariffs largely spared American consumers by focusing on industrial goods that don't show up directly in the mall or big-box stores. But the new round would inflict financial pain on ordinary households because it will affect many consumer goods, from cellphones and computers to shoes and silk scarves.\n\"There's certainly a lot of business pressure to resolve the China trade wars,\" said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade practice at the law firm Dechert and a former U.S. Commerce Department official.\nShe added: \"The president looks at all of this as a negotiation. As we have seen, sometimes these things have a way of working themselves out as they did with his tariffs on Mexico.\"\nIf Trump does expand his tariffs to all remaining goods from China, though, it could prove costly. A report commissioned by the National Retail Federation found that American consumers would pay an additional $4.4 billion a year for clothing, $2.5 billion more for shoes and $1.6 billion more for household appliances.\nMore broadly, economists say the tariffs could weaken a U.S. economy that appears to be on shakier footing. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said the higher import taxes would leave the United States with 900,000 fewer jobs than it would have had otherwise.\n\"The U.S. economy will be flirting with recession later this year and early next,\" Zandi said.\nJeffrey Pratt, leader of the supply chain practice at the accounting and consulting firm BDO, called the looming tariffs \"a bit of gamechanger\" for his clients. Many can't afford to absorb the taxes themselves and would pass along the higher costs to their customers.\nAtlas PyroVision Entertainment in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, relies on China for 90 per cent of the fireworks it sells.\n\"Simply imposing a 25 per cent tariff will ultimately cause significant harm to our family business,\" CEO Stephen Pelkey said in a filing with the U.S. Trade Representative. \"We would be forced to pass along the increase directly to our customers.\"\nNoting that community non-profits often use the fireworks for Independence Day celebrations, Pelkey wrote: \"In most cases, a 25 per cent hike in price will force their skies to go dark on the 4th of July.\"\nBracing for the new tariffs, Yedi Houseware, a Los Angeles family business, has postponed plans to hire and move into a bigger warehouse. Bobby Djavaheri, a company executive, echoed a common complaint: The administration is taxing products \u2014 in his case, things like air fryers \u2014 that aren't made by American companies. They must be imported. So no U.S. producer benefits from the tariffs; U.S. importers just get socked with a tax.\n\"It's really dumbfounding,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Path of COVID-19 economy even harder to predict than that of virus itself: Don Pittis", "description": "Economic bounce-back depends not just on what virus does but how governments, businesses, people react", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/pittis-covid-19-economy-recovery-1.5552816", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5552817.1588375919!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canada-economy-employment-youth.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 04, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-05-04T08:00:00.636Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When we in the media ask for questions from the audience on the COVID-19 crisis, one that pops up near the top is \"when will it all end?\"\nWhether addressing the disease or its economic effect, while experts try to offer the latest evidence to help us understand, the unsatisfying honest answer is that no one really knows for sure.\nEven as we wait for fresh Canadian trade and jobs numbers this week, in many ways the economic answer to the question is the more difficult of the two. That's because the economic result depends not just on the unpredictable unfolding medical situation, but also on the results of attempts by governments, businesses and the rest of us to cope.\nWe have repeatedly seen anger expressed at the fact that medical officials or political and economic leaders have got it wrong. But in a\u00a0health and economic crisis unlike anything we have experienced before, the landscape is constantly changing.\nWATCH | Modelling suggests we're in it for the long haul:\n\"The thing is, we're working with the best evidence that we have at the time,\" said infectious disease specialist Sumon Chakrabarty on CBC\u00a0Radio's The Current last week.\nOn Friday, recession arbiter, the C.D.Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council, declared that Canada is officially in a recession. Growth figures from February released last week showed the economy was already slowing even before the Canadian lockdown had begun.\nEchoing Chakrabarty's comments on the medical outlook, the newly appointed next head of Canada's central bank, Tiff Macklem, took a similar stance from the economic point of view.\n\"The bank has to be humble about what it doesn't know,\" he said, responding to reporters' questions on Friday in an empty auditorium.\nAnd as events unfold, Macklem warned that the Bank of Canada's economists will be forced to forecast based on a range of possible outcomes that will probably change over time.\n\"The Bank of Canada has tremendous analytic economic financial capacity to analyze what's going on in the economy, and I think an important role for the Bank of Canada is to provide Canadians with as much information as it can honestly provide,\" said Macklem, \"recognizing that\u00a0we're probably going to have to look at more than one scenario.\"\nJust as the World Health Organization and Canada's Chief Public Health Officer\u00a0Dr. Theresa Tam have been accused of getting it wrong at first and changing their prescriptions to fight the virus, economic policy is taking plenty of flack as well.\nEconomists at commercial and retail banks have been chided for underestimating the severity of the effect of the pandemic on the economy.\nThe federal government has had to update its policy of economic support as each new group complained that it had been left out or shortchanged. Even then, existing plans face new criticism, such as from employers concerned that the support package means workers would rather stay home than take the jobs they offer.\nAs governments expand borrowing to pour money into the economy, no one is sure what the long-term effects will be. Some worry about deflation; others, inflation.\nSimilar to the events of the Great Recession in 2008, some critics worry attempts by central banks to flood capital markets with cash to avoid systemic failures are employing public funds to artificially boost the price of stocks, adding to the wealth of stockholders who are already better off.\nBut even if the medium- and long-term uncertainty remains for both the illness and the economy, fresh data this week will give a firmer grip on what is happening in the present.\nTomorrow's trade figures are for March, so they will give a fresher perspective than last week's GDP numbers, likely revealing how a slowdown caused by our trade partners in Asia and Europe transformed into a domestic logjam as the virus hit home.\nBut Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey report for the month of April will be the freshest economic data of all.\nAlthough Friday jobs numbers are likely to be bad, representing the first full month of the lockdown, there's a bright side. As provincial economies experiment with reopening businesses and sending employees back to work, there is a chance that this week's lows will represent a nadir. Of course, all bets will be off if it turns out we have opened up too soon, or if frustrated Canadians cause a new outbreak by mingling too quickly.\nAs our next Bank of Canada governor pointed out, at a time like this optimism is good. So long as it is tempered by realism.\n\"There is certainly a fairly optimistic scenario, that when you think of this as a natural disaster \u2014\u00a0as we recover from the natural disaster, the economy bounces back fairly quickly,\" said Macklem, who is current dean of the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\n\"But clearly, there are downside risks against that scenario.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada launching 'one-stop' site for energy-sector data and analysis", "description": "Chief statistician says project's goal is to become 'the trusted source' for such information", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/canadian-centre-for-energy-information-announcement-1.5261518", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5261554.1566931057!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/dashboard.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 27, 2019 1:43 PM MT", "2019-08-27T19:43:08.184Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The federal government is launching an online portal for information on the country's energy sector that it says will make much more data and analysis available for researchers, industry and the general public.\nDubbed the Canadian Centre for Energy Information, the project is described as an \"independent, one-stop, website\" where anyone can access \"comprehensive energy information.\"\nThe full website is set to launch later this year.

And in a country like Canada, which is highly urbanized, that's about income \u2014 having adequate income relative to the cost of living.\"\n\"The evidence shows that cash transfers and income support programs \u2014 like, for example, the Canada Child Benefit, or Old Age Security \u2014 you can see very clearly in the food insecurity statistics that those programs made a difference. They are a type of basic income, essentially.\"\nYasmeen sees COVID-19 as a chance to take these income support programs further.\n\"We need a universal, livable income floor through which nobody can fall. This is long overdue,\" she said. \"And you know what? Everyone is talking about it now \u2026 We have seen what is possible. And so this is the time now, particularly in a wealthy country like Canada, to make sure that we really use this opportunity to do it right.\"\nThe pandemic has also provided an opening to rethink how our entire food system is structured, Yasmeen added.\n\"Farmers are really hurting right now. They were already facing huge challenges \u2026 Farmer debt has doubled to $106 billion since the year 2000, according to the National Farmers Union,\" she said, adding that the challenges of making a living have meant high levels of depression and anxiety among farmers.\nThere is a need for more infrastructure and support at the local and regional levels, and a move away from our excessive orientation towards exports, Yasmeen suggested.\nCanada currently imports about 30 per cent of its food and exports about 50 per cent of what it grows \u2014\u00a0but increasing local food production would strengthen the economy and help create more jobs too, she said.\nAccording to a study on Ontario, for example, replacing just 10 per cent of the province's top fruit and vegetable imports would result in a $250-million increase in provincial GDP and the creation of 3,400 new jobs, Yasmeen added.\n\"This moment is showing our incredible interdependence internationally, but also how the current Canadian food system is oriented. And that is a system which is extremely oriented towards the export of commodities \u2026 and where we're seeing all sorts of logistical bottlenecks,\" she said.\nRather than the current over-concentration of power, where just a handful of large multinationals control our food system and create various kinds of dependencies, Yasmeen believes we need to build more resilience.\n\"There is such a thing as diseconomies of scale,\" she said, pointing out that our meat supply is at the mercy of just a few plants.\nWhat this pandemic has shown is that the biggest threat to food security is not the lack of food availability or supply \u2014 it's the nature of the supply chain itself, Yasmeen added.\n\"There was a recent study that showed that close to 60 per cent of food in Canada before COVID-19 was lost or wasted\u2026 worldwide those figures are at least 30 per cent, if not higher,\" she said.\n\"The mainstream discourse is so much about 'we have too many people, not enough food,'\" Yasmeen said. \"The ghost of Thomas Malthus from the 18th century is still alive.\"\n\"In fact, we live in a world of plenty \u2026 So the global response has to be conditioned by the evidence, which shows that this is about poverty reduction and this is also about resilience and supporting small farmers.\n\"Most of the food in the world is actually grown by very small farmers, by peasants. And they need to be supported and they need the right infrastructure so that they can stabilize and thrive.\"\nClick 'listen' above to hear the full interview.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Why Hong Kong student protests matter to markets and vice versa: Don Pittis", "description": "Financial markets are engines of prosperity but they can be destroyed", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hong-kong-markets-violence-1.5357782", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5357991.1573665649!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hongkong-protests.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 14, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-11-14T10:08:12.050Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As Hong Kong's rule of law descends into something more like a police state, the Chinese region's financial markets may be more important than many demonstrators realize.\nBy Wednesday the Hang\u00a0Seng\u00a0Index, sort of a cross between Toronto's TSX Composite and New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average, was down about four\u00a0per cent amid a week of increasing violence.\u00a0\nA four per cent decline over three days is nothing to be sneezed at in a world where that amount represents a healthy percentage gain for an entire year for Canadians saving for retirement. That the Hang Seng fell so much despite the influence of China's government-controlled companies adds to the impact.\u00a0\nAnd while the tumble represents a loss of\u00a0something in the order of $2 trillion US \u2014 from a market that earlier this year surpassed Tokyo as the world's third biggest \u2014\u00a0it is unlikely student demonstrators or many Canadians will be shedding tears for wealthy shareholders.\nIn fact, one reader objected to a column earlier this week that ended on a reference to the potential impact of the violence on global financial markets.\n\"Good piece by @don_pittis until the very end,\" the reader,\u00a0a Canadian environmentalist and social activist, tweeted.\u00a0\"Greed is the root of our woes and media keeps reminding us that cash is king.\"\nI had sympathy for the reader's comment. As Greta Thunberg\u00a0has instructed us, the clamour for endless industrial growth\u00a0may not be compatible with saving the world from terminal climate change. That said, there are many credible environmentalists who insist market forces can and will be used to improve the climate.\nAnd greed may have contributed to the mess in Hong Kong. It has been widely remarked that income disparity, high housing costs and a shortage of good jobs have been among\u00a0the early\u00a0motivations for the youthful discontent that has blown up into something so much worse.\nMy current job at the CBC is to write about economics and financial markets, so it is hard to escape the fact that anything I write about Hong Kong will include those kind of references. But the reader's tweet made me think about\u00a0how important financial markets are, specifically in the case of this dispute that has grown through mismanagement from peaceful demonstrations to pitched battles reminiscent of a war zone.\u00a0\nThe first thing to say is that, while far from perfect in their current rendition, markets remain valuable tools, that, until we invent a better system, are essential to our well-being as individuals and as a society.\u00a0Arguably they are often commandeered by elite special interests. However, while\u00a0too complex to describe all their benefits\u00a0here, financial markets also allow us to build large, useful structures and evaluate their relative worth.\nThe best financial markets, like the best ports or highway systems, are not built overnight. The most reliable ones only occur in relatively healthy societies, ones that have a well-educated workforce, functioning transportation, good housing and laws\u00a0that try to discourage corruption and\u00a0fraud. As an example of such a society, Hong Kong \u2014\u00a0with median incomes at developed-country levels, reliable courts and good services \u2014\u00a0has been\u00a0ideal.\nWhile stock markets may be the visible portion, a successful financial centre like Hong Kong is an intricate network of highly skilled humans working together in banking, law, insurance, sales, communication and a variety of specialist jobs\u00a0it is hard for most of us to imagine. Large\u00a0financial\u00a0centres are enormously valuable\u00a0for the services they provide, the local wealth they generate in terms of employment and other spin-offs.\nAs a rule, successful financial markets and the complex system required to run them do not grow up\u00a0in unstable war zones. And when stable societies crumble, markets crumble with them.\nThis is one of the reasons the current chaos in the streets of Hong Kong matters to markets and why those markets may act as a deterrence to greater police violence or the kind of invasion threatened by Chinese military police. Because the more\u00a0Hong Kong degenerates into a war zone, with battles in\u00a0the streets and buildings in flames, the harder it is for all those people to do their jobs and\u00a0the less likely the people who make the region's markets so valuable will want to stay.\nAnother reason markets make a difference to Hong Kong demonstrators is that sharply falling markets draw world attention. While the world may have grown used to months of demonstrations, falling markets act as an indicator that something new and more serious is happening.\nA third effect is the danger of serious market declines for\u00a0China. China's explosive growth means Hong Kong's share of the country's GDP has shrunk to about three per cent, but that is with only half a per cent of China's population. Recent calculations by Reuters show the region's markets continued to punch above its weight in importance to the Chinese economy, with Chinese assets in Hong Kong worth almost 10 per cent of the whole country's GDP.\n\"Losing such a massive financing channel risks destabilizing the already slowing Chinese economy, hurting confidence that the Communist Party can continue to deliver prosperity after a strong, decades-long track record,\" said the Reuters analysis.\nDe-escalating the current destructive violence with peaceful negotiations will likely be the best outcome for pro-democracy demonstrators. It would also help preserve Hong Kong's economy and its value to China.\nBut for the powerful government in Beijing, the danger of shattering\u00a0Hong Kong's\u00a0value as a vigorous financial market\u00a0due to an extended military crackdown, with the resulting\u00a0danger that it would weaken the Communist Party's grip on power, may be the strongest impetus for\u00a0Chinese government moderation.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U.S. Federal Reserve leaves rates near zero as COVID-19 savages U.S. economy", "description": "Economists forecast sharpest downturn in U.S. history this quarter", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fed-renew-pledge-1.5548953", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5549076.1588173017!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-economy.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 29, 2020 12:00 PM ET", "2020-04-29T21:16:53.765Z"], "source": null, "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve, which has pumped\u00a0trillions in emergency funding into U.S. financial markets to\u00a0stem the damage from the coronavirus pandemic, left interest rates near zero and\u00a0repeated a vow to do what it takes to shore up the economy.\u00a0\nThe central bank says the pandemic will \"weigh heavily\" on\u00a0the near-term outlook and poses \"considerable risks\" for the\u00a0medium term.\n\"The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of\u00a0tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time,\u00a0thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability\u00a0goals,\" the Fed said in a statement following a two-day policy meeting held via video conference.\nEarlier Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported the economy contracted in the first quarter at its sharpest\u00a0pace since the Great Recession, ending the longest economic\u00a0expansion in the nation's history.\nThat reflects a plunge in economic\u00a0activity in the last two weeks of March, which saw millions of\u00a0Americans seeking unemployment benefits.\nThe rapid decline in\u00a0GDP has\u00a0left economists bracing for a\u00a0record slump in output in the second quarter.\n\"If the economy fell this hard in the first quarter, with\u00a0less than a month of pandemic lockdown for most states, don't\u00a0ask how far it will crater in the second quarter, because it is\u00a0going to be a complete disaster,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief\u00a0economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in New York.\nPlunging consumer spending on the back of widespread\u00a0stay-at-home orders to curb the spread of the virus helped drive\u00a0a 4.8 per cent\u00a0decline on an annualized basis in first-quarter gross\u00a0domestic product.

Some of those people are now being rehired on the wage subsidy \u2014 but not all of them are coming back full time, he said.\n\"When you have the wage subsidy, but you have next to no revenue, the ability to keep your facilities there long term is very much in doubt,\" he said.\nWhen asked if there was a risk of YMCAs shutting down\u00a0after the pandemic, Dinsdale said it's possible.\n\"There is a risk in some locations that will be the case,\" he said, adding that's why they're turning to the government for support.\nDawna Morey is\u00a0executive director of The Lending Cupboard Society of Alberta, which loans out medical equipment.

The required increase in social spending will outpace federal transfers, the report says.\nIt predicts Manitoba could also get a smaller slice of equalization payments from Ottawa \u2014 money meant to help poorer provinces offer services similar to richer ones. Some eastern provinces might receive a larger share, and British Columbia is likely to start receiving equalization sometime around 2060 due to a slower economy.\nAs a result, Manitoba \"will progressively receive less and less equalization as a proportion of their economy.\"\nPrince Edward Island faces the largest percentage increase in health spending due to its older population, the report says, while Newfoundland and Labrador is expected to see its population decline and economy grow very slowly.\nThe report's projections about government finances are not a prediction of what is most likely to happen, Giroux stressed, but rather a look at what could happen if federal and provincial government policies remain unchanged over the long term.\nProvincial debt loads, which currently range as high as 34 per cent of provincial gross domestic product in the case of Newfoundland and Labrador, could increase dramatically, the report warns. By 2093, Manitoba's could jump to 342 per cent, Saskatchewan's to 253 per cent and Newfoundland and Labrador's to 463 per cent.\nGiroux suggests one alternative to provincial tax increases or spending cuts would be an increase in transfer payments from the federal government. Ottawa currently pays for 21 per cent of provincial health spending, but that number could slip to 17 per cent unless the funding formula is changed.\nAnother possible solution would be for Ottawa to cut its taxes and allow the provinces to raise theirs, Giroux adds.\nThe federal government has fiscal room over the long term despite its current string of deficits, he says, due partly to limits on how quickly federal expenses can rise. Some transfer payments to the provinces are capped by the rate of economic growth. Some payments to individuals, such as old age security, are tied to inflation.\n\"Most expenditures are constrained at the federal level, while at the provincial level, it's demand-driven.\"\n"}, {"author": "Riley Laychuk", "title": "'It's really tough': COVID-19 leaves Manitoba potato farmers with glut of spuds as demand plummets", "description": "Nearly one-third of Manitoba's 2019 harvest still in storage as processors cut back production", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-potato-producers-covid-19-1.5545584", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5545593.1588711972!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pat-owen-potatoes.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 27, 2020 5:00 AM CT", "2020-04-27T10:00:00.621Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "After two years of harvest losses at the hands of Mother Nature, Manitoba potato farmers are now looking at another bleak year \u2014 this time because of\u00a0COVID-19.\u00a0\nDemand has dried up at processing plants across Canada and the United States due to the closure of restaurants and bars during the pandemic, which has left Manitoba producers sitting on hundreds of millions of kilograms of potatoes with no place to go, according to Dan Sawatzky, manager of the Portage la Prairie based Keystone Potato Producers Association.\n\"We do need some help in this situation,\" he said. \"It's very difficult to handle any more losses at the grower level.\"\u00a0\nSawatzky said most of the potatoes grown in Manitoba end up being used for french fries or patties that are used in restaurants and fast-food industries.

He said, however, that he has already had his contracts with potato processors for this year's growing season cut by 15 per cent.\u00a0\nKevin MacIsaac, president of the United Potato Growers of Canada, said the effects go far beyond Manitoba.\u00a0\n\"It's an issue that's not only in Manitoba, but its an issue right across Canada,\" he said.\u00a0\nMacIsaac said many processors are still sitting on potatoes imported from the United States last fall after shortcomings in the Canadian market due to heavy fall rain and an\u00a0early dump of snow in Manitoba \u2014 which is the second-largest potato growing province in the country.\u00a0\n\"The irony is that [processors] don't need all of what they thought they needed,\" MacIsaac told CBC News, adding facilities that produce potato chips haven't seen the same crash in demand.\u00a0\n\"People like eating potato chips as comfort food when there are times like these,\" he said.\u00a0\nOnly Prince Edward Island outpaces Manitoba for potato production. Producers there also left some potatoes in the ground last fall due to weather.\u00a0\n\"It's really tough. It's really stressful for growers,\" MacIsaac said. \"They've had two years of very difficult harvests.\"\nMcCain Foods, which has two potato processing facilities in Manitoba \u2014 at Carberry and Portage la Prairie \u2014 said it has laid off workers and scaled\u00a0back production due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\n\"All\u00a0McCain potato processing plants in Canada are impacted by temporary layoffs, to varying degrees,\" read a statement emailed to CBC News.\u00a0\"The specific numbers will fluctuate by site at any point in time according to customer demands, which are changing constantly in these uncertain times.\"\n\"The situation is being monitored daily to ensure that everything that can be done, to support McCain employees through this unprecedented but temporary challenge, is being done.\"\nThe company also has potato processing facilities in Alberta and New Brunswick. It did not say how many people had been laid off in Manitoba or in Canada.\nSimplot \u2014 which announced a $460 million expansion of its Portage la Prairie potato processing facility in 2018 \u2014 didn't respond to a request for information on its operations on Friday.\u00a0\nSawatzky, Owen and MacIsaac all said they want governments to step up and offer more assistance for the industry.\nThe federal government previously announced measures to increase lending capacity, loan deferrals and funding for temporary foreign workers who have to quarantine. More aid is expected to be announced soon, a federal spokesperson told CBC News last week.\nPremier Brian Pallister, meantime, said on Friday that he has discussed agriculture with deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland and planned to address it with prime minister Justin Trudeau.\n\"This is a monumental issue for a province with a big piece of our pie chart of GDP \u2026 associated with ag,\" Pallister said.\u00a0\"Whether it's ag or related processing industries, this is an important industry for us.\"\nOwen said despite a lot of unknowns, he still has to plant a crop this year \u2014 and soon.\n\"We have a lot on the line here right now,\" he added. \"We have a lot at risk right now if these potatoes don't move.\"\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Mia Urquhart", "title": "Provincial parks, trails and other tourist attractions set to reopen", "description": "Some services may be altered or eliminated because of COVID-19 restrictions", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/covid-provincial-parks-trails-reopen-1.5568329", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3579738.1530905679!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fundy-parkway.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 13, 2020 6:16 PM AT", "2020-05-13T21:18:58.088Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "New Brunswick's tourism industry is open for business \u2014\u00a0although it's more self-serve than full-service at the moment.\u00a0\nWhile the government gave the green light\u00a0for parks, trails, campgrounds and restaurants to open, they still have to abide by the conditions for the orange phase of the province's economic recovery plan.\u00a0\nAs part of this phase, provincial parks and attractions will reopen with limited services, no events, and no programming or co-coordinated activities, said Tourism Minister Bruce Fitch on Tuesday.\u00a0\n\"There'll be some attractions that won't have some of those interactive things for them \u2026 and I'm thinking more of King's Landing or some of the Acadian villages again, where we don't want to put our staff and maybe some of the visitors at risk,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"It's going to be a little different, but I think, by and large, people will be able to enjoy the venues.\"\u00a0\nOak Bay provincial park will open Thursday, and several more will follow Friday, including Mactaquac, New River Beach, and the Fundy Trail Parkway.\u00a0\nSeveral others will open later in the month or in June, many\u00a0with reduced services.\u00a0\nFitch said\u00a0it was important to ensure proper staff training and that everything meets government guidelines, including appropriate signage and personal protective equipment for staff members.

And we are the highest indebted province in Canada right now.\"\nBut the CIBC chart cited as evidence for that has\u00a0nothing to do with per capita debt, says CIBC economist\u00a0Maria Berlettano.\n\"When you adjust for [Manitoba Hydro] debt, which is self-supported by Manitoba Hydro, Manitoba's debt actually is high, but is sort of within the average,\" said Berlettano, who heads up the bank's\u00a0Canadian government credit-strategy department.\nThe chart was included in a workforce-management\u00a0presentation made\u00a0last week to Manitoba Crown corporations, universities and other government agencies\u00a0which are now facing pandemic-related staff and spending cuts.\nIn that presentation, the provincial Treasury Board secretariat\u00a0asked those agencies and Crowns\u00a0to prepare scenarios involving 10, 20 and 30 per cent workforce reductions.\nBerlettano says the chart is complex, but was intended for institutional investors who pay for sophisticated analyses. It shows what the bond-rating agency S&P has to say about Manitoba's financial situation.\n\"It is counterintuitive because the [bar] is so high for Manitoba,\" Berlettano said.\nManitoba's actual taxpayer-funded debt burden ratio \u2014 which excludes Manitoba Hydro debt \u2014 is indicated by the red horizontal line on the yellow Manitoba bar.\nUsing this measure, Manitoba comes in\u00a0behind Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and\u00a0Newfoundland and Labrador.\nBerlettano also notes this chart does not include $45.8 billion of debt incurred by Hydro Quebec, a Crown utility that does its own borrowing. That means the chart does not compare the rankings of provincial debt when hydro-electric utility borrowing is included across the board.\nBerlettano says the chart\u00a0actually shows Manitoba in a\u00a0middling position when it comes to debt.\nManitoba's \"high\" debt rating is better than Ontario's and\u00a0Newfoundland and Labrador's,\u00a0which are rated as \"very high.\"\nIt also shows Manitoba has a \"positive\" rating alongside its A+ rating, which means there is a one-in-three chance the province will receive a credit upgrade\u00a0during\u00a0the next year or two.\u00a0\n\"The worst in Canada is Newfoundland,\" Berlettano said.\u00a0\nBond rating agency S&P (formerly known as Standard & Poor's)\u00a0no longer treats Manitoba Hydro's $21.6-billion debt \u2014 which makes up over 40 per cent of the province's $51-billion debt total \u2014\u00a0 as taxpayer-supported, according to a report authored by Berlettano.\nLast October, S&P made the determination that Manitoba Hydro's debt is no longer taxpayer-supported because \"as a regulated, vertically integrated utility with an effective monopoly position, [it] has the capacity and demonstrated willingness to repay its debt obligations as they become due.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nManitoba Hydro pays its debt through revenue generated by billing its customers.\nA recently published report by RBC shows Manitoba has the fourth-highest per capita debt, after Newfoundland, Ontario and Quebec.\u00a0\nBut Berlettano says\u00a0per capita debt is not a useful measure of debt burden.\n\"There's really only two ways to calculate a debt burden, and that's debt-to-GDP, or debt-to-revenue,\" she said.\nManitoba was in a good financial position going into the COVID-19 pandemic because it was getting close to balancing its budget.\n\"If you look at Manitoba's ratings overall, they don't signal any kind of concern \u2026 because their ratings are somewhat in the middle of the road, relative to all the other provinces,\" Berlettano said.\nShe said this strong starting position bodes well for Manitoba's future credit ratings, because the province will be compared to other jurisdictions when COVID-19 spending is taken into account.\u00a0\n\"Rating agencies are not all of a sudden going to wholesale downgrade governments all around the world,\" she said.\n\"What they're going to do is identify those that were in a very weak starting position.\"\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Lessons from the Great Crash of 1929 for investing in an ever-rising market: Don Pittis", "description": "Having escaped an October crash, can we finally talk about irrational markets?", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stocks-market-doom-1.5351368", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5351544.1573146824!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/brooklyn-daily-eagle-stock-crash-1929.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 11, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-11-11T09:00:00.843Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Phew. The dangerous\u00a0month is safely behind us, so it finally feels less risky to talk about stock market panics without being accused\u00a0of helping to precipitate another October crash.\nFor mysterious reasons October really is crash month, though in most years\u00a0markets do perfectly well during the month,\u00a0 and most analysis shows\u00a0that September is the worst overall month for stocks. But October's ominous\u00a0reputation comes well earned.\nThe bear market that stretched from 2007 to 2009 began in October, though the initial\u00a0one-day decline was moderate.\u00a0The Panic of 1907,\u00a0a three-week plunge in markets that fell by half, certainly began in October.\u00a0Indisputably, 1987's Black Monday, the largest one-day percentage market\u00a0drop and one that seemed to come out of the blue, was an October\u00a0phenomenon.\nHistorically, the Great Crash of 1929 remains the apocalyptic\u00a0touchstone of October market crashes not just for its suddenness and unexpectedness but because of what came after, namely\u00a0the crumbling of the financial system that led to the Great Depression.\nOf course getting October out of the way is no proof against sudden market plunges. A list of global market panics\u00a0shows sharp market declines can come in any month, especially when there is an external cause\u00a0that shocks investors into running for the exits.\nOne of the most disturbing parallels between now and the time of the\u00a0Great Crash is that it came in what seemed like a period of economic health. Unemployment had declined. The auto industry, a key driver of the North American economy, was still going strong.\n\"There was no reason for expecting disaster,\" wrote Canadian economist\u00a0John Kenneth Galbraith in his 1954 history of the time,\u00a0The Great Crash 1929. \"A depression, serious or otherwise, could not be foreseen when the market fell.\"\nIn his book, which I remember gobbling up in my youth, Galbraith was contradicting the conventional view that the stock market was reacting to a slowdown in the economy.\nThat's not to say that as the markets rose to dizzying heights there wasn't plenty of fear that they would eventually have to come down again. But greed had won out and\u00a0there was no special reason a crash should\u00a0happen on those particular days.\nIn a recently published extract titled What We Talk about When We Talk about Stock Market Crashes from his most recent book, Yale economist Robert Shiller, who has noted similarities between current markets and those of the 1920s, observes that the market conflagration did not have an obvious spark.\n\"Economists still puzzle over the stock market crash of Oct.\u00a028, 1929, a date on which no sudden important news occurred other than the crash itself,\" writes Shiller.\nOne interesting explanation proposed for the sudden crash was technology. Shiller himself has described the\u00a0Trans-Lux Movie Ticker, a newfangled method of projecting changing share prices\u00a0that brought awareness of rising\u00a0stocks to the masses.\nBut according to Joe Janes from the University of Washington, the real trigger for the crash was that during the initial day of declines on Oct.\u00a024, unprecedented trade volumes\u00a0due to the increased popularity of stocks meant the ticker could not keep up.\nJanes says it was well known the technology\u00a0was not up the task, but when markets were rising no one really cared.\u00a0\n\"When it started to fall, and the ticker fell behind, and then when it became clear that things were getting worse fast, it was the not knowing \u2014 and moreover not knowing what you didn't know \u2014 that helped to fuel the panic,\" says Janes in his podcast\u00a0Stock Market Ticker Tape, 1929.\nCertainly there are plenty of reasons technology could once again help destabilize the stock market. Already the proliferation of online discount trading has shown ordinary traders they have trouble exiting when markets fall suddenly.\u00a0\nAutomated trading that contributed to the Flash Crash of 2010 where markets fell 1,000 points in minutes and the market lost $1\u00a0trillion in value before bouncing back, could have a much worse effect if traders had been fearing a\u00a0wider crash. Certainly the growth of trading by artificial intelligence means people aren't really sure how the AIs will react in the next sharp market decline.\nAnother lesson from 1929 that may not have been learned is the growth of investment trusts, tradable collections of stocks that turned out not to be liquid when traders decided they wanted out. While modern exchange traded funds are not the same thing, the democratizing of share holding through ETFs that faced selling pressure on a market panic could compound market disruptions, as nervousness grows.\nOf course those are just structural reasons for a market decline. If traders decide they are flying too close to the sun, external shocks could initiate a tumble. For example, a\u00a0new and sudden outbreak of conflict in the Middle East, while good for Canadian oil producers, could destabilize markets.\nAn attack on demonstrators in Hong Kong could have an effect similar to the Tiananmen\u00a0Square crisis of 1989\u00a0that caused a sharp slide\u00a0in\u00a0Chinese GDP growth. With China's new global clout any shock to its economy would likely have a worldwide impact on markets.\nAs Edward Yardeni, chief economist and investment strategist at Yardeni Research,\u00a0has said,\u00a0\"Crashes usually happen when people are not expecting them.\"\nThe trouble is of course that one of the other lessons of 1929 is\u00a0that even after many wise people have\u00a0suggested\u00a0the market has risen too high, what Galbraith called\u00a0\"the mass escape into make-believe\" can continue to carry it much higher.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Conservation Council recommends more local food security as part of COVID-19 recovery plan", "description": "Group also calls for more protection of natural areas and more reliable, affordable electricity system ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/covid-19-conservation-council-new-brunswick-recovery-plan-1.5542646", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5332625.1571862453!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/louise-comeau.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 24, 2020 4:00 AM AT", "2020-04-24T14:13:26.821Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Conservation Council of New Brunswick is calling on the provincial government to encourage more local food security in agriculture and fisheries, to broaden protections for natural areas and water systems, and to reform the electricity system to make it more reliable and affordable.\nIt's all part of the organization's recommendations for a COVID-19 recovery plan.\nThe council marked Earth Week by sending an open letter to Premier Blaine Higgs\u00a0on Thursday focused on those three priorities.\n\"We really do think this is an opportunity for us to rebuild post-pandemic in ways that protect our health, our security, and make us safer from environmental threats as well as health threats like the pandemic,\" said\u00a0director of climate change and energy solutions\u00a0Louise Comeau.\n\"You know, going back to normal isn't going to make us safer, healthier and more resilient.

So we're looking for solutions that are better than normal.\"\nThe\u00a0seven-page letter is\u00a0not so much a \"course correction\" as it is expanding upon\u00a0existing efforts, said Comeau.\nFor example, there are already calls from farmer organizations, farmer market operators, local food security advocates, and others that the province needs to bolster food security.\nThe conservation council agrees the province needs to \"increase dramatically\" the proportion of its food from homegrown sources.\nAs it stands, only about eight per cent of fruits and vegetables are grown locally.\n\"We need a balanced mix of New Brunswick-grown\u00a0and sustainably-managed community gardens, home gardens, hobby farms, and larger agriculture operations supplying not just produce, but most of the food we eat if we want to improve food security,\" the letter states.\nIt also recommends deploying land\u00a0suitable for growing food with programming targeting young people who want to start farming in 2020 and 2021.\nAs part of the focus on food security, the conservation council also wants to see increased wage subsidies for farm workers, as well as help for inshore fisheries and the fish-processing industry.\nTo build community and ecosystem resiliency, it's calling on the government to exceed its goal of protecting 10 per cent of natural areas by 2020 and instead develop a plan to protect 25 per cent of each of\u00a0the land and marine base by 2025.\n\"We need to learn from our recent history, including two back-to-back 100-year floods of the St. John River, Hurricane Dorian and Arthur and the 2017 ice storm and move rapidly to implement protection plans that ensure natural systems can protect us from extreme weather,\" the letter states.\nThis will also help create\u00a0jobs in protection and restoration, in building trades through infrastructure projects, and temporary work such as\u00a0beach debris cleanups.\nThe plan also deals with forestry, including better\u00a0protection of\u00a0Crown lands\u00a0by decreasing the average size of clear cuts\u00a0by about 80 per cent, and replacing aerial herbicide spraying with more labour-intensive silviculture practices, such as manual thinning and Acadian forest restoration.\nUnder electricity, the conservation council recommends an action plan that would include targets and timelines.\nIt suggests immediately retrofitting 100 per cent of New Brunswick\u00a0building stock over the next six years, which it says could result in a net increase of 3,460 jobs per year and a\u00a0net increase of $730 million in GDP per year.\nPremier Blaine Higgs said Thursday he\u00a0will share the province's COVID-19\u00a0recovery plan \"in the coming days.\"\nThe province will outline a series of phases similar to Saskatchewan's plan, where different levels of services are to begin to reopen while physical distancing is maintained, and there is a limit on how many people can gather at once.\n\"There's two factors. One is in relation to allowing people to get back to their normal way of life in the\u00a0new norm\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and then the phase of, how businesses recover and the economy,\" Higgs said.\nThursday marked the fifth day in a row of no new cases of COVID-19 in New Brunswick.\nThere are 14 active cases, including five people in hospital, one of whom is in intensive care.\nTo date, 104 people across the province have recovered from the disease.\nGoing back to the way things were before COVID-19 likely isn't an\u00a0option, said Comeau.\n\"Some things are not going to recover,\" she said. \"Changes in the energy sector may not be something you can just switch back onto.\"\nPolling also indicates a shift in attitudes, she said.\nPeople are more interested in\u00a0buying local\u00a0and\u00a0seed sales are \"skyrocketing.\"\nPeople are enjoying working from home and being closer\u00a0to family.\n\"I think these social changes that have emerged during the pandemic have the potential to create permanent change and opens a window to doing things differently,\" said Comeau.\nIn addition,\u00a0governments are co-operating, people are collaborating\u00a0are feeling empathy toward each other, she said.\n\"I\u00a0think we definitely have an opportunity.\u00a0Not only should we do better than normal, but people will want us to do better than normal.\"\n"}, {"author": "Nicholas Frew", "title": "Bowman backs cities' request to feds for up to $15B for COVID-19 budget relief", "description": "Winnipeg finances relatively OK, but mayor says 'we're not immune to the crisis facing municipalities'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-cities-federal-funding-covid-19-1.5543456", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3720306.1471143662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winnipeg-city-hall.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 23, 2020 10:40 PM CT", "2020-04-24T03:40:24.821Z"], "source": "CBC", "content": "Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman is backing a\u00a0request for billions of dollars from the\u00a0federal government made by a group of Canada's municipal leaders, so cities can stave off financial crises caused by\u00a0the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe\u00a0Federation of Canadian Municipalities has asked for\u00a0between $10 billion and $15 billion over the next six months for cities from coast to coast.\n\"Cities across Canada are incredibly important economic drivers for provinces, and in fact for the entire country,\" Bowman said Thursday.\n\"Residents are depending on municipal services more than ever before.

Indeed, we knew we wouldn't, but we couldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\" Trudeau said in response to questions about holes in the government's aid programs.\nHow soon those workers can get back on the job will vary by jurisdiction as provinces and cities determine how quickly to loosen restrictions that have severely limited economic activity.

That is set to rise to $1,800, though not everyone qualifies and so far, only 40,000 Italian families have applied.\nThe implicit government expectation, said\u00a0many women, is that grandmothers will step in to help out, reflecting an antiquated grasp on Italian reality.\n\"My parents are still young and have a million interests \u2026 Finally, they have some time for themselves, and now they have to take care of\u00a0their grandchildren?

The province is taking its challenge of the federal tax to the Supreme Court.\n\"You're not going to be able to directly link exactly to the carbon tax,\" Trade Minister Jeremy Harrison told The Canadian Press in a recent interview.\n\"It is killing jobs because it's making us less competitive.\"\nOne of Premier Scott Moe's arguments against the tax is that it costs jobs.\nHarrison concedes job losses in the energy sector are not the result of any one factor, but a confluence of different issues.\nHe points to a lack of new pipelines as well as to federal legislation that overhauls how large energy projects are approved and restricts tankers off the British Columbia coast. He says those things put Canada at a competitive disadvantage compared to other jurisdictions.\nThe carbon tax is another layer, says Harrison, although he adds it's hard to measure its immediate impact over a short period of time.\nAt the same time as Saskatchewan voices its concerns, the province reports an increase of more than 12,000 mostly private-sector jobs in the last year.\nHarrison says job growth and the carbon tax's effect on employment are not \"mutually exclusive.\"\n\"The fact that we've been creating private-sector jobs outside of the energy sector, outside of the mining sector, speaks to a wonderful entrepreneurial spirit in the province.\"\nTrent Wotherspoon, finance critic for the NDP Opposition, says the government is playing \"fast and loose\" with an important file and didn't even factor in potential costs of the carbon tax in its last budget.\nAlberta comes at the numbers from a different position.\nThe NDP there brought in a provincial carbon tax when it was in power, but Premier Jason Kenney's United Conservatives got rid of it not long after they won the April election.\nAn email from the Environment Department says economic modelling estimates the repeal will create 6,000 new, full-time private-sector jobs and increase GDP by $1.3 billion.\nAlberta is also challenging the federal tax, which Ottawa says it will apply to the province in the new year.\nSome experts say not enough time has passed and not enough research has been done to know what impact federal carbon pricing is having on jobs.\nTrevor Tombe, an economics professor at the University of Calgary, points to two studies published in recent years that examine British Columbia's carbon tax.\nOne study concludes the province's revenue-neutral tax doesn't hurt employment.

They're beefing up investment in Mexico and the workers in the U.S., like in Canada, have had enough.\"\nGM's Oshawa assembly plant is set to close at the end of the year, one of five plants in North America that the auto giant is closing.\nThat is one of the key issues for the UAW in the U.S., which is pressing GM to schedule new models for the four U.S. plants it is closing.\nUnifor has pressed GM Canada unsuccessfully to extend the life of the Oshawa plant, arguing the automaker made a commitment to at least 2020 when it accepted the 2008 government bailout.\nGM is negotiating a shift toward more electric cars and investing heavily in automation, considered among the key trends in the auto industry.\nNorth American car sales have boomed in the past three years, but are stagnating this year as young consumers put off owning vehicles.\nBut GM made $8 billion in\u00a0profit in 2018 and the UAW is arguing it deserves a wage hike and better benefits to share in the good fortune.\nIt's not just GM plants here in Canada, but also other auto-parts makers that could be affected.\nThat's one reason\u00a0Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, hopes the dispute will be quickly resolved.\nWithin three or four days, it starts affecting people's shifts, Volpe told Bloomberg.\nThe last strike by the UAW was in 2007, and it only lasted 17 hours, so there was not much impact on Canadian operations.\nBefore that a strike at just two major parts plants in Flint, Mich., in 1998 that lasted 54 days eventually shut down much of GM's North American operations.\nA long strike could have a big impact on Canadian workers.\u00a0But it might not significantly affect the Canadian and U.S. economy.\nIf the strike lasts\u00a0to the end of September, it would take\u00a0only 0.1 per cent off annualized U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter, according to CIBC economist\u00a0Avery Shenfeld.\n\"Impacts on Canada would be even more modest.\u00a0Just to give a sense of scale, in the unlikely case where the strike lasts\u00a0through [the fourth quarter] in its entirety, it would subtract a more meaningful 0.7 per cent off that quarter's annualized pace in the U.S., and take a bit of a shine off Canada as well.\"\n"}, {"author": "Nick Boisvert", "title": "Canada's manufacturing heartland faces 'bumpy road' back, uncertain future after COVID-19", "description": "Ontario lost more than 31,000 manufacturing jobs in March, far more than any other province", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-manufacturing-the-covid-economy-1.5533617", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4566068.1520447260!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/steel-worker-sparks-modular-farms.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 16, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-04-16T12:58:08.407Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of\u00a0The COVID Economy,\u00a0a CBC News series looking at how the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic is affecting jobs, manufacturing and business in regions across Canada.\nIt was in late March that a prominent national trade association released a bleak report forecasting the worst year for Canadian manufacturers since the Great Recession of 2008.\nA little more than two weeks later, the group's president and CEO says the dire warning may be in need of an update.\n\"I think that might have been optimistic,\" said Dennis Darby, president and CEO of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters (CME), which is forecasting a 5.7 per cent decline in output for 2020, after more than a decade where growth ranged from around \u20131\u00a0to four per cent.\n\"It all depends on the speed at which Canada and the U.S. come back.\"\nWith the novel coronavirus still wreaking havoc on health care systems and interventions to slow its spread choking\u00a0the economy, Canada's manufacturers are simultaneously riding out an unprecedented shock while also planning for an uncertain future.\nIn Ontario, which accounts for nearly half of Canada's manufacturing output, the drop in production has already contributed to the loss of 31,600 jobs, according to Statistics Canada's labour survey for March.\nBy contrast, Quebec, Canada's second largest manufacturer, lost only 1,200 manufacturing jobs in March, though employment figures are expected to fluctuate as new data becomes available.\nWhile most of Ontario's auto assembly plants have been temporarily closed due to the virus, a host of other facilities\u00a0remain open, including\u00a0those in food production and medical manufacturing. Darby says many of them are struggling due to dwindling cash flow and disruptions to their supply chains.\n\"It's regrettable and it's caused a lot of damage,\" he told CBC News.\nDarby recognizes that productivity won't return to typical\u00a0levels until international trade returns to normal, trading partners begin to reopen their economies and consumers start buying things again. For some, it may never return.\nThe list of variables doesn't seem poised to stabilize for the foreseeable future.\n\"That's the great unknown right now,\" he said.\nThe blow to Ontario's manufacturing industry comes on the heels of a steady decline that had already weakened the sector, which accounts for more than 12 per cent of Ontario's GDP.\n\"Heading into the virus, [Ontario manufacturing] was in a little bit of a tough spot,\" said Rishi Sondhi, an economist at TD Bank.\nNationally, manufacturing sales had declined for five straight months leading to January, a stretch that included the closure of GM's Oshawa assembly plant in December 2019 and, later, rail blockades in support of the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs that hobbled freight train traffic.\nRead other stories in the series:\nRishi says manufacturing activity has \"severely\" contracted during the pandemic. TD Bank expects the sector to begin a recovery in the second half of 2020, though there are many questions still unanswered about what the process will look like.\n\"I think it's safe to say demand will remain muted for some time yet,\" Rishi said. \"It will be a bumpy road.\"\nThe province has pledged to help struggling businesses of all types recover, in part through its new Jobs and Recovery Committee, which has started work on a post-pandemic plan.\nPremier Doug Ford has also promised to \"ignite a fire\" and jump-start the provincial economy when it is safe to do so, but there are no details yet on how this will be achieved.\nThere is also a belief that Ontario's manufacturing sector could be irrevocably changed after the COVID-19 pandemic, and perhaps in some ways that will make the industry stronger.\nDarby said the crisis has revealed the extent to which Ontario relies on supplies and goods from other regions, and the possibility that we could start producing\u00a0some of\u00a0them in the province.\u00a0\nFor instance, in the face of shortages of medical equipment, some Ontario manufacturers altered their facilities to produce goods such as hand sanitizer\u00a0and medical scrubs, while others have pledged to start building ventilators.\nDarby said the quick mobilization of Ontario companies shows untapped potential that could be accessed through faster approvals and fewer regulations.\n\"If we can do it under crisis, maybe we should do it all the time,\" he said.\nSondhi warns that large structural changes may not extend to industries more reliant on international supply chains, such as the auto sector.\nHe also notes that manufacturers may have to enforce physical distancing rules in their plants for many more months, a restriction that will\u00a0weaken efforts at restoring productivity.\n"}, {"author": "Murray Brewster", "title": "NATO defence ministers take stock of pandemic's economic toll on national budgets", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid19-defence-budgets-1.5533587", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5383440.1575446578!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/nato-summit.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 15, 2020 5:21 PM ET", "2020-04-15T22:49:22.630Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "NATO defence ministers took stock Wednesday of the economic damage raining down on allied countries because of the pandemic crisis \u2014 and considered the disease's ability to blow vast holes in national defence budgets.\nThe military alliance's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, acknowledged the obvious in a teleconference with journalists following a virtual meeting of defence ministers from 30 member nations.\n\"Of course there will be economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"We've seen a significant reduction in GDP.

Too optimistic, in my humble opinion, and I can understand why,\" Momani said.\nMomani says the world's poorest people, not just in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and South America\u00a0but in U.S. inner cities, too, will suffer the most, and in ways that could lead to revolts. Places such as\u00a0Venezuela, already chaotic, may collapse into something worse.\nShe says the IMF, which is structured to be able to help individual countries when they suffer from unique problems, is not equipped to help everyone at the same time.\nIt would be\u00a0like if an insurance company, which is perfectly prepared to help\u00a0a client\u00a0in the very unlikely event their house is damaged in a fire, was\u00a0suddenly overwhelmed by a forest blaze that burned\u00a0out everyone in the area.\u00a0In the current crisis, the economy\u00a0of every country in the world will be affected by the coronavirus\u00a0and the lockdown to prevent its spread.\nIt may be no surprise that Argentina is on the way to its ninth default on its sovereign debt as it asks the IMF for help. But this time, Argentina will not be alone.\nIn Italy, for example, high levels of national debt have been overlooked in the past because of the country's large output of goods and services, Momani says.\u00a0But now, with a production collapse, Italy is facing a sovereign debt default of its own.\n\"There's no other solution,\" says Momani. \"It has nothing but, you know, basically\u00a0asking for an IMF full-on sovereign debt rescue package akin to what we saw with Greece and Argentina.\"\nBut, she says, with half of IMF members already putting in requests for money, and fewer alternative sources of cash, there won't be enough to go round.\nThat's why James Boughton, senior fellow with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Waterloo-based think-tank, says wealthy governments must authorize the IMF to extend the use of special drawing rights\u00a0(SDRs), non-dollar currency units held by the fund.\nAccording to a recent report by Soumaya Keynes, who happens to be a relative of John Maynard Keynes, the economist who helped conceive SDRs, such a plan faces hurdles that could delay it for months.\n\"Most important,\"\u00a0she writes, \"America is reluctant to issue any SDRs at all, let alone $4 trillion worth.\"\nBoughton, who has written two histories of the IMF, says there is growing support for an increase in the fund's resources.\n\"But it's not a slam dunk,\" he says.\nBoughton worries that the world's recent move toward every-country-for-itself thinking could lead to a calamity much worse than the IMF's latest projected $9-trillion loss in global output, which he fears would block an economic recovery in 2021.\nAnd while everyone will suffer, he expects, like Momani,\u00a0that the poorest people in the poorest countries will bear\u00a0the brunt of it. Despite the cancellation of some debts by the IMF and the World Bank, more will need to be done by the world's wealthiest countries to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe that we will live to regret, he says.\n\"The potential for a real disaster here is enormous.\"\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\nMore by Don Pittis\n"}, {"author": "Jessica Wong", "title": "Post-secondary schools face rough autumn if pandemic keeps foreign students away", "description": "Already strained by COVID-19, institutions could be further challenged by lack of new students", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/post-secondary-enrollment-1.5554348", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5556433.1588705657!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/still-shots-of-empty-and-nearly-empty-ryerson-and-u-of-toronto-campuses.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 07, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-05-07T08:00:00.051Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Having imagined coming to Canada since her teen years, Fabiana Costa was living her dream. A former lawyer, the Brazilian student began the international transportation and customs program at Toronto's Seneca College in 2019 and found a part-time job in the industry that was helping her pay expenses and save for her tuition.\u00a0\nThen COVID-19 hit.\nCosta's campus closed, classes moved online and she lost her part-time job. She said she doesn't qualify for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and, because she's neither a citizen nor a permanent resident, can't access student loan programs like the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP).\nThis month, the approximately $7,000 bill for her final, three-month semester in Toronto comes due.\n\"I want to finish my school and if I don't have money to pay, I can't,\" she said. \"Now what am I going to do here? I [will] have to go back to Brazil.\"\nIn the past decade, international students \u2014\u00a0typically charged at least double the tuition paid by domestic students \u2014 have become a vital part of Canada's post-secondary system. But with closed campuses and borders threatening new enrolment and schools anticipating significant budget cuts, Canadian universities and colleges are bracing for rough semesters ahead.\u00a0\n\"All universities\u00a0\u2014 like all Canadians \u2014 want to get back to normal as quickly as we can, but some of that is outside our control,\" said Universities Canada president Paul Davidson, whose association represents public and private universities across the country.\nWhat happens with international students is a definite concern, as they represent about 50 per cent, on average, of total tuition revenue, according to Davidson. In its recent international education strategy plan, the federal government reported foreign students contributed an estimated $21.6 billion to Canada's GDP in 2018 and that, between 2014 and 2018, the number of international students studying in Canada increased by 68 per cent.\n\"One of things that people have not noticed over the last decade or so is that governments, both federal and provincial, now fund less than 50 per cent of the cost of higher education,\" Davidson said.\nHe added that the economic impact of international students \u2014 not just tuition fees but also rent, groceries, transportation, entertainment and more \u2014 is as important to Canada as the contributions of industries like softwood lumber, wheat or auto parts.\u00a0\n\"This really matters to communities large and small across the country.\"\nThe loss of these students can be severe. Davidson pointed\u00a0to 2018, when Canada lost a cohort from Saudi Arabia amid a diplomatic dispute. After helping students return home, schools then faced the decision of which classes, labs and other resources to cut, he said, since it was the presence of these students that helped finance those offerings.\nThe federal government has made temporary provisions for foreign students, including exempting those previously approved for a study permit from travel restrictions into Canada, loosening some eligibility restrictions for the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program and allowing them to work more than 20 hours a week if providing essential services during the pandemic.\nCanada remains \"a hot target for international students,\" because of a high-quality education system, welcoming society, overall safety and favourable post-grad work permits,\u00a0Davidson said.\n\"Students very much want to come to Canada. If they can begin their studies online [while still at home], that will make a big difference even if they can't come immediately in September. It will open the doors and get them on the path to completing their studies,\" he said.\nAside from the ongoing work overhauling programs for a multitude of teaching scenarios this fall, many schools are anticipating a different landscape \u2014 especially institutions now used to welcoming students\u00a0from abroad.\nCape Breton University is one of them. In the last few years, it\u00a0has nearly doubled its student population from about 3,000 to 5,500, due to international students studying in programs such as business, hospitality and engineering.\nCBU is rare among Canadian universities in that\u00a065 per cent of its student population hails\u00a0from abroad. At larger schools that attract international students, for instance\u00a0University of British Columbia or Montreal's\u00a0McGill University, that percentage runs closer to 30 per cent of the total student population.\u00a0\n\"In the fall, if we can't run in-person classes at all, if we're only online, I suspect we will have a drop in domestic enrolment,\" said\u00a0Cape Breton University Prof.\u00a0Scott Stewart, who is also president of the Association of Nova Scotia University Teachers and former president of the Cape Breton University Faculty Association.\u00a0\nHe added that he believes there's \"no chance\"\u00a0borders will be opened up for international students.\nIn a recent letter to faculty, CBU officials suggested the school could have a $45-million shortfall because of COVID-19. Even if the figure is closer to $10 million or $20 million, \"it's a terrible hit that can't possibly be dealt with in any way but some fairly substantial job layoffs for faculty, academic support, maintenance, you name it. It would be quite devastating,\" Stewart said from North Sydney, N.S.\nWith many post-secondary institutions located in smaller towns, schools are major employers. Layoffs can be \"destructive not just to the universities themselves, but a huge economic hit for the communities,\" he said.\nStewart is part of a Nova Scotia coalition of faculty unions and student groups now calling for financial support from universities and governments.\nThey want:\nOther Canadian post-secondary faculty groups have similarly called for government aid.\n\"We're asking for universities themselves to accept that they may run deficits this year, just like the federal and provincial governments are doing, municipal governments are doing,\" Stewart said.\nBut it's an ask that could be more difficult for some schools to manage. Grappling with the pandemic this spring has already challenged Sudbury, Ont.'s Laurentian University, said\u00a0president Robert Hach\u00e9.\u00a0\n\"We've had residences that have closed early. We've had to refund fees. We have recreation facilities that are no longer generating revenue. Overall, that has put a strain on our finances,\" he said.\u00a0\nWith still so many unknowns about reopening this fall, school administrators are deep into planning different scenarios: a mix of approaches ranging from online-only learning to in-person sessions with limited numbers of students.\u00a0\nHowever, \"if we have fewer enrolments, we can expect to have fewer sections of each of our courses.\u2026 We may even have to reduce the total number of courses that we offer,\" Hach\u00e9 said.\u00a0\n\"We're working very hard to keep our university as whole as possible and that means maintaining employment levels as high as we possibly can, because we do see coming through the end of this\u2026. At the same, with the revenue shortfalls that we're seeing, we have started to cut back on things like part-time work, contract work,\" he said.\nHowever, the goal for all post-secondary institutions is to ensure safe, secure and flexible learning environments for students, said\u00a0Hach\u00e9, adding\u00a0that\u00a0he and his peers have been in discussion with provincial and federal authorities.\u00a0\n\"What can [governments] do to support us in encouraging students to come, to stay in school, to come back to school this fall? I think that's really what it's all about: how we can maintain the registrations, because really this is for the future of the province \u2014 for the future of the country \u2014 to have a strong population of university graduates.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Feds announce $2B for women who operate their own business", "description": "Federal government has goal of doubling women-led Canadian businesses by 2025", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/women-entrepreneurship-strategy-announcement-1.5226056", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5226097.1564148093!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/wes-funding-announcement-in-regina-july-25.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 26, 2019 7:57 AM CT", "2019-07-26T13:57:57.688Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The federal government announced there is a new $2 billion fund for businesses led by women in Canada.\u00a0The goal of the program is to\u00a0double\u00a0the number of businesses owned and run by women by 2025.\nThe Women Entrepreneurship Strategy (WES) announced the first batch of money \u2014 more than $4.6 million \u2014 for businesses in Saskatchewan.

It's leading some economists to call on the government to prioritize some tools over others, and to consider at least one unprecedented economic strategy.\nThe unredacted portions of the memo don't cite any specific recession warning signs\u00a0\u2014 but the document does note that, since the 1970s, Canada has experienced four significant recessions, one per decade. Canada's last recession happened in 2008-09, triggered by the U.S. housing bubble.\n\"Of note, Canada has never experienced a significant recession that was not also suffered by the United States,\" the briefing note says.\n\"On average, since the 1970s, recessions in Canada resulted in the equivalent of 550,000 job losses and a 4 per cent decline in real GDP.\"\nNow, the fallout from the United Kingdom's protracted political brawl over leaving the European Union, trade disputes between the U.S and other countries and the ongoing protests in Hong Kong have some business analysts\u00a0predicting economic turmoil.\nThe\u00a0latest GDP figures\u00a0show Canada's economic growth in the third quarter slowed due to a drop in exports. Statistics Canada reported last week that Canada's real gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 1.3 per cent in the last three months, compared with 3.7\u00a0per cent in the previous quarter.\nThe briefing note gives Morneau an overview of\u00a0the tools he and Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz could use in the event of an economic downturn. They include\u00a0reducing interest rates below zero\u00a0\u2014 so-called \"negative\" interest rates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0increasing government spending, offering more grants to businesses and households and increasing the money supply through quantitative and credit easing.\nThe memo outlines the \"proposed sequencing of policy tools should Canada experience a recession.\" The details are blanked out in the document obtained by CBC News because, since they contain advice by or for\u00a0a government institution or cabinet minister, they are exempted from access laws.\nEconomists who spoke with\u00a0CBC News said the Department of Finance and the Bank of Canada can't expect the playbook they used the 2008-09 recession to work next time.\nConference Board of Canada Chief Economist Pedro Antunes said strategies such as lowering interest rates (already at record lows) and quantitative easing weren't as effective as expected during the last downturn \u2014 and won't help pull Canada out of the next economic downturn, either.\n'Quantitative easing' involves\u00a0central banks buying assets\u00a0such as government and corporate bonds from commercial banks and financial institutions, increasing the supply of money in the system. The goal is to lower interest rates and leave financial institutions flush\u00a0with cash, which (in theory)\u00a0should allow them to lend more to stimulate economic activity.\n\"We really didn't see that having a big impact globally or in Canada, in terms of driving investment,\" Antunes said. \"It was more of a consumer-led kind of recovery.\"\nAntunes and other economists said stimulus backfired in the last recession: instead of expanding their businesses and hiring more people, businesses seemed to hoard the injection of new money created through the monetary policy of central banks.\nAlthough the briefing note touches on this point, Antunes\u00a0said he would have liked to see infrastructure investment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which spurs private sector\u00a0spending and job creation\u00a0\u2014 play a more prominent role in the government's recession toolkit.\nThe Fraser Institute, however, argues that since it takes years for infrastructure projects to get built, they're not that useful\u00a0in fighting recessions. The centre-right think tank points out that, before workers are hired and the first shovel hits the ground, such projects have to go through feasibility studies, design changes, legislative funding allocations\u00a0and consultations with Indigenous communities, provinces, territories and municipalities before they even make it to tender.\n\"I think the evidence is overwhelmingly clear that it's almost impossible to do that in a short period of time,\" said Jason Clemens, the Fraser Institute's executive vice president. \"And so, by the time those projects get shovels in the ground, the recession is over.\"\nThe Liberal government isn't helping matters by racking up back-to-back deficits, which could tie its hands when the next recession hits, Clemens said.\nThe sections of the briefing note that are not blacked out say nothing about how\u00a0the Liberals would manage deficits and debt during a recession.\nClemens said the government should rely on automatic stabilizers like Employment Insurance \u2014 which ramps up spending when the number of jobless Canadians increases\u00a0\u2014 to keep the economy on an even keel.\nBut David Macdonald, an economist with the\u00a0Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives,\u00a0said EI doesn't always help the people who need it most because some Canadians \u2014 the self-employed and workers who don't receive enough hours \u2014 don't qualify for benefits.\nThat's why he and at least one European economic think tank are calling for an \"unprecedented\" response to the next recession: central banks, working with finance ministers, giving money directly to businesses or citizens. Governments typically deliver such benefits to citizens, not the Bank of Canada.\n\"Everyone gets $100 or $200 a month, or lower-income families get more and upper-income families get less,\" Macdonald said.\nEconomists acknowledge this \"helicopter money\" concept is an extreme form of economic stimulus. Still, it's been suggested by former U.S. Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke as a strategy to fight deflation.\n\"This is something that's starting to be discussed but hasn't been implemented,\" Macdonald said. \"But I think these are the types of things that the Bank of Canada is certainly thinking about going into the next recession.\"\nEconomist and columnist Erica Ifill\u00a0notes the toolkit doesn't seem to have anything to say about the sorts of\u00a0targeted regional strategies the government or the Bank of Canada could undertake to stimulate regional economies.\n\"I don't see in the briefing note the economic position of the West and any analysis around that,\" Ifill said. \"I'm really concerned with the West suffering, as they are right now, that the federal government is not looking at them as a specific case.\"\nIfill is calling on both the federal government and the Bank of Canada to consider economic stimulus packages tailored for Canada's regions.\nA Department of Finance spokesperson downplayed the significance of the memo, saying that economic growth in Canada remains stable\u00a0and unemployment is low.\n\"This note provides an update on the department's work on the general mechanics of the federal government toolkit to respond to potential slowdowns in the economy,\" said ministerial spokesperson Pierre-Olivier Herbert.\n"}, {"author": "Haley Ryan", "title": "Province's employment numbers dropped 25,000 in first impact of COVID-19", "description": "'The health-care problem is one side of this.

Erjavec expects sales to be down $440 million for the second quarter of 2020.\n\"We're going to be decimated,\" Erjavec said, adding that many full-service restaurants haven't been able to make the jump to takeout or delivery that is now the\u00a0only option.\nErjavec said these job losses and closures have quite the \"ripple effect,\" since each dollar spent in the restaurant industry triggers $1.85 in spending in the rest of the community.\nWhen asked about the Labour Force Survey in the COVID-19 press conference Thursday, Premier Stephen McNeil agreed it has yet to capture the \"full impact\" of what's happening in the province.\nHowever, he thanked those people still out working and following the physical distancing protocols. He added the province is hoping to pull forward infrastructure projects in the coming months to help the economy rebound when restrictions are eased.\n\"I have every bit of confidence that once we see our way through this pandemic, Nova Scotia's entrepreneurs will do what they've always done \u2014 start to rebuild and their government will be there with them,\" McNeil said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Russia cuts off oil supplies to Belarus as economic talks collapse", "description": "Belarus relies on Russia for 80% of energy needs, hosts pipeline that Russia uses to export oil", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russia-belarus-dispute-1.5414064", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5414079.1578069208!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/russia-belarus.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 03, 2020 11:49 AM ET", "2020-01-03T16:49:08.711Z"], "source": null, "content": "Russia has halted oil supplies to Belarus as talks on strengthening economic ties remained stalled over concerns that Russia could effectively swallow up its neighbour.\nIn a case that has echoes of Russia's relationship with Ukraine before it annexed the Crimean Peninsula, Belarus's state-owned oil company said Friday that Moscow has stopped supplying crude until contracts for this year are drawn up. Belarus's\u00a0two main refineries were operating at low capacity, running on reserves.\nRussian oil company Transneft confirmed the suspension, which does not affect oil transit to Europe or the supply of natural gas.\nLater on Friday Belarus suspended its oil exports, which contribute up to 20 per cent\u00a0of annual GDP. State-owned oil company Belneftekhim said there were enough reserves to cover the country's needs.\nBelarus relies on Russia for more than 80 per cent of its overall energy needs, including gas. Over 90 per cent of its crude oil imports come from Russia. And it has been has been relying on discounted prices and loans from Russia for more than a quarter century.\nBut it has one point of leverage: Russia depends on Belarus to ship oil to wealthier markets in the rest of Europe. About 10 per cent of Western Europe's oil supplies come from Russia, via a pipeline transiting Belarus.\nThe Kremlin has recently increased pressure on its ally, raising energy prices and cutting subsidies. It argues that Belarus should accept closer economic integration if it wants to continue receiving energy resources at Russia's domestic prices.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusan President Alexander Lukashenko held two rounds of talks in December, but failed to reach an agreement on deeper integration and on\u00a0oil and gas prices.\nPutin said Russia was not ready to \"subsidize\" energy supplies without a closer economic integration with Belarus, and Lukashenko insisted he would not sign off on the integration until the issues with oil and gas supplies were resolved.\nIn late December, Lukashenko ordered his government to look for alternative oil suppliers, though in practice that will be difficult considering the country's near-total reliance on Russia.\nThere are concerns in Belarus that the economic discussions are a plot by Russia to swallow up Belarus. Those concerns have been fuelled by Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its support for separatist insurgents in eastern Ukraine.\nBefore relations soured completely with Ukraine, Russia had likewise used energy supplies as political leverage to keep the country in its economic orbit and from developing closer ties with Europe.\nThere also has been speculation that Putin, who has been in power for nearly two decades, could contemplate a merger with Belarus as a way to stay at the helm of the new union state of Russia and Belarus after his current Russian presidential term expires in 2024.\nLukashenko repeatedly rejected the idea, vowing that his country would never become part of Russia.\n\"Russia has started to strong-arm Minsk by trying to get Belarus's Soviet-style economy off its oil needle, but Lukashenko is fighting really hard, as he doesn't want to become a Russian governor,\" said Alexander Klaskovsky, a Minsk-based political analyst.\n"}, {"author": "Sa\u0161a Petricic", "title": "The man, the myth: How Xi Jinping's rise from village life explains China's ambitions", "description": "'To believe in the Chinese flag is to believe in President Xi,' says one Communist Party member", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/xi-jinping-global-ambition-1.5373557", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5373681.1574785130!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/xi-jinping-billboard.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 27, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-11-29T18:30:01.266Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of a CBC News series exploring China's expanding influence around the world and how Canada and other countries are contending with China's power.\nThey come by the busloads to the rugged hills of Shaanxi Province, more than 2,000 political pilgrims a day, to trace the steps of Chinese President Xi Jinping through the dusty yellow soil where the seeds of his cult of personality now grow.\nIn tiny Liangjiahe village, 850 km southwest of Beijing, Communist Party officials obediently line up to hear legends of how Xi once waded barefoot into freezing water here to help locals clear ice dams\u00a0(\"It was a good sign that he could bear hardships!\"). They come to see the cave where he slept, following the centuries-old living traditions in this part of China.\nAnd they read the slogans representing life lessons the military tour guides say Xi learned, such as \"struggle hard and be self-reliant\" \u2014 the same imperatives the party now preaches to 1.4 billion Chinese.\nXi arrived in Liangjiahe half a century ago from Beijing as a bewildered 15-year-old. Like other young city dwellers, he had been sent \"down to the countryside\" \u2014 as Chinese leader Mao Zedong ordered at the time \u2014 in order to toughen his comfortable urban roots.\nXi's father, once a party propaganda chief and then vice-premier, had been purged during Mao's Cultural Revolution in the 1960s. He was in prison when Xi was shipped off alone to Liangjiahe. Xi spent five years in the countryside before starting university back in Beijing\u00a0and then beginning his climb up the party ladder.\nThese days, political lectures are held throughout Liangjiahe for party members, including committees that exist in most Chinese companies. What is said during these talks, we were told on the tour, must remain secret, as we were followed closely by police and warned not to interview anyone.\nSuch is the sensitivity surrounding Xi's image, policies and even his persona that today's China has adopted.\n\"To believe in this [Chinese] flag,\" said Liu Ming Fu, \"is to believe in President Xi.\"\nLiu is a former instructor of political thought at China's military college and one of 90 million members of the Communist Party. He lives in Beijing, and has carefully arranged tributes to Xi \u2014 mementoes and books of his thoughts \u2014 on a table in his apartment.\n\"As soon as he came to power, he promoted the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of our nation,\" Liu said. \"He seized the hearts of all of us.\"\nXi assumed the role of \"Paramount Leader\" in 2012, which involved first becoming chairman of the Communist Party, then the Central Military Commission, and finally a president who did away with term limits so he could rule as long as he wants. And he made national pride his rallying cry.\nAs the official story goes, Xi's path from the village to the centre of power echoes China's struggle to overcome poverty and humiliation to become a global force.\nWhile tanks and nuclear missiles rolled through the streets of Beijing last month in a parade marking the 70th anniversary of the Communist Revolution, Xi stood in front of the Forbidden City to declare, \"No force can ever shake the status of China, or stop the Chinese people and nation.\"\nChina's \"miserable fate of being poor and weak and being bullied and humiliated in over 100 years\" is over, he said, referring to occupations and military losses to Japan, Britain and others.\nIndeed, the lines of soldiers who stood in front of him \u2013 with their high-tech weaponry \u2013 were a force no one had ever seen before in China.\nIt's one Beijing has been determined to use, for example, to reclaim the entire South China Sea on the basis of \"historical precedent,\" ignoring protests and counter-claims from China's neighbours. The government has also ignored the ruling of an international tribunal in The Hague calling Beijing's actions \"unlawful,\" prompting accusations that it is \"bullying\" smaller nations.\nXi's aim is to reintegrate lost territories like Hong Kong, despite any local resistance, and to retake the self-ruled, democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward Chinese province \u2014 possibly by force.\nWATCH: Sa\u0161a Petricic\u00a0tours the village that shaped Xi\u00a0Jinping:\nHe also wants to make China the world's undisputed economic power. After years of incredible growth, World Bank figures show the country is on the cusp of overtaking the U.S. economically. China's nominal gross domestic product (GDP) is $13.41 trillion US\u00a0while the United States sits at $20.49 trillion. But if you measure GDP using purchasing power parity, China's economy has already hit $25.27 trillion, surpassing the U.S.\nThis remains a challenge because China's growth rate \u2013 about six per cent annually \u2013 is half of what it was in the early 2000s.\nXi's ambitious project to build a half-trillion-dollar global network of roads, railways and sea links throughout Asia to Africa and Europe would allow Chinese exports to flow to even more places, more efficiently.\nThis so-called Belt and Road Initiative would also spread Chinese influence \u2014 and potentially control \u2014around the world. In short, China aspires to equal or better the U.S. in every way.\nXi's personal rise took him through the party apparatus, step by step through different regions and posts, as he positioned himself for the top job. Once there, he consolidated power, initially cultivating a friendly \"Uncle Xi\" image (or \"Xi dada\" in Mandarin), but turning progressively tough and dictatorial.\nHe has moved harshly to rein in any possible dissent from Muslim Uighurs by jailing more than a million in so-called work camps. He has shut down churches and locked up human rights activists.\nThat has made him enemies within his own party, \"factions that may be ready to challenge him,\" said historian Zhang Lifan, a former member of China's prestigious Academy of Social Sciences and a rare voice in the country willing to criticize Xi publicly.\n\"China's one-party dictatorship is very difficult to sustain,\" Zhang said. \"While people all over the world are working toward freedom and democracy, he's calling for dictatorship and despotism. This has no future.\"\nWhile Xi has purged opposing voices inside and outside the Communist Party, there are some who still challenge his vision.\n\"Xi is full of fantasies,\" Zhang said. \"He lives in the illusion of building a great world empire and replacing the U.S. This is the so-called Chinese dream, but it's too huge and unrealistic. It's just a dream.\"\nNot so, China's leaders have insisted. They point to their country's rise, which has been as dramatic as Xi's own from his days in the village.\nAnd yet, the permanence of all this prosperity is not guaranteed. China's economy is slowing and its military is largely untested.\nThe ambitious climb to great power status also faces growing international resistance \u2013 a trade war with the U.S., charges of espionage and technology theft, diplomatic disputes with countries (including Canada) that have led to accusations of \"hostage diplomacy\" as China arrests foreigners in retaliation for perceived unfairness.\nBut Xi has convinced his people that, like his sacrifices in the village, all of this is necessary for China to take the place it deserves on the world stage, to fulfill the Chinese dream.\n\"China may not be the United States,\" said Communist Party member Liu, \"but we are competing hard and catching up.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada Pension Plan board president says the retirement fund is safe, despite economic downturn", "description": "\u2018This is one thing they should take off their list to worry about,\u2019 says Mark Machin", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-april-3-2020-1.5520333/canada-pension-plan-board-president-says-the-retirement-fund-is-safe-despite-economic-downturn-1.5520544", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5521335.1585945019!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cppib-canada-pension-20200214.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 03, 2020 5:41 PM ET", "2020-04-06T13:44:00.561Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Read Story Transcript\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the global economy, the president of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board says Canadians' CPP contributions are safe.\n\"This is one thing they should take off their list to worry about,\" said Mark Machin.\u00a0\n\"The fund is in strong shape.

So how is it that the CPPIB would be insulated by that?\nThe money we manage isn't completely insulated. So obviously as markets go down, it's likely that the funds that we have will go down. But we do a number of things.\u00a0\nFirst of all, we diversified the monies. We haven't got all our eggs in one particular market or one particular type of investment, and that provides some cushion.\u00a0\nFor example, generally when the stock market goes down, the government bond market will strengthen. That provides some offsets.\u00a0\nHow much of our money is invested in oil and gas? Because we've seen the price of oil, again, drop lower and lower and lower. The gas sector taking a huge hit as well.\u00a0\nNot so much. About 3 per cent of the fund overall is exposed to that sector. So it's not a huge amount.\u00a0\nWhere are you investing the pension money of Canadians?\nSo it's invested broadly around the world, which helps.\u2026 We're invested in the rest of North America, Russia, South America, Europe and we're invested in Asia. We're invested in bonds and we're also invested in private assets like infrastructure \u2014 relatively safe things, generally on the infrastructure front, like roads and ports and electricity and those types of things.\nWhat are [the] industries that are doing better now than others? Because it seems as though, from a distance, that everybody is taking this hit.\nThere are industries that are doing fine. For example, anything to do with our delivery and logistics, particularly at-home ordering.\u00a0\nOne company we've invested in Europe is a flavour and fragrance company that's benefited from two things. One is the rise in the buying of toilet paper and tissues because it puts the fragrance in that, and also canned soup.\u2026 The flavour that goes into that also came from this company.\nSo there are certain companies that are doing well. But it is a narrow slice of companies.\u00a0\nAnd generally there's lots of companies, whether it's in travel or leisure or sports, etc., that are obviously going to suffer quite a lot. And then there's a lot in between that are going to just have dampened demand and dampened ability to do business, because all the economies in the world are shut down.\nAre you predicting a recession?\nYes. So we're predicting that for the world for this year, we'll be down about 2.4 per cent growth, and Canada is going to be particularly badly hit in the second quarter of this year. So over 20 per cent decline annualized for GDP growth. So it's going to be a very steep recession.\u00a0\nBut we think by the fourth quarter, it should be growing strongly again. And by next year, we see the world rebounding.

As for strawberry pickers, they will get five cents more a\u00a0kilogram, attaining\u00a0$1.04 per kilogram.\nBoulet said the wage increase will benefit the more than 409,000 workers who earn minimum wage, including some\u00a0235,700 women.\nThose workers, he said, will have\u00a0more purchasing power and the increase gives people a stronger incentive to work.\n\"This will contribute also to the fight against poverty \u2014\u00a0something our government finds extremely important,\" Boulet\u00a0said.\n\"It is also an increase\u00a0that will respect the capacity of businesses to pay and preserve their ability to remain competitive.\"\nMaking the announcement now \u2014 more than four months before it takes effect \u2014 will give businesses a chance to prepare for the increase, he said.\nThe Coalition\u00a0Avenir\u00a0Qu\u00e9bec campaigned on a promise to increase the minimum wage year over year,\u00a0working\u00a0toward $15 per hour by 2023. The first increase came last May, when the hourly minimum wage went up 50 cents, from $12.00\u00a0to\u00a0$12.50.\nThe government's goal is to attain a minimum wage that is half of the average hourly wage of Quebecers, by the 2020\u20132021 fiscal year. In 2018, that average hourly wage was just under $25.\u00a0\nLinking the increase in minimum wage to that of the average hourly wage across the province allows less affluent workers to benefit from the general growth in wages and the economy, the CAQ said.\nOpposition Qu\u00e9bec\u00a0Solidaire said\u00a0there is no time to waste in hiking the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\u00a0\nSoon after the announcement, QA co-spokesperson\u00a0Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois tweeted: \"Seattle raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2015. Meanwhile, in Quebec, we are making ridiculous increases that keep everybody in poverty.\"\nSheetal Pathak, a community organizer with the Montreal-based homeless advocacy group, Project Genesis, agrees with Nadeau-Dubois's assessment.\nAny increase in the minimum wage is a good thing, she said, but people will continue to struggle to make ends meet at the current rates.\n\"We really think the plan should be, as quickly as possible, to increase to $15 an hour. We really think that's the minimum it should be at.\"\nThe Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) says small business owners will be among the hardest hit by the wage increase.\n\"The proposed 4.8 per cent\u00a0increase in the minimum wage is almost as large as their profit margin and is in addition to other payroll taxes paid by the employer,\" said CFIB vice-president Fran\u00e7ois Vincent\u00a0in a statement.\n\"To alleviate this financial pressure, it is often the entrepreneur himself who will work more or lower his own salary.\"\nThe CFIB said\u00a0the hike will create a domino effect as employers scramble to ensure more experienced workers are fairly compensated by being\u00a0paid more than the unskilled labourers earning\u00a0minimum wage.\nThe organization, which has some 110,000 members countrywide, said it would like Quebec to instead favour tax measures that will increase the disposable income of low-income workers.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Clare Hennig", "title": "Vancouver needs 10,000 affordable housing units a year to address rental 'backlog,' report advises", "description": "There\u2019s a mismatch between what\u2019s being built and what renters need, says economist Mark Lee", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-needs-10-000-affordable-housing-units-a-year-to-address-rental-backlog-report-advises-1.5393571", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4605140.1522881136!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancouver-home-sales-slows.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 12, 2019 1:08 PM PT", "2019-12-12T21:08:33.994Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A total of at least 10,000 rental homes.\nThat's how many units of non-market rental housing a Canadian think tank says need to be built every year to address Metro Vancouver's ongoing affordability crisis.\nAccording to Marc Lee, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives who wrote\u00a0a report on the matter,\u00a0the problem in Vancouver isn't a lack of construction,\u00a0it's a mismatch between what's being built and what's needed.\u00a0\n\"We've had a major building boom in recent years,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"But for some reason, we're not building the type of housing that we actually need to address the crisis.\"\nNon-market rental housing, which included public housing and co-ops, is more affordable than the average for-profit, privately-developed home.\u00a0\n\"The emphasis has been on building condos,\" Lee told Gloria Macarenko, host of CBC's On The Coast.\u00a0\n\"We've seen some efforts by municipal governments to try to move the needle on that \u2026 but the end result still ends up being apartments that are very expensive.\"\nMunicipalities across the Lower Mainland have brought rules and incentives to encourage developers to build rental units, as well as focusing on building more social housing.\u00a0\nLee argues the push for affordability needs to be more aggressive to make a difference.\u00a0\n\"We haven't come up with the numbers to get ahead of the curve,\" he said.\u00a0\nAbout four to five per cent of housing in Metro Vancouver is some form of public housing, like social housing or co-ops, Lee said.\u00a0\nHe compared that to some cities in Europe where public housing is closer to 20 to 25 percent of the stock, or Vienna, the capital of Austria, where almost half of the total housing stock is public.\n\"We need to think a lot bigger,\" Lee said.\u00a0\nThe number of 10,000 units per year for Metro Vancouver comes from data compiled from various studies, Lee said, ranging from city reports to estimates from the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association.\n\"Generally, we find that we need about 5,000 new rental units per year just to stay level \u2014 so just to tread water, but not really to dig in and address the crisis,\" Lee said.\u00a0\n\"We need another 5,000 units per year to address the backlog.\"\nIt's a goal that would would cost about $2.5 billion annually, according to the report. Lee said much of that should come from the federal and provincial governments.\u00a0\n\"It's certainly not a small amount of money but in the context of B.C.'s total income, our GDP, it's 0.8 per cent,\" he said.\n\"It's an investment.

When it introduced its carbon pricing plan, the federal government offered rebates to cover the added cost to households.\nThe federal carbon tax \u2014 currently in place in four provinces and soon to be imposed in Alberta,\u00a0where an equivalent provincial plan is not in place\u00a0\u2014 is set to increase to 50 dollars a tonne by 2022.\nThe Liberals haven't said what might happen after that date,\u00a0even as they've promised to meet and exceed their climate targets.\nIn its report, the Ecofiscal Commission concluded that, even though it's more visible and politically controversial, the carbon tax remains the most cost-effective approach to fighting climate change.\nThe commission\u00a0modelled various policy options\u00a0\u2014 including carbon pricing, steeper regulations and subsidies\u00a0\u2014 and found that a more stringent carbon tax, coupled with\u00a0rising rebates, would inflict the least amount of economic damage on Canadians.\nThe fight over whether the Liberals intend to raise the carbon tax became a flashpoint during the recent election campaign, with Andrew Scheer and his Conservatives branding the measure a \"job-killing tax\" and promising to scrap it if elected.\n\"We do have options to get to 2030 but some of the options are, frankly, pretty ugly,\" said Chris Ragan, economist and chair of the Ecofiscal Commission.\nHe cited the example of the \"very expensive subsidies\" that some have pitched as a response to climate change\u00a0\u2014 corporate or industrial subsidies to fund things like carbon-capture systems, or household subsidies to lower the cost of purchasing electric vehicles or green renovations.\nSuch subsidies would have a lower political profile than a carbon tax. Ragan said they'd also demand personal or corporate tax increases to pay for them.\n\"The punchline really is, the more hidden your policy choices, the more expensive they are,\" he said.\nThe report's data show\u00a0a scenario combining stricter regulations (requiring companies to cut the intensity of their emissions in half, for example) and\u00a0substantial subsidies for electric vehicle purchases\u00a0could end up forcing an income tax hike of roughly 1.5 to 2 per cent\u00a0for Canadians and corporations, depending on the province.\nThe report also says a scenario relying on regulations and subsidies for industries alone would cost even more \u2014 roughly a 4 to 6 per cent spike\u00a0in income taxes. The commission concluded that a industry-focused regulation-only\u00a0model would end up depressing Canada's GDP \u2014\u00a0and likely would fail to allow Canada to meet its current Paris target\u00a0of a 30 per cent reduction in emissions below 2005 levels by 2030.\nRagan acknowledged that the modelling system does not take into account companies shifting toward more sustainable methods without government intervention, but said the report offers governments a realistic \"menu of choice.\"\n\"The menu items have a price tag,\" he said.\nRagan said the carbon tax hike scenario laid out in the Ecofiscal Commission report would not lead to a \"dramatic\" rise in gasoline prices.\n\"That still puts prices below where they were in the summer of 2014, before the price of oil fell, and keeps prices well below where they are in France,\" he said, adding that the debate over the carbon tax needs to take into account the rebates meant to offset the household effects.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/confronting-carbon2/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Murray Brewster", "title": "Canada facing renewed pressure from U.S. to meet NATO defence spending benchmark", "description": "'Canada has got a lot of real estate to defend,' new U.S. national security adviser says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-pressure-us-defence-spending-1.5371352", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5371356.1574571024!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/security-forum-20191123.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 23, 2019 11:58 PM ET", "2019-11-24T14:48:14.556Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Liberal government is facing renewed political pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to increase defence spending to meet the benchmark established by NATO.\nRobert O'Brien, the new U.S. national security adviser, said it is an \"urgent priority\" to get allies across the board to set aside military budgets that are equal to two per cent of the individual country's gross domestic product.\nSpeaking with journalists at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday, O'Brien rattled off a list of the world's flashpoints, including Iran and Venezuela, as well as traditional adversaries such as Russia and China.\n\"There are very serious threats to our freedom and our security,\" he said. \"Canada made a pledge at [the 2014 NATO Summit in] Wales to spend two per cent.

They have also frequently pointed out that Canada had the fastest gross domestic product\u00a0growth among the G7 nations. They frequently refer to using the Canada Child Benefit program to lift 287,000 families above the poverty level.\nThe last point is important \u2014 because it's\u00a0a growing practice for governments to focus on quality of life indicators, in addition to growing the national economy.\nIn 2018, Scotland, New Zealand and Iceland came together to form the Wellbeing Economy\u00a0Governments group. These countries have decided that economic growth should not be pursued at any cost and that they are going to be accountable to their citizens for quality of life outcomes.\nThis is an approach to governing that addresses the major issues of the day such as climate change, globalization, and inequality.\nHere in Canada, it's election time, and we should absolutely pose hard questions to our political leaders on what they are doing \u2014 or what they will do \u2014 to make day-to-day life better for Canadian citizens.\nAsking candidates about what social and environmental outcomes they intend to produce is a good way to move the political discourse beyond economic growth. After all, GDP is largely an indicator of how well high-income people and businesses are doing.\nNational GDP numbers also tell us very little about provincial or regional outcomes.\nA recent Statistics Canada study found that population in Newfoundland and Labrador could drop by as much as 90,000 people by 2043. We have an aging population, low birth rates and stagnant immigration.\nWe must ask our candidates what they're\u00a0going to do to improve those indicators.\nDid you know that the Conference Board of Canada has found that Newfoundland and Labrador has the lowest health outcomes of all provinces, and that we rank below the United States and many other Western countries?\nThe federal government puts massive amounts of money into health care at the provincial level \u2014 but has no mechanisms to hold provinces accountable for how that money is spent \u2014 or the outcomes those dollars achieve.\nWhen the federal government speaks of post-secondary education, rarely do they speak of the impact of the increasing costs of living on student debt or how this will impact the economy of the future.\nTuition fees are only a fraction of the cost of an education.\nHousing costs in St. John's have doubled in the last 20 years, and wages have not. New graduates have said that the changes to Canada Student Loans have been a tiny Band-Aid on a gushing wound.\nWhile the Trudeau government has spent almost four years developing a carbon tax program, have our environmental outcomes improved during their four years in office? What outcomes do the other parties say their climate change policies will achieve?\nMost of the initiatives undertaken will benefit us over the long term and will be in peril if the ruling party changes. It is reasonable to ask candidates how they're\u00a0going to ensure climate change continues to be addressed if government changes. This is clearly an issue that requires putting partisanship aside.\nThe Trudeau government has committed to reducing methane emissions by 40 to 45 per cent below 2012 levels by 2025. There is a good chance government will change before we reach that date.\nThey also introduced the Just Transition Task Force on coal, designed to reach 90 per cent non-emitting power by 2030. The federal government has also put in place a rebate for electrical vehicles, designed to reach 100 per cent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2040.\nThese are also long-term measures that will have to pass through the hands of multiple governments.\nFrom a Newfoundland and Labrador perspective, they have protected only 13 per cent of oceans and 2.5 per cent of our land, notably up from 0.9 per cent and 1.05 per cent, respectively.\nIs this enough or do we deserve more? What are the other parties going to do in these areas?\nAre incidents of violence against women increasing or declining?\nThe best indicators tell us it has increased slightly during the last four years. The Trudeau government has implemented a Gender Based Violence Knowledge Centre that will hopefully enable us to better address prevention. Will the other parties commit to maintaining it?\nThe national gender pay gap has closed marginally during the last four years. Canadian women still make only 87 cents for every dollar that men make, on a national basis, as opposed to the 86 cents they made four years ago.\nNewfoundland and Labrador has the highest gender pay gap of any province in the country with women making 69 cents for every dollar a man makes. When can we expect to see improvements in this area? The Trudeau government has offered pay equity, pay transparency, paternity leave, and daycare spaces. What are the other parties offering?\nIt is hardly a secret that the growing service economy has created more minimum wage positions. Job growth numbers do not tell us how many jobs people need to earn enough money to live on or to make it through university.\nMany Canadians need desperately to see the minimum wage raised. Many want to see much higher taxes on high income earners and corporations. They want to see solutions for taxing the wealth that now goes offshore untaxed.\nWhen politicians talk about job numbers, we need to ask them:\nIn short, Canadians want to see structural change that will address\u00a0the major challenges of our time. Many also feel that the major political parties are not up to addressing these challenges in any substantive way.\u00a0\nThe major parties have spent much of this election, and indeed the last four\u00a0years, focused on \"gotcha\" politics.\nThe problem with that is when we are\u00a0debating who is perfect enough to be prime minister, we are not talking about the policy changes that need to be made.\u00a0\nWe have reached a critical turning point in our history.\nWe owe it to the next generation to manage our shifting global environment in an effective and responsible manner. We owe it to them to put partisanship aside.\nWe also owe it to them to ask the hard questions of our leaders right now.\u00a0\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Jonathon Gatehouse", "title": "Andrew Scheer's claim about foreign aid deemed false", "description": "Official figures don't support idea that $2.2 billion a year is going to rich or undeserving nations", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservatives-foreign-aid-fact-check-1.5305045", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5305190.1569969787!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-conservatives-20191001.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 01, 2019 6:39 PM ET", "2019-10-02T19:17:01.289Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The claim: \"The Trudeau government today sends $2.2 billion of so-called foreign aid to middle- and upper-income countries...Worse still, some of that money is shoveled to repressive regimes that are adversarial, if not outright hostile, to Canadian interests and values.\"\n-- Conservative leader Andrew Scheer announcing his proposal to slash 25 per cent of Canada's foreign aid budget and redistribute the money to taxpayers at home.\nThe facts: Ottawa spent a total of $6.098 billion on \"international assistance\" in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, according to the latest statistical report from Global Affairs Canada.\nOf that amount, $3.41 billion was spent directly on aid to other nations\u00a0and $993.82 million was devoted to \"multilateral international assistance,\" benefiting more than one country\u00a0or an entire region. In addition, other federal bodies like the Department of National Defence, the RCMP and Environment and Climate Change Canada spent a total of $858.43 million that falls under the \"foreign aid\" umbrella.\nIn\u00a0Toronto on Tuesday, Scheer said\u00a0he believes that the \"vast majority\" of Canada's foreign aid is \"well spent,\" but maintained that a \"significant chunk\" is being misdirected under Justin Trudeau. The Conservative leader specifically cited assistance to \"middle- and upper-income countries\" like Argentina, Barbados, Brazil, China, Italy, Mexico, and Turkey. And he identified \"hostile\" regimes like Iran, North Korea, and Russia as also being undeserving.\nIn total, those 10 countries received $22.03 million in Canadian assistance last fiscal year, mostly under multinational programs for international security, food assistance, or disaster relief. For instance, the $2 million that went to Italy was to help pay for rescue and recovery efforts after a 2017 earthquake.\nIt's not clear how the Tories arrived at their $2.2 billion figure. The party has said that they are defining \"middle- and upper-income countries\" as those with a score of 0.6 and above on the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI). But that's not a benchmark that any other country or international body uses to determine which nations need assistance. And it seems like a rather arbitrary point within the HDI itself \u2014 about three-quarters of the way down the list of \"medium human development countries.\"\nIf Canada were to adopt that cut-off it would mean that Ghana \u2014 ranked 140th of the 189 nations currently scored on the development index \u2014 would be the wealthiest country to qualify for our foreign aid. And it would disqualify five of Canada's top 20 aid recipients \u2014\u00a0Jordan, Bangladesh, Iraq, Lebanon\u00a0and India \u2014 from future assistance.\nLast fiscal year, those countries received a total of $387.55 million, $211 million of which was classified as emergency humanitarian aid, going mostly to support Syrian refugees in the Middle East and Rohingya\u00a0Muslims who fled a genocidal regime in Myanmar.\u00a0\nDuring his Toronto speech, Scheer said that a Conservative government would continue to assist Ukraine \u2014\u00a0ranked 88th on the development index with a score of 0.751 \u2014\u00a0which received $54.51 million last year. But applying the 0.6 HDI mark would exclude every other European nation from Canadian assistance, as well as every country in Central and South America\u00a0and every Caribbean nation except Haiti.\nNorth African nations would no longer qualify for Canadian aid, nor would South Africa. And in the Middle East, only Syria and Yemen would make the grade. The list in Asia would be whittled down to Afghanistan \u2014 Canada's top foreign aid recipient at $237.97 million last year \u2014 Pakistan, Myanmar and Nepal.\nThat would account for the $1.5 billion that Scheer is promising to cut from the aid budget, but not the additional $700 million he claims the Trudeau government is wasting on well-to-do countries and corrupt dictatorships.\u00a0\nExperts in the field are mystified by the Tory claims and their number crunching.\u00a0\n\"This is not the standard way of looking at country income classification. No one does it that way,\" says Aniket Bhushan, an adjunct research professor at Carleton University, who oversees the Canadian International Development Platform, a database that tracks aid spending. \"There's nothing in the empirical literature that says anything about 0.6 HDI.\"\nBhushan says that Canada doesn't actually provide any official development assistance to high-income countries \u2014 they are excluded under agreed international definitions. (The cut off, as per this OECD eligibility list, is \"Upper Middle Income Countries,\" with per capita Gross National Incomes of between US $3,956 and $12,235 in 2016.)\nAnd he suspects that the Conservatives are including the funds that go to multinational programs \u2014 some $2.4 billion in 2018 \u2014 and the money that Canada spends at home \u2014 like the $462.19 million that went to support newly arrived refugees last fiscal year \u2014 in their calculations of direct foreign aid.\u00a0\n\"It's all bizarre,\" says Bhushan. \"It's sort of a Trump-like response.\"\nBut regardless of how it is justified, a 25 per cent cut to Canada's foreign aid\u00a0would be a serious blow to the developing world, says Liam Swiss, a Memorial University sociologist who serves as president of the Canadian Association for the Study of International Development.\n\"Fundamentally, you're talking about immunizing fewer children, more mothers dying in childbirth, less potable water and more refugees suffering in conflict zones. That's what it means in terms of Canada's aid,\" says Swiss.\nAnd then there's the question of Canada's commitments to the international community.\u00a0\nIt was Lester Pearson, the former prime minister, who helped the UN set a development spending target for wealthy nations \u2014 0.7 per cent of GDP \u2014 back in 1970. It's a\u00a0goal that Canada has been committed to for 50 years, but has never come close to attaining. At present, Ottawa's $6.1 billion aid budget is 0.28 per cent of GDP. The proposed Conservative cut would drop that figure to 0.21 per cent.\n\"We're already well below our fair share,\" says Nicolas Moyer, CEO of the Canadian Council for International Co-operation, an association representing aid organizations. \"We rank 15th in the OECD, and this would drop us to 19th, and make us second-last among G7 countries.\"\nMoyer says past Conservative governments have been strong leaders on foreign aid, citing the almost $3 billion that Stephen Harper devoted to child and maternal health initiatives.\u00a0\nAnd he's not sure why Andrew Scheer is talking about cuts.\n\"Is it a signal that we're withdrawing from the rest of the world?\" asks Moyer. \"In an era of climate change, mass migration and challenges to the international order, Canada needs to engage more in the world, not less.\"\nThe verdict: False.

The office expects the deficit will shrink to $11.1 billion in 2024-2025.\nThe worsened shortfall is the result, the budget office says, of lower tax revenues and higher operating expenses for the federal government than had been expected. When the economy is whirring along, the government collects more taxes and people generally call less on public services.\nBut all those numbers don't reflect any new policy decisions, or promises made during this fall's election campaign.

But they jettisoned that promise in favour of a consistent decline in the federal debt-to-GDP ratio, which compares government debt to the size of the overall economy.\nThe PBO report suggests warns that any new spending or changes in tax revenues could mean the ratio doesn't decline as the government hopes. It also notes that the government hasn't set any date for when it hopes to get back to balance.\nThe party's 2019 platform forecast a deficit next fiscal year of almost $27.4 billion and $23.7 billion the year after, relying on the PBO's forecasts from June.\nThe updated forecast wouldn't shift the Liberals' deficit projections too much in 2020-2021, but the PBO's new numbers would add $4 billion to the deficit the year after \u2014 making it closer to $27.3 billion.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "'I've had a muskrat on my back,' Dwight Ball tells annual Liberal fundraiser", "description": "Premier Dwight Ball proclaims N.L. will be the energy capital of Canada by 2030", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/dwight-ball-liberal-fundraiser-1.5349446", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5349456.1573151046!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/dwight-ball.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Nov 06, 2019 7:45 AM NT", "2019-11-06T11:15:36.214Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Premier Dwight Ball says Muskrat Falls weighs heavily on the minds of people in Newfoundland and Labrador \u2014 it accounts for a huge amount of the province's debt \u2014\u00a0and his minority government is working at\u00a0\"righting a wrong.\"\nBall made the comments at a Liberal fundraiser Tuesday night.\n\"The biggest single issue that people are telling me when I get in their communities, face to face, is Muskrat Falls,\" Ball said at the annual fundraising dinner.\n\"It's a huge concern that we as a province face, but, you know, it really didn't have to be this way,\" he said, pointing the finger again at the previous Progressive Conservative government for sanctioning the project.\nThe audience was a\u00a0crowd of Liberals\u00a0at the Delta Hotel ballroom in St. John's, where more than 500 attendees purchased\u00a0$500-per-plate dinners, and took in speeches from MP Seamus O'Regan, MHA Lisa Dempster, and others.\n\"I know people here, you're shaking your heads, and I understand it, you're sick and tired of hearing about Muskrat Falls\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and believe me, I've had a muskrat on my back for all my political life,\u00a0I'm tired of it too,\" Ball said.\nBut, Ball said, Muskrat Falls accounts for 30 per cent of the province's debt, and the public's concern about the cost of utilities after the project comes online needs to be addressed.\n\"Imagine for a moment, that nearly $4 billion, how we could have spent that money.

Instead, a private sector that usually clamours for lower taxes is now asking\u00a0governments to spend more.\nBut even as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau injects what amounts to an estimated four\u00a0to five\u00a0per cent of GDP in government stimulus, there is simply no way state support can replace the massive amounts of money that normally flood\u00a0through a healthy economy, says Craig Alexander,\u00a0Deloitte Canada's chief economist.\n\"They can't offset all the weakness, but they're a very important part of mitigating how weak things actually become,\" said Alexander, who had grown hoarse from giving web seminars trying to convince business leaders that the current economic and market gloom was only temporary.\nHe said one of the most crucial things governments can do\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that business really can't\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is inspire confidence that massive resources will be used to prevent the economic system from going into a tailspin.\nIn a strange twist, he said, market gloom has pushed interest rates on federal debt so low that governments can borrow \"almost\u00a0for nothing\" and spend in a way that would have been impossible in the high-inflation, high-interest era\u00a0of Reagan and Thatcher.\nUniversity of Ottawa political economist Jacqueline Best researches the political crisis caused by the high inflation of the 1970s and 1980s that\u00a0helped convince cash-strapped governments to reject state spending as a solution.\nIn the years since, she says, with\u00a0the private sector celebrated as the solution to all our ills, gaps have formed in social support networks, especially for low-wage earners in the gig economy, and are only being noticed now that\u00a0we're in a crisis.\nAll at once, the COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0is acting as a reminder of the essential role governments and society play in providing social support, from adequate health care to emergency financial help\u00a0for those thrown out of work. Best says the more we work together to prevent the disease's spread, the more people may notice\u00a0that, contrary to Thatcher's famous maxim, society not only exists but is essential to our collective well-being.\n\"It's so clear that what each of us does affects other people,\" she said.\nIn talking to her students, she sometimes gets the feeling the concept of collective welfare that predominated during the Great Depression and the World Wars, the time of the\u00a0Greatest Generation,\u00a0may be coming back into fashion.\n\"A crisis like this makes us aware how vulnerable we are,\" she said.\nThat feeling of potential crisis in business and financial markets\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like the\u00a0worst-case scenario imagined by Francis Fong, the chief economist with the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada, where markets and businesses fail, \"permanently destroying economic capacity\"\u00a0\u2014 has convinced those who might normally oppose government spending to favour loosening the purse strings.\n\"The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada have long advocated for, during good times, ensuring fiscal balance and fiscal responsibility,\" said Fong. \"Now is not the time for that.\"\nOf course, as critics said after governments bailed out markets in 2008, this may be one more case of\u00a0privatizing profits while socializing losses.\nDespite complaints that it is never enough and that it will take time for money to flow into the economy,\u00a0Armine Yalnizyan, economist and fellow with the\u00a0Atkinson Foundation, lauds the Liberal government and opposition for their quick action.\nShe says the economic magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0may represent an inflection point that begins to take us away from Thatcher and Reagan.\n\"I think this crisis is going to absolutely be the last nail in the coffin for trickle-down economics as being any kind of boost to the economy,\" she said, referring to the idea that helping the wealthy will also eventually help those with less.\nIn the aftermath of the coronavirus\u00a0slump, she says, it will become increasingly evident that government involvement is essential in a no-growth economy, and not just to ensure adequate health care and a social safety net.\n\"After 40 years of being told that the best economic formula is more market and less government, we have our nose pressed up against the glass, seeing that we need more government,\" she said. \"And, of course, that will mean less business.\"\nBut once the private sector economy begins to recover from the effects of the virus, perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised that when the time comes to pay the bill, the current consensus in favour of government intervention in the economy will have fewer champions.\nFollow Don on Twitter\u00a0@don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Richard White", "title": "OPINION | Calgary Stampede: More than just a rodeo", "description": "The Stampede is Calgary\u2019s largest arts festival.

In December 2019, the Conference Board of Canada published the \"Economic Impact of the Calgary Stampede,\" documenting that the 10-day Stampede accounts for about half \u2014 $283 million \u2014 of the Calgary Stampede's $541 million total impact on the economy. Year-round events contribute about $110.9 million to Calgary's GDP.)\nBut beyond the money and the bucking broncos, what a lot of people don't realize is that one of Canada's largest and most diverse arts festivals has also just been cancelled.\u00a0\u00a0\nYep, that's the Stampede,\u00a0too.\nWhile the rodeo and chuckwagon races get the majority of the national and international media attention (not always positive), the Stampede is more than a one-trick pony.\u00a0Don't believe me? Let's take a look.\nArt has been part of the Calgary Stampede since its inception in 1912.\nThree visual artists presented and sold their works at the very first Stampede. The most notable of them was Charlie Russell.\nOver the two-week period, 14 of his 20 pieces were sold and, due to overwhelming demand, the Russell exhibit was moved to the Royal Building downtown for a one week continuation at the conclusion of the Stampede.\nThe popularity of his work at the 1912 Stampede inspired him to start his famous RCMP series.\u00a0\nThe Stampede has four music venues and anywhere from 80 to 100 bands performing, creating what is essentially a 10-day music festival.\nThe Coca-Cola Stage showcases over 50 performers (local, national and international) that attract an audience estimated as high as 400,000. Last year, one of the headliners was Feist, not exactly your typical country and western singer-songwriter.\nNashville North attracted another 100,000 or so people in 2019 to listen to 19 different artists.\nThe Big Four Roadhouse, which opened in 2017, hosted 20 bands, attracting another 30,000 people last year.\nAnd the Scotiabank Saddledome hosted concerts by the likes of Sugarland, Tim McGraw and the Zac Brown Band, with a total attendance of 30,000.\nCollectively,\u00a0 the Stampede in 2019 offered over 100 performances, which attracted an estimated audience of more than 500,000 people.\u00a0\nBut wait, there is more.\nThe Window on the West has two stages at the Western Oasis that host 50 or so young local performers, attracting an audience estimated at 5,000. The Weadickville outdoor stage attracts more than 20,000 people to listen to another 30 musicians.\u00a0Throw in the 160-member Calgary Stampede Showband's 100 performances during Stampede, as well as the World Showband Championship, and the attendance at Stampede for music events swells to over 600,000 people.\nWhile some music connoisseurs may scoff at calling the Stampede a music festival, the variety of music and the attendance figures don't lie. It is by far Calgary's biggest music festival, and it showcases more local artists than most major urban music festivals.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it comes to the performing arts, the Stampede Grandstand show engages more than 200 performers in various genres for its two-hour long extravaganza. The show attracts an audience of 160,000 each year, equal to Theatre Calgary's 130,000 annual patrons and Decidedly Jazz's 20,000 patrons combined.\u00a0\nBut it doesn't stop there. The Stampede is also a major visual arts festival with its Western Art Showcase featuring 150 professional artists in a 100,000 square-foot gallery that attracts over 150,000 visitors. This is on par with the Glenbow Museum's attendance for the entire year \u2014 150,735 in 2018.\nIn addition, the Stampede's Maker Market,\u00a0with its 50-plus artisans, draws an audience estimated at more than 100,000 people over the 10 days of Stampede.\nThe Stampede's fun, mixed-media show of quilts, woodworking, drawings, fibre art and even cake decorating, showcases the work of over 150 community artists, and attracts more than 150,000 spectators.\u00a0\nAdd all that up and you have more than 300,000 Calgarians, Albertans, Canadians and international visitors enjoying a quality art experience.\nAgain, Calgary's high-brow culture executives might not see these as cutting-edge art experiences, but from the public's perspective\u00a0they are entertaining and enlightening.\u00a0And I expect for many young people, they are just as inspiring as academic art experiences.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile many of Calgary's arts groups are just now integrating Indigenous artists into their programming, the Calgary Stampede has been doing it for over 100 years.\nThe Elbow River Camp is home to hundreds of Indigenous performances, from drumming to dancing (hoop, jingle, fancy, traditional, grass, buckskin and cowboy special) by more than 1,500 performers.\nThere are five evenings of story-telling, and the Council Tipi has artists doing beadwork, leather work, parfleche and other traditional Indigenous artwork every day.\nIn addition to traditional artwork, in 2019 the Elbow River Camp also had a DJ performing techno music. It is estimated over 100,000 Stampede visitors experienced an Indigenous art performance or watched an art-making demonstration.\nThe Calgary Stampede is a leader when it comes to recognizing and celebrating the history and culture of our First Nation neighbours.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut the Stampede is more than just the 10 days in July.\nStampede Park has three venues that are year-round arts venues: Doherty Hall (capacity 130), BMO Amphitheatre (capacity 800) and the TransAlta Performing Arts Studio (capacity 712).\nThe Big Four Roadhouse is also a year-round music venue attracting about 40,000 patrons outside of the Stampede.\u00a0\nAs well, the TransAlta Studio is home to the Young Canadians, the Calgary Stampede Show Band, the Calgary Stetson Show Band, the Calgary Round-Up Band and the Band of Outriders.\nIt is a training facility for more than a thousand young Calgary musicians and dancers. Next to the Conservatory at Mount Royal University, it is the largest music education institution in Calgary, and one of the largest in Canada.\u00a0\u00a0\nCalgary Arts Academy School opened in 2017 with an enrolment of 300 students as part of the Stampede's Youth Campus initiative, which also included the TransAlta Performing Arts Studio.\u00a0 Plans are also in the works for the Calgary Opera Community Arts Centre to be located on the campus in the future.\nStampede Park is also home to the annual Calgary Expo that attracts over 100,000 people of all ages and backgrounds for four days of celebrating Calgary's vibrant cosplay culture. It is a fun mixture of performance, visual and literary arts.\nAnd Stampede Park is home to 17 significant public artworks \u2014 murals and sculptures, making it on a par with and complementary to the Beltline's Urban Mural Project.\nThere is an online Stampede Park Art Walk brochure, that makes it easy for anyone to explore the park and see the artworks any time.\u00a0\nThe Stampede is Calgary's largest arts organization and Stampede Park is our biggest arts centre, and its year-round operations depend very much on the profits earned during the 10 days of Stampede.\nSo, yes, this year's Stampede will be missed by Calgarians and Albertans of all ages, whether they like the chucks\u00a0or not.\nThis column is an opinion.

So far, the federal government isn't willing to pick up that\u00a0tab.\n\"I think Manitoba does face some pretty serious kind of short-term fiscal pressures,\" Dodds said.\nThe Conference Board of Canada, which forecasts Manitoba's economy will contract by 3.9 per cent this year, attributes the province's economy downgrade, in part, to declines in transportation equipment manufacturing.\nAs one example, Dodds referenced bus manufacturer NFI Group Inc. permanently laying off 300 employees and temporarily halting production at its facilities, leaving\u00a0at least hundreds more people without work for the time being.\nOther big Manitoba employers have cut staff:\u00a0Winnipeg-based Dufresne\u00a0Furniture and Appliances has temporarily laid off 1,000 employees across several provinces, and Palliser Furniture let go of 500 Winnipeg staff in the short-term.\n\"Whether you serve your domestic market or an international market, we've seen demand really drop off a cliff,\" said Conference Board of Canada economist Alicia Macdonald.\nRon Koslowsky, vice-president of the Manitoba division of the Canadian Manufacturers and\u00a0Exporters, said the manufacturing sector is \"surprisingly still holding its own.\"\u00a0\nFood production is booming, and dozens of manufacturers have pivoted to making personal protective equipment for the health care field, he said, but depressed demand for transport and aerospace manufacturing is unmistakable.\n\"There's no question that some [companies] will be altered,\" Koslowsky said. \"Some may not be around, although I don't think they'll be that many, unless things really tank.\"\nManitoba Finance Minister Scott Fielding said he's encouraged the province is moving toward loosening\u00a0business restrictions after repeated days of few, or no, new cases of COVID-19.\nIt doesn't mean the recovery, or the road to get there, will be painless, he said.\n\"Listen, I don't want to sugar-coat this and say somehow this is going to be easy for anyone,\" Fielding said in an interview.\n\"When you have the amount of people, the businesses that are completely shut down or partially shut down, the unemployment rate ... it's going to be some tough times for Manitobans, and really all Canadians,\" he said.\nFielding also mentioned Manitoba's diversified economy, and his hope in a financial system that has evaded the economic busts, but also the booms.\n"}, {"author": "Ian Froese", "title": "Why Manitoba's middle-of-the-road economy cannot weather a pandemic on its own", "description": "Premier Brian Pallister wants Manitoba to be the 1st province to reopen", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-middle-of-the-road-economy-pandemic-diversified-1.5539574", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5529526.1586554773!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/empty-downtown-winnipeg.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 22, 2020 3:00 AM CT", "2020-04-22T08:00:00.872Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of\u00a0The COVID Economy,\u00a0a CBC News series looking at how the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic is affecting jobs, manufacturing and business in regions across Canada.\nIt's become clich\u00e9 to describe Manitoba's economy as diverse, but that's what is giving\u00a0Manitobans\u00a0solace as the province's economy is put through the wringer in a global pandemic\nAn assorted blend of industries from agriculture to manufacturing and transportation have previously cushioned the middle province from the economic blows of provinces more vulnerable to the whims of single industries, such as oil.\nAnd that economic track record has given officials the belief they can weather the financial toll of COVID-19.\nPremier Brian Pallister has clung to economic forecasts carrying the same optimism, citing one model last week from RBC that predicted Manitoba's gross domestic product would collapse\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but not as badly as any other province.\n\"We are projected by most of the analysts, whether in banks or bond rating companies, to be the province that is best positioned to come back from this pandemic, and we are going to make that happen,\" Pallister said on Tuesday.\nOne economist behind the RBC forecast, however, suggests that provincial rankings are nearly meaningless.\n\"I think we're starting to split hairs here,\" said senior economist Robert Hogue, whose report pegs Manitoba's GDP as dropping 3.7 per cent this year, compared to a 1.1 per cent increase in 2019.

So far, the federal government isn't willing to pick up that\u00a0tab.\n\"I think Manitoba does face some pretty serious kind of short-term fiscal pressures,\" Dodds said.\nThe Conference Board of Canada, which forecasts Manitoba's economy will contract by 3.9 per cent this year, attributes the province's economy downgrade, in part, to declines in transportation equipment manufacturing.\nAs one example, Dodds referenced bus manufacturer NFI Group Inc. permanently laying off 300 employees and temporarily halting production at its facilities, leaving\u00a0at least hundreds more people without work for the time being.\nOther big Manitoba employers have cut staff:\u00a0Winnipeg-based Dufresne\u00a0Furniture and Appliances has temporarily laid off 1,000 employees across several provinces, and Palliser Furniture let go of 500 Winnipeg staff in the short-term.\n\"Whether you serve your domestic market or an international market, we've seen demand really drop off a cliff,\" said Conference Board of Canada economist Alicia Macdonald.\nRon Koslowsky, vice-president of the Manitoba division of the Canadian Manufacturers and\u00a0Exporters, said the manufacturing sector is \"surprisingly still holding its own.\"\u00a0\nFood production is booming, and dozens of manufacturers have pivoted to making personal protective equipment for the health care field, he said, but depressed demand for transport and aerospace manufacturing is unmistakable.\n\"There's no question that some [companies] will be altered,\" Koslowsky said. \"Some may not be around, although I don't think they'll be that many, unless things really tank.\"\nManitoba Finance Minister Scott Fielding said he's encouraged the province is moving toward loosening\u00a0business restrictions after repeated days of few, or no, new cases of COVID-19.\nIt doesn't mean the recovery, or the road to get there, will be painless, he said.\n\"Listen, I don't want to sugar-coat this and say somehow this is going to be easy for anyone,\" Fielding said in an interview.\n\"When you have the amount of people, the businesses that are completely shut down or partially shut down, the unemployment rate ... it's going to be some tough times for Manitobans, and really all Canadians,\" he said.\nFielding also mentioned Manitoba's diversified economy, and his hope in a financial system that has evaded the economic busts, but also the booms.\n"}, {"author": "John Paul Tasker", "title": "Liberal government 'not thinking about raising taxes' right now, says Morneau", "description": "Trudeau dismisses calls for a budget in the short term as PBO warns debt could hit $1 trillion", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-budget-one-trillion-1.5568031", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5503854.1584659454!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/coronavirus-bill-morneau.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 13, 2020 2:50 PM ET", "2020-05-14T01:53:26.834Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Finance Minister Bill Morneau says his government is not currently thinking about raising the GST or any other taxes but that Canada will have to face tough questions about how to pay for the COVID-19 pandemic response that is costing billions.\n\"We're not thinking about raising taxes,\" Morneau told CBC's Rosemary Barton during a town hall special Wednesday evening. \"What we're thinking about is preserving our economy for the future, making sure that we can get back to a vibrant place.\"\nMorneau said he\u00a0is focused on ensuring the Canadian economy is strong enough to grow once the pandemic ends so that Canadians who have lost their jobs in one sector may be able to pick up a\u00a0job in a different one.\nAsked if his government will either cut services or raise taxes to increase government revenues in an effort to pay off the pandemic debt,\u00a0Morneau said that was a problem Canadians would have to face once they are back on their feet.\u00a0\n\"We know that we are going to need to face up to those challenges.

At the start of the year, the federal debt was roughly $700 billion.\nBut Trudeau said today he has no immediate plans to table a budget because the government simply doesn't know how the economy will fare in the months ahead, as social distancing measures continue to cripple economic activity.\nHe also seemed to rule\u00a0out tabling some sort of document that could be updated as the fiscal situation stabilizes.\nTrudeau said the government is focused on \"immediate\" needs over long-term budgeting.\n\"A budget is usually something that projects what's going to happen to the Canadian economy for the next 12 months and right now, we're having a lot of difficulty establishing with any certainty what's going to happen in the next 12 weeks,\" Trudeau said today at his daily briefing with reporters.\n\"The situation is changing extremely rapidly.\"\nIn the midst of the 2008-09 global recession, the previous Conservative government tabled a budget in January 2009 and a fiscal update followed in September as the Tories responded to a cratering economy.\nWhen asked if there were any plans for a fiscal update this year, a spokesperson for Morneau said the department\u00a0had no comment beyond what Trudeau said at his press conference.\nConservative members pressed Morneau in the Commons today,\u00a0asking if the government had any projections of how much it would cost to finance the growing debt.\nMorneau said he will give a full accounting of the costs of the government's pandemic measures \"when we have the ability.\"\nThe PBO said the cost to service the debt will be manageable\u00a0for now,\u00a0because interest rates are at record lows \u2014 but a spike in those rates would be very \"concerning.\"\nWhile cabinet ministers have been reluctant to say if or when the next fiscal update will be released, a senior public servant told the Senate's national finance committee Tuesday that work is underway on such a plan.\n\"We're in the process of beginning that fiscal update, which, of course, involves consultation with the private sector, and we expect to be able to provide a fiscal update in the coming weeks,\" said Alison McDermott, an official in the economic and fiscal policy branch of\u00a0the\u00a0Department of Finance.\n\"I don't think the government has made any announcements about the timing of that at this point.\"\nKevin Page, the country's first PBO and the president and CEO of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa, said Morneau should produce a fiscal update by June to make\u00a0Canadians feel confident that the government has its fiscal house in order.\nPage said nobody is expecting a traditional 500-page budget \u2014 \"We're not in that\u00a0world right now, we get that,\" he said \u2014 but there's still a need for some sort of planning document. He said the prime minister should face pressure to release some numbers soon.\n\"It's pretty hard to say we don't need a fiscal strategy right now. The way to engender confidence is to be transparent,\" he told\u00a0CBC\u00a0News. \"I don't think they\u00a0can get away getting much past early June without a fiscal statement ... there's no accountability without a plan. We need to see a\u00a0tally.\"\nHe said people need to know if the government intends to continue programs like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the wage subsidy, and, if so, for how long.\n\"Just tell people \u2014 this is the situation, this is how we're going to respond. We need a strategy.\u00a0We need to tell people what to expect over the next few months,\" he said.\nSuch information is also important for would-be bondholders, Page said, who will be extending credit to a money-hungry government.\nSahir Khan, Page's former deputy PBO, said the government is probably reluctant to release numbers now because opponents could pounce\u00a0if the fiscal situation rapidly deteriorates.\nBut if health officials are expected to release modelling for COVID-19 infections and deaths, he said,\u00a0federal finance officials should do the same with deficit\u00a0spending and debt.\nAs spending continues unabated, former prime minister Stephen Harper voiced concerns Tuesday with the debtload much of the Western world has taken on in recent weeks in response to\u00a0this crisis.\nHarper, an economist by training, said balance sheets have become an \"unholy mess\" and some states are likely to face sovereign debt crises in the months ahead.\n\"If they fail to practice mild austerity proactively, a brutal kind will be thrust on them,\" Harper said in an op-ed published in the U.S.-based Wall Street Journal.\nHarper said \"leftists\" are trying to capitalize on this crisis to permanently expand the size of government by pushing ideas like a \"guaranteed minimum income.\"\n\"A new era of big government in the economy is unlikely, undesirable and far from inevitable,\" Harper said.\n\"When focus shifts from the pandemic to the economy, it will need to shift from a lot more government action to a lot less.\"\nBut Page, who was appointed by Harper, said now isn't the time to talk about austerity.\nHe said Canada is still in a strong fiscal position compared to\u00a0other industrialized nations,\u00a0with roughly half the average\u00a0debt-to-GDP ratios of other advanced economies.\n\"We're nowhere near code red,\" Page said, when asked if belt-tightening is needed now.\n\"If\u00a0you phoned someone from Washington, D.C. and told them Canada is hitting $1 trillion they'd say, 'Boy we wish we had your numbers,'\" Page said, citing the country's projected debtload.\nPage said that,\u00a0rather than austerity, the government should start talking about a stimulus package \u2014 measures beyond direct payments to Canadians. \"We have to take care of our citizens or else we'd be in a Great Depression-mode.\"\n"}, {"author": "Muriel Draaisma", "title": "Toronto reports 190 deaths related to COVID-19 as medical officer warns of second wave", "description": "281 people are in hospital with 109 in intensive care units, Dr. Eileen de Villa says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-update-covid-19-april-21-city-officials-1.5540117", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5540161.1587500488!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-toronto-march-17-april-10.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 21, 2020 5:15 PM ET", "2020-04-22T03:04:38.673Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A total of 190 people have died of COVID-19 in Toronto, and residents were warned on Tuesday that there will be a second wave of novel coronavirus infections in the city.\nThe city now has a total of 3,820 cases, which includes\u00a03,462 confirmed and\u00a0358 classified as probable. A total of\u00a0223 people have recovered.\u00a0\nOf the total number of cases,\u00a0281 people are in hospital with 109\u00a0in intensive care units. The new total represents an increase of 138 cases since Monday.\nDr. Eileen de Villa, the city's medical officer of health, told reporters at a daily news briefing that the city needs to ensure its health care system remains strong because the system\u00a0will have to manage the second wave.\n\"We know that we will experience another COVID-19 wave because we have yet to reach a high level of immunity in our community,\" she said.\n\"We will continue to see COVID-19 spreading in our community until we start to experience herd immunity. This will not happen until many people are infected with COVID-19 and recover and they build immunity that lasts, or we develop a vaccine.\"\nDe Villa, who presented a series of slides to show data about the disease in a larger context,\u00a0noted that the trajectory of COVID-19 cases\u00a0is lower in\u00a0Toronto, Ontario and Canada than it is for such\u00a0countries as Spain and the U.S., which\u00a0have seen a large number of cases\u00a0since outbreaks began.\n\"We believe, at this point, that the number of cases to date in Canada, Ontario and locally in Toronto is lower than originally forecasted. This is due in part to the strong public health measures that were put in place early in our outbreak and the fact that our residents took these measures seriously,\" she said.\n\"Thank you everyone for following the advice to stay home and practise physical distancing. I know it has been difficult but I hope you are now seeing the benefits of these actions.\"\nDe Villa added the city is currently in the \"peak period\" of its\u00a0community outbreak, but how long that period will last remains a question.\n\"I use the term 'peak period'\u00a0because a peak is really not just one day, nor is it one number, as the number of cases on any day during the peak will vary. The reality is that we will only know when we have hit our peak for COVID-19 cases after it has passed,\" she said.\nThe data shows the actual number of cases experienced in Toronto over time.\u00a0\nDe Villa said data\u00a0helps the city\u00a0understand how it has\u00a0used the resources of the\u00a0healthcare system resources during the outbreak.\u00a0The data also shows the curve currently flattening.\nShe added that the city can track\u00a0the impact of the collective work being done\u00a0to prevent the health care system from being overburdened. As the city moves down the curve, the data helps Toronto Public Health to plan and when to ease physical distancing measures, she said.\n\"It is critical that we ensure that we have healthcare resources and capacity in place to manage outbreaks we are seeing among vulnerable groups including our long-term care homes and shelter settings,\" she said.\nThe data shows\u00a0the number of hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and deaths to date.\nThe final slide, according to De Villa,\u00a0shows the\u00a0\"tale of the two outbreaks\" in the city.\nDe Villa noted that females represent about 60 per cent of the cases in long-term care homes, retirement homes, chronic care and hospital settings, a fact she attributed to females living on average longer than males and making up a larger proportion of the people in these settings. Women are also more likely to be employed in these places, she said.\nDe Villa said the city will continue to see COVID-19 spreading in its long-term care homes, which are experiencing their own distinct outbreaks.\n\"We should expect to see more cases in these settings,\" De Villa said.\nTwo institutions, in particular, are recording significant outbreaks. Eatonville Care Centre, a privately run long-term care home in Etobicoke, has 144 cases and has recorded 34\u00a0deaths. Meanwhile, Willowdale Welcome Centre, a shelter for refugees in North York, has 110 positive cases.\nMayor John Tory says the city has received a shipment of three million surgical masks that will be used primarily in long-term care homes and shelters for people experiencing homelessness.\nThe city ordered the masks from AMG Medical Inc., a distributor based in Montreal, and the masks\u00a0arrived in two shipments. The first shipment of one million\u00a0arrived on April 17, while the final shipment of two million\u00a0arrived on Tuesday.\n\"The new masks have been inspected and staff have confirmed masks are as ordered and have passed inspection,\" Tory said.\nBefore the city received the shipment, the city had enough surgical masks to last 52 days at the current consumption rate and 25 days in the worst case scenario. The new inventory means the city has about 127 days worth of stock at the current consumption rate and about 60 more days\u00a0in the worst case scenario.\nIn a news release, the city said it continuing to look for suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\"This new influx of PPE will ensure staff can continue to help the most vulnerable Torontonians in our shelters and long-term care facilities,\" the city said in a news release on Tuesday.\nIn a joint statement, the mayors of municipalities in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) said it is estimated that the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area alone is projected to lose 355,000 jobs because of COVID-19.\nThat number represents 28 per cent of GDP, along with with $894 million in lost wages and $3.7 billion in revenue losses for businesses.\n\"This will be felt right across the GTHA but it also threatens the provincial and national economies,\" the mayors said in the statement.\nTory said the mayors and chairs met by video conference on Tuesday to discuss the impacts of COVID-19 on the region and how they can work together to get the economy restarted when the time comes.\u00a0\nTory noted that the time will be determined not by politics, but by science and under the guidance of public health officials.\n\"A strong recovery right here in the GTHA is crucial to healing the economic damage done by COVID-19 and helping the families and businesses all governments have been working to protect throughout this emergency,\" the statement reads.\n\"Ontario's economy and Canada's economy need the GTHA to come back stronger than ever when the restart begins.\"\nToday I met by video conference with the Mayors and Regional Chairs of the GTHA to discuss the impacts of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> on the region and how our municipalities can work together on an a united regional economic restart and recovery. <a href=\"https://t.co/y5At92MHHk\">pic.twitter.com/y5At92MHHk</a>\nTory said the mayors and chairs agreed that they need to work together to reopen the economy, to share information about their respective financial positions and to explore\u00a0ways to obtain financial support from other governments.  \"A strong recovery needs strong cities and strong regions,\" Tory said.\nThe TTC and Toronto Paramedic Services, meanwhile, have repurposed five decommissioned TTC buses to transport ambulatory and stretcher-bound patients, including\u00a0those on ventilators.\nEach bus can transport three stretcher-bound patients, eight to ten ambulatory patients, depending on space needed for physical distancing, and three paramedics and a driver, the city said in a news release on Tuesday.\n\"The converted buses represent a key component of the city's contingency planning to support seamless, efficient, and timely patient care, while also providing important surge capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the city said.\nCrews completed modifications to three vehicles on Monday and the city said the emergency transport buses\u00a0will soon be on the road, responding to calls as needed. Modifications to two more buses are underway.\nTTC\u00a0bus drivers will drive the vehicles, while paramedics will tend to the needs of patients.\n\"I am extremely proud of the innovation and cooperation across our city government to fight COVID-19,\" Tory said.\n"}, {"author": "Maryse Zeidler", "title": "Demand for Indigenous tourism outpacing availability of staff, creation of infrastructure", "description": "Industry expert says unmet need increases risk of cultural appropriation and inauthentic experiences", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/indigenous-business-canada-1.5317336", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5318715.1570823688!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/world-indigenous-business-forum.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 12, 2019 7:00 AM PT", "2019-10-12T16:13:46.003Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Deanna Lewis has worked as a B.C. tourist guide for about 20 years, but never has she seen so\u00a0much interest\u00a0from visitors wanting to learn about her Squamish culture.\u00a0\nLewis, who is also an elected councillor with the Squamish Nation, works as an operator for Talaysay Tours.

While tourism overall grew by 14 per cent, Indigenous tourism grew by 23 per cent.\u00a0\nTourism industry research shows that more than one in three visitors to Canada are interested in an authentic Indigenous tourism experience.\u00a0\nThe industry's main challenge, according to Henry, is building capacity to meet demand.\nThat includes building better websites, training Indigenous staff and securing investment funding for infrastructure like shuttle buses and buildings.\u00a0\nNot having enough Indigenous-led\u00a0companies has, in some cases, led to cultural appropriation and misrepresentation when large tour operators try to meet demand without enough Indigenous contribution, Henry says.\u00a0\n\"These experiences need to be telling the truth about culture,\" he said. \"It can't be contrived and it can't be Disneyfied.\"\nTourists can often sniff out inauthentic experiences, Henry pointed out.\nOther Indigenous tourism operators from\u00a0around the world, who were also at the Vancouver conference, cited similar growth in their countries.\nLewis said one of the biggest factors limiting growth at Talaysay Tours has been finding Indigenous guides who are willing and able to share stories about their culture.\u00a0\nThe legacy of residential schools means previous generations have been hesitant about doing so.\u00a0\n\"Some people wanted to hold that knowledge,\" Lewis said. \"It was taken from them for a very long time.

At the start of the year, the federal debt was roughly $700 billion.\nBut Trudeau said today he has no immediate plans to table a budget because the government simply doesn't know how the economy will fare in the months ahead, as social distancing measures continue to cripple economic activity.\nHe also seemed to rule\u00a0out tabling some sort of document that could be updated as the fiscal situation stabilizes.\nTrudeau said the government is focused on \"immediate\" needs over long-term budgeting.\n\"A budget is usually something that projects what's going to happen to the Canadian economy for the next 12 months and right now, we're having a lot of difficulty establishing with any certainty what's going to happen in the next 12 weeks,\" Trudeau said today at his daily briefing with reporters.\n\"The situation is changing extremely rapidly.\"\nIn the midst of the 2008-09 global recession, the previous Conservative government tabled a budget in January 2009 and a fiscal update followed in September as the Tories responded to a cratering economy.\nWhen asked if there were any plans for a fiscal update this year, a spokesperson for Morneau said the department\u00a0had no comment beyond what Trudeau said at his press conference.\nConservative members pressed Morneau in the Commons today,\u00a0asking if the government had any projections of how much it would cost to finance the growing debt.\nMorneau said he will give a full accounting of the costs of the government's pandemic measures \"when we have the ability.\"\nThe PBO said the cost to service the debt will be manageable\u00a0for now,\u00a0because interest rates are at record lows \u2014 but a spike in those rates would be very \"concerning.\"\nWhile cabinet ministers have been reluctant to say if or when the next fiscal update will be released, a senior public servant told the Senate's national finance committee Tuesday that work is underway on such a plan.\n\"We're in the process of beginning that fiscal update, which, of course, involves consultation with the private sector, and we expect to be able to provide a fiscal update in the coming weeks,\" said Alison McDermott, an official in the economic and fiscal policy branch of\u00a0the\u00a0Department of Finance.\n\"I don't think the government has made any announcements about the timing of that at this point.\"\nKevin Page, the country's first PBO and the president and CEO of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa, said Morneau should produce a fiscal update by June to make\u00a0Canadians feel confident that the government has its fiscal house in order.\nPage said nobody is expecting a traditional 500-page budget \u2014 \"We're not in that\u00a0world right now, we get that,\" he said \u2014 but there's still a need for some sort of planning document. He said the prime minister should face pressure to release some numbers soon.\n\"It's pretty hard to say we don't need a fiscal strategy right now. The way to engender confidence is to be transparent,\" he told\u00a0CBC\u00a0News. \"I don't think they\u00a0can get away getting much past early June without a fiscal statement ... there's no accountability without a plan. We need to see a\u00a0tally.\"\nHe said people need to know if the government intends to continue programs like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the wage subsidy, and, if so, for how long.\n\"Just tell people \u2014 this is the situation, this is how we're going to respond. We need a strategy.\u00a0We need to tell people what to expect over the next few months,\" he said.\nSuch information is also important for would-be bondholders, Page said, who will be extending credit to a money-hungry government.\nSahir Khan, Page's former deputy PBO, said the government is probably reluctant to release numbers now because opponents could pounce\u00a0if the fiscal situation rapidly deteriorates.\nBut if health officials are expected to release modelling for COVID-19 infections and deaths, he said,\u00a0federal finance officials should do the same with deficit\u00a0spending and debt.\nAs spending continues unabated, former prime minister Stephen Harper voiced concerns Tuesday with the debtload much of the Western world has taken on in recent weeks in response to\u00a0this crisis.\nHarper, an economist by training, said balance sheets have become an \"unholy mess\" and some states are likely to face sovereign debt crises in the months ahead.\n\"If they fail to practice mild austerity proactively, a brutal kind will be thrust on them,\" Harper said in an op-ed published in the U.S.-based Wall Street Journal.\nHarper said \"leftists\" are trying to capitalize on this crisis to permanently expand the size of government by pushing ideas like a \"guaranteed minimum income.\"\n\"A new era of big government in the economy is unlikely, undesirable and far from inevitable,\" Harper said.\n\"When focus shifts from the pandemic to the economy, it will need to shift from a lot more government action to a lot less.\"\nBut Page, who was appointed by Harper, said now isn't the time to talk about austerity.\nHe said Canada is still in a strong fiscal position compared to\u00a0other industrialized nations,\u00a0with roughly half the average\u00a0debt-to-GDP ratios of other advanced economies.\n\"We're nowhere near code red,\" Page said, when asked if belt-tightening is needed now.\n\"If\u00a0you phoned someone from Washington, D.C. and told them Canada is hitting $1 trillion they'd say, 'Boy we wish we had your numbers,'\" Page said, citing the country's projected debtload.\nPage said that,\u00a0rather than austerity, the government should start talking about a stimulus package \u2014 measures beyond direct payments to Canadians. \"We have to take care of our citizens or else we'd be in a Great Depression-mode.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Portugal's ruling Socialists top general election", "description": "Not yet clear if PM Antonio Costa's party gained enough seats for majority", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/portugal-election-1.5311195", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311205.1570396366!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/portugal-election.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 06, 2019 5:45 PM ET", "2019-10-06T23:33:10.457Z"], "source": null, "content": "The centre-left Socialist Party collected the most votes in Portugal's general election Sunday, leaving it poised to continue leading the government for another four years.\nWith 208 seats in the 230-seat parliament awarded in the official count, the Socialists reached 99 seats, compared with 74 for the second-place Social Democratic Party. Social Democrat leader Rui Rio conceded defeat.\nThe parliament chooses a government, usually taken from the party that has the most lawmakers.\nIt remained unclear, however, whether the Socialists would get a parliamentary majority, with votes from abroad being counted late.\nThat could mean the Socialists take power as a minority government or pursue alliances with other left-of-centre parties to pass legislation \u2014 as they did in their last term with the Portuguese Communist Party and the radical Left Bloc.\nThe Left Bloc, which had won 17 seats in the incomplete count, said it was ready to open negotiations with the Socialists on a government program. The Portuguese Communist Party had 10 seats and the Christian Democrats five.\nAntonio Costa, the Socialist leader and incumbent prime minister, took power four years ago on a promise to undo austerity measures introduced during Europe's financial crisis, when Portugal needed an international bailout.\nNow his Socialists reaped the rewards of Portugal's economic rebound in recent years. Annual growth climbed from 0.2 per cent\u00a0in 2014 to 2.1 per cent\u00a0in 2018, and unemployment dropped by around half, to six\u00a0per cent, over that period.\nAs other Socialist parties have lost ground across Europe in recent years, Costa's administration has proved wrong the doubters who said it would overspend and endeared itself to its European Union partners by straightening out Portugal's ill-managed public finances.\nThe budget deficit \u2014 long a torment for Portugal as governments routinely overspent \u2014 is now close to zero under the financial stewardship of Finance Minister Mario Centeno, who also chairs the meetings of finance ministers from the 19 European nations that used the shared euro currency. Centeno is expected to continue in the post.\nThe Social Democrats are still associated in the public mind with deep cutbacks and a three-year recession that ended in 2014, when they were in government. Also, party leader Rui Rio has struggled to contain disagreements between factions of his party.\nSmaller, fringe parties may also gain a handful of seats in the 230-seat Republican Assembly, the country's parliament, which will elect the next government. The country's president is mostly a figurehead.\nPortugal hasn't witnessed the rise of populist or far-right parties which have risen to prominence elsewhere in the EU. Protests in Portugal are traditionally channeled into a low turnout \u2014 the exit poll said it could be a new low of around only half the country's 10.8 million eligible voters.\nThe next government faces plenty of challenges, including the United Kingdom's impending departure from the EU. The U.K. is one of Portugal's main export markets.\nWhile government spending is now more in line with revenues, Portugal's government debt is equivalent to more than 120 per cent\u00a0of gross domestic product \u2014 the third highest in the EU. And the combined government, private and corporate debt is more than three times the country's GDP, the Bank of Portugal says. If European interest rates rise, the Portuguese could find themselves in big trouble.\nOther challenges include climate change, as rainfall in the southern half of the country dwindles, and an aging population that threatens the financing of the welfare system. The EU says that at current fertility rates the number of Portuguese will decline from 10.3 million this year to 6.6 million in 2100.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian industry is 'addicted to fossil fuels,' but the Green Party can change that, says Elizabeth May", "description": "Goal isn't to come up with something politically palatable, it's to secure future: May", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-sept-27-2019-1.5298373/canadian-industry-is-addicted-to-fossil-fuels-but-the-green-party-can-change-that-says-elizabeth-may-1.5298632", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5296367.1569410796!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-green-party-20190920.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 27, 2019 12:13 PM ET", "2019-09-27T16:13:36.717Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Read Story Transcript\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May says Canadians want action on climate change, but are stymied by living in a society \"hardwired to fossil fuel use.\"\n\"It's very hard for an individual to take action in a system that's still subsidising fossil fuels, that's still promoting the idea that we can expand the oil sands,\" May told The Current's interim host Laura Lynch.\nShe said that what's needed is leadership and programs that help and encourage people to make sustainable choices, such as putting solar panels on their roofs, or plugging in their cars rather than stopping at the gas station.\n\"These are really good choices for the future, but almost impossible for the individual to do \u2026 against a structure in society that says we're addicted to fossil fuels, and we think that's just fine,\" she said.\n\"It's not fine.

They are vibrant, colourful and unique.\nAnd with airline travel set to double in a few short years, airports are employing some bold, non-stop marketing ideas.\nMost of us walk through airports like we're on a mission.\nChecking luggage, impatiently inching through security lines, finding the gate, waiting for the crunch of the boarding call. Hoping everything is on time.\nBut have you stopped to actually look at airports lately? They are undergoing big changes.\nIt may surprise you to know that airports compete for business with other airports.\nYes, airports are highly competitive brands.\nThey compete for passengers, hoping travellers will choose their airport as a hub or a connection. The more passengers that pass through its gates, the more revenue an airport makes.\nMore flights mean more income, more retail sales, and more duty-free revenue, more parking fees, and so on.\nAirports compete to attract airlines because airlines bring passengers along with lucrative landing and departure fees. Airlines choose which airports to use as hubs and connecting flights.\nAirports compete to attract and retain the best retailers and restaurants. In the new world of airport design, the highest-rated airports have the best retail stores, spas and restaurants. Happy travellers attract airlines. And, airports compete for big cargo contracts and warehouse fees.\nSo if you don't think airports are competitive brands, think again. The airports of today are mini cities.\nToronto's Pearson Airport, for example, facilitates over 50,000 jobs. It is the second biggest employment zone in Canada. Pearson hosted 45 million passengers and over 430,000 flights last year. It contributed over $42 billion\u00a0in economic activity or 6.3 per cent of Ontario's GDP.\nOver 63,000 work at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. It handled close to 900,000 flights last year. It features 300 retailers and restaurants and the airport generates $34 billion\u00a0in economic impact for metro Atlanta. It is one of the busiest airports in the world.\nOver 76,000 people work at Heathrow\u00a0Airport in London. It handles 1,300 flights every day and 80 million passengers every year.\nWith that much revenue at stake, it's no wonder airports have strategically redesigned themselves completely.\nThe new era of airport design began after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Suddenly, we all found ourselves spending more downtime at the airport than ever before. Prior to Sept. 11, you could catch a flight even if you got there at the last minute. Running to the gate was an airport clich\u00e9. But after the attack (and the shoe bomber) airport security became a major issue.\nPassengers now have to check in 90 minutes before domestic flights,\u00a0and two hours ahead of departure time when flying internationally. That means \u2014 for the first time in aviation history \u2014 we are now spending most of our time on the post-security side of the terminal.\nWith that seismic change,\u00a0airports needed to be redesigned.\nMost major airports are now bustling retail centres. They boast hundreds of retail stores and restaurants. They offer spas and sleeping pods. Pearson has a gigantic fitness gym on the main floor. Sales from retail, duty-free and food and\u00a0beverage accounts for over 54 per cent of an airport's revenues.\nWith that much potential revenue, airports are becoming destinations themselves.\nThe remarkable Changi airport in Singapore, for example, features a 40-metre-high indoor waterfall flanked by tropical plants and a forest of over 2,000 trees. It also has a butterfly garden, a rooftop pool and you can walk above it all on a 24-metre-high Sky-net. Travellers have voted Changi the best airport in the world for seven years in a row.\nIncheon International Airport in South Korea has a golf course and a skating rink.\nThe Munich Airport has a cinema, a minigolf course and its own brewery.\nThe Kansai\u00a0International Airport in Osaka, Japan, offers a dentist's office and a pet hotel.\nThe Amsterdam airport has a library.\nClearly, creating a unique experience is a critical aspect of branding an airport.\nFor more stories about Airports As Brands, click or tap the \"Listen\" button above to hear the full Under the Influence episode.

The debt was $62.7 billion on March 31, 2019. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nToews said the pattern of increasing debt needs to change.\n\"As a province, we must live within our means and curb expenses,\" he said.\nThe government's plans will be revealed when Toews tables his first budget in late October. A report on Alberta's finances prepared by a panel led by former Saskatchewan finance minister Janice MacKinnon\u00a0is aiding the government with its budget preparations.\u00a0\nToews said his plan is to return the province to balanced budgets within the government's first mandate, then start paying off the debt\u00a0\nDavid Eggen, the NDP MLA for Edmonton-North West, was suspicious about how Toews was characterizing he province's finances, saying the fiscal update provides\u00a0a \"flimsy excuse\" for making cuts this fall.\nEggen said the update shows Premier Jason Kenney's claim about the terrible financial situation his United Conservatives inherited from the previous government to be false.\u00a0\n\"This fiscal update shows that we are in a tenuous position but certainly the path to balance that our government set out is there,\" Eggen told reporters. \"It is not a dire circumstance that would require cutting nurses, teachers and essential social services.\"\nWhile the government focused on debt, other indicators defied the government's narrative of a treasury in crisis.\nRevenue was nearly the same as the same quarter last year \u2014\u00a0$13.4 billion. Revenue from personal and income taxes was $166 million higher than Q1 of 2018. The government attributed that to \"growth in household income and corporate profits.\"\u00a0\nResource revenue was up too \u2014\u00a0by $164 million, mostly due to a narrower differential between light and heavy oil prices.\nExpenses were $364 million lower than in the same quarter of 2018.\u00a0\nToews said increasing cost pressures and flat revenues combined with increasing debt equals trouble. He ruled out the prospect of a provincial sales tax, which some economists say would help curb Alberta's dependence on fluctuating resource revenues. He said the UCP\u00a0has committed to not increasing taxes during its time in government.\u00a0\nThe NDP Official Opposition claims the government's staged decrease in corporate taxes from\u00a012 to eight per cent by January 2022 would add $4.5 billion to\u00a0the deficit.\nToews\u00a0said he was confident the tax cuts would stimulate the economy and add to corporate tax revenues over time. Asked if he would reverse the tax cuts\u00a0if they don't work as planned, he said he would not.\n\"One of the greatest things you can do to actually discourage investment is to create uncertainty,\" he said. \"We've committed to reduce\u00a0corporate taxes. We will follow through on that.\"\nThe Alberta government is required by law to publish updates each quarter of the fiscal year. Usually, Alberta Treasury Board and Finance produces a booklet with fiscal and economic forecasts.\nUsually, fiscal updates compare the government's financial results to the budget. Since the last budget was released in March 2018, finance officials decided to compare the results from this quarter to the same quarter of 2018.\nGovernment officials on Tuesday declined to provide forecasts on Alberta's economy nor a current debt-to-GDP ratio.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Rail blockades causing containers to pile up at Canadian ports", "description": "Containers sitting idle at major import hubs of Vancouver, Montreal and Halifax", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/rail-blockade-ports-1.5471312", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5471347.1582303625!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/halifax-port-containers.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 21, 2020 11:48 AM ET", "2020-02-21T20:25:43.187Z"], "source": null, "content": "A rail blockade in eastern Ontario has led to backlogs at Canada's three biggest ports, prompting some shippers to take their business elsewhere as cargo piles up and dockworkers' paycheques shrink.\nThe protest along Canadian National Railway tracks east of Belleville, Ont., has halted CN's eastern network \u2014 about one-quarter of its operations \u2014 and choked shipments from coast to coast.\nAtlantic Container Line (ACL), a major U.S. shipping line, is diverting from the Port of Halifax in favour of U.S. harbours. The company, which typically berths two ships a week, is now docking in New York and Baltimore to run cargo inland on American railroads, chief executive Andrew Abbott said.\n\"It's our gateway port for North America. So if you take out the rail, it knocks out 90 per cent of the cargo that we were putting on the ship,\" said Abbott, whose company has been calling on the Halifax port for more than 50 years.\nACL typically handles the equivalent of about 2,000 20-foot containers a week in Halifax that carry everything from Ontario auto parts to French cheese.\n\"It's commercial damage to Canadian manufacturers. It's financial damage to the guys who are bringing in French wine or Walkers butter cookies, because they're not going on the shelves,\" Abbott said. \"Everybody's paying a piece.\"\nWATCH | Businesses try to wait it out:\nHalifax longshoremen are also working \u2014 and earning \u2014 less, as more than 60 per cent of freight that passes through the port is bound for trains that can no longer be loaded, port authority spokesman Lane Farguson said.\nThe blockade disrupts business for everyone from stevedores to truckers, packers, importers, exporters and the ports and railways themselves.\n\"It is certainly a challenging situation for everyone involved.\"\nIn Montreal, some 4,000 containers sit immobilized on the docks and Prairie bulk products like grain can no longer reach the port.\n\"We are obviously concerned about this situation, which has significant impacts on the economy and the transport logistics chain serving the port,\" spokeswoman Melanie Nadeau said in an email.\nMeanwhile, the number of ships waiting at anchor to enter Vancouver-area terminals has more than doubled to 50 due to the clogged transportation system, though no vessels are opting for U.S. ports as a result, said Vancouver Fraser Port Authority spokeswoman Melanie Nadeau.\nNearly two weeks ago, protesters barred road access to Canada's biggest freight hub for several days, one of many pop-up blockades at ports, rail lines and roads across the country.\nCN closed its critical eastern network eight days ago after protesters set up a blockade in Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory on Feb. 6 in support of Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who oppose a natural gas pipeline slated to pass through their traditional lands in British Columbia.\nThe rail shutdown is rippling out to other sectors. Superior Propane, Canada's largest supplier of the fuel, said the situation is getting dire as it begins to ration distribution in Atlantic Canada over concerns that hospitals, nursing homes and households could run out.\n\"This is a crisis that is unfolding. Unfortunately if it goes on many more days it will be very difficult for the propane industry to recover quickly enough to keep people in supply,\" chief executive Greg McCamus said in a phone interview.\nPropane companies generally have one to two weeks' supply on hand, relying on a network of trains and trucks to convey it from rail terminals to local storage facilities, he said. A frozen railroad squeezes that supply chain, triggering truck lineups as long as 10 hours for propane in Sarnia, Ont., according to Canadian Propane Association CEO Nathalie St-Pierre.\nThe blockades hinder west-to-east flow of household items from produce to plywood, Band-Aids and canola oil, and raise the cost of others, said Retail Council of Canada spokesman Karl Littler.\n\"In terms of the mass carried, rail is far more efficient. So you've got potential price impacts if everything that was formerly moved by rail is moved by truck\" \u2014 a sector already facing a severe shortage of drivers.\nThe effects are likely to be felt more keenly in smaller cities and towns, particularly in Eastern Canada, he said.\n\"We're not talking about some Soviet store where you've got two cans of gherkin,\" he said. \"But a lot of items are stuck 6,000 kilometres away in Vancouver.\"\nThe broader impact on the economy may only amount to a hit of 0.2 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth, said RBC economist Nathan Janzen \u2014 likely in the tens of millions of dollars. But the ripple effects are being felt \"acutely\" by some in the rail and manufacturing sectors.\nOn Wednesday, Via Rail announced temporary layoffs for 1,000 employees as its Montreal-Toronto, Ottawa-Toronto and Montreal-Quebec City routes remain suspended.\nEarlier this week, CN temporarily laid off about 450 workers from its operations in Eastern Canada after cancelling more than 400 trains since protests arose.\nMajor carriers are monitoring the blockades closely. German shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd continues to call on the Halifax port, but is reviewing the situation \"with a view to potentially omitting or rerouting vessels,\" said spokesman Tim Seifert.\nThe crisis is stranding an estimated $425 million in goods every day, according to the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters trade group.\n"}, {"author": "Mike Blanchfield", "title": "Freeland agrees to NDP trade pitch in return for new NAFTA support: letter", "description": "Liberals agree to inform House of 'intent to enter into negotiations' on new deals 90 days before they begin ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/freeland-ndp-trade-deal-1.5470328", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5466773.1581996887!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usmca-20200127.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 20, 2020 3:44 PM ET", "2020-02-20T20:44:54.096Z"], "source": null, "content": "Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland says she wants to make Canada's trade negotiations more \"transparent,\" by agreeing to proposals from the New Democrats to provide more details of future deals.\nFreeland offers that view in a Wednesday letter to the New Democrats, a promise that secured the party's support for a speedier ratification of the new North American trade deal, which is still before Parliament.\nIn the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Canadian Press, Freeland makes clear she is agreeing to the NDP proposals to get support for ratifying the new continental trade agreement among Canada, the United States and Mexico.\nFreeland maintains that the 13 months of acrimonious negotiation among the three countries was open and transparent because the government consulted widely with stakeholders.\nNDP trade critic Daniel Blaikie disagrees, saying the actual negotiations were held in secret, and the government provided inadequate analysis of the economic consequences of the deal to Canadians.\nFreeland\u00a0confirmed to Blaikie during question period in the House of Commons Thursday that the NDP proposals would be adopted and thanked the party for backing the ratification of the trade deal in a timely manner.\u00a0\nFreeland says the government will provide the House of Commons with an economic-impact assessment at the same time the legislation to ratify a trade deal is tabled.\nShe said that report will include \"estimates of overall economic impact of a free trade agreement on the Canadian economy, including changes in gross domestic product (GDP), trade flows, unemployment, and income as well as sector-specific estimates for the sectors directly addressed in the free trade agreement.\"\nThe government also agrees to inform the House of \"intent to enter into negotiations\" on new deals 90 days before they begin and \"to require objectives for negotiations\" for new deals to be tabled 30 days in advance, the letter says.\nFreelan's letter says she is making the changes \"in light of the NDP proposal and to add further transparency to the free-trade negotiations process.\" It says she was responding to written proposals from NDP sent on Dec. 16.\n\"In exchange for these changes,\" Freeland concludes, \"I understand we can count of the support of the NDP\" to 'expeditiously' ratify the new trade deal \u2014 something the U.S. and Mexico have already done.\nAs the letter states, and Blaikie acknowledges, reopening the deal to further negotiations was a non-starter.\n\"We've always felt that the trade negotiation process has been far too secretive, and Canadians will benefit from a more open and transparent process,\" Blaikie said in an interview.\n\"The way to do that is to make sure that the government has to be more clear about its intentions both in terms of letting Parliament know who it is negotiating with and also laying out its objectives so that at the end you can measure whether the government succeeded.\"\nBlaikie dismissed a suggestion that his party's manoeuvring represented a break from its past policy of being skeptical and unsupportive of free trade.\n\"This agreement is still part of a model of globalized trade driven by corporations that we are critical of,\" he said.\n\"We knew we couldn't change the deal. You can't open it up again. So, we wanted to focus on something we could change, which is what this looks like for future trade deals like Canada-U.K., Canada-China and Canada-India,\" Blaikie added.\n\"I look forward to having a better process when the next government comes along that's looking to sign Canada up for some kind of trade deal.\"\nEarlier this week, Freeland offered effusive public thanks to New Democrats for supporting the new deal and stinging criticism of the Conservatives for wanting to study it further at a Commons committee. In the House of Commons Thursday she said Blaikie was a pleasure to work with on the changes.\nFreeland said the government wanted to limit study of the new deal, and was surprised that Conservatives wanted to extend committees' study of the agreement into March.\nBut the Conservative trade critic Randy Hoback told The Canadian Press that there was no circumstance under which his party would vote against ratifying the trade deal. He said the Tories simply wanted to hear from witnesses to give voice to people who are concerned about the deal, to make it stronger in the long term.\n\"That's what created the problem in the previous NAFTA is when people were left out. They were the ones that elected Trump this last election, because they were left out,\" said Hoback.\nPresident Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to rip up the old North American Free Trade Agreement during the renegotiations. Freeland has had cabinet responsibility for Canada-U.S. relations during that time as foreign affairs minister and now as deputy prime minister.\nGetting a new deal became the Liberal government's top priority because of Canada's massive economic dependence on access to the United States, its biggest trading partner.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "British immigration overhaul takes aim at 'cheap labour from Europe'", "description": "Changes likely to impact service, farming and health-care industries, among others", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/britain-immigration-system-plans-1.5468158", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5468167.1582118918!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/britain-politics-patel.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 19, 2020 8:45 AM ET", "2020-02-19T13:45:19.124Z"], "source": null, "content": "Britain announced new post-Brexit immigration rules Wednesday that will make it tougher for European Union citizens, but easier for people from many other nations, to move to the U.K. starting next year.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government said the new rules would \"open up the U.K. to the brightest and the best from around the world\" while ending \"the reliance on cheap, low-skilled labour coming into the country.\" But U.K. employers said the radical changes could bring about a labour crisis for sectors such as health and social care.\nBritain's exit from the EU last month after 47 years of membership is triggering the biggest change to the country's immigration rules for decades.\nDuring Britain's EU membership \u2014 and until a post-Brexit transition period runs out on Dec. 31 \u2014 citizens of any of the EU's 27 nations can freely live and work in the U.K.\nMore than three million EU citizens currently living in the U.K. are entitled to stay. But from Jan. 1, 2021, new immigration rules will apply to EU and non-EU citizens alike.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said Britain's new \"points-based immigration system\" would assess prospective immigrants on a range of skills, qualifications, salaries or professions.\nPeople hoping to work in Britain will need a job offer paying at least 25,600 pounds ($43,975 Cdn) a year. That's less than the current 30,000 pounds ($51,510 Cdn) set for non-EU immigrants, a figure that is more than the country's average annual wage. Prospective immigrants who earn less may be able to come if they have other skills.\nSkilled immigrants are currently required to have a university degree but in future will only need the equivalent of Britain's pre-university \"A levels.\"\nThe government says the new rules will cut net immigration from its current level of more than 200,000 people a year. But it has abandoned a pledge made by previous Conservative governments to cut Britain's annual net immigration figure to below 100,000 a year.\nThe immigration plan still has to be passed by Parliament \u2014 which is highly likely since the Conservatives have a large majority.\nThe government said it would come up with specific proposals for scientists, graduates, health-care workers and those in the agricultural sector. But there is no specific immigration route for what the government calls \"low-skilled workers\" \u2014 a category it says includes 70 per cent of the more than one million EU citizens who have moved to the U.K. since 2004.\nHundreds of thousands of EU citizens currently hold jobs in sectors including farming, health care and restaurants that are relatively low-paid.\nEmployers in those industries have warned there will be worker shortages under the tighter immigration rules. The U.K. Homecare Association described the lack of provisions for low-paid immigrant workers in the proposals as \"irresponsible.\"\n\"Cutting off the supply of prospective care workers under a new migration system will pave the way for more people waiting unnecessarily in hospital or going without care,\" it said.\nBut the government was unsympathetic.\n\"We need to shift the focus of our economy away from a reliance on cheap labour from Europe and instead concentrate on investment in technology and automation,\" it said in a policy paper. \"Employers will need to adjust.\"\nMany people who voted in 2016 for Britain to leave the EU believed that immigration had driven down wages and driven up joblessness among British-born workers. The evidence for this is partial at best.\nThe Migration Advisory Committee, an independent body consulted by the government on immigration plans, said introducing a points-based system would only \"very slightly increase GDP per capita, productivity, and improve the public finances\" compared to continued free movement of EU citizens, and would also reduce Britain's economic growth.\nDiane Abbott, the immigration spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, called the proposed new system flawed.\n\"This isn't an 'Australian points-based system,'\u00a0which is a meaningless government sound bite,\" she said. \"It's a salary threshold system, which will need to have so many exemptions \u2014 for the NHS [National Health Service],\u00a0for social care and many parts of the private sector\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that it will be meaningless.\"\n"}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "Tax the rich, spend on the poor: 3 years in, this is still an NDP government", "description": "But with an economy still performing tops in Canada, the government can comfortably stay the course", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-budget-2020-analysis-1.5467815", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5467963.1582073554!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bc-budget-2020-lock-up.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 19, 2020 4:00 AM PT", "2020-02-19T12:00:00.436Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "\"Budgets are really about choices,\" said Finance Minister Carole James, more than once, as she delivered her third budget as B.C.'s finance minister.\nThat being said, there were fewer choices to make\u00a0in this budget than her first two.\u00a0\nWith over three-quarters of the NDP's election platform already on the way, and a commitment to a balanced budget, there was always going to be little room to manoeuvre \u2014 even if reforms at ICBC and a slight slowdown in the provincial economy hadn't taken place.\u00a0\nBut those things did happen, and it meant the government had a decision to make: how would it stay in the black without going back on spending commitments in the expensive health and education ministries?\u00a0\nThe answer was a new tax on the people making the most money in the province \u2014 giving the province its highest marginal tax rate (20.5 per cent for people making over $220,000) this century.\u00a0\n\"If you had taken a\u00a0look at the past government, what often would happen at this time when you saw moderation in the economy, you'd see programs and services cut \u2026 we're not doing that,\" said James.\u00a0\n\"In order to do that, we've asked the top one\u00a0per cent to pay a little bit more.

Demographic factors, like age and population density, were also considered.\nThe idea was to peer 10 days into the future starting March 31 and see what would happen if New Brunswick followed different sets of measures.\nThe team settled on South Korea, Denmark and Spain for the models.\n\"We looked at South Korea, which had a really good effort of mobilizing and reducing the spread of the disease,\" McDonald\nHe said Spain's initial response to the outbreak was not effective \u2014 as of Wednesday, it stands only second to the United States in confirmed cases and second to Italy in deaths \u2014 and Denmark represented a \"middle ground\" scenario since it has a similar median age to New Brunswick and 20 per cent of both populations is above 60 years old.\nUsing trajectory data from the three countries as of March 31 \u2014 when New Brunswick had 70 confirmed cases \u2014 the team forecast how many cases, hospitalizations and intensive care patients the province would have on April 10.\u00a0\nThe best-case scenario: 120 cases, 16 hospitalized and four in intensive care. The maximum predicted numbers under the South Korea scenario: 147 cases, 19 hospitalized and four in intensive care.\nThe worst-case scenario, Spain's trajectory, paints a wildly different picture: 550 cases, 72 hospitalized, 17 in intensive care. The maximum numbers in that 10-day projection jump to 1,570 cases, 204 hospitalized and 47 in intensive care.\nAs of Wednesday, there have been 108 confirmed cases in the province and there are six current hospitalizations, four of which are in intensive care \u2014 numbers that track closely with the South Korea model.\nAlthough the institute receives funding from the provincial government, it is arm's-length and the report is an independent initiative.\u00a0\nThe New Brunswick government is expected to release its COVID-19 projections for the province Thursday.\nDr. Kim Barker, the medical officer of health for the southern region of the province, offered the first glimpse into provincial projections earlier this month to the Town of Sussex. She said the peak of the outbreak is expected to hit the week of April 21.\nTracking along the best-case scenario means the provincial health-care system should not be pushed beyond its 150 ICU-bed capacity, the research indicated.\nMcDonald noted the province and health authorities are already redeploying resources and moving long-term care patients in anticipation of a surge.\nBut from the institute's perspective, the long-term concern is what happens next. He said modellers are starting to examine how delaying medical procedures and surgeries to focus on urgent care will burden the system on the other side of the pandemic.\nPlus, he said, we have to consider mental health issues following extended sheltering.\n\"Part about what we're going to be working on is thinking about those issues and thinking what the burden those issues might be as we kind of recover from this,\" he said.\nThe positive trajectory comes with a warning, however.\u00a0\nMcDonald said forecasting is a \"fraught business\" and it's still too early to tell if the province has \"sufficiently flattened the curve.\"\nHe said data is limited and there is a lot we don't understand yet, like why are some people more susceptible to the infection than others.\n\"The models really are like economic models,\" he said. \"Models that are predicting employment growth rates or GDP next year or interest rates, they're all going to have a margin of error. They're only as good as the data that go in them and they rely on the assumptions that are made to generate those forecasts.\"\nThe positive projection is also a sign that the restrictions in place are working and the public should continue to comply.\n\"Just because we're on a good trajectory now doesn't mean everything is fine, ease up on those restrictions because we're done,\" McDonald said.\u00a0\n\"It doesn't mean that at all.\"\nMcDonald said the next big questions are when and how to ease restrictions.\nHe cited a quote from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and key official in the Trump administration's outbreak response, who was asked this week about loosening restrictions and restarting the American economy.\n\"It isn't like a light switch, on and off,\" Fauci said.\nHowever, modelling using the trajectories of countries who are further along in the pandemic could offer some insight into best practices.\n\"China is now easing restrictions, so there is going to be some information there on their experiences,\" he said. \"We've seen what's happened in Japan where there was an easing of restrictions and there's a recurrence.\n\"So as much as what has to go along with that easing of restrictions is also a system that can mobilize very quickly to deal with those cases, to isolate, to track every possible contact and to make sure those contacts are isolated as well.\"\nWatching how other countries react can inform our own system, he said.\n"}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "Tax the rich, spend on the poor: 3 years in, this is still an NDP government", "description": "But with an economy still performing tops in Canada, the government can comfortably stay the course", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-budget-2020-analysis-1.5467815", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5467963.1582073554!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bc-budget-2020-lock-up.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 19, 2020 4:00 AM PT", "2020-02-19T12:00:00.436Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "\"Budgets are really about choices,\" said Finance Minister Carole James, more than once, as she delivered her third budget as B.C.'s finance minister.\nThat being said, there were fewer choices to make\u00a0in this budget than her first two.\u00a0\nWith over three-quarters of the NDP's election platform already on the way, and a commitment to a balanced budget, there was always going to be little room to manoeuvre \u2014 even if reforms at ICBC and a slight slowdown in the provincial economy hadn't taken place.\u00a0\nBut those things did happen, and it meant the government had a decision to make: how would it stay in the black without going back on spending commitments in the expensive health and education ministries?\u00a0\nThe answer was a new tax on the people making the most money in the province \u2014 giving the province its highest marginal tax rate (20.5 per cent for people making over $220,000) this century.\u00a0\n\"If you had taken a\u00a0look at the past government, what often would happen at this time when you saw moderation in the economy, you'd see programs and services cut \u2026 we're not doing that,\" said James.\u00a0\n\"In order to do that, we've asked the top one\u00a0per cent to pay a little bit more.

Demographic factors, like age and population density, were also considered.\nThe idea was to peer 10 days into the future starting March 31 and see what would happen if New Brunswick followed different sets of measures.\nThe team settled on South Korea, Denmark and Spain for the models.\n\"We looked at South Korea, which had a really good effort of mobilizing and reducing the spread of the disease,\" McDonald\nHe said Spain's initial response to the outbreak was not effective \u2014 as of Wednesday, it stands only second to the United States in confirmed cases and second to Italy in deaths \u2014 and Denmark represented a \"middle ground\" scenario since it has a similar median age to New Brunswick and 20 per cent of both populations is above 60 years old.\nUsing trajectory data from the three countries as of March 31 \u2014 when New Brunswick had 70 confirmed cases \u2014 the team forecast how many cases, hospitalizations and intensive care patients the province would have on April 10.\u00a0\nThe best-case scenario: 120 cases, 16 hospitalized and four in intensive care. The maximum predicted numbers under the South Korea scenario: 147 cases, 19 hospitalized and four in intensive care.\nThe worst-case scenario, Spain's trajectory, paints a wildly different picture: 550 cases, 72 hospitalized, 17 in intensive care. The maximum numbers in that 10-day projection jump to 1,570 cases, 204 hospitalized and 47 in intensive care.\nAs of Wednesday, there have been 108 confirmed cases in the province and there are six current hospitalizations, four of which are in intensive care \u2014 numbers that track closely with the South Korea model.\nAlthough the institute receives funding from the provincial government, it is arm's-length and the report is an independent initiative.\u00a0\nThe New Brunswick government is expected to release its COVID-19 projections for the province Thursday.\nDr. Kim Barker, the medical officer of health for the southern region of the province, offered the first glimpse into provincial projections earlier this month to the Town of Sussex. She said the peak of the outbreak is expected to hit the week of April 21.\nTracking along the best-case scenario means the provincial health-care system should not be pushed beyond its 150 ICU-bed capacity, the research indicated.\nMcDonald noted the province and health authorities are already redeploying resources and moving long-term care patients in anticipation of a surge.\nBut from the institute's perspective, the long-term concern is what happens next. He said modellers are starting to examine how delaying medical procedures and surgeries to focus on urgent care will burden the system on the other side of the pandemic.\nPlus, he said, we have to consider mental health issues following extended sheltering.\n\"Part about what we're going to be working on is thinking about those issues and thinking what the burden those issues might be as we kind of recover from this,\" he said.\nThe positive trajectory comes with a warning, however.\u00a0\nMcDonald said forecasting is a \"fraught business\" and it's still too early to tell if the province has \"sufficiently flattened the curve.\"\nHe said data is limited and there is a lot we don't understand yet, like why are some people more susceptible to the infection than others.\n\"The models really are like economic models,\" he said. \"Models that are predicting employment growth rates or GDP next year or interest rates, they're all going to have a margin of error. They're only as good as the data that go in them and they rely on the assumptions that are made to generate those forecasts.\"\nThe positive projection is also a sign that the restrictions in place are working and the public should continue to comply.\n\"Just because we're on a good trajectory now doesn't mean everything is fine, ease up on those restrictions because we're done,\" McDonald said.\u00a0\n\"It doesn't mean that at all.\"\nMcDonald said the next big questions are when and how to ease restrictions.\nHe cited a quote from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and key official in the Trump administration's outbreak response, who was asked this week about loosening restrictions and restarting the American economy.\n\"It isn't like a light switch, on and off,\" Fauci said.\nHowever, modelling using the trajectories of countries who are further along in the pandemic could offer some insight into best practices.\n\"China is now easing restrictions, so there is going to be some information there on their experiences,\" he said. \"We've seen what's happened in Japan where there was an easing of restrictions and there's a recurrence.\n\"So as much as what has to go along with that easing of restrictions is also a system that can mobilize very quickly to deal with those cases, to isolate, to track every possible contact and to make sure those contacts are isolated as well.\"\nWatching how other countries react can inform our own system, he said.\n"}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "B.C. budget 2020 promises new tax on wealthy to help ensure future surpluses", "description": "Higher taxes on the top 1% to bring in $216 million next fiscal year ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-budget-day-carole-james-finance-2020-1.5466533", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5467739.1582065248!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/carole-james-b-c-2020-budget-victoria-2020.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 18, 2020 4:00 AM PT", "2020-02-18T23:45:26.781Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The B.C. government is promising continued balanced budgets over the next three years thanks to a new tax on the highest earners, sugary drinks, vaping and companies like Netflix.\u00a0\n\"We're asking those at the top who benefit most from our economy to contribute a little bit more,\" Finance Minister Carole James told reporters on Tuesday as the province unveiled its new budget.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"This really is a budget that builds a stronger British Columbia: not for a few at the top, but for everyone.\"\u00a0\nPremier John Horgan's NDP minority government is projecting a $227 million surplus for the 2020-21 fiscal year, along with $179 million in 2021-22.\u00a0\nBut it also announced three new tax measures to help achieve that:\u00a0\nWatch: Finance Mininster Carole James announces new tax\u00a0for most wealthy British Columbians, PST on sugary drinks and increased funds for low income post secondary students.\nJames said the increase to the top tax bracket \u2014 the second in three years \u2014 still leaves B.C. with the third lowest income taxes in the country\u00a0for people making under $475,000.\u00a0\n\"This will help to deliver the infrastructure and services that create good jobs and keep B.C.'s economy moving,\" she said, arguing the new taxes were required to ensure the province wouldn't have to cut funding to ministries at a time when the economy was slowing.\u00a0\nOutside those announcements, it was a relatively stand pat budget by the government, as it continued to build upon programs announced in previous budgets.\nHowever, there were some notable increases to planned spending.\u00a0\nThe government will spend around $130 million more on education this year than originally planned, due mostly to higher than projected enrolment. Around $50 million more will be earmarked over the next three years for the homeless, including 500 additional shelter spaces.\u00a0\nFurther, spending in the next fiscal year on health care \u2014 long the biggest driver of costs in the provincial budget \u2014 is now $22.2 billion, up from an anticipated $21.5 billion 12\u00a0months ago.\nThe newly announced\u00a0B.C.

The mutual defence clause has only ever\u00a0been invoked once\u00a0\u2014 by\u00a0Canada on behalf of the U.S.\u00a0in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\nThe 158 Canadian soldiers and seven Canadian civilians who lost their lives in Afghanistan died upholding Article Five. The NATO alliance only works when members trust that others will answer when the call comes.\nMilitary analyst Dave Perry of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute said NATO allies still trust the U.S. military, American institutions\u00a0and the individual Americans they work with in the alliance.\n\"The concern is really about a president who keeps demonstrating, over and over again, that he has a very different view of how America should be relating to its allies,\" he said.\n\"The American president has left the impression at times that he's got better relations with the Russian president than he does with some of the heads of NATO allies in Europe or even Canada.\"\nIvo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, was the U.S. permanent representative on the NATO Council for four years under President Barack Obama.\nHe said President Trump has undermined the alliance by sowing doubts about America's intentions.\n\"He has said many times that NATO is obsolete. He refused for the first six months of his presidency to reaffirm Article Five, and has called into question whether the United States should continue to be a member of NATO if the allies are not willing to spend more on defence,\" he said.\n\"It's those kinds of questions that lead allies to say, 'If the chips are down, will the U.S. be there?' And there's less confidence about that today than there used to be.\"\nDaalder said Trump has undermined that trust through both his words and his actions.\n\"President Trump has taken a number of steps, including abandoning his Kurdish allies in Syria, that would call into question his commitment to alliance relationships,\" he said.\nPerry agrees that the betrayal of the Kurds sent a shiver through the Western alliance.\n\"It's not just that the United States bailed out on the Kurds, because I think we've seen a version of that movie before. It's the no-notice way of doing it, and the fact that the president would make these kinds of decisions not only capriciously, but also appearing to have totally ignored any advice that he did bother to solicit,\" he said.\n\"The president's whims are increasingly being translated into tangible outcomes. People have been speculating for several years that the president will send some tweets, but then the 'grown-ups' will prevail. I think the Syria example shows that the 'grown-ups-prevailing' narrative may be coming to an end.\"\nWhile some European leaders expressed their doubts in private, France's President Emmanuel Macron made his public in a recent interview with The Economist. In it,\u00a0Macron said NATO was suffering \"brain death\" and openly questioned Article Five.\nDaalder said the French leader's concerns about the United States' reliability as an ally may be affected by his own ambitions to lead Europe.\n\"My reading of President\u00a0Macron's latest statements are back in this Gaullist perspective that France needs to lead Europe,\" he said.\u00a0\"I'm gratified that the reaction to that from allies within Europe has been to say, 'Don't call into question the fundamental nature of the alliance with the United States,\u00a0and indeed with Canada,' while at the same time trying to say how can we do more ourselves within a European context.\"\nOn Thursday, Macron defended his harsh language and expanded on it.\n\"The questions I have asked are open questions\u00a0that we haven't solved yet \u2014 peace in Europe, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the relationship with Russia, the issue of Turkey,\" he said. \"Who is the enemy?\u00a0\n\"So I say, as long as these questions are not resolved, let's not negotiate about cost-sharing and burden-sharing, or this or that. Maybe we needed a wake-up call, as they say in English. I'm glad it was delivered, and I'm glad everyone now thinks we should rather think about our strategic aims.\"\nBut the U.S. does want to talk about cost-sharing; in fact, the Trump administration announced unilaterally this week that it intends to cut its contribution to NATO's total budget from 22 per cent to 16 per cent. Other members, including Canada, will have to pick up the slack.\nIt's a feature of NATO that the closer its members are to Russia, the more likely they are to meet the desired threshold of spending at least 2 per cent\u00a0of GDP on defence.\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, while visiting President Trump in the Oval Office on Monday, made a point of noting that his country spends 3.1 per cent\u00a0of its GDP on defence.\n\"You should tell that to Germany,\" Trump huffed.\nTrump has singled Germany out for failing to spend enough on the alliance, although his\u00a0administration also is pressuring Canada.\nIn the run-up to the NATO summit, the U.S. and Germany have been feuding over another topic familiar to Canadians: Huawei.\nLike their Canadian counterparts, Germany's leaders are wrestling with whether to permit the Chinese company to bid on contracts to build its 5G networks. Berlin has been subjected to a pressure campaign by Washington to ban Huawei as a potential security risk.\nOn Sunday, German minister Peter Altmaier recalled during a TV debate that it was the Americans\u00a0\u2014 not the Chinese\u00a0\u2014 who were caught spying on Germans through the PRISM program exposed by Edward Snowden in 2013.\nPointing out that Germany had not boycotted the U.S. companies that facilitated that spying, Altmaier reminded Germans that \"the U.S. also demands from its companies that they pass on information.\"\nBack in 2013, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel personally reproached President Obama about the bugging of her phone, he apologized and promised to make changes to the program.\nU.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell said Altmaier's remarks were \"an insult to the thousands of American troops who help ensure Germany's security and the millions of Americans committed to a strong Western alliance.\"\nMeanwhile, Turkey continues to behave more like an adversary than a member of the NATO alliance, doubling down on its arms purchases from NATO's main strategic rival Russia \u2014 and threatening other members with sending jihadists captured in Syria back to their European countries of origin if their governments don't stop complaining about Turkey's actions in Syria.\nTurkey has depended on President Trump to shield it from U.S. retaliation over its attack on Kurdish enclaves in Northern Syria, which infuriated both Republicans and Democrats. At the same time, it has counted on Trump to block enforcement of a U.S. law that requires Washington to impose sanctions on Turkey for installing Russian-made S-400 air defence systems.\nOn Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu castigated Macron for hosting a delegate from the Kurdish YPG last month.\n\"He is already the sponsor of the terrorist organization and constantly hosts them at the Elys\u00e9e. If he says his ally is the terrorist organization ... there is really nothing more to say,\"\u00a0said Cavusoglu.\n\"Right now, there is a void in Europe. [Macron is] trying to be its leader.\"\nMacron shot right back, arguing Turkey's attack on the Kurds was at cross-purposes with NATO's mission to defeat the Islamic State.\n\"One cannot say on one hand that we're allies, and consequently demand our solidarity, and on the other hand\u00a0put one's allies in the face of a military offensive delivered as a fait accompli\u00a0that endangers the action of the coalition against the Islamic State,\" he said.\nAnd on Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan upped the stakes again, accusing\u00a0\"some countries\u00a0that are accustomed to not taking risks and always winning\" of being unable to \"tolerate Turkey's efforts to protect its own rights, laws, borders and sovereignty. Most particularly, the latest comments of French president are the examples of this sick and shallow understanding.\n\"[Macron]\u00a0says NATO is experiencing a brain death. I'm addressing Mr. Macron from Turkey and I will say it at NATO: You should check whether you are brain dead first.\"\nAs if the rancour wasn't enough, Perry said that President Trump is sowing new doubts by pardoning convicted war criminals.\n\"For all its warts, the U.S. has long been an upholder of the laws of armed conflict. For him to be intervening in that process of maintaining order and discipline is extraordinarily troubling,\" he said, citing Trump's recent decision to intervene in a disciplinary case against\u00a0a Navy SEAL accused of war crimes in Iraq.\n\"From allies' perspective, it's another piece falling on top of the Syria withdrawal.

Then, she followed in Trudeau's footsteps, strolling through Unity Park with the Ethiopian prime minister. And as Trudeau was leaving Jubilee Palace from his meeting with the Ethiopian president, Solberg's staffers were in the building preparing for her imminent arrival.\nIt's no coincidence. The two leaders are both in Africa to win support from world leaders for a UN Security Council seat they both want to win. And Norway's prime minister is suggesting that when it comes to that campaign, it may be Canada who is trailing behind.\n\"I think one of the differences, of course, is we have been on the steady same path for a very long time, so [African leaders] know us,\" Solberg told Canadian reporters.\nTake, for example, the African Union meeting. Trudeau made history on this trip by being the first Canadian prime minister to attend an African Union session. But Solberg was also here last year.\nThe African Union is a rich source of potential votes for any country looking to win a Security Council seat. It has 54 voting members at the United Nations, roughly a quarter of the total votes.\nSpeaking to Canadian reporters, the Norwegian leader said she\u00a0didn't want to emphasize competition between the two countries, noting they take the same approach to many issues. But she suggested Norway was perhaps more deeply engaged.\n\"Canada is a bigger economy, a larger country, of course, but on the other hand we are using more in development aid. We have used more support for the international policies as part of our GDP.\"\nIn 2018, Norway spent nearly one\u00a0per cent of its gross national income on international assistance. For Canada, the figure was 0.28 per cent, according to OECD figures.\u00a0\nNorway, Ireland and Canada are all gunning for one of the two limited-term UN Security Council seats that open up next year.\u00a0\nIreland too, has been plotting a course of engagement with Africa for years. It launched its \"Africa Strategy\" in 2011.\nWhile all countries see the seat as something of a prize that would allow their countries to play an influential role in world affairs, Solberg said the seat is also something of a burden.\n\"It's an obligation that you have as supporters of multi-lateralism, as a supporter of rule of law. \"\n\"You have to take the burden of sitting on the Security Council, because it's also a burden. You have to take a stand on some policy decisions that as a non-member you don't have to do.\"\nCanadian officials point to the warm reception Trudeau is receiving in Ethiopia. His speech on gender equality received plenty of applause at the African Union and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed spent two hours personally touring Trudeau around Unity Park.\nCanada's International Trade Minister Mary Ng, who has been on a week-long trade mission to South Africa, Kenya and Ethiopia, said there are\u00a0\"deep connections\" between Africa and Canada.\n\"There's really great discussions that are taking place between African businesses and Canadian businesses and they're looking to explore further opportunities.\"\nAsked if she was confident Canada would win the seat, Ng would only say Canada would work hard.\n\"We are pursuing this with energy and because we believe Canada has a very positive role to play on the world stage.\"\nCanadian officials have previously pointed to investments the government has made over the past few years in Africa.\nIt committed $2.65 billion over five\u00a0years to helping developing countries, including many on the continent, fight climate change. Canada has also helped raise billions of dollars for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which does 65 per cent of its work in Sub-Saharan Africa. It recently pledged $930 million over two years to the fund.\nThe vote for the 2021-22 United Nations Security Council seats is scheduled for mid-June.\n"}, {"author": "Amanda Parris", "title": "Artists are getting us through COVID-19.

And it's led many of us to reflect not only on the current moment but also on what comes next. If there will be an \"after\" COVID-19, the world will be fundamentally changed. (Yes, I said \"if.\")\u00a0\nThere's a\u00a0question that I've noticed coming up a lot lately: what kind of new world do we want to build? Part of the answer lies in reflecting on what we don't want to continue. I suggest that in this new iteration, we stop devaluing artists' worth.\nIf you told me a month ago that I would be spending my evenings re-watching the pilot episode of The Walking Dead, jotting down tips for non-violent survival tools (transistor radio, walkie talkies, bolt cutters?), I would have laughed \u2014 a lot. But the world looks different today than it did just a few weeks earlier.\u00a0\nThe things we once took for granted seem more fragile and fleeting than ever before. I've only been able to stop myself from descending into a rabbit hole of existential despair and irrational paranoia by basking in live duets between Deborah Cox and Tamia, or watching Christopher Paunil create ridiculously stylish COVID-19 masks. I've spent mornings reading the words of M. NourbeSe Philip, evenings struggling to keep up with Esie Mensah's dance moves and nights jamming down to sets by some of Toronto's finest DJs.\u00a0\nAnd I'm not the only one. Everyone I talk to seems to be coping with social isolation through engagement with art and culture. Our calendars are now populated by appointments for virtual theatre readings, Instagram Live paint-alongs and Stay-at-Home Cinema nights. At a time when social distancing has become a matter of life and death, it is the creatives who have largely made it possible to endure this new way of life.\nLet's not forget that this isn't an easy time for anyone in the creative industries. Lockdowns around the world have forced tours, performances, book launches, festivals and film productions to cancel. Entire creative industries that are already highly vulnerable have been put on pause.\u00a0It is too early to say how much this virus has economically affected Canada's cultural industries, but artists felt the hit almost immediately.\nThe thing is, before this lockdown even began, artists in Canada were already facing a multitude of challenges. Last year in Ontario, funding to the Ontario Arts Council was cut by $10 million, a $5 million Indigenous Culture Fund was cancelled and the Ontario Music Fund was cut by $8 million. Similar decisions were made in Alberta in 2019, with cuts to video game industries, the Alberta Foundation of the Arts and The Banff Centre.\nIn Winnipeg, proposed cuts to the arts made headlines earlier this month. In February, Nova Scotia arts groups challenged the province's decade-long funding freeze. These recent cuts follow a national trend where support for the arts is largely deemed elective. It is often one of the first areas on the chopping block when governments want to balance budgets. Artists are constantly forced to prove their value and worth to governments and voters. This lockdown should be a wake-up call to all of us who are leaning on these creatives now: arts and culture needs to be an unwavering national priority.\nBut if you're tired of me tugging on your heart strings and need things broken down into dollars and cents, artists are consistently bringing this country cold hard cash.\nNumbers released by Statistics Canada last year revealed that the economic impact of culture industries in 2017 was approximately $59 billion. That's eight times more than sports and is larger than the combined value of utilities; agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting; and accommodation and food services.\nIn 2014, Toronto spent far less per capita on arts, culture and heritage than cities like Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary and Ottawa, but creative industries in Toronto still contributed $11.3 billion to the city's GDP. Artists bring in money, and perhaps more importantly, they also help to build Canadian identity.\u00a0According to a fact sheet put out by the Toronto Arts Council, 95 per cent of Ontario residents believe that the success of Canadian artists gives people a sense of national pride.\nDespite all of this, our culture constantly belittles artists' worth, but remains happy to parade their talent for ceremony. Remember when former Prime Minister Stephen Harper said that \"ordinary working people\" don't care about the arts \u2014 that they don't want to turn on their TVs to see artists whining about funding at \"a rich gala\"?\u00a0\nIn Harper's estimation, artists aren't working people. (And an important note about those \"galas\"\u00a0\u2014 they're a rare opportunity for artists\u00a0to celebrate their work and make important connections. They can also lead to more recognition and resources for their work). Harper's\u00a0astonishing ignorance about the average life of Canadian artists would have been hilarious if the reality weren't so sad.\u00a0\nAccording to a recent Canada Council study, the median individual income for Canadian artists is $24,300, which is well below the poverty line. The lowest rung is reserved for dancers, who make $15,800 a year, on average. Musicians and singers follow them ($17,900/year) and then actors and comedians ($18,500/year). People in these creative fields have been hit particularly hard by the lockdown. The tours and live shows that make up a substantial part of their income have all been cancelled. And contrary to Harper's assessment of artists, the Toronto Arts Foundation's 2019 Art Stats report revealed that Toronto-based artists work an average 51.4 hours a week, which is more than the average full-time Canadian worker.\u00a0\nIn spite of that hustle and grind, the majority of artists in the city cannot make enough to continue living here. A recent cost of living index estimated that a resident would need to earn $55,500 a year to afford rent and take public transit in Toronto. With so many artists now unable to earn their wages, the future looks bleaker, even with the various avenues of support that have emerged in the midst of COVID-19.\u00a0\nNot all artists are in the same boat, however. I would be remiss if I didn't also mention Black artists' difficulties in accessing arts funding. Historically, it has been an upward climb, regardless of government-enforced cuts. Andrea Monike Fatona's critical study on equity at the Canada Council of the Arts illustrates how in the '80s and '90s, Indigenous, POC and Black artists had to work together to lobby various cultural institutions to address the systemic exclusion of their art and the way that work was positioned and categorized. There is a systemic reason why racialized Canadians are underrepresented in the arts community. It is scary to think how much more those numbers will decrease as we feel the after-effects of this moment.\u00a0\nAs we sit at home in isolation bingeing movies created by artists,\u00a0watching Instagram Lives hosted by artists and\u00a0singing along to music created by artists, I hope an awakening happens. What kind of world do we want to build? I hope it's one where the same creatives who have kept us entertained and sane during this time are no longer taken for granted. I want a world where artists are respected and valued for their work and their worth.\nCBC Arts understands that this is an incredibly difficult time for artists and arts organizations across this country.

And craft breweries have been permitted to sell their products curbside as well.\n\"We explored the option of allowing alcohol sales via delivery from restaurants, and brought the issue to the joint committee dealing with COVID-19 response,\" said Finance Minister Tom Osborne.\u00a0\n\"While we had a good discussion, these changes would require introduction of legislation to accomplish. There are many considerations for such a shift, including how age verification is confirmed.\"\u00a0\nOsborne said implementing such a change without due consideration of these issues would be irresponsible.\nChef Todd Perrin knows the struggles of the restaurant industry.\n\"We're particularly vulnerable in our business, because we're so reliant on that daily cash flow and anything that disrupts missing a Thursday, or a Friday, or a Saturday \u2014 it just has a very direct effect on your ability to proceed,\" he said.\n\"The closure \u2014 be it a Snowmageddon event or a global pandemic \u2014 these holes that get blown in our revenue are gone forever.\"\nAs a co-owner, Perrin said he felt the effects of the pandemic right away. Mallard Cottage in Quidi Vidi was closed (as well as its related inn next door); Waterwest Kitchen and Meats in St. John's changed its service to takeout only.\nAcross those three businesses, Perrin said, they had to lay off almost 70 employees. There are now only a dozen people on the job.\nWith changing safety measures, Waterwest later shifted to curbside pickup \u2014 which has led to a drop in sales.\nPerrin said he's unhappy with what he's heard out of Ottawa to date, noting that waiting six weeks for money is not sustainable for their current operating model.\n\"It's not enough to pay the bills, really, but in the interest of trying to kind of wait out until we see what level of [federal government] support is going to be there,\" he said.\n\"It's really just an exercise in keeping some of our staff operational and not having to go through the process of closing the business [which also has associated costs].\"\nPerrin said the near-term future of Waterwest will depend on this week \u2014 how well the business does, and what new challenges come with the evolving COVID-19 situation.\n\"[It's] going to be a big teller in terms of what we're going to be able to do for the next number of months,\" he said.\nBut through it all, Perrin said he remains hopeful.\n\"I've been joking that it's bobbing and weaving, but it's certainly the most trying thing that we've ever gone through,\" he said.\n\"Our goal is always to keep rolling, and we'll do whatever we can, personally and businesswise, to do that.\"\nThe team will hold strategy meetings early next week to try to figure out a path forward.\n\"[It's a] combination of how the level of business is \u2026 how our staff is feeling, how we're able to maintain a safe environment for our staff to work in, and maintain a safe environment for ourselves and our customers,\" he said.\n\"[We're] dedicated to make it happen, if we can.\"\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Dr. Brian Goldman", "title": "The health cost of being poor", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/whitecoat/the-health-cost-of-being-poor-1.5449683", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5242435.1580753871!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/homeless-newcomers-20190809.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 03, 2020 11:30 AM ET", "2020-02-03T17:43:31.328Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canadians pride themselves on having a health-care system for everyone. But an editorial published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) says the system is failing people with low income.\u00a0\nThis happens in several ways, say the authors of the editorial, Dr.\u00a0Andrew Boozary, executive director of health and social policy at\u00a0University Health Network in\u00a0Toronto, and Dr. Andreas Laupacis,\u00a0CMAJ's\u00a0editor in chief.\nFirst, publicly funded health care in Canada covers only certain services. Prescription drugs are inconsistently funded in Canada. Coverage of physiotherapy is almost non-existent. Home care coverage is inadequate. So is counselling for mental health problems.\nFor many Canadians, employee benefits make up the shortfall. Those with lower incomes do without simply because they can't afford them. When they do have coverage, disadvantaged patients with limited financial resources use fewer preventive and outpatient services than those with higher incomes.\nPoverty also leads to insidious barriers even when services are \"free.\" For instance, they might not be able to afford the cost of transportation.\nIncome disparities lead to predictable shortfalls in health. A recent\u00a0report\u00a0from Ontario found that only 54 per cent of women living in the poorest neighbourhoods got screening for cervical cancer. By comparison, more than 67 per cent of women living in the most affluent urban neighbourhoods got full screening for cervix cancer. Disparities like that are true for colorectal cancer screening too.\nStudies show that people who live in well-off parts of Canada have better access to family medicine than people who live in areas that are less advantaged.\nThese discrepancies affect survival. In Ontario, between 1993 and 2014, the likelihood of dying from a preventable cause more than doubled among people living in the province's poorest neighbourhoods.\nIndigenous people are among the vulnerable Canadians. Approximately one-third of the people who use shelters are Indigenous. That's according to\u00a0research by the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness. People with physical and mental disabilities are twice as likely as other Canadians to live below the poverty line. Up to 45 per cent of people who are homeless are living with some sort of disability.\nSingle mothers are also\u00a0on the list of those whose health is disadvantaged. One in five single mothers live in poverty. Racialized families are more likely to live in poverty, and racialized women tend to earn less money. According to one estimate, two million seniors who were receiving the Guaranteed Income Supplement were living on an annual income that was below the basic standard of living.\nAs the editorial states, when compared to other countries, Canada ranks relatively poorly in spending on social programs. A 2018\u00a0study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that Canada ranked 10th out of 11 well-off nations in terms of public spending on health expressed as a percentage of total national GDP.\nThat article pointed to\u00a0other disturbing trends. Canada placed second only to the U.S. in newborn and infant mortality.\nA paper\u00a0published last week in CMAJ argued that Canadian social programs have changed relatively little over the decades despite substantial transformations across society. These include increased migration and cultural diversity, changing family structures and gender roles, as well as changes to the economy and globalization.\u00a0\nThe editorial calls on the federal government and the provinces to do more to address those inequities. For instance, Canada needs to consider a guaranteed annual income. It needs to understand that health and social services are interconnected.\nOther countries are making strides. The U.S. has proposed a national interagency council on the social determinants of health. Earlier this year\u00a0New Zealand\u00a0released a budget promising more money for mental health, Indigenous peoples and poverty reduction. Iceland and Scotland have expressed interest in similar policies. Canada must invest more in evaluating these sorts of policies here.\nInstead of trailing other well-off nations, Canada should be leading the way. It's the right thing to do. Given the cost of health care, it's also the smart thing to do, as prevention costs far less than managing serious and avoidable chronic diseases.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "New virus could trigger travel sector woes akin to damage from SARS in 2003", "description": "Transportation, tourism companies have seen declines in share prices", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-economic-impact-1.5437393", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5437413.1579792108!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/japan-china-outbreak.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 23, 2020 10:21 AM ET", "2020-01-23T15:21:46.948Z"], "source": null, "content": "A deadly new virus that emerged in China is raising concerns beyond the public health sphere as experts warn about the potential economic cost of a global outbreak that is already drawing comparisons to the deadly SARS epidemic 17 years ago.\nTransportation and tourism companies have seen declines in share prices amid travel warnings and restrictions from governments around the world hoping to avoid a repeat of the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which cost the Canadian economy an estimated $5.25\u00a0billion.\nAt least 17 people have died and more than 500 have been infected by the ailment called novel coronavirus, whose early cases are linked to a market in Wuhan in central China. The World Health Organization postponed until Thursday a decision on whether to declare an international emergency over the outbreak of the flu-like illness, which can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms, including one case in the United States.\n\"The cost to the global economy can be quite staggering, in negative GDP terms, if this outbreak reaches epidemic proportions as until this week, the market was underestimating the potential of the flu spreading,\" Stephen Innes, chief Asian strategist for AxiCorp, said in a report.\nThe travel sector has already started to feel the hit as shares of four North American airlines that fly to China, including Air Canada, fell on Tuesday amid growing anxiety about the viral infection.\nNone of the airlines fly directly to Wuhan, but their Chinese partner airlines do, and some passengers transfer from a Chinese carrier to a Canadian one, offering the potential for the virus to spread here.\nShares at the three biggest U.S. cruise lines have also fallen, with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. \u2014 which boasts a major Chinese presence \u2014 dropping more than four per cent this week.\nAnalyst Chris Murray of AltaCorp Capital pointed to the past for clues on the market volatility, propelled by \"an unknown level of potential disruption.\"\n\"History suggests shares may be in for a rough ride,\" he said of airline and tourism stocks in a research note. He recalled jittery stock movements after the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003, as well as with H1N1 influenza in 2009 and the Ebola virus in 2014.\n\"These larger-scale epidemics can have a more pronounced near-term impact. However, once a better understanding of the magnitude of the spread and severity was understood, stock prices recovered quite sharply in all three cases within months,\" he said.\nThe extent of the epidemic so far still falls well short of the spread of SARS, a virus from the same family as coronavirus that spread from China to more than two dozen countries \u2014 including Canada.\nSARS infected more than 8,000 people worldwide, killing close to 800, according to the World Health Organization. The disease sickened about 438 Canadian patients and caused 44 deaths in the Toronto area.\nSARS cost the country $5.25 billion and about 28,000 jobs, according to a 2014 report by Kai Ostwald, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs.\nThe damage came in large part from fear-based shifts in consumer behaviour rather than higher medical expenditures, Ostwald said.\n\"Specifically, fear of contagion prompted widespread aversion behaviour, in which people significantly reduced activities that put them in close proximity with others. This included not only things like flying and eating in restaurants, but also activities like workplace and school attendance,\" he wrote.\nHotels in the Greater Toronto Area, where the Canadian outbreak was centred, lost out on an estimated $39 million in revenues in April 2003 alone, according to the Canadian Tourism Commission.\nLess traffic through the city's Pearson airport spawned some $220 million in losses, according to the Conference Board of Canada. More than 800 bus tours were cancelled by the end of April \u2014 when the World Health Organization issued a one-week travel advisory for Toronto \u2014 with an economic loss of up to $6 million.\nAir Canada wouldn't speculate on the potential impact from coronavirus. In 2003 financial reports, it said passenger revenues decreased in part due to lower demand for travel resulting from the SARS crisis, particularly in the Pacific market that \"was severely adversely impacted with large reductions in traffic and capacity.\"\nChang Hoon Oh, a business professor at Simon Fraser University, warned against alarmist reactions to relatively small outbreaks.\nCanadian authorities are now more prepared for SARS-like viruses, he said. But he also noted that the number of annual visitors to Canada from China has shot up, growing by a factor of 10 since 2000 to 757,000 travellers in 2018, according to Statistics Canada.\nOn Tuesday a U.S. citizen who had recently returned from China was diagnosed in the Seattle area, making the United States the sixth country to report a case, following China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.\nWhile the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, uncertainty over how deadly and transmittable the new virus may be has amplified concerns, especially on the cusp of the annual mass travel surrounding lunar New Year, which begins this week.\nDr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, says she immediately contacted her counterparts at the provincial level upon hearing of three potential cases of the new virus that were investigated and ruled out.\n\"They in turn have notified their front line in terms of their health system,\" Tam said on a call with reporters Monday. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer has said hospitals are already employing protocols established during the SARS epidemic in anticipation of possible cases.\nCanadians are at low risk of contracting the illness, Tam said. Other precautionary measures have been introduced by the Public Health Agency of Canada, including screening processes at airports in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal to identify passengers travelling from Wuhan for assessment by Canada Border Services Agency officers, including a possible temperature check.\nTour operators are alert, but aren't battening down the hatches just yet.\n\"Industry is monitoring the issue,\" said Tourism Industry Association of Canada spokeswoman Marcela Diaz in an email.\n"}, {"author": "Ian Froese", "title": "Manitoba government delivers cautious budget as COVID-19 rattles economy", "description": "Revised budget estimates negative economic growth in 1st half of 2020, rebound by end of year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-budget-2020-21-1.5492319", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5501808.1584564679!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winnipeg-richardson-international-airport-empty.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 19, 2020 3:23 PM CT", "2020-03-19T20:23:46.613Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "While the province's economy is reeling from COVID-19, the Manitoba government unveiled a cautious budget Thursday that it still believes can fend off an economic downturn while delivering on tax cuts.\nThe budget, delayed more than a week by procedural delays from the Opposition NDP, was originally set to be delivered on March 11 \u2014 the day before\u00a0the first presumptive case of COVID-19 was announced in Manitoba.\nPremier Brian Pallister\u00a0pre-empted major budget surprises by announcing an upcoming one percentage point cut to the provincial sales tax and changes to the payroll tax, along with unveiling the province's own carbon tax, earlier this month.\nThe Progressive Conservative government\u00a0has decided to keep those measures, but in recent days has tempered budget plans that were revealed under embargo last week\n\"Because COVID-19 is a rapidly changing situation, we cannot provide specific details in respect to our 'bottom line,'\" the\u00a0province said in the supplemental budget documents.\nThat revised budget maintains a $300-million injection into the\u00a0rainy-day fund, intended to be used for unforeseen expenses, but speeds up the process.\nThe province will top up the fund \u2014 currently sitting at $571 million\u00a0\u2014 to $800 million over the next month.

However, we must do our part, and the government will oversee this collective effort,\" Girard said in an advance copy of his budget speech.\nThe government also renewed a popular tax rebate for the purchase of electric cars, dubbed Roulez Vert, and a program (Chauffez Vert) to encourage homeowners to switch to a renewable energy heating system.\nBut Quebec will still need to substantially cut emissions in the transportation sector in order to meet its 2030 target.\nCurrently, about 44 per cent of Quebec's greenhouse gas emissions come from the transport sector, especially fossil fuel-burning cars and trucks.\nPatrick Bonin, a climate campaigner with Greenpeace Canada, said the budget doesn't contain enough measures to curb emissions, and devotes too much money to building roads, as opposed to expanding public transit.\n\"Overall, when you look at what is on the table, it's far from what is needed to counter the climate emergency,\" he said. \"We're quite skeptical that Quebec is on the way to meeting the targets of the Paris accord.\"\nMontreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante, who has made fighting climate change key to her own mandate, said she was \"pleased to witness an important shift\" toward public transit. But she also said she was disappointed that the government did not commit to build any new social housing in the city as its vacancy rate hits a 15-year low.\n\"We cannot ignore the immediate housing needs of thousands of Montrealers,\" Plante said.\nWATCH: Finance minister breaks\u00a0down the budget by the numbers\nThe budget was tabled in the midst of global economic uncertainty, sparked by fears of the coronavirus and volatile oil prices.\nQuebec projected GDP growth to drop to two per cent in the coming year, down from 2.8 per cent in 2019. It expects growth to drop further, to 1.5 per cent in 2021.\nBut Girard's budget was prepared before stock prices dropped dramatically on Monday.\nA line in the document acknowledges the COVID-19 epidemic could hinder economic growth, but otherwise maintains Quebec's finances make it \"resilient to economic disruptions.\"\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Girard said the province is prepared for any impact on the economy or the health-care system.\n\"We will see what the evolution of the virus is,\" he said.\nCarlos Leit\u00e3o, the finance critic for the Liberals, said the budget \"lacked prudence.\"\nHe said the two per cent growth forecast was aggressive given global uncertainty, and that the budget didn't contain sufficient \"provisions for risks.\"\nHe suggested a \"mini-budget\" could even be necessary in the coming months to address the lack of foresight seen in Tuesday's plan.\nHere are some other key takeaways.\nMore cash is being put into the province's crumbling infrastructure. The amount in the province's 10-year infrastructure plan will increase by $15.1 billion, to a total of $130.5 billion.\nIn all, the plan devoted $15.8 billion for public transportation projects in six cities across the province, including Montreal's light-rail network, an extension of the Metro's Blue line and the possible extension of the Yellow line. There was no mention of adding a new Pink line to the network, an idea long championed by Plante.\nThe road network, meanwhile, was allotted $26.8 billion. Environmental groups had pressed the Legault government to devote equal money to roads and public transit.\u00a0\nImprovements to education infrastructure, such as schools, was allocated $25.5 billion, while health and social services got $20.5 billion.\nDespite the focus on the environment, the biggest spending areas in the provincial budget remain health care and education.\nEducation spending is going up by 4.5 per cent, while health-care expenditures are increasing by 5.3 per cent.\nIn education, the CAQ says it will add 350 more pre-kindergarten\u00a0classes for four-year-olds, bringing the total to more than 1,000. The government will also put $126 million toward helping students with special needs, and promised 6,000 more subsidized daycare spaces within two years. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nMuch of the new health-care money is going toward improving primary care services. But it also includes a commitment to add 900 beds to long-term care facilities, and $450 million over five years to hire more staff in the province's beleaguered youth protection system.\nThe CAQ moved closer to standardizing the school tax rate across the province, which was a key election promise. That means homeowners in certain regions will save hundreds in the coming year.

\u2014\u00a0the EXPO Centre at the Edmonton Exhibition Lands\u00a0site and the Edmonton Convention Centre downtown \u2014 and attracting tourism.\u00a0\nRight now, the EEDC manages these two areas and\u00a0four groups under its Innovate Edmonton branch: StartUp Edmonton, Edmonton Made, InnovateYEG and the Advanced Technology Centre.\u00a0\nCouncillor Sarah Hamilton said for as long as she can

should be in this space,\" she said. \"What we'll hear time and again is that we actually need to be really firm and decisive, and it's time to be firm and decisive on the issue of the EEDC.\"\nShe noted that the EEDC used to foster trade and attract foreign direct investment until Edmonton Global \u2014 a regional body of 14 municipalities \u2014 was created in 2017 and picked up most of this

city's urban form branch.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe recommendations are up for public discussion at a meeting Wednesday.\u00a0\nCouncil can vote to\u00a0develop an innovation authority but the shareholder

There's no question about that,\" he said.\nTo support his analysis, he also studied satellite images of China's nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, a pollutant that is emitted through the burning of fossil fuels.\u00a0\n\"That actually showed an even larger reduction of around 35 per cent\u00a0in NO2 levels, so it gave us\u00a0confidence that we're at least not overestimating when we say 25 per cent\u00a0or more,\" he said.\nAnother significant contributor to the emissions decrease was the dramatic decline in China's domestic and international\u00a0air traffic, which account for about 15 per cent of global air travel emissions.\nAn analysis\u00a0by the flight data agency Flightradar24 shows that since late January, 13,000 fewer flights are\u00a0landing and taking off each day from Chinese airports.\n\"In general, air traffic originating in China is down 80 per cent since the beginning of the year,\" Flightradar24 spokesperson Ian Petchenik said in an email.\nThe paradox of airline travel is one of the most intriguing aspects of the epidemic for Ann\u00a0Dale, director of the School of Environment and Sustainability at Royal Roads University in Victoria.\u00a0\n\"We've got a virus that is spreading more rapidly because of our advances in airline travel. Ironically, it's also resulting in a decrease in that airline travel.\"\nShe said it raises questions about how much international travel is sustainable.\n\"What are the limits and optimal scale of travelling? How many greenhouse gas emissions do you want to consume?\" she said.\n\"Maybe it's time we started addressing questions about limits and scale on human consumption.\"\nAn economic shock that affects carbon emissions this dramatically is rare. Experts point to the 2008 global financial crisis as another moment when an unintended series of circumstances resulted in major reductions in carbon emissions.\u00a0\n\"What it shows is that emissions are closely linked to economic growth,\" said Klaus Hubacek, an ecological economist at the University of Groningen, Netherlands.\u00a0\"Once economic activities decline, you have a reduction of associated emissions.\"\nThe\u00a0entanglement of\u00a0economic activity and carbon emissions is one of the most vexing aspects of climate change mitigation.\nFor years, experts have debated how to separate\u00a0growth from carbon emissions,\u00a0a concept known as de-coupling.\n\"The economy grows, the emissions grow, unless we have decoupling,\" said Hubacek, whose research\u00a0has shown that reducing\u00a0carbon emissions in one country often results in a shift of carbon-intensive production to another country.\nThe task is also complicated by the challenge of lifting much of the world out of poverty while trying to reduce emissions. Hubacek points out that half of the world's population is still living on $3 a day.\nSome academics are also studying the concept of degrowth,\u00a0a school of thought where economic activity is deliberately reduced to slow climate change. The research is geared toward\u00a0policies that would gradually scale back economic growth\u00a0to the point where it's\u00a0in sync with global resources. The idea is to\u00a0use local\u00a0resources and change\u00a0the way people work so that less time is spent on economically oriented activity.\n\"I find it quite sympathetic and interesting but it's really, within academia, a niche. I don't think it has any political traction at this point,\" said Hubacek.\nThe various carbon mitigation strategies being considered around the world right now are based on a planned and co-ordinated approach to reducing emissions. So the\u00a0empty highways and silent streets of Wuhan, China, are not some\u00a0stark glimpse of a carbon-controlled future.\n\"Economic activity has to be reduced in some sectors and overall emissions have to decrease, but this is not in any way planned or a healthy way of reducing emissions,\" said Hubacek.\nMyllyvirta\u00a0had a similar assessment of what's happening in China.\u00a0\n\"A\u00a0plan to bring down emissions, even very rapidly, would not look like this,\" he said.\n\"Millions and millions of people\u00a0are suffering in different ways because of what's happening in China. People are unable to access health care, people are unable to work. Many of them\u00a0are losing income.\"\nHaving said that, some aspects of China's response to the coronavirus \u2014 such as the construction of Huoshenshan Hospital\u00a0in Wuhan in just 10 days \u2014\u00a0could be used as a model if the world decided to move rapidly to a green economy, he said.\n\"It would look more like that construction site for the hospital, mobilizing a lot of resources to build clean energy on a scale that would enable us to ditch fossil fuels in the span of a decade or two.\"\nMyllyvirta said his colleagues in China who have been forced to work from home during the epidemic have already adapted.\n\"I have so many friends\u00a0and contacts who have logged on to a proper\u00a0video conferencing system\u00a0for the first time\u00a0because of this,\" he said. \"Will we see more remote working in China going forward? That's something that has been adopted very rapidly.\"\nThe climate implications of COVID-19\u00a0are still evolving.\u00a0More flights are being cancelled as the epidemic spreads to other countries.\u00a0\nAnd the\u00a0outbreak is already being factored into global oil demand projections.\nThe International Energy Agency's\u00a0\u00a0oil market report this month stated that \"global oil demand has been hit hard\" by the virus and\u00a0China's economic slowdown. The report predicts demand will fall in \"the first quarterly contraction in more than 10 years.\"\nBut those contractions in fossil fuel consumption are viewed as temporary. There are concerns that carbon emissions could rise sharply if China\u00a0pushes for rapid economic recovery when the epidemic subsides.\nChinese officials could choose to stimulate the economy through large-scale, carbon-intensive construction projects as has happened in the past, said\u00a0Myllyvirta.\n\"If [China]\u00a0actually wants\u00a0to grow the GDP six\u00a0per cent after what's happened during the past few weeks, that would mean\u00a0an enormous amount\u00a0of spending on new construction. And that would mean a lot of emissions.\"\nWhen the country raced to recover from the previous financial crisis\u00a0by\u00a0building infrastructure,\u00a0the amount of emission-intensive cement used between 2011 and 2014 was staggering.\u00a0\n\"In those three years, they consumed 50 per cent more cement than the U.S. in the whole of the 20th century,\" said Hubacek. \"It's just mind-boggling.\" \u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Polarizing ex-defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa wins Sri Lanka presidential vote", "description": "Victory marks return of family ousted from power in 2015 amid various allegations", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/sri-lanka-president-election-gotabaya-rajapaksa-1.5363021", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5363023.1574036849!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sri-lanka-election.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 17, 2019 8:00 PM ET", "2019-11-18T01:00:45.857Z"], "source": null, "content": "Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a former defence official revered by Sri Lanka's ethnic majority for his role in ending a bloody civil war but feared by minorities for his brutal approach, declared victory Sunday in the nation's presidential election.\nSri Lanka's ruling party presidential candidate, Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa, conceded defeat to Rajapaksa, saying he would honour the decision of the people.\nRajapaksa, the campaign front-runner and former defence secretary under his brother, ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa, pledged to restore security to the Indian Ocean island nation still recovering from ISIS-inspired attacks last Easter.\nRajapaksa announced his candidacy shortly after the terrorist attack that killed 269 people, faulting the government for intelligence lapses and letting the security sector falter.\nHis victory in Saturday's vote marks the return of a family ousted from power in 2015 elections amid constant reports of nepotism, skimming off development deals with China and alleged human rights violations during the end of the decades-long war with the Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009.

The numbers are just staggering,\" Brett Finlay, a University of British Columbia microbiology professor who chaired the panel, said in an interview. \"It's time to do something now.\"\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada commissioned the report on the socio-economic impacts of antimicrobial resistance\u00a0and the Council of Canadian Academies assembled the independent panel. The 268-page document released Tuesday represents the most comprehensive picture to date of the country's resistance rate, as well as its costs to the health system and economy.\nAntimicrobial resistance occurs when micro-organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, evolve to resist the drugs that would otherwise kill them. Unnecessary antimicrobial use in humans and agriculture exacerbates the problem, and widespread international travel and trade help resistant bacteria spread around the world.\nThe most common antimicrobials are antibiotics, which treat infections caused by bacteria. The report focuses on resistant bacteria, but uses the broader term antimicrobial because surveillance data tend to be collected under this heading.\nAn investigation by The Canadian Press last year revealed Canada has been sluggish to act on the growing threat. At that time, the government did not know how many Canadians were dying of resistant infections and it had not produced a plan that lays out responsibilities for provinces and territories.\nA pan-Canadian action plan has still not materialized, but the new report estimates an annual death toll in Canada. The panel used the current resistance rate of 26 per cent to calculate\u00a0resistant infections contributed to over 14,000 deaths in 2018, and of those, 5,400 were directly attributable to the infections \u2014 only slightly less than those caused by Alzheimer's disease.\nThe panel's economists used a more cautious model to project the impacts than a well-known international report by British economist Jim O'Neill, which predicted up to 10 million global deaths annually by 2050.\nThe Canadian report's findings on the economic and social toll of antimicrobial resistance are stark. Currently, the problem costs the national health-care system $1.4 billion a year, and by 2050, that figure is projected to grow to $7.6 billion, the report says. The cost to GDP is expected to jump from $2 billion to up to $21 billion annually.\nResistant infections decrease quality of life while increasing isolation and stigma and the impact will be unequally distributed as some socio-economic groups are more at risk, the report adds. These groups include Indigenous, low-income and homeless people, as well as those who travel to developing countries where resistant microbes are more common.\n\"Discrimination may be targeted at those with resistant infections or deemed to be at risk of infection,\" the report warns. \"Canadian society may become less open and trusting, with people less likely to travel and more supportive of closing Canada's borders to migration and tourists.\"\nAntimicrobial resistance has the potential to impact everyone, Finlay says.\n\"It's going to change the world,\" he says. \"We all go to hospitals and we all get infections.\"\nThe report notes that resistance could increase the risk and reduce the availability of routine medical procedures including kidney dialysis, joint replacement, chemotherapy and caesarean section. These procedures all carry a threat of infections for which antibiotics are commonly prescribed.\nLimiting the impacts of antimicrobial resistance requires a \"complete re-evaluation\" of health care in Canada, the report concludes.\nThe panel states that Canada lacks an effective federal, provincial and territorial surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance and use, with little comprehensive data describing the number of resistant infections and their characteristics.\nIt also calls for improved stewardship involving careful use of antimicrobials to preserve their effectiveness, strict infection prevention and control through hand hygiene, equipment cleaning and research and innovation for new treatments.\nThe report notes it's unlikely that new broad-spectrum antimicrobials will be discovered. None have been found in decades and there's little profit incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in drugs that quickly cure patients. However, the panel calls for more flexible regulations and incentives to promote discovery of new antimicrobials that treat infections caused by specific bacteria.\nAlternative therapies are also being developed to treat or prevent resistant infections, including vaccines and treatments using phages, which are viruses that attack bacteria, the report adds.\nCanada should immediately invest $120 million in research and innovation. and up to $150 million in stewardship, education and infection control, matched by the provinces and territories, says Dr. John Conly, a panel member and University of Calgary professor specializing in chronic diseases.\nThe government and public should \"absolutely\" be as concerned about antimicrobial resistance as they are about climate change, Conly says.\n\"It's a slow-moving tsunami. Like a tidal wave, it's out at sea but it's going to land on us much sooner than climate change.\"\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Jonathan Montpetit", "title": "Why the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois came back from the dead to haunt the Liberals", "description": "By recycling old arguments, Trudeau and the other leaders appeared out of touch with Quebec", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bloc-qu%c3%a9b%c3%a9cois-come-back-haunt-liberals-nationalism-sovereignty-1.5327944", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5327945.1571530197!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/yves-francois-blanchet.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 20, 2019 10:11 AM ET", "2019-10-20T14:11:34.708Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Throughout the campaign, as the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois rose steadily in the polls, the other leaders would accuse the sovereigntist party of trying to revive vieilles chicanes, old arguments.\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer used the line in the TVA debate. The NDP's Jagmeet Singh used a slight variation. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau has been using the line at least since 2013.\nBut whatever effect the claim once had, it's since worn off. The Bloc is poised to make substantial gains on Monday night. After eight years in the political wilderness, it could once again be a significant player on the federal scene.\nAccusing the Bloc of obsessing over old arguments was meant, of course, to make the party look like a leftover from a bygone era, when talk of referendums and sovereignty consumed the country's political oxygen.\nBut the problem is that under leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, the Bloc has reinvented itself.\nBlanchet has spent most of his time talking about Quebec nationalism, not sovereignty.\nIn Quebec, this brand of nationalism is often called d\u00e9complex\u00e9, that is, unselfconscious or, literally, without complexes; its champion is Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault and it's seen as something new, refreshingly so.\nRecycling the vieilles chicanes line makes it seem like it's the other federal leaders who are the ones stuck in the past.\nBooks will be written on why this unselfconscious nationalism has supplanted sovereignty, and why at this moment. In the meantime, though, here are a few sociological trends to consider.\nFor the first time in recent history, according to Scotiabank, Quebec's economy will lead the country in GDP growth this year.\nThere are construction cranes not just in Montreal, but across the province. Mid-sized cities \u2014 like Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Sherbrooke and\u00a0Drummondville \u2014 are growing and adapting to the opportunities of a high-tech economy.\nAlong their main streets, help-wanted signs can be spotted in just about every other storefront window.\nThis is a relatively new experience in a province where for years a sluggish economy was understood to be the byproduct of continuous referendum uncertainty.\nBut the long-term prospects of this growth face significant hurdles thanks to an aging population that is leaving the workforce in droves.\nEconomists, business lobbies and mayors are pleading for more workers, for immigrants. But these pleas confront more deeply embedded concerns: Will they speak French?

The NDP's Jagmeet Singh used a slight variation. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau has been using the line at least since 2013.\nBut whatever effect the claim once had, it's since worn off. The Bloc is poised to make substantial gains on Monday night. After eight years in the political wilderness, it could once again be a significant player on the federal scene.\nAccusing the Bloc of obsessing over old arguments was meant, of course, to make the party look like a leftover from a bygone era, when talk of referendums and sovereignty consumed the country's political oxygen.\nBut the problem is that under leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, the Bloc has reinvented itself.\nBlanchet has spent most of his time talking about Quebec nationalism, not sovereignty.\nIn Quebec, this brand of nationalism is often called d\u00e9complex\u00e9, that is, unselfconscious or, literally, without complexes; its champion is Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault and it's seen as something new, refreshingly so.\nRecycling the vieilles chicanes line makes it seem like it's the other federal leaders who are the ones stuck in the past.\nBooks will be written on why this unselfconscious nationalism has supplanted sovereignty, and why at this moment. In the meantime, though, here are a few sociological trends to consider.\nFor the first time in recent history, according to Scotiabank, Quebec's economy will lead the country in GDP growth this year.\nThere are construction cranes not just in Montreal, but across the province. Mid-sized cities \u2014 like Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Sherbrooke and\u00a0Drummondville \u2014 are growing and adapting to the opportunities of a high-tech economy.\nAlong their main streets, help-wanted signs can be spotted in just about every other storefront window.\nThis is a relatively new experience in a province where for years a sluggish economy was understood to be the byproduct of continuous referendum uncertainty.\nBut the long-term prospects of this growth face significant hurdles thanks to an aging population that is leaving the workforce in droves.\nEconomists, business lobbies and mayors are pleading for more workers, for immigrants. But these pleas confront more deeply embedded concerns: Will they speak French? Will they adopt our values?\nThe perception among many Quebecers \u2014 especially those older and living outside of Montreal \u2014 is that the Trudeau government was deaf to these concerns.\nMulticulturalism, a word closely associated with the Trudeau name, is understood as putting the needs of newcomers and minority groups before those of\u00a0the host society.\nTo get a taste of how that was received, here are a few samples from the opinion pages in Saturday's Journal de Montr\u00e9al, the most widely read newspaper in the province:\n\"[Trudeau] trucks in a radical multiculturalism.\"\nHe's among the \"defenders of the multicultural orthodoxy.\"\nCanada is a country divided by its \"state multiculturalism.\"\nQuebec, in a way, is re-modernizing itself, a process that comes with anxieties about the ability of a collective identity to survive the transformation.\nAs have similar anxieties elsewhere in the world, in Quebec they have been channeled into\u00a0nationalism.

Some suggestions drew applause and even a few moans from the roughly 170 people who filed into the museum's theatre.\nNajib Jutt, an Edmonton-based political strategist, suggested the country's electoral divisions be portioned off based on a province's economic output.\u00a0\n\"In the short term, what we have to do is change the way our power is structured,\" said Jutt.\n\"Instead of making seat allocation based on population, why don't we make it based on something like GDP, you know, something that is actually tied to our economy,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"I know, it's not democratic,\" he said after some people in the audience seemed to grumble and groan over the suggestion.\nJutt said it's time for some \"big ideas.\"\nHe also questioned why more Albertans\u00a0aren't talking about electoral reform.\nJustin Trudeau promised that the 2015 federal election would be Canada's last under the current first-past-the-post electoral system. He promised to study several different options of electoral reform, including ranked ballots, proportional representation, mandatory voting and online voting.\u00a0\nThe main objective of proportional representation is to make a party's share of seats in the House of Commons equal to their share of the popular vote.\nThe CBC Poll Tracker has suggested Albertans are poised to send as many as 32 or 33 Conservative MPs to Ottawa on Oct. 21, but Jutt said not everyone in the province votes conservative. In 2015, 604,000 Albertans voted for the NDP, which formed\u00a0government\u00a0for the first time in Alberta.\n\"At least we can say having an NDP government shows that Albertans do have an appetite for something different,\" said Jutt.\nThat's why he wants to see more Albertans start talking about electoral reform, including proprotional representation.\nPublic opinion researcher John Santos suggested something he dubbed \"emissions equalization,\"\u00a0a federal program that would recognize the challenge Alberta faces in reducing industrial CO2 emissions.\u00a0Instead of penalizing\u00a0the province, he said Ottawa would provide help.\n\"Incentivize instead of penalize,\" added Jutt.\u00a0\nWith the polls suggesting Canadians might elect a minority Liberal or Conservative government on Monday, the executive director of the Arc Energy Research Institute\u00a0said the day after the election will only add more uncertainly\u00a0\u2013 not only for Albertans, but many Canadians.\n\"The dominant issue is confederation, right? That's what we're going to be talking about on Oct. 22,\" said Peter Terzakian.\n\"The scenario that every Albertan fears is a Liberal minority with the NDP holding the balance of power,\" said Santos.\nHe said, as an example, such a coalition or arrangement\u00a0could bring in additional environmental regulations that could hurt the province's fragile economic recovery.\nSantos said if Canadians elect a Conservative minority government, he would question the benefits for Albertans because he would doubt the government would survive.\n\"In a perverse kind of way, a Liberal majority is actually the most stable thing for Alberta,\" said Santos.\nHe said that would provide more certainty around the future of the TMX pipeline expansion, which the Liberals purchased in 2018.\nJutt predicted a minority government, possibly a coalition between the Liberals and the NDP.\nWhat may be harder to predict is exactly what that would mean for Alberta.\n\"It's hard to say,\" he said.\nBryan Labby is an enterprise reporter with CBC Calgary.

It examines the fall of civilizations over time and the conditions that lead to collapse.\u00a0\nI remember him calmly explaining to me last fall that societies do not collapse because they face a single challenge. In fact, a modern society can probably face up to three challenges at a time. However, when that fourth challenge arrives, collapse is probably imminent. \u00a0\nFor example, it was not invasion alone that led to the fall of Rome. Overspending, corruption and political instability, enabled by weak government over a number of centuries, were all contributing factors.\nAs such, pandemics alone do not collapse societies. However,\u00a0they can be the fourth condition that arrives to collapse a society that already faces significant vulnerabilities.\u00a0\nPremier Dwight Ball recently wrote Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to ask for help because the provincial government was struggling to pay its bills. Furthermore, most of the industries we depend on were crashing.\u00a0\nApparently, things have improved since the Bank of Canada started buying provincial bonds. However, this fiscal crisis is far from over. There's a long dark road ahead. \u00a0\nOur leaders will tell you that it was the combination of January's\u00a0Snowmageddon and the pandemic that collapsed our provincial economy. They have long sold the narrative that they had no financial options after Muskrat Falls was approved by the previous government.\u00a0\nThe truth is that the current government had options when they took power in 2015. In reality, they have failed to act on those options again and again, despite repeated calls from citizens to do so.\u00a0\nFor some time now, representatives of civil society, including many scholars, have been ringing the bell on extensive borrowing, inequality, overdependence on oil, failure to address climate change and overly partisan politics.\u00a0\nIn 2013, economist Thomas Piketty published Capital in the Twenty-First Century. The book effectively documented that in the contemporary world the return on capital is greater than the rate of economic growth, which has resulted in concentrations of wealth, inequality and economic instability.\u00a0\nThe book articulated what many had been feeling about the economy and reached No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list. It also became the most purchased book ever published by Harvard University Press. Clearly, the public is aware of the problems of inequality in the contemporary capitalist world.\u00a0\nIn 2016, the provincial government introduced a budget that relied heavily on consumption taxes. Ultimately, most of those changes had to be undone.\u00a0\nConsumption taxes are the most regressive of taxes. The lower your income, the greater the portion of it that gets spent on consumption taxes. Citizens on low incomes rebelled against bearing the brunt of mistakes that were made by political elites. \u00a0\nThe opposite is true of income tax,\u00a0which affects those at the highest income levels the most.\u00a0\nNewfoundland and Labrador has the lowest income tax levels in Atlantic Canada, even though our incomes are higher on average. Provincial income tax rates were reduced by the Williams government when oil revenue was at a high.\u00a0\nPolitical economist Russell Williams has estimated that Newfoundland and Labrador has left up to $500 million a year in income tax revenue on the table\u00a0by not bringing our tax levels in line with the other Atlantic provinces.\u00a0\nSimilarly, Williams has noted that unincorporated areas of Newfoundland and Labrador are not taxed, even though they are in other provinces. As such, the provincial government, rather than municipalities, pays for services in these areas. He maintains that this leaves approximately $400 million in annual revenue on the table.\u00a0\nThe Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation does not bring in as much revenue as similar Crown corporations in other provinces, even though its costs are higher for vendors. The NLC has also been plagued by scandals, which has limited its effectiveness. \u00a0\nThe need for health-care reform in this province is well documented. When the leader of the Official Opposition called for it in the last provincial election, the governing party unleashed attack ads stating that Progressive Conservatives were going to cut health care.\u00a0\nOur province has the highest per-capita expenditures in health care and the lowest health outcomes. Nowhere is health-care reform needed more than in Newfoundland and Labrador. Yet\u00a0we cannot even have a conversation about it without becoming mired in partisanship.\u00a0\nThis province has had options for the last five years. There were revenue sources available to us so that we did not have to continue to grow our debt and continue paying larger amounts of interest.\u00a0\nThe provincial government also pursued dependence on oil, despite warnings that the price of oil was not stable and that it was not a good source of revenue to depend on over the long term.\u00a0\nIn the midst of all this financial vulnerability, our government maintained over-reliance on borrowing and natural resources;\u00a0inequality, driven by low wages and precarious employment; and\u00a0climate change policies that are not doing enough to decarbonize.\u00a0\nAlong comes a global pandemic and boom! You have got your fourth condition that makes collapse imminent.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, after this pandemic is over, there will be much more pain ahead. We have not even seen the impact of this in many nations, which are under-testing.\u00a0\nMost people have not yet fully grasped the reality of the economic crisis that awaits us both globally and locally. People are too busy trying to survive to worry about government debt. While the International Monetary Fund has put global GDP at $90 trillion, a Reuters report this winter estimated that public and private debt globally is almost $260 trillion.\u00a0\nSoon it will become clear, however, that while taxpayers are benefiting from government programs, we are also the people who will have to pay for them.\u00a0\nLow-income workers are now being sacrificed on the altar of being essential, even though they are not essential enough to be provided with a living wage, benefits, and safe working conditions.\u00a0\nHealth-care workers are being treated as collateral damage, and they do not have the appropriate protective equipment. Leaders in many nations failed to act in a timely manner on containing the virus and obtaining the necessary medical equipment.\u00a0\nAll of this will spark a major conversation about incomes and working conditions. There is already a lot of discussion of the need for universal basic income.\u00a0It will become even more obvious that generations with little to no retirement savings\u00a0now have even less. Or nothing left at all when the markets are finished crashing.\u00a0\nFinally, within the next 10 years it will become abundantly clear oil is no one's salvation. Most analysts believe the price of oil is never coming back to previous levels.\u00a0\nIdeas are becoming more powerful than institutions as it becomes even more obvious that a new generation of political institutions must be designed that will better meet the needs of citizens.\u00a0\nAs a historian of print, I have recently found myself reflecting on the work of Mary Shelley, who published dire warnings about the modern world as it was being built in the 19th century. \u00a0\nHer novel\u00a0The Last Man (1826) is a post-apocalyptic tale of a world that is ravaged by plague. In it she asks:\u00a0\nHear you not the rushing sound of the coming tempest? \u2026Feel you not the earth quake and open with agonizing groans, while the air is pregnant with shrieks and wailings \u2013 all announcing the last days of man? No! None of these accompanied our fall.\nIn the final analysis, it is not a pandemic that is bringing an end to the world as we know it.\u00a0\nWhen the histories of this age are written, it will be concluded by many that it was our political structures that failed us.\u00a0\nJust like ancient Rome, we are burdened by overspending, corruption, political instability\u00a0and weak government.\nWe will be dealing with the inadequacies of our systems of government for long time after the threat of contagion has passed.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Peter Armstrong", "title": "'Master of narrative' Trump tells voters his story about the U.S. economy", "description": "The economy is strong, but not everyone has experienced gains under the Trump administration's policies", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-economy-state-of-the-union-jobs-tariffs-voters-1.5451790", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5113041.1580866367!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trump.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 05, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-02-05T19:00:14.693Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump is heralding what he calls a \"blue-collar boom.\"\nWith his impeachment trial in the Senate nearly behind him, Trump took the opportunity during last night's state of the union address to describe what he calls \"the great American comeback.\"\nHe touted how he moved quickly when he took office to revive the U.S. economy by \"slashing a number of job killing-regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements.\"\n\"America's fortunes are on the rise.

However, it's important to say, the economy\u00a0is\u00a0doing well. It's just that the benefits of that growth are not being felt everywhere.\nYes, the stock market is soaring. But the vast majority of stocks are held by the wealthiest Americans.\nYes, jobs are being added, but the growth rate has begun to slow.\nYes, GDP is still growing at a respectable pace, but it's down from the high points under Barack Obama and earlier under Trump.\nIn 2016, Trump's campaign tapped into deep economic anxiety in regions that felt left behind during the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Part of that was the American economy transitioning from traditional manufacturing to a more services-based economy \u2014 a painful shift that had begun many years earlier.\nWATCH | Trump says 'the best is yet to come' for the country:\nA global manufacturing downturn has meant many people who live in those regions are worse off today than they were when Trump took office. While many sectors have added jobs these past few years, manufacturing has actually been laying people off.\u00a0Factory activity contracted for five consecutive months to close out 2019. January of this year finally showed some positive numbers on that front.\n\"A number of [Trump's]\u00a0real swing states that came into supporting him have actually taken more damage than other parts of the American economy,\" said\u00a0Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist with Cambridge Global Payments, a Toronto-based provider of cross-border payment\u00a0services and currency management solutions.\u00a0\nCoal-mining regions in states like Kentucky were promised Trump would revive their industry. But the coal comeback never emerged.\nMeanwhile, farmers who supported Trump in the Midwest have been targeted by punitive tariffs in Trump's trade war with China.\nBut none of that may matter.\n\"Although Trump may not be master of the facts, he is a master of the narrative,\" said\u00a0Schamotta. \"He's very good at telling a story about the American economy that a large chunk of the population chooses to believe.\"\nLooming over the whole economic debate is the vast increase in government spending that has occurred since Trump took office. The federal budget deficit surpassed $1 trillion last year.\u00a0Trump promised he would start paying down the national debt, but his tax cuts and sweeping spending plans have\u00a0seen the deficit soar to record highs.\nSchamotta says spending that much while the economy is doing well runs counter to\u00a0generations of Republican thinking \u2014 and he questions how well it's working. In\u00a02018, the U.S. economy grew by 2.9 per cent. In 2019, Trump's enormous spending and tax cuts kicked in and yet the economy grew by just\u00a02.3 per cent.\n\"So, it's actually decelerating despite all this money pouring in,\" he said.\nEven those who feel Trump's economic record should stand on its own are worried about the impact of all that new spending.\n\"If there is a concern, it's that we've run up the deficit during good times,\" said\u00a0Avery Shenfeld, chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets. \"Should a recession hit, there's a fear that Congress might hesitate about amplifying that deficit, which would be a necessary step to fight the next recession.\"\nNonetheless, Shenfeld said, Trump's economic record is a good one. Based on the three years of data, the president has a reasonable claim that the average American family is better off, he said.\n\"If it wasn't for all the whiff of scandal and controversy around this president, he'd be sailing into re-election \u2014\u00a0if it was just a battle over\u00a0the economic numbers.\"\nTo a degree, every election is about the economy. People look around and ask whether they're better off now than they were four years earlier.\nThe answer under Trump depends on where you live and\u00a0where you fall on the income range. It's easy to point to job numbers\u00a0or the stock markets and say everyone's better off. It's also easy to point out the regions that are being left behind by a changing economy and blame the president.\u00a0The truth almost always falls somewhere in between.\nNuance makes for lousy talking points. But during an election year, nuance should be more important than ever.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Deficits can mean pain ahead, or they can be an investment in the future: Don Pittis", "description": "When does government spending become reckless?

Ironically the economic boom during the Reagan era was funded by public borrowing, as tax cuts transferred public wealth to the private sector. During his two terms as president, the U.S. public debt\u00a0tripled.\nHistorically, Canada's Conservative-led governments have seen a place for public spending. The Roads to Resources plan by the government of John Diefenbaker in the 1950s\u00a0was promoted as a way to open up the isolated communities of the Canadian North to new\u00a0development.\nMostly remembered as a success, the idea was that the federal government\u00a0would spend\u00a0hundreds of millions of dollars in road construction that no individual company wanting to exploit resources in the region could afford.\nThe idea of government spending to open up new territory is hardly new. It was the British government that funded voyages of discovery such as the Franklin expedition, though that didn't quite pay off. The Spanish government of Queen Isabella sponsored exploration by Christopher Columbus.\nAnd that idea of government investment has expanded from new geography to new frontiers in technology. As economist Mariana\u00a0Mazzucato, author of\u00a0The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths, has pointed out, it was massive government investment in unproven technology that created the even more massive private sector wealth of companies like Google and Amazon.\nLiberals may scoff at Poilievre's comparison of government spending to running up the credit card. After all, when governments spend money on something like\u00a0northern roads or other infrastructure projects, the money flows straight back into the economy as wages and business profits that are taxed once again. But\u00a0the comparison of personal debt and public debt is not baseless.\nRunning up a credit card bill for consumer goods\u00a0is\u00a0different from borrowing to invest in\u00a0a home. In the same way boosting the deficit to offer juicy election handouts to voters is completely different from deficit spending for long-term investments in the economy. Promises from both frontrunners in this election fall on both sides of that equation.\nLast month a group of economists, including French scholar Thomas Piketty, wrote a letter to the Financial Times declaring the advantages of European government investment in the economy, especially when interest rates are so low.\n\"Today the government can borrow at negative real interest rates: Many pressing infrastructure, education and environment projects offer returns well above zero and can therefore generate higher future tax receipts, supporting, not detracting, from fiscal sustainability,\" said the letter writers that also included Mazzucato.\nMazzucato is one of those who have thrown her support behind that ultimate\u00a0licence for governments\u00a0to spend. In\u00a0Modern Monetary Theory, the idea is that while inflation and interest rates remain low,\u00a0governments should keep spending until every person is employed and inflation starts to rise. That theory is widely disputed.\nOf course the public acceptance of government spending depends on the\u00a0political times. When Ontario Premier Doug Ford warned of the province drowning in debt, he was playing on memories of older voters of when the federal debt-to-GDP ratio some claimed\u00a0was as high as\u00a072 per cent,\u00a0though sources differ on that figure.\nWith considerable pain to the country, Liberal Finance Minister Paul Martin got the debt down, and since then governments have managed to hold deficit increases\u00a0below the growth of the economy, something the Liberals are promising to continue. Of course a sudden plunge in economic growth could abruptly change the picture.\nBut in the wake of the Ford government's cuts in Ontario that many critics claim unnecessarily slashed investment in education, damaging the province's future prospects,\u00a0the voters' attitude to deficit spending may be blowing the other way.\nAt least that's what Trudeau is betting for now.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The candidates for Regina\u2012Lewvan and where they stand on the issues", "description": "Candidates gathered for panel discussion Friday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-lewvan-candidates-1.5301190", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301200.1569630322!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/regina-lewvan-candidates.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 27, 2019 6:40 PM CT", "2019-09-28T00:40:14.884Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It's anyone's game for candidates in the Regina\u2012Lewvan riding.\u00a0\nThe federal riding's current MP, Erin Weir \u2014 ousted from the\u00a0NDP caucus last year \u2014 isn't running again.\nFour of the five people who are running in the Oct. 21 election\u00a0gathered for a panel discussion Friday, hosted by the CBC's Stefani Langenegger at the University of Regina Centre for Continuing Education.\nConservative Party candidate Warren Steinley, Liberal candidate Winter Fedyk, NDP candidate Jigar Patel and People's Party of Canada candidate Trevor Wowk were there to speak and answer questions from Langenegger and the audience.\u00a0\nThe Green Party candidate from the riding, Naomi Hunter, wasn't there, but Tamela Friesen \u2014 the party's candidate for Regina\u2012Wascana \u2014\u00a0participated.\nAll five spoke on issues including climate change, health care, Indigenous issues and reconciliation, and immigration.\nFriesen said the Green Party has the most aggressive action plan on climate change, with an aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 60 per cent by 2030. She said her party would cancel all imports of oil, sticking to Canadian fossil fuels until they are phased\u00a0out.\u00a0\nShe also said the party would invest in helping people who work in the oil and gas industry transfer their skills to positions that support a green economy.\u00a0\nThe People's Party's Wowk said he is skeptical of the climate crisis, but supports climate change protests because he and his party are in favour of free speech. He said the climate is changing gradually, but thinks society will adapt and work together to find solutions. His party will would scrap the carbon tax, he said.\nPatel called\u00a0climate change a serious issue that needs to be addressed. He said the NDP action plan on climate change would aim to create 300,000 jobs in green energy, with the goal of moving toward zero emissions.\u00a0\nSteinley said the Conservatives would get rid of the carbon tax which he called\u00a0a \"Liberal tax grab.\" He said the party\u00a0would instead push for the creation of green technology\u00a0that could be shared with the rest of the world.\nFedyk said the Liberals\u00a0would balance aggressive climate action with economic realities, especially in the west. She said the Liberal plan would move\u00a0to net zero emissions by 2050 by bringing in an independent review panel to advise on skills training, investments and education.\u00a0\nWowk said the People's Party\u00a0would let provincial governments take the lead on health care, but would work to reduce wait times.\u00a0\nPatel said it is unacceptable that\u00a0health care in Canada is often cost prohibitive, and the NDP would launch universal pharmacare for prescriptions drugs.\nSteinley said the Conservatives would provide $1.5 billion to the provinces to increase the number of MRIs and CT scans. He said the party would also increase health transfers by three per cent, or more if the GDP goes up.\u00a0\nFedyk said the Liberals would offer universal pharmacare and would invest in both mental health and addictions.\u00a0\nFriesen said the Green Party would also roll out pharmacare. She said the party would treat the opioid crisis as a public health issue, not a criminal one. She also said the party would work to eliminate poverty and improve nutrient density in food to reduce health care costs long-term.\u00a0\nSteinley said the Conservative Party would work on economic reconciliation. He said a Conservative government would partner with First Nations communities on- and off-reserve to find out what issues impact them the most.\u00a0\nFedyk said a Liberal government would work to cut down on the number of First Nations children in\u00a0care of social services. She pointed to the Industrial School land transfer near Regina as an example of work that her party is committed to doing.\u00a0\nFriesen said the Green Party would implement all the recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the missing and murdered Indigenous women inquiry's report, as well as recommendations from the United Nations. She said the Greens would honour self-governance on First Nations communities, but would also make sure Indigenous people had adequate drinking water and K-12 education on reserves.\u00a0\nWowk said the People's Party would help families of MMIW and those who are entitled to residential school settlements.\u00a0\nPatel said the NDP would make sure Indigenous communities have safe housing, access to clean drinking water, education and health care for all residents.\nFedyk said the Liberal Party has committed to maintaining \"healthy levels of immigration,\" with a goal of\u00a0bringing in 350,000 immigrants by 2020. She said the focus will be on economic immigration to help fill gaps in the labour market.\u00a0\nFriesen said the Green Party supports immigration. She said intolerance needs to be addressed on social media, where people spread lies about the immigration process.\nWowk said the People's Party would cut down on immigration, with a focus on maintaining \"Canadian values\" and assimilating immigrants.\u00a0\nPatel, who is an immigrant himself, said immigration helps the economy. He said the NDP would shorten times for families waiting to reunite.\u00a0\nSteinley said the Conservative Party would improve language training for new immigrants and credential recognition for those with schooling, and end illegal border crossings from the U.S.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Where are Thomas Cook travellers stranded?

But it went bankrupt over the weekend, and since it currently has 600,000 people abroad, that has forced\u00a0governments and insurance companies to co-ordinate a huge operation to bring them all home.\nHere is a summary of official responses to the Thomas Cook collapse:\nThe U.K.'s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and government has lined\u00a0up flights in order to begin bringing an estimated 150,000 Britain-based customers back home from vacation spots around the globe in what was called the biggest peacetime repatriation effort in the country's history.\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was traveling to New York for a meeting at the United Nations, said the government was right not to bail out the company, arguing that doing so could have led other businesses to expect the same treatment.\u00a0\nFrench organization Entreprises de Voyage said that about 10,000 French tourists could be affected by the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.\nNorwegian subsidiary Ving said that currently 8,685 Norwegians are on its tours.\nThe Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund, an insurance scheme that is compulsory for tour operators, issued a statement saying it will ensure any passengers traveling with Thomas Cook's Norwegian unit will be repatriated.\nDanish subsidiary Spies said that none of its planes will be leaving, and about 1,400 travelers are affected. A press contact in Thomas Cook said that affected travelers will get their trips refunded.\nThomas Cook unit\u00a0Tj\u00e4reborg said it has 2,884 passengers traveling. \"We are currently doing all we can to arrange return flights for passengers and will provide more information during the day,\" the company said on its website.\nThe Swedish unit Ving said the number of Swedish passengers currently away came to 16,956. \"We are now working intensely to ensure that all affected travelers are flown home with as little disruption as possible,\" the company said on its website.\nThe Russian tour operator subsidiary Intourist expects the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook will have no impact on clients, Russian executive director Sergei Tolchin told Interfax.\nThomas Cook holiday airline Condor says it will continue its flight operation despite its parent company's insolvency.\n\"Condor \u2026 is continuing operations,\" the German airline said in a statement.\nThomas Cook says there are roughly 140,000 vacationers\u00a0currently traveling with its German units.\nAs of Monday morning, the Netherlands and Belgium units of Thomas Cook were still operating.\nThe Polish unit Neckermann said its financial condition is stable and it continues to operate normally, with holidayers unaffected.\nA Greek tourism ministry official told Reuters that about 50,000 tourists are stranded.\n\"The top priority now is to get them back home,\" the official said, declining to be named.\nCyprus's\u00a0deputy minister for tourism said arrangements are underway to ferry back home the 15,000 Thomas Cook travellers \u2014 half being U.K. citizens, 40 per cent hailing from Scandinavian countries and the rest being from Germany \u2014 on the eastern Mediterranean island nation.\n\"We will work intensively \u2026. I believe that a large portion of the arrivals we stand to lose will somehow be regulated by the market and other travel agencies,\" said Savvas Perdios, deputy minister of tourism to Reuters.\nThe company's clients represent about six per cent of Cyprus's annual tourist arrivals, or around 250,000 people.\nSpanish Airport operator Aena says 46 flights operated by Thomas Cook have been cancelled in Spanish airports. Between 25,000 and 30,000 tourists are affected in the Canary Islands, according to local media.\nThe Turkish Ministry of Tourism said\u00a0more than 21,000 stranded travellers are now in Turkish hotels.\nThe ministry tweeted Monday that guest payments were guaranteed by the U.K.'s Air Travel Organiser's Licence. The statement warned there would be legal proceedings against hotels demanding payment from guests or forcing them to leave.\nThe Hotelier Federation head said about 45,000 tourists from the UK and Europe are in the country.\nThomas Cook operator Blue Sky Group said that 25,000 reservations in Egypt booked up to April 2020 had been cancelled. Blue Sky currently has 1,600 tourists in Egypt's Hugharda resort\nTunisian tourism minister Rene Trabelsi told Reuters that 4,500 Thomas Cook customers are still on holiday in Tunisia. Meanwhile,\u00a0Tunisia's government offered assurances that Thomas Cook clients won't be prevented from leaving the country, following British media reports that the Les Orangers beach resort in Hammamet, near Tunis, initially refused to let Thomas Cook clients leave.\nA\u00a0British vacationer told BBC radio on Sunday that security guards shut the hotel's gates, for fear it wouldn't be paid what it is owed by Thomas Cook. \u00a0\nBut Tunisia's Tourism Ministry, cited by Tunisia's TAP news agency, denied Sunday that British tourists were sequestered at a Hammamet hotel.

Advocates are calling for urgent government action to stem the bleeding.\n\"Something needs to change immediately or these small communities that don't have other employers are going to wither and die,\" said Marty Gibbons, president of United Steelworkers Local 1-417, based in Kamloops, B.C.\nThe local represents hundreds of forestry workers who have lost jobs in Interior communities including Merritt, Clearwater, Vavenby and Clinton.\nThe largest driving factor is the province's complex stumpage system that results in high fees, he said.\n\"These are private businesses. If they can't turn a profit, there's no reason for them to run. Right now, it's not the markets that are the issue. It's the cost of the logs,\" he said.\nStumpage is a fee businesses pay when they harvest timber from Crown land. The B.C. government calculates stumpage annually, so the system is less responsive than in Alberta, where monthly adjustments are made, Gibbons said.\nThe Forests Ministry said stumpage fees are based on market demand and the current rates reflect the scarcity of timber supply that has resulted from the mountain pine beetle outbreak and has been exacerbated by several severe fire seasons.\nIntervention in the stumpage system would weaken the legal case in the appeals of the duties imposed by the United States on softwood lumber from Canada, the ministry said in a statement.\n\"It is well-known that any interference in B.C.'s market-based timber pricing system would lead to an increase in softwood lumber duties levied by the U.S.,\" it said.\nMost of B.C.'s forest land is publicly owned, so companies have long-term tenure rights and the government charges them stumpage to harvest trees. In contrast, most land in the U.S. is private and companies face costs associated with replanting.\n\"That's what the stumpage fee is all about,\" explained Ken Peacock, chief economist of the Business Council of B.C. \"It tries to equate, if it was privately owned, what the cost would be to operate and manage and reforest the land.\"\nPeacock said the high cost of logs is the major cause of the industry's decline in B.C. He also blamed the mountain pine beetle and record-breaking 2017 and 2018 fire seasons for decimating supply.\nThe policies of Premier John Horgan's government are also breeding uncertainty, Peacock argued.\nThe government is developing a caribou habitat protection plan that the industry expects will further restrict access to northern timber, he said, and it's promised to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples without explaining how companies are meant to fulfil its requirement of \"free, prior and informed consent\" from First Nations.\nThe NDP government has also introduced Bill 22, which would control tenure transfers. Currently, a company that is scaling back or shutting down a mill can transfer its tenure to one that is operating, but the government wants oversight over these transfers to protect the \"public interest,\" a term not defined in the legislation, Peacock said.\n\"The picture here in B.C. is we are a very high cost jurisdiction. It's actually less costly to operate in Alberta and companies can make a profit milling lumber and producing two-by-fours in Alberta.\"\nOn top of all that, market conditions in North America are softening, he noted.\nForestry is the No. 1 engine that drives B.C.'s economy with nearly $15 billion in annual exports, representing one-third of the province's international merchandise exports and the largest segment by far, said Peacock.\nWhile other sectors may employ more people or produce more gross domestic product (GDP), Peacock believes forestry is the top driver of B.C.'s economy because it is the province's leading export industry. He argues export industries are key to the economy because they access external markets and spread B.C. goods far and wide.\nThe Business Council of B.C. just trimmed its 2019 economic forecast in part because of the forestry downturn, from 2.2 to 2 per cent growth, he said. The B.C. government also just cut its forecast to 1.7 per cent, citing mill closures in part.\nThe Forests Ministry said the challenges the province is facing have been in the making for many years and the previous Liberal government ignored them and failed to help the sector and communities adapt.\n\"We have laid out a process ... to bring together industry, First Nations, labour and communities to address the challenges and build a sustainable sector to protect jobs.\"\nOpposition Liberal forestry critic John Rustad has blamed the current government's policies for \"killing the industry\" and resulting in more layoffs and closures.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Wallis Snowdon", "title": "'It's been tough': Edmonton's job market limps into new year", "description": "'I'm beginning to see now that the statistics ring true so it's been tough'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-unemployment-1.5436283", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5436301.1579716641!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/brian-wolfe.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 26, 2020 6:00 AM MT", "2020-01-26T13:00:00.155Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Brian Wolfe was so desperate for a job he took to the streets with a sign reading, \"Ready to work.\"\nFor six hours on Jan. 13, the out-of-work welder stood on the corner of a busy Edmonton intersection at -30 C, pleading for someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 to give him a job.\nWolfe, 49, had been without steady work for nine months.\n\"I applied to hundreds of places and there was no response,\" said Wolfe, who had supported his family with a welding torch for 15 years.\u00a0\n\"My welding tickets ran out, and the way things fell there wasn't any money to renew the tickets.

But that seems to be changing.\nGrowth in Edmonton's real gross domestic product (GDP) hovered around 0.5 per cent in 2019, the lowest it's been since 2015, soon after oil prices started to plunge.\nFull-time employment has been declining year over year since last September, weakening growth in average weekly wages.\nThe figures show Edmonton is lagging behind other parts of Alberta, and elsewhere in Canada.\nAlberta lost roughly 1,000 positions in December as the provincial unemployment rate ticked down from 7.2 to 7 per cent.\u00a0\nIn contrast, the Canadian job market bounced back in December to post a gain of 35,200 jobs and reverse some losses posted in the previous month, which saw the biggest monthly loss since the 2008 financial crisis.\u00a0\n\"We seem to be bucking the provincial trend and the national trend,\" said Raja Bajwa, president of the Economics Society of Northern Alberta and a professor of macroeconomics at NorQuest College.\n\"Hopefully it doesn't continue into 2020 and we see some bounce-back, but it might be going on for a little while.\"\nEdmonton's labour market has been showing signs of stress for some time, Bajwa said.\nGrowth has been stagnant, oil prices remain volatile, but more than anything Edmonton has been hit by the provincial budget, Bajwa said.\u00a0\n\"It was a pretty quick hit in terms of the impact,\" Bajwa said. \"There is going to be an adjustment. Hopefully we recover quickly.\"\nThe city's workforce is dominated by government, public sector and non-profit employers who have been spooked by spending cuts introduced by Premier Jason Kenney's government, Bajwa said.\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of it has to do with the provincial budget that came out in October,\" he said. \"It was a pretty quick hit in terms of the impact, whether municipal governments or some of the non-profits that rely on provincial funding. And as a result, a lot of the places that were looking to hire full time or had full-time positions coming to end, those didn't get extended.

The rate in Edmonton now hovers around 17 per cent, up from 9.2 per cent in December of 2018.\n\"We're seeing an increase in employment for young females but it declined for young males, a significant decline, which ends up giving us a pretty flat employment level for young people,\" Leveille said.\u00a0\n\"You have more young people that are looking for work, and there are not more jobs for them.\"\nIt's not all bad news, according to the latest quarterly report from the city.\u00a0\nWhile labour force growth outpaced the region's employment gains, Edmonton gained 3,100 positions in December, with most of the growth coming from the trades, finance, insurance, real estate and food services.\nFor 2019 as a whole, employment growth in Edmonton increased by 1.1 per cent from the year before, and\u00a0average weekly wages for 2019 were almost two per cent higher.\u00a0\nThe city expects employment in Edmonton to grow by a modest\u00a0one per cent in 2020.\u00a0\n\"The unemployment rate is forecast to decline, though the rate is unlikely to move much lower than the seven to 7.5 per cent range,\" according to the latest quarterly outlook from the city.\nAfter being out of work for two years, house painter Aaron Deneiko, 39, is feeling more positive about this prospects.\nDeneiko sought some professional advice and now plans to return to warehouse work.\u00a0\nHe was a house painter for 15 years before the work dried up.\u00a0\n\"The economy dropped,\" he said. \"Lots of places were downsizing staff.\n\"Four months ago I was feeling pretty down about finding a job.

He had been made permanent in April.\n\"At my age, I still have lots left in the tank,\" he said. \"But I want something with stability, and I thought I had that. So I'm very apprehensive about applying for temporary positions.\n\"That's probably been the toughest thing, is seeing how little is out there.\"\nLess reliant on the energy sector than other Alberta cities, the provincial capital has been surprisingly resilient during the ongoing downturn. But that seems to be changing.\nGrowth in Edmonton's real gross domestic product (GDP) hovered around 0.5 per cent in 2019, the lowest it's been since 2015, soon after oil prices started to plunge.\nFull-time employment has been declining year over year since last September, weakening growth in average weekly wages.\nThe figures show Edmonton is lagging behind other parts of Alberta, and elsewhere in Canada.\nAlberta lost roughly 1,000 positions in December as the provincial unemployment rate ticked down from 7.2 to 7 per cent.\u00a0\nIn contrast, the Canadian job market bounced back in December to post a gain of 35,200 jobs and reverse some losses posted in the previous month, which saw the biggest monthly loss since the 2008 financial crisis.\u00a0\n\"We seem to be bucking the provincial trend and the national trend,\" said Raja Bajwa, president of the Economics Society of Northern Alberta and a professor of macroeconomics at NorQuest College.\n\"Hopefully it doesn't continue into 2020 and we see some bounce-back, but it might be going on for a little while.\"\nEdmonton's labour market has been showing signs of stress for some time, Bajwa said.\nGrowth has been stagnant, oil prices remain volatile, but more than anything Edmonton has been hit by the provincial budget, Bajwa said.\u00a0\n\"It was a pretty quick hit in terms of the impact,\" Bajwa said. \"There is going to be an adjustment. Hopefully we recover quickly.\"\nThe city's workforce is dominated by government, public sector and non-profit employers who have been spooked by spending cuts introduced by Premier Jason Kenney's government, Bajwa said.\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of it has to do with the provincial budget that came out in October,\" he said. \"It was a pretty quick hit in terms of the impact, whether municipal governments or some of the non-profits that rely on provincial funding. And as a result, a lot of the places that were looking to hire full time or had full-time positions coming to end, those didn't get extended. We've also seen a lot of major projects come to an end in town, so a lot of those construction jobs have moved on as well.\"\nPost-budget, Edmonton has slipped behind Calgary, which ended 2019 with an unemployment rate of 7.1 per cent, Bajwa\u00a0said.\n\"Back in 2017, Calgary was three per cent higher than us with their unemployment and now it's sort of flipped,\" Bajwa said.\u00a0\n\"We were insulated at that time and now it's our turn to get hit.\"\u00a0\nCharlene Stowe said the level of competition in Edmonton's job market has become \"insane.\"\u00a0\nStowe worked in auto body shops for 10 years but was laid off and\u00a0can't find a job.\u00a0\nShe most recently applied to work as a labourer in Edmonton. She said the position had more than 3,800 online applicants.\u00a0\n\"It's hard,\" she said. \"I've never been unemployed this long. Going on five months, it's starting to get pretty darn scary.\u00a0\n\"My savings are dwindling down to nothing. EI certainly doesn't give you a whole lot, and when you apply for jobs you're competing against not just hundreds but thousands.\"\u00a0\nYoung people, especially young men, have been among the hardest hit by the employment slump, said Bertrand Leveille, an economist with Stats Canada.\nThe unemployment rate for Albertans aged 15 to 24 for the year increased 3.9 percentage points, to 15 per cent. The rate in Edmonton now hovers around 17 per cent, up from 9.2 per cent in December of 2018.\n\"We're seeing an increase in employment for young females but it declined for young males, a significant decline, which ends up giving us a pretty flat employment level for young people,\" Leveille said.\u00a0\n\"You have more young people that are looking for work, and there are not more jobs for them.\"\nIt's not all bad news, according to the latest quarterly report from the city.\u00a0\nWhile labour force growth outpaced the region's employment gains, Edmonton gained 3,100 positions in December, with most of the growth coming from the trades, finance, insurance, real estate and food services.\nFor 2019 as a whole, employment growth in Edmonton increased by 1.1 per cent from the year before, and\u00a0average weekly wages for 2019 were almost two per cent higher.\u00a0\nThe city expects employment in Edmonton to grow by a modest\u00a0one per cent in 2020.\u00a0\n\"The unemployment rate is forecast to decline, though the rate is unlikely to move much lower than the seven to 7.5 per cent range,\" according to the latest quarterly outlook from the city.\nAfter being out of work for two years, house painter Aaron Deneiko, 39, is feeling more positive about this prospects.\nDeneiko sought some professional advice and now plans to return to warehouse work.\u00a0\nHe was a house painter for 15 years before the work dried up.\u00a0\n\"The economy dropped,\" he said. \"Lots of places were downsizing staff.\n\"Four months ago I was feeling pretty down about finding a job. I'm actually pretty positive right now, and feel like I will be able to accomplish this goal soon.\"\nWith files from Nola Keeler and Travis McEwan\n"}, {"author": "Kyle Bakx", "title": "'We're a bit stuck': CEO of Alberta bank expects province's economic struggles to continue", "description": "Woes continue for energy and construction sectors, while manufacturing and logistics industries grow", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/atb-financial-curtis-stange-1.5271726", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5271816.1567703456!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/curtis-stange.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 06, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-06T08:00:00.021Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Alberta's sputtering economy has slowed in the last year and any growth over the next 18 months will be minimal, predicts the chief executive of ATB Financial, an Alberta bank owned by the provincial government.\nWhile the economy is \"stuck,\" Curtis Stange\u00a0said he doesn't\u00a0think the province will fall back into recession, something the Conference Board of Canada has forecast\u00a0in successive reports about Alberta's economic outlook.\nStange said the province's economy was growing at upward\u00a0of two per cent in 2018, but the growth has slowed to less than one per cent this year.\u00a0Any momentum the economy was showing, he said, has been lost.\n\"We're a bit stuck,\" Stange said\u00a0in an interview at an ATB branch in downtown Calgary.\u00a0\"It's stuck because of stubbornly high unemployment rates. It's stuck because we've seen now three continuous years of flat capital expenditures in the province.

While the court's announcement won't halt construction,\u00a0it is another\u00a0legal hurdle for the long-delayed project that would transport oil from Alberta to B.C.'s coast.\nThe provincial economy has struggled since the price of oil collapsed in 2014, which has contributed to high unemployment, stagnant\u00a0wages, and a downtown office vacancy rate in Calgary of more than 20 per cent.\nAbout 2,425 oil and gas wells are expected to be drilled this year in Alberta, down from an initial projection of 3,532 from the\u00a0Petroleum Services Association of Canada.\nThe woes are expected to continue.\n\"We think 2020 will also be a challenging year,\" said Stange. \"We're looking out about 18 months right now and say it's going to be stuck under one per cent GDP growth.\"\u00a0\nWATCH: ATB Financial CEO Curtis Stange assess the state of Alberta's economy.\nThe economic challenges of small businesses aren't confined to certain geographic areas of the province, said Stange, but rather\u00a0specific industries.\nThe oilfield services and oil producing sectors are struggling, in addition to the construction industry, rural hotels and retail. Meanwhile, manufacturing, logistics, life sciences and some agricultural sectors are \"doing quite well.\"\nATB\u00a0Financial itself hasn't been immune from the province's struggles. Its recent financial results have been mixed, according to analyst Adam Hardi with credit rating agency Moody's. Overall, Hardi said he's cautiously optimistic about the bank's performance, although its loan loss provisions to the energy sector are \"sizeable.\"\nThe provisions relate to money set aside for uncollected loans.\n\"We expected quicker improvement from ATB Financial over the last few years. That hasn't happened yet,\" he said.\u00a0\nOver the past five years, ATB Financial has continued to see a growing gap between its amount of total loans and deposits. The bank reported $36.1 billion in\u00a0deposits compared to\u00a0$46.5 billion in loans,\u00a0according to its most recent financial update.\nStange, who became CEO just over a year ago, isn't concerned about the gap.

Howe Institute found that all three countries will be worse off if the treaty is approved by their legislatures and comes into force: the U.S. economy will be 0.1 per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been, the Canadian economy 0.4 per cent smaller, and the Mexican economy 0.79 per cent smaller. The effects are primarily because of U.S. efforts to get more protections for its manufacturing sector, the analysis found.\n\"Yes, we gave up some access (in the dairy sector) but we have to remember what we got in return, which was Chapter 19 ... That was a big one for us, for Canada,\" Ambrose said.\nChapter 19 lays out the trade agreement's dispute-resolution mechanism and is, in Ambrose's view, \"the heart of the deal for Canada.\" Trump was determined to scrap it and allow American courts to judge trade disputes in future but the Trudeau government held firm that some kind of independent dispute-resolution system must be part of the deal.\n\"It wasn't an idle threat (from Trump),\" said Ambrose. \"They were extremely critical of Chapter 19 and I think right up to the last minute it was their intent to scrap it.\"\nIn addition, Ambrose said Canada scored success on having international labour standards and environmental principles entrenched in the deal.\nAmbrose said Scheer's criticism of the dairy concession is consistent with his strong support for supply management. Dairy farmers were instrumental in his leadership victory over Maxime Bernier, who advocated dismantling supply management and has now left the Tories to found his own party.\nScheer, who has dubbed the new trade pact NAFTA 0.5, has also criticized the deal for extending patent protection for pharmaceuticals, which could drive up the cost of prescription drugs. He's also maintained the deal makes Canadian automakers less competitive and that it gives the U.S. \"unprecedented\" say over Canadian negotiations with future potential trade partners.\n\"The prime minister had a once-in-a-generation opportunity to negotiate a better deal and he failed,\" Scheer told the House of Commons last May. \"He gave Donald Trump everything the president wanted and more.\"\nBut Ambrose said she doesn't think Canada was outmanoeuvred by Trump.\n\"No. I think at the end of the day, there's three parties, everyone gained a little and everyone gave up a little. That's the nature of a negotiation.\"\nFormer Conservative cabinet minister James Moore, who also served on Trudeau's NAFTA advisory panel, refused to comment on Scheer's contention that Trudeau caved in to Trump.\n\"It's a fair question, it's a reasonable story but I'm not going to get sucked into the election,\" Moore said in an interview.\n"}, {"author": "John Last", "title": "Funding gap with N.W.T. municipalities should be election issue, mayors say", "description": "Territory identified massive funding gap 5 years ago \u2014 since then, not much has changed", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/funding-gap-election-2019-1.5252113", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2669349.1574988497!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sean-whelly.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 19, 2019 12:04 PM CT", "2019-08-19T18:04:59.852Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It's been five years since the N.W.T. government\u00a0acknowledged communities were receiving almost $40 million less per year than needed to maintain existing infrastructure.\nSince then, mayors and advocates say\u00a0not much has changed.\nNow, municipalities across the territory are gearing up to lobby candidates in the fall's territorial election to make closing the funding gap a priority for the next assembly.\n\"We're struggling every day with this,\" said Sheila Bassi-Kellett, administrator for the City of Yellowknife. She estimates the gap is as high as $11 million for the N.W.T. capital.\n\"What we see is an acknowledgement that we should be funded more,\" she said. \"We're not seeing a lot of action.\"\nIn 2014, the territory's Department of Municipal and Community Affairs (MACA) agreed to undertake a review of a funding formula established in 2007 known as the \"New Deal.\"\nTogether with the NWT Association of Communities, the department found community governments received $39.2 million less per year than they would need to maintain and replace their existing infrastructure.\nIn Fort Simpson, N.W.T., Mayor Sean Whelly said he receives about $2 million per year from the territorial government. But he estimates he'd need $5 million per year to keep up with the community's infrastructure needs.\n\"We're able to do emergency repairs,\" said Whelly.\u00a0\"But we're so stressed in our funding that we tend to not set up programs of regular maintenance.\"\nFor example, Whelly said\u00a0the town hasn't been able to afford regularly flushing the sprinkler systems at its rec centre. But after a review by the fire marshal, the town is facing a much more expensive prospect: replacing the system altogether.\nNow, Fort Simpson is counting on a one-time infusion of federal or territorial cash, like the $31 million announced recently for roads and cultural sites.\n\"It's basically begging\u00a0\u2014 begging to get things done\u00a0\u2014 after they basically fall apart,\" said Whelly.\nCBC spoke with mayors and administrators in several communities across the territory. While the impact of the gap varied, all said territorial funding for municipalities should be an election issue in the fall.\nAccording to MACA Deputy Minister Eleanor\u00a0Young, the territory has made moderate increases to funding over time, reducing the overall gap to about $30 million\u00a0by the end of the 2019 fiscal year.\nBut Sara Brown, CEO of the NWT Association of Communities, said the new money, which amounted to an average of just over $42,000 per community last year, is a little better than a \"cost of living\" increase.\n\"That just means the gap is moving,\" said Brown. \"It's not being closed really.\"\u00a0\nYoung said the department has done the best it can to close the gap under strict financial pressures.\n\"I'm sure that the folks out there that need money are saying that we've not made sufficient effort,\" said Young. \"From where I sit, obviously, I'm working in a very competitive environment for funding.\"\n\"It was never \u2026 an expectation that we would be able to address that $40 million in five years,\" she said.\n\"We know that money doesn't grow on trees,\" said Yellowknife administrator\u00a0Bassi-Kellett. \"We're not expecting an immediate influx right away.\"\nBut Bassi-Kellett also pointed to new territorial revenue streams \u2014 like cannabis sales and the carbon tax \u2014 that are not being redistributed to communities.\nThe benefits of closing the gap could be substantial. The NWT Association of Communities estimates adequate funding could increase the territory's GDP by $21 million and result in 220 new jobs.\nThat became a flash point in the Legislative Assembly last week, when MACA Minister Alfred Moses laughed at MLA Kieron Testart for suggesting the 18th Assembly do something to address the funding gap before its mandate ends in September.\nThe territory is planning to release a new funding strategy before the end of session.\n\"This is going to be something that's going to need to be addressed by the next government,\" said Moses at the time.\n\"Where's the direction of the territorial government going?\" said Whelly. \"They like the glittery, high profile, attention-grabbing projects.\"\n\"Are they trying as hard to get the money for the communities?\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Why a Canadian Muslim is boycotting the hajj over Saudi war crimes", "description": "'The hajj is governed by the Saudi regime and I do not agree\u00a0at all with the atrocities they've committed'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/reliving-parkland-in-el-paso-hong-kong-protests-intensify-canadian-muslim-boycotts-hajj-sam-rudy-more-1.5240818/why-a-canadian-muslim-is-boycotting-the-hajj-over-saudi-war-crimes-1.5240836", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5242106.1565387635!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/saudi-haj.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 09, 2019 6:04 PM ET", "2019-08-09T22:04:30.243Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "More than two million Muslims are expected to make the annual hajj pilgrimage\u00a0to Mecca this year, but Waeza Shamsia Afzal won't be one of them.\n\"The hajj is governed by the Saudi regime and I do not agree\u00a0at all with the atrocities they've committed and continue to commit,\" she told\u00a0Day 6\u00a0host Brent Bambury.\nThe annual event began Friday and is considered the spiritual pinnacle for many Muslims around the world.\nAfzal, who wrote about her concerns for the Globe and Mail, says her opposition\u00a0starts with the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.\u00a0\n\"The war crimes that were committed in Yemen have left millions of people to essentially starve to death.

Afzal says she would like to fulfil her duty at some point, but she tells Bambury she has conditions.\u00a0\nBelow is part of that conversation.\nIt's the fact that the hajj is in Saudi Arabia that you cannot abide? \nIt's in Saudi Arabia and it is governed by the Saudi regime who benefits from the pilgrimage.\nBenefits how? \nFrom the facts and figures I've looked into, the Saudi regime brings in about $12 billion that goes toward its GDP from the hajj. I think it's the second largest industry after oil and gas.\u00a0\nWhen did this all start for you?\nI have\u00a0been following some of the political situation there and I actually started a petition a couple of years ago.\nIt didn't really go anywhere, but that was at the time that prime minister [Stephen]\u00a0Harper signed an arms deal with Saudi Arabia and then it wasn't cancelled under Trudeau.\nSo I've been keeping up to date and following this issue for a while and, I think, it's not something new for me.  How did that choice reconcile with your religious duty as a Muslim?\u00a0\nUltimately, I don't feel like I'm necessarily doing anything.\nI feel that I'm simply expressing my opinion in the hopes that there are other people who this may resonate with \u2014\u00a0whether within the Muslim community or other people who are part of a religious tradition that are trying to reconcile some fundamental tenets of their faith with their own personal beliefs or conscience.\nWhat I'm doing is nothing new, I think even within the Muslim community there is discourse on this topic.\nWere you prepared for the fallout from\u00a0that discourse, and did you think your family and friends would support you? \nWhat's interesting is that it was received, I would say, pretty well from within the community and others.\nWithin my immediate family, they're pretty progressive. They have very similar opinions to mine when it comes to the Saudi regime. I think it's some more distant, extended family members and then, possibly, some people in the wider community who do not agree with this stand, because ultimately it is a fifth pillar and I acknowledge that.\nIf the pilgrimage is governed by an independent body, I would like to go on the pilgrimage myself. I understand the sacredness of the place and the importance that it holds for Muslims.\u00a0\nOne of the reasons why this was tough for me is that I really do not want to be pigeonholed into this idea that somehow I'm pandering to an Islamophobic agenda or narrative or somehow betraying the community, because that would really hurt me.\nI am very aware of the current climate that is not very favourable to Muslims and the scapegoating that happens and the rampant Islamophobia that exists.\nHaving this kind of opinion, for me, is a way to exert personal power over a geopolitical issue like this.\nIt has nothing to do with blaming Muslims ...\u00a0It's more about personal power and doing what we can to possibly limit the benefits that the Saudi regime collects from the pilgrimage industry.\nYou said that there were, maybe,\u00a0distant relatives in your family who might not be so supportive of your position here. Let's imagine that those people are over at your house for dinner. What do you do when the subject of the hajj comes up?\nThis is actually really closely linked to the idea that, I would say, Muslims are not a monolithic community, and\u00a0there will be people who strongly believe that this is completely wrong.\nBut there are also others, like me, who reconcile their belief in the faith with not going on the hajj. Because, again, with the idea that Muslims are a very diverse community, you have some Muslims who maybe choose to place more importance on the ritualistic or literalist aspects of the faith. Others maybe fall into a different category.\nWhat would have to happen for you to change your stance and perform hajj?\nIf an independent body were to govern the pilgrimage, I think I would feel a lot more comfortable knowing that there's no benefit that the Saudi regime going on what is essentially a holy purpose.\nIt just feels like a contradiction to go when I know that I'll be benefiting a regime that is then turning around and committing war crimes, and orchestrating the murder of journalists and all of that.\nThis Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.

The way they were going to do that was by bypassing expensive, big city life and starting a unique business in a small town.\nThere's a feeling in the arts community that \"either you have to move to Vancouver, Halifax, Toronto, or do it on your own,\" Kyle said. \"We said, hey let's do it on our own.\"\n\"We didn't want to go to Toronto,\" Chrissy said. \"Just so many people, such a high rate of competition.\"\nAfter attending a conference on artist-run centres in Ottawa in 2009, they realized a huge component of success in those ventures was owning your own property. Chrissy was raised in Picton, Ont.\u00a0(population 4,702) and the pair realized having an established support network in a town with a tourism sector was the perfect choice.\n\"Artists don't make a ton of money,\" Kyle said. \"Coming to Picton meant that we could buy a house for $200,000. You could never find that in Toronto.\"\nThe couple realized that they wanted to keep making art, and devised a plan to create an artist residency that would allow them to sustain their own artistic practices while running a business that would benefit other creatives at the same time.\nThat's how\u00a0Spark Box Studio\u00a0was born. The house itself is a gothic-style cottage on 1.5 acres overlooking a farmer's field and can host up to three residents at a time, each with their own bedroom and workspace. There's also a 1,000-square-foot out-building the pair has fashioned into a print studio, giving visual artists space to spread out and make to their heart's content in a\u00a0gorgeous pastoral setting.\nOn top of unbeatable real estate prices, moving to a small town opened Kyle and Chrissy up to a world of community support that enabled them to get on their feet in the first place. Prince Edward County's Economic Development office took a special interest in the pair and transformed what was originally a notebook of ideas into a 60-page business plan.\n\"You go to art school, learn about art, talk about it, cry about it, but it's rare you learn how to make a living in it,\" Kyle said.\n\"The county actually really liked the project and it fit with a bunch of community mandates they were trying to establish. They assisted us in securing funding for the first two years,\" Chrissy said. \"Just the amount of manpower they put behind us was really impressive.\"\nAs governments begin to realize the benefits of a town rich with culture, programs like this are popping up in small towns and counties all over Canada. \"Being in a small town can open up a lot of opportunities to make meaningful connections with people who can help you along the way,\" Kyle said.\nLambton County in southwestern Ontario's Creative County program also sees the value in helping creative entrepreneurs get started. Andrew Meyer has been Lambton's Corporate Cultural Officer for the past two years and it's important to him that the county is \"recognizing the increasingly important role played by culture in growing local economies and enhancing the quality of life for its residents.\"\nIn 2013, the county created the grant program as a result of its cultural plan, \"Building a Creative Economy.\" They allocate $75,000 annually to the program because they know that an investment in this sector will pay off both socially and financially. In fact, according to the Canada Council for the Arts, in 2016 there were 652,406 self-reported culture workers across the country, which brought in\u00a0over $53-million\u00a0in GDP that same year.\n\"Progressive municipalities find themselves trying to grow and prosper in a highly competitive environment, and that requires innovative thinking and changes in the traditional way of doing business for communities,\" Andrew said.\nThat break from tradition also allowed Kyle and Chrissy to nestle into the fabric of the town and lay down roots. \"You become a staple in the community,\" said Kyle, who, along with Chrissy, gives guest lectures, facilitates workshops, and mounts exhibitions of their own works, on top of their duties as residency directors to up to 70 artists per year. \"We want to teach artists that you are an entrepreneur,\" said Chrissy, who took what she learned in Spark Box's early days to create a solid business foundation for their establishment.\n\"One of the reasons we chose to start Spark Box is because we were leaving our [school] community,\" Kyle said. \"We came here and we built our own community.\" By choosing a small town to set up shop, that feeling of local fellowship is something the couple is able to focus on because their Picton price point is lower. \"We don't have to work 60 hours a week,\" Kyle said.\nAnd while they have many friends who have gone on to have successful artistic practices in big cities, the life and home they've created for themselves in Picton, surrounded by like-minded creators and farmers alike, is just what they always imagined.\n\"It's a very unique experience to have,\" Chrissy said. \"It's really fulfilling.\"\nOriginally published in December, 2018.\n"}, {"author": "Susan Ormiston", "title": "Trump extends U.S. physical distancing guidelines until April 30", "description": "Many had worried U.S. president would lift restrictions too soon", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-coronavirus-quarantines-1.5513607", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5514384.1585519136!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/virus-outbreak-trump.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 29, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-30T01:13:24.463Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This is a breaking news update.\u00a0 Below is an earlier version of this story.\u00a0\nU.S. President Donald Trump will extend national physical distancing guidelines to limit the spread of COVID-19 until April 30.\u00a0\nThe announcement at the White House on Sunday evening came as many health-care experts worried that Trump would relax restrictions too early after he said he was hoping for an economic resurrection, with the country \"raring to go by Easter.\"\nBut when asked by reporters about those statements on Sunday evening, Trump said the idea of restoring more normalcy by Easter\u00a0\"was just an aspiration.\"\u00a0\nThis is an earlier version of this story.

But in order to get that funding, 65 per cent of the steel, iron,\u00a0and manufactured goods used in the projects must be produced in the United States.\u00a0And that will raise to 70 per cent in 2020.\nBecause Bombardier has contracts with U.S. cities, and because of the Buy America requirement, the company said it had \"no choice\" but to move manufacturing to the U.S. and establish \"an American manufacturing footprint and supply chain.\"\nThe result, according to Bombardier, is having to cut jobs at its Canadian plant.\n\"The problem is, [Bombardier tries]\u00a0to make it sound the reason behind the cuts is that the Americans have become more protectionist, and that's why they're losing money,\" said Ramy Elitzur, a financial analysis professor with the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\nElitzur said while U.S.\u00a0protectionist measures may have had a marginal impact on Bombardier's bottom line, the more complete picture is that the company has not been very efficient,\u00a0effective or agile in terms of strategy.\nTyler Chamberlin,\u00a0assistant professor at the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management, also questioned how much Buy America was impacting business at Bombardier.\n\"It strikes me as a little bit convenient to have that sort of answer at this time, that it's about\u00a0Buy American rules,\" he said. \"I'm\u00a0certainly not aware of any deals that have been\u00a0missed by Bombardier and handed to some American manufacturer.\"\u00a0\nAs for a larger impact on Canadian industry, Chamberlin said he just isn't seeing it.\n\"Our GDP and our export numbers aren't suffering in big ways. Can you find a case or two? Maybe you might be able to. But they're not so sizable that it's actually holding back the Canadian economy or holding back Canadian exports.\"\nBut other observers say the U.S. legislation is certainly having a significant impact on some industries in Canada. Buy America does not just apply to those in the business of selling buses or railway cars, but other U.S. government procurements\u00a0including highway\u00a0contracts and other infrastructure projects.\n\"Buy American had broader impacts than Bombardier. But its impact on Canadian exports of railway rolling stock is virtually prohibitive,\" said international trade expert Peter Clark.\n\"They tell us that effectively, they can't build up a good export base to the United States.\"\nClark agreed that\u00a0companies like Bombardier that want to bid on some U.S. contracts will have to set up shop in the U.S., and that means fewer jobs in Canada.\n\"And the American states are pretty quick to offer incentives to move your plants to the U.S.,\" he said.\nDennis Darby, CEO and president of the\u00a0Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, of which Bombardier is a member, said Buy America\u00a0is a real factor in public procurement.\n\"If they have a U.S. contract and the U.S. says you have to build a certain percentage in the U.S., the jobs have to go there.\"\nDarby said it forces companies like Bombardier and New Flyer, a Winnipeg-based bus manufacturer,\u00a0to do a large part of the assembly in the U.S.\u00a0\n\"Even though it's a\u00a0Canadian company headquartered in Winnipeg almost all of the final assembly is done in the U.S,\"\u00a0he said. \"So that is a problem.\"\nFollowing Bombardier's announcement, Canada's premiers, gathered in Saskatoon for their annual conference, called on\u00a0the federal government to\u00a0take a more active role in negotiating an exemption from Buy America.\nDarby said part of the problem is that there are no real effective reciprocal measures that Canada can employ.\n\"We have no reciprocity on this with any teeth.\u00a0Both Quebec and\u00a0Ontario can ask for up to 20 per cent of the value of rolling stock to be Canadian-made. But\u00a0that's all there is right now.\"\nDarby said Canada should have its own reciprocal Buy Canada measures, or there should be a Buy North American agreement.\n\"This is one of those areas where there is not a level playing field for companies like a Bombardier\u00a0or others that are in the transit business or anyone who is doing public procurement because the U.S. rules are much, much stronger.\"\n"}, {"author": "Peter Zimonjic", "title": "Premiers end summit saying Canadian unity is strong - with some exceptions", "description": "Between 50 and 60 per cent of Albertans support potential secession from the federation: Kenney", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/premiers-pipelines-quebec-religious-symbols-1.5208244", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5209058.1562883607!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/premiers-meeting-20190711.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 11, 2019 12:11 PM ET", "2019-07-11T22:50:48.251Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada's premiers say national unity is strong across the country and that regional leaders are working together on a number of fronts to ensure that harmony becomes even stronger.\nThe provincial and territorial premiers made the comments at the closing press conference of the two-day Council of the Federation meeting hosted by Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe in Saskatoon.\nThe two outliers among the provincial leaders were the premiers of Saskatchewan and Alberta, who maintained that frustration over political factors hampering oil development and export have increased alienation in their provinces.\n\"This is not just some random political opinion,\" Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said. \"We had at least two credible pollsters in the past three months indicate between 50 and 60 per cent support for the principle of a potential secession\u00a0from the federation.\n\"I don't think Albertans are actually ready to do that, I think they believe in this country, but that's a way that they are expressing a truly profound sense of alienation. And all they ask for is fairness within the federation.\"\nKenney said that while there is no private sector proposal to build a pipeline to transport oil from west to east, such a plan could win investment if the\u00a0federal government offered some certainty that it would be approved.\nMoe and Kenney have warned of western alienation before\u00a0\u2014 most recently in response to the passage of federal legislation banning oil tanker traffic off the coast of British Columbia\u00a0and a\u00a0new environmental assessment law\u00a0that changes the the approval process for natural resource projects.\nThey said that both laws frustrate the oil and gas industry and make it harder for Saskatchewan and Alberta to overcome the economic challenges facing Canada's energy sector.\nKenney aimed his criticisms\u00a0directly at the federal government and Quebec, accusing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of giving Quebec a virtual veto over a west-east pipeline.\n\"Albertans ask the reasonable question: if [Quebec is] not willing to accept our resources, why are [they] willing to accept the money that comes from them?\" he said.\nQuebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault maintains that there is no \"social acceptability\" in his province for a pipeline connecting Alberta to refineries in New Brunswick and crossing through his province, and that he will continue to oppose any such proposals.\nAnother point of division between Quebec and at least one other province was\u00a0the Legault\u00a0government's controversial new law banning the wearing of religious symbols by certain public employees.\nManitoba Premier Brian Pallister has attacked the law publicly as a \"dangerous\" and \"un-Canadian\" attack on personal freedoms. He said today that while he respects Legault for following through on a campaign promise to pass such a bill, he disagrees with the law itself.\n\"I think he's a fine man ... and if two men always agree, then one of them isn't doing any thinking,\" Pallister said.\n\"The people of Manitoba celebrate our diversity.\u00a0I believe our country does too.\u00a0I don't think we should hide that. My position will continue to be what it is, and perhaps the premier's will continue to be what it is as well.\"\nOther premiers said that while there were disagreements on pipelines and the religious symbols law, the provinces are working together on trade, labour mobility, immigration, climate change, health care and treatment for addictions.\n\"I don't believe the country's divided, nor do I believe we're in a situation as was described,\" said Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil. \"If you look around this table and the conversations that have happened today, it actually has been about cooperation.\"\nMcNeil said there should have been pipelines across the country decades ago but the premiers are continuing to work on things they can fix now.\nThe premiers agreed to review the exemptions they put into the interprovincial Canadian Free Trade Agreement \u2014 which took effect July 1, 2017 \u2014 with a view to removing as many as possible. Kenney announced Wednesday that his province would eliminate half\u00a0of its exemptions and would work to remove the rest.\nThey also presented a united face on a number of requests they're making of the federal government.\u00a0\nOn health care, they want the federal government to increase the annual health transfer to the provinces by 5.2 per cent per year. Transfers currently rise by either 3 per cent per year, or by the three-year average of nominal GDP growth, whichever is higher.\nThe premiers also said that they asked the federal government to work with them on the proposed federal pharmacare plan to ensure that federal funding for drugs does not hamper work the provinces are already doing.\nThe leaders also want the federal government to streamline their access to funding to mitigate natural disasters\u00a0\u2014 funding\u00a0which they said is not timely or flexible enough to cope with sudden weather events driven by climate change.\nOn Wednesday, the premiers asked the federal government to work with them to standardize professional certifications across the country,\u00a0streamline immigration rules to ensure Canada gets the skilled workers it needs and press the United States for an exemption from \"Buy American\" legislation that they said disproportionately hurts Canadian workers.\nIn a somewhat unusual move, the premiers released\u00a0copies of letters they sent to the federal party leaders asking them to outline their policies on\u00a0job and skills training, immigration, healthcare, climate change, Arctic sovereignty, reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and their commitment to federalism.\nMoe said that the responses to the premiers'\u00a0letters will be released publicly to help inform voters in advance of the coming federal election.\nNext year's Council of the Federation meeting will be hosted by Quebec from July 22 to 24.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian and U.S. economies are converging but danger lurks: Don Pittis", "description": "Poloz and Wilkins warn that markets overestimate the power of a rate-cut quick fix", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/poloz-powell-rates-economy-1.5204132", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5207418.1562794054!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bank-of-canada-20190710.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 11, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-07-11T16:01:07.313Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "On the face of it, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz and his deputy Carolyn Wilkins had some excellent news about the Canadian economy in yesterday's Monetary Policy Report.\nThe happy story included falling mortgage\u00a0rates, continued employment strength and growing business investment that have pushed Canadian economic growth rates higher in the first half of the year than almost anyone expected.\nBut as global trade threats linger, Canada's top central bankers warn that many people who should know better, including stock market investors, seem to think cuts to interest rates can solve all problems.\nIn a complex world riven by trade disputes, they say, there are simply limits to the power of central bankers to patch things up.

A Senate vote\u00a0appeared likely Wednesday, with a House vote to follow. \u00a0 \u00a0\nAt issue is an unprecedented economic rescue package that would\u00a0give direct payments to most Americans, expanded unemployment\u00a0benefits and a $367-billion program for small businesses to keep\u00a0making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the\u00a0last issues to close concerned $500-billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries.\u00a0\nA one-time payment of $1,200 per person, or $3,000 for a family of four, would go directly to the public.\nTo provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new\u00a0inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars.\nIn a series of tweets posted Tuesday, Trump implored lawmakers to strike a deal.\nTrump in recent days has sounded a note of frustration about the\u00a0unprecedented modern-day effort to halt the virus's march by\u00a0essentially shutting down public activities in ways that now\u00a0threaten the U.S. economy.\u00a0On Tuesday, he weighed a relaxation of\u00a0social distancing guidelines after the 15-day period is up.\u00a0\nHis\u00a0suggestion that the pandemic could ease and allow a return to\u00a0normalcy in a mere few weeks is not supported by public health\u00a0officials or many others in government, including some in his own party.\nRepublicans, including Liz Cheney and Sen.

No American is going to say accelerate the economy at the cost of human life,\" he said, at a convention centre in Manhattan that is being repurposed to fit beds for coronavirus patients.\nCuomo said the projected need for hospital beds in New York at the peak of the outbreak has jumped to 140,000, compared with the 53,000 that are available.

Rand Paul of Kentucky and congressmen Ben McAdams (Utah) and Mario D\u00edaz-Balart (Florida) are among those who have tested positive for the virus, as have\u00a0members of the military.

Trump said in a Twitter post earlier Tuesday he has not needed to rely on the act\u00a0to get supplies. \"The Defense Production Act is in full force, but haven't\u00a0had to use it because no one has said NO! Millions of masks coming as back up to States,\" Trump said.\nIn another development, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said Tuesday it would award\u00a0$100 million immediately to 1,381 health centres\u00a0across the nation to bolster their response to the pandemic.\nThe health centres may use the funds to meet screening and testing needs, acquire medical supplies and boost telehealth capacity, the HHS said.

But he says this could be accomplished by effectively setting \"deductibles\" and limiting coverage in such a way that would dissuade a province from \"burning down its home to collect insurance.\"\nHe proposes three possible methods to do this.\nMethod A (the least generous of his proposals) would include a five-per-cent \"deductible\" and a 50-per-cent coverage rate for losses beyond that deductible.\n\"In other words,\" Dahlby writes, \"only reductions in annual own-source revenues in excess of five per cent of the average own-source revenue over the previous five years would be eligible for a payment and only 50 per cent of that would be covered.\"\nMethod B would also include a five-per-cent deductible, but with a 75-per-cent coverage rate.\nAnd Method C would have a lower deductible\u00a0\u2014 just three per cent \u2014 along with a lower coverage rate of 66 per cent.\nDahlby calculates these methods would have resulted in much more financial support for Alberta during its recent economic downturn.\nRemember: the province received roughly $250 million under the current fiscal stabilization program in 2016.\nUnder Dahlby's proposals,\u00a0Alberta would have received $2.1 billion under Method A, $3.1 billion under Method B or $3.2 billion under Method C.\nThe following year, it would have received even more: between $2.8 billion and $4.2 billion, depending on the calculation method.\nProvinces like Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador, which also experience booms and busts related to the prices of oil and gas, would also receive more federal funds during downturns under this approach, Dahlby notes.\nHe suggests such a system would be a more effective \"insurance policy\" for provinces that rely heavily on volatile natural-resource markets and, as such, their lobbying efforts would be better directed at reforming the\u00a0stabilization program than Canada's system of equalization payments.\n\"While it is true that the equalization program needs reform, that program was never meant to help a province such as Alberta, where GDP per capita and household incomes are above the national average, even in times when its economy shrinks,\" he writes.\n\"Alberta and the other resource-rich provinces should also pressure the federal government to reform the fiscal stabilization program in order to address their concerns about the lack of federal support in the wake of the downturn in the oil and gas sector.\"\nDahlby also sits on the expert panel appointed by Premier Jason Kenney that is tasked with offering advice to the Alberta government on how to balance its budget without raising taxes.\n"}, {"author": "Brandie Weikle", "title": "Canada and California sign deal to cut vehicle emissions", "description":

"source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada's federal government has signed an agreement with California to further reduce vehicle emissions.\nEnvironment Minister Catherine McKenna announced Wednesday that the two governments will work together on regulations to cut greenhouse gases from vehicles and promote the use of cleaner-running vehicles.\nMcKenna announced the agreement with California Gov.\u00a0Gavin Newsom, and signed the memo of understanding with the chair of the California Air Resources Board, Mary Nichols.\nCalifornia has pioneered low-carbon fuel standards in the United States, and Canada is aiming to cut emissions by 30 million tonnes by 2030, the equivalent to taking seven million cars off the road.\n\"As the world's fifth-largest economy and a global leader in clean transportation, California is a leading example of how climate action can be good for people, the environment and the economy,\" said McKenna in a statement.\u00a0\n\"We look forward to working with California to fight climate change, keep the air clean and give drivers better options for cleaner, more affordable vehicles.\"\nUnder current regulations, by 2025 new model light-duty vehicles are expected to burn as much as 50 per cent less\u00a0fuel and emit half the volume of greenhouse\u00a0gasses compared with vehicles built in 2008.\nDuring a teleconference with media Wednesday, McKenna said the agreement with California will do three main things:\nCalifornia is suing the U.S. federal government after President Donald Trump moved last summer to no longer allow California to set its own standards for tailpipe emissions.\nTrump is enacting that change at the same time as he is rolling back standards set under his predecessor Barack Obama that would have required the efficiency of gasoline-powered vehicles to improve each year through 2025.\nCanada has aligned with the United States on tailpipe emissions standards for more than two decades and signed on to the 2012 version set by Obama.\nAfter Trump moved to lower those standards last summer, Canada said it was reviewing its plan and wouldn't commit to maintaining parity with the U.S. any longer.\nMcKenna said that in the past, Canada harmonized its vehicle emission manufacturing standards with the U.S., but now \"it looks like there will be two standards in the U.S.\"\nShe said \"that's not anybody's first choice,\" but the two countries couldn't meet their emissions targets without aggressive action on vehicle pollution.\nDuring the teleconference with McKenna, Newsom said the reduction of greenhouse gases is \"essential to our economic growth and prosperity.\" He said\u00a0the state has out-performed\u00a0the rest of the U.S. in GDP growth for the past five years.\n\"For us, these vehicle emissions standards are fundamental and critical to reaching our goals.\"\nAsked what he had to say to conservative politicians who oppose firm action on climate change, Newsom issued an invitation.\n\"If you want to see if climate change is real, come to California. See what we've just come through in the past few years,\" he said, citing wildfires that claimed dozens of lives and caused record property damage.\n\"Something big is happening. Mother Nature has joined the conversation.\"\nThe announcement was met with apprehension\u00a0from the auto industry, who voiced concern about the implications of manufacturing vehicles to two different emissions standards.\nMark Nantais, president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, said that if Canada were to formally part ways with the U.S. on vehicle standards, it would create\u00a0\"all kinds of inefficiencies in a market that's a highly integrated market to begin with.\"\u00a0\n\"Over two years now, we've worked very hard to strike an agreement on a North American free trade agreement that supports the integrated economies,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"Canada, in our view, needs to ensure that national standards\u00a0\u2026 for light-duty vehicles remain aligned with the United States, which enable\u00a0us to deliver vehicles to Canadian consumers ... with continued environmental improvements, but at an affordable cost.\"\u00a0\nSimilarly, the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association said the\u00a0announcement \"runs counter to the benefits of single national standard with the United States.\"\n\"Moves away from a harmonized approach will hinder choice and increase costs for Canadian consumers,\" said spokesperson\u00a0Huw Williams.\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Dan Healing", "title": "Canadian agriculture is using more energy \u2014 but more efficiently, too", "description": "Productivity gains outpace steep rise in agricultural energy use since 1990", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/agricultural-energy-productivity-gains-1.5186950", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3842525.1478644927!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/combine-harvesting-barley.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 23, 2019 1:01 PM MT", "2019-06-24T13:50:20.453Z"], "source": null, "content": "Third-generation farmer Ron Lamb remembers his father pulling six-metre-wide crop-seeding equipment around his southern Alberta grain fields in the 1990s, overlapping on each pass to make sure he covered all the ground.\n\"When my dad was seeding the soil, he was using a 20-foot-wide piece of machinery and he was eyeballing or judging how much overlap on each pass across the ground so he didn't miss. So he would have to overlap a foot or so, so he was actually only covering 19 feet,\" said Lamb in an interview.\n\"Well, now, we're using 40- and 50- and 60-foot-wide equipment. But thanks to GPS, there is zero overlap,\" the 59-year-old farmer said.\nThat small amount of overlap on each pass around the field looms large as overall energy use from Canadian agriculture grows along with average farm size but energy efficiency improves as well.\nCanadian agricultural energy demand increased from roughly 200 petajoules (about 55 million megawatt-hours) in 1990 to 300 PJ in 2016, but the amount of energy consumed per inflation-adjusted dollar of agricultural output fell 17 per cent, according to a recent National Energy Board analysis of federal statistics.\n\"This is a pretty common trend within the broader energy system as a whole,\" said Matthew Hansen, a technical specialist on the energy outlook team for the NEB.\n\"Canada's energy use has been increasing since 1990 but the energy intensity of the economy, or energy use per dollar of GDP, has been declining.\"\nThe trend varies from province to province and from year to year but it is something energy and crop engineer Steve Clarke, who joined the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs in 1983, predicts will continue for some time.\n\"In the last five years, we're massively moving to LED lighting, which has a huge reduction in energy costs,\" he said, especially for poultry and dairy farms where much of the activity takes place indoors.\n\"Farms are bigger, so there's less manpower, so we're automating more. And we're now starting to remote monitor stuff ... through the cloud so you can actually see it on your desktop.\"\nAccording to Statistics Canada, the number of farms in Canada dropped from 280,000 in the 1991 census to 193,500 in 2016. The number of farm operators contracted from 385,600 in 1996 to 272,000 in 2016.\nTechnological\u00a0advances are increasingly important as farmers focus on ways to save time, money and energy, Clarke said.\nA typical dairy farmer 30 years ago might have had 60 cattle to look after but on today's larger farms, he could have 250, he noted. Remote monitoring is required to figure out which cattle aren't eating or producing as much milk as they should because the farmer doesn't have the time to get to know each cow.\nControlling growing conditions means controlling energy use for members of her organization, said Linda Delli Santi, executive director of the B.C. Greenhouse Growers Association and a former greenhouse operator.\nThe industry has employed energy curtains on the ceilings of their greenhouses for years to help with heating at night and in the winter, cooling during the day, and dispersing humidity, she said. Now computer programs automatically open and close them as needed.\nB.C. operators prefer to use natural gas to heat their greenhouses because the carbon dioxide produced helps plants grow, she said. In recognition, the province offers relief grants equal to 80 per cent of the B.C. carbon tax on eligible natural gas and propane consumed by greenhouses.\nMeanwhile, on the Lamb farm in southern Alberta, energy costs are falling again this spring thanks to a solar energy system installed last year to generate most of the energy needed for its grain field irrigation systems.\nLamb and two neighbours partnered to build a large array of solar panels that generates electricity to pump water from a lake as well as power central-pivot-style irrigation systems that move in a circle to distribute water evenly and automatically over each field.\nThe panels produce about 85 kilowatts of power for Lamb, which he calculates will provide an annual average of 70 to 80 per cent of the power needed. About 30 per cent of the cost of $220,000 was covered by a provincial grant, which means the system should pay off its $150,000 net cost in eight or nine years, he said.\nEnergy use, efficiency and cost control enter into every decision on the farm these days, Lamb said, from calculating fuel economy per hectare for a new tractor to figuring out the shortest routes and optimum frequency for routine visits to far-flung pastures.\n\"It's a whole system of thinking,\" he said.\n\"Every time we make a machinery change or difference in technique of how we do production, certainly energy consumed is a factor.\"\n"}, {"author": "Aaron Wherry", "title": "This isn't Thomas Mulcair's NDP anymore", "description": "Jagmeet Singh unveils a platform that embraces taxes and promises big things", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jagmeet-singh-ndp-platform-analysis-wherry-1.5178309", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5179223.1560814301!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 18, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-06-18T08:00:00.146Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The socialist wing of the NDP should probably send Justin Trudeau a note of thanks.\nIf Trudeau and the Liberals hadn't trounced the NDP in 2015, and if they hadn't done so while running on an aggressively progressive platform, the New Democrats would surely not have released the sort of platform they did on Sunday\u00a0\u2014 a platform that practically boasts of the billions in new revenue an NDP government would raise.\nThomas Mulcair's NDP was not entirely opposed to raising taxes. As set out in the party's 2015 platform, a\u00a0Mulcair government would have increased the corporate tax rate by two points, from 15 to 17 per cent. That\u00a0NDP also promised to close the tax loophole on stock options \u2014 an issue the Trudeau government partially addressed\u00a0earlier this year.\nBut the former NDP leader scoffed at raising\u00a0taxes on the wealthiest Canadians, as Trudeau eventually did. \"Several provinces are now at the 50 per cent rate,\" Mulcair\u00a0said in 2013.\u00a0\"Beyond that, you're not talking taxation; you're talking confiscation. And that is never going to be part of my policies, going after more individual taxes. Period. Full stop.\"\nMulcair worried that any increase in personal taxes would tarnish his\u00a0party's brand. But not raising taxes was also linked with a refusal to run a deficit. Tom Mulcair\u00a0prided himself on being a serious and experienced \"public administrator,\" and serious public administrators didn't do such things.\nJagmeet Singh's NDP is apparently not encumbered by such pretence.\nAs laid out\u00a0on Sunday, a Singh government would increase the top personal income rate from 33\u00a0to 35 per cent;\u00a0make 75 per cent of capital gains eligible for taxation, up from\u00a0the current 50 per cent;\u00a0and introduce a new one per cent \"wealth tax\" on those with incomes over $20 million.\nAn NDP\u00a0government would also increase the corporate tax rate to 18 per cent,\u00a0it would introduce a 15 per cent foreign buyer's tax on real estate purchases and would apply to GST to foreign-based Internet services, like Netflix.\nSomewhere Tom Mulcair is feeling faint.\nThose tax increases are necessary because of everything else the NDP is promising to do.\nIn 2015, the NDP promised to work toward universal pharmacare. Singh's NDP\u00a0is promising to have a national pharmacare system up and running by 2020, and to then add dental care and seniors care to the Canada Health Act, while also funding eye, hearing and mental health care.\nIn 2015, the NDP promised to build 10,000 new affordable housing units. Singh's NDP\u00a0is vowing to build 500,000 spaces over 10 years.\nIn 2019, there are also aspirational goals of free post-secondary education and free public transit. And a Singh government would fund a basic income pilot project, while also\u00a0increasing\u00a0funding for child care by $1 billion per year.\nThere are promises of nearly a dozen national strategies, covering everything from aerospace to freshwater to food waste.\nLearn more about the NDP's\u00a0recently unveiled platform:\nBut the boldness isn't limited to new social programs:\u00a0Singh's NDP would decriminalize all drugs, and they'd lower the voting age to 16.\nAs for balancing the budget, the NDP isn't particularly worried about it.\n\"Our fiscal approach ensures that Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio falls over our 10-year fiscal horizon,\" the party explains, giving itself significant leeway to increase the federal deficit in the short term.\nTimes, of course, have changed.\nIn 2015, the NDP was the Official Opposition and competitive in the national polls.\u00a0Going into that year's campaign, it even held a small lead over both the Conservatives and Liberals. The greatest risk might have seemed to be that the party would scare off potential voters\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that the increasingly real prospect of an NDP government would cause swing voters to have second thoughts.\nSo the NDP struck a reassuring tone, while promoting Mulcair as a more serious,\u00a0experienced leader than Trudeau.\nFour years later, the NDP\u00a0have neither the political nor the policy room to play it safe.\nWhile surely not to the satisfaction of all progressive activists, the Trudeau government has, in several ways, acted as a moderate NDP government might. And the real NDP has fallen back to a distant third in national polls. After the historic breakthrough of his election as NDP leader, Singh has largely failed to generate any significant excitement.\nThe NDP currently sits\u00a0at 15 per cent and is facing the potential for significant losses in the fall election. Fundraising returns are weak. And\u00a0worse, Elizabeth May's Greens are suddenly not far behind.\nThe clearest\u00a0available path back to relevance involves being interesting\u00a0\u2014 with an eye to voters who might wish the Liberals had done more on various fronts and with a mind to ensuring those progressive voters don't move to the Greens.\nFor certain segments of the NDP's membership, this is no doubt preferable to the 2015 approach. And for certain segments of the public, this might seem like an exciting break from the status quo.\nThe risk for the NDP\u00a0in being more interesting\u00a0is that\u00a0the party may seem less credible. The Liberals have already begun to needle the New Democrats for having great ideas, but no real plan to make any of it happen.\nWhat the NDP\u00a0platform lacked on Sunday was anything that looked like a full costing. That is apparently in the works, with plans to submit proposals to the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer for an independent review.\nEven if the PBO finds that the party's numbers add up, those numbers will\u00a0surely be big. And big numbers are often hard to carry around.\nBut whether borne out of circumstance or ideological inclination, this is what the NDP needs to be right now.\n"}, {"author": "Paul Withers", "title": "Despite labour shortages, Nova Scotia's ocean tech sector is booming", "description": "'The bottleneck is labour, has been for years.

That can help determine impact on marine life.\n\"Basically, everything you see other than the float itself, this piece of foam was either supplied by a local company, manufactured by a local company or produced or assembled by a local company,\" said\u00a0Moloney.\nJASCO used 22 Nova Scotia companies, many based in Burnside \u2014 to produce the Kitimat observer buoy.

For commuters, it means about two more months of disruption.\nThe closure of Quinpool Road from the Armdale Roundabout to Connaught Avenue has put tremendous pressure on Chebucto Road and shortened the tempers of those affected.\nBut District 9 Coun. Shawn Cleary says work is going well\u00a0and should be done by mid-August.\n\"They're on schedule,\" he said. \"The first couple of weeks was Halifax Water.\u00a0So with the bridge, the reinforcement of the arch, the Halifax Water pipes that used to be inside the bridge can no longer be inside the bridge, there's\u00a0not enough room.\"\nA separate bridge to carry the water pipes over the railway cut was built and CN was able to begin its work, he said.\n\"Then\u00a0CN\u00a0came in and they started excavating because they had\u00a0to go right down to the masonry arch. They\u00a0had to reinforce and waterproof the arch and now \u2026 the concrete is curing and so they'll be hopefully at a point soon where they can start rebuilding it back up,\" Cleary said.\nHe said the target date for completion is mid-August and and he's been notified that work is on schedule.\nRainy weather has helped, not hindered, the project.\n\"Concrete, as long as it's hard,\u00a0doesn't mind the rain. Actually, sunshine is a bad thing for concrete when it's curing, you don't want it\u00a0to cure too quickly. Things are progressing. I see lots of equipment, lots of workers on site.\"\nIt's not the first time the\u00a0Halifax West Armdale\u00a0councillor and his\u00a0constituents had to cope with closed roads and upheaval due to a massive construction project.\nIn 2017, a stretch of the St. Margarets Bay Road\u00a0between Douglas Drive and Quarry Road was closed to through traffic from mid-July to the end of November.\nEven though traffic on Quinpool past Connaught is restricted to local residents, drivers are using side streets to weave their way to Chebucto in order to exit the peninsula, Cleary said. As a result, there are complaints from residents.\n\"We've had police every day in here patrolling, actually both on the north side and the south side of Quinpool, and they've had days where they've given out 15 to 20 tickets because people are rolling through stop signs,\" Cleary said.\n\"People are doing dangerous things like coming up outside of their lane to try and make a turn ahead of the rest of the traffic. And so the police have been very active.\"\nThe streets most affected\u00a0\u2014 MacDonald, Quinn and Churchill\u00a0\u2014 are coping with sharply increased\u00a0amounts of traffic.\n\"There are [13,500] vehicles coming up Quinpool every morning, and Armview used to see over 2,000 go down there. And so we know the traffic has increased through MacDonald and Quinn and Churchill,\u00a0certainly not to that extent.\"\nSome changes have been made on those streets. A yield sign on Churchill has been changed to a stop sign and Blink Bonnie Terrance has been closed off where the street meets MacDonald.\nFour speed bumps have been added to MacDonald. But that was due to a traffic study last year that found about 85 per cent of drivers were going too fast on the road that connects Quinpool and Chebucto.\n\"But when it's gridlock, it's not the speed that is the issue. It is the people's aggressive driving tendencies. Thankfully, [there's been] no major incidents, a lot of close calls and those kind of things. The police, as I said, have given a lot of tickets for dumb driving behaviour.\"\nHalifax police said there has not been a spike in the number of collisions since the construction work began.\u00a0\n\"The number of motor-vehicle collisions in the Armdale Roundabout, Chebucto Road and Connaught for April-May 2018 was zero and for April-May 2019 was one,\" Const. John MacLeod said in an email Thursday.\nThe length of time for this particular project has rankled Halifax residents. One local structural engineer said\u00a0CN could have used\u00a0a prefabricated structure to replace, rather than repair, the bridge. That could have cut construction time to one month from more than four.\nCleary\u00a0said the municipality had no control over the means and length of the work.\n\"The city has no authority to dictate how CN rebuilds their bridge.

It is one of the most curious acts of solipsism ever invented.\nThe beloved leader-for-life, a king or a president, always a man, appears on some hideous filigreed-and-gilded couch or chair, chatting with an important visitor. Maybe sweet tea is served. No questions are allowed. That's it.\nLickspittle journalists from the state-controlled media are invited to record the event (usually, no audio is permitted), which is then broadcast at the top of the evening newscast, with gushing narration about the awe and respect and deference shown the leader by his important visitor.\nI've seen Jordanian television lead its newscast with three identical, consecutive scenes, all on the same royal couch.\nIt's hilarious, and most Western reporters cackle sarcastically when they first see it. I certainly did.\nIn reality, though, photo ops in our democracies aren't much different.\nPoliticians pose and grip and grin, and mouth blandishments, and, like the beloved Arab leaders, are careful to say nothing.\u00a0\nThe prime photo op directive, it seems, is to say absolutely nothing. The only difference in the West is that leaders don't order journalists to turn off the audio. (I'll bet they would if they could).\nSo reporters scrutinize faces for the slightest flicker of authenticity. Did the Italian PM roll his eyes for a moment? Did Angela Merkel seem to suppress a snicker? Did Melania Trump look exhausted and scared?\nThe exception, of course, is Donald Trump.\nNo need to examine him for tells or tics. Ever since his elevation by the American public he represents so perfectly, he's been barging into photo ops, elbowing his way to the front, running his mouth, looking desperately bored when anyone else is speaking, using other leaders as props, and disrupting everything.\nI love it. After a lifetime of suffering through photo ops, it's refreshing. Trump might have a mouth like an open sewer, but at least he says something.\nWatching him crash around NATO's 75th anniversary get-together earlier this month was particularly enjoyable.\nHe turned a photo op with NATO's obsequious secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, into a 52-minute news conference starring himself, bellyaching about Congressional Democrats.\nHe then did the same thing to French president Emmanuel Macron, beside whom he held court for 41 minutes, telling Macron he should take back French citizens who went off to fight for ISIS and are now stranded in detention camps in Syria.\n\"Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?\" he asked Macron. \"I could give them to you.\"\nMacron sputtered that Trump should be serious, and that foreign fighters are a tiny part of a big problem.\nIt was fascinating: problems normally handled quietly by diplomats, erupting like burst pimples, right out in the open.\nDuring Trump's relatively brief 35 minutes with Justin Trudeau, he bluntly asked our prime minister, in front of everybody, why Canada isn't contributing two per cent of GDP to NATO, as required. Actually, asked Trump, \"What are you at? What's your number?\"\nTrudeau flailed, tried a little boring message track about his government's commitment to raise defence spending (I was sure he was going to start talking about helping the middle class), and finally, after consulting with his retinue, replied 1.4 per cent.\n\u00a0Well, maybe Canada should be put on a payment plan, gloated Trump.\nIt was those Trump performances that Trudeau and Macron were giggling about at a reception later, when they were caught on camera with the audio turned on.\nThe video went viral, and made headlines, because it was normally scripted leaders caught in a rare moment of honesty. Trump, on the other hand, prefers making fun of people to their faces.\nA colleague, after watching the NATO coverage for a few days, wrote me asking: \"Why don't more politicians besides an old white racist use these deadly dull canned moments to actually say something?\"\nGood question.\nGreat question, really. Instead of sniggering at receptions, why don't our leaders stop behaving like wax sculptures of themselves?\nWouldn't it have been wonderful, when Trump started bitching about Canada's NATO contribution, if Trudeau had had the bottle to say something like: \"Sure, let's talk about American military leadership. Your country invaded Iraq based on a lie, solved nothing, and caused not only hundreds of thousands of deaths, but created ISIS. And now we're learning from your own government correspondence that you had no idea what you were doing in Afghanistan, a mess you actually managed to drag Canada into, and we all spent a lot of blood and treasure for nothing. Great job, Mr. President. Everybody's impressed.\"\nOr, when Trump made his smarty-pants offer to send France some nice ISIS fighters, if Macron had replied: \"Really? Well, let's talk about that. You've been dumping your own prisoners on another country's soil, and holding them indefinitely without due process. Your country has also practised torture as an official policy, and you just pardoned three war criminals. Spare me, Mr. President. Also, and I say this as a Frenchman, your long-tie look is ridiculous.\"\nInstead, the posing and empty statements live on, and will be happening long after Trump lurches off to enjoy the money his resorts have raked in during his presidency.\nWhy does such photo-op mummery persist?\nVanity and fear, I'd submit. Some of our leaders, like the Arab potentates, actually think they're so interesting they need only mouth pleasantries to make people listen in fascination.\nOthers take refuge in scripted replies and posed photo ops because they're afraid, probably with good reason, that they'll say something stupid.\nBut Trump has made that all right. Hasn't he?\n***\nAuthor's Note: A rather doleful column I wrote last September about\u00a0wrestling with a decision on whether to have surgery done on\u00a0my Border Collie pup Lola, after we discovered she'd been born\u00a0with hip dysplasia, generated an awful lot of response from\u00a0commiserating dog-owners.\u00a0I can report that we went ahead and basically had her hip joints\u00a0removed that month, and that she has recovered brilliantly, and\u00a0now runs like the wind.

Alienation and resentment fester, triggering separatist sentiment.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking it's 1980 and not 2019.\nIn 1980, there were no Liberal MPs from Alberta, Saskatchewan or B.C. in Ottawa, and a separatist actually won a provincial seat in an Alberta byelection (but lost it within months).\nSince last week's federal election returned Justin Trudeau's Liberals to power, with no seats in Alberta and Saskatchewan, the anger in Alberta seems to have climbed from its already considerable heights. Western separatism is again being bandied about.\nIt may not even be at the tepid levels of support that it had in the early '80s, but it's not just relegated to the fringes of the fringes of the internet these days.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut how substantial, or how real, are those sentiments, and what does that mean for Alberta, the West and Confederation?\u00a0\nIt's hard to quantify whether online venting is a real thing that could transform into Albertans actually wanting to break away from the rest of Canada.\u00a0 Still, there's no doubting the animosity and impatience\u00a0Albertans have for Ottawa these days.\u00a0\nOne thing that is not up for debate is there is real anger in Alberta.\u00a0\nMany in the heart of Canada's stubbornly sluggish energy economy feel \u2014 justly or not \u2014 that the federal government has been actively undermining the industry Alberta is so dependent on.\n\"There's definite concern, anger, frustration coming from even people who I would describe as real moderates,\" said Monte Solberg, a former Conservative cabinet minister\u00a0and current principal of New West Public Affairs.\u00a0\n\"Because they see things like this tanker ban on one coast but not on the other and start to wonder: 'Well, what has Alberta done to deserve being targeted by its own federal government to\u00a0essentially shut down its oil and gas economy?'\"\nThe list of grievances is long:\u00a0There's new legislation on environmental reviews of large industrial projects like pipelines, which Alberta Premier Jason Kenney calls the \"no-more-pipelines act;\" there's the aforementioned tanker ban on the northern West Coast; and there's also frustration with equalization payments that some Albertans feel are too high (due, it should be noted, to our higher earnings.)\nA fiscal stabilization fund that funnels money into provinces when their GDP nosedives is out of date and provided a relative pittance when the price of oil cratered.\u00a0\nThen, there's the dreaded carbon tax.\u00a0\nFor weeks this past winter, angry protestors in yellow safety vests lined the byways and highways of the Prairies demonstrating against\u00a0a laundry list of grievances ranging from the carbon tax to immigration.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the recent federal election, that all added up to a giant blue swath washing over Alberta and Saskatchewan, with almost 70 per cent of Albertans voting Conservative.\u00a0\nBut would the anger subside if our bellies were full?\n\"Historically, the sentiment is always strongest when the economy is down,\" said Solberg. \"But it's not just about the economy. It's about when the government does something that interferes with the economy and causes this to happen.\"\nIt's a volatile situation that requires deft hands.\u00a0\nKenney says he's an avowed federalist. A longtime Calgary MP who was at the cabinet table when the current equalization formula was developed under prime minister Stephen Harper, he says he wants to find solutions that help Alberta and calls separation \"irrational.\"\nBut there is that whole negotiation thing.\u2026\nKenney plans to barrel ahead with a referendum on equalization, which he said will provide leverage when negotiating with Ottawa.\u00a0\nHe also said last week that he'll appoint a panel to talk to Albertans \u2014 including those with separatist views \u2014 about the province's place in the federation.\u00a0\n\"There's two approaches that leaders can take in an environment like this in Alberta today,\" he said about the panel consultations.\n\"One would be to dismiss and ridicule the sentiment of frustration that is palpable and refuse to listen to those people. That is the worst mistake possible that would just, I think, create even more frustration. The other alternative done is to actually listen to people and respect what they have to say. And I think that is the much wiser approach.\"\nMelanee Thomas, a political scientist at the University of Calgary, doesn't think the premier is doing the province any favours by playing to separatist sentiments. She thinks he's using it to his political advantage.\n\"Who's the person who's speaking most about western separatism and especially 'if we don't get a fair deal, we're going to have a referendum on equalization,\u00a0and we should just leave,'\" she said.\u00a0\n\"This is an elite-driven narrative. I mean, I'm looking at Jason Kenney.\"\nAnd there is a political advantage to whipping up anger. Angry voters are motivated voters.\u00a0 Kenney and the UCP arguably rode a wave of anger into office in April, capturing a massive majority government over the incumbent NDP.\nKenney isn't the first Alberta premier to navigate western anger and alienation. Peter Lougheed plied those same waters in 1980 and used similar language to Kenney.\n\"I don't think that people in Western Canada want to separate,\" Lougheed\u00a0told CBC News in October 1980. \"They want to be a part of the mainstream of Canadian life.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBut Lougheed\u00a0said Albertans had \"a great deal to complain about, and they're justified complaints.\"\nSolberg points to Preston Manning and his Reform Party as an example of channeling western rage into something constructive for Alberta.\u00a0\n\"It can be used, you know, to to get things for the province and get a fair shake and consideration, but it does have to be handled with care,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"You know, if there was sort of an articulate spokesperson for western separation or for Alberta separation, it would be that much more tricky to handle.\"\nSo far, that articulate voice, or real support behind any kind of separatist movement, hasn't materialized.\u00a0\nJay Hill \u2014 a former Conservative cabinet minister first elected as a Reform MP \u2014 has gone full-throttle western separatist.\u00a0\n\"I believe the first step is to hold a referendum and let the people themselves decide once they know all of the ramifications. There's lots of reasons to be afraid of this as there is to leaving an abusive relationship and seeking a divorce,\" he said.\n\"You know it's not unlike that type of situation, but people reach that point where that's the only viable option no matter what the cost is both financial and emotional.\"\nThere's no doubt there would be costs, and lots of details to sort out if Alberta were to separate (with Saskatchewan and others or not). Trade deals, landlocking the province's resources, First Nations land, Crown land, the province's share of the federal debt, and, and, and, and, and.\u00a0\nStill, Hill and others like him think despite the \"myriad hurdles, challenges and difficulties\" involved in separation, it's the only choice.\u00a0\nHe also thinks there will be enough support, if the discussion takes place in a meaningful way, for a referendum to pass.\u00a0\nThe numbers, so far, don't support his claim.\u00a0\nJust prior to the election, polling firm ThinkHQ conducted a survey\u00a0on separatist sentiment in Alberta.\u00a0\nIt found 23 per cent of Albertans would vote to secede from Canada \u2014 a number that dropped to 16 per cent in Edmonton.\u00a0\nThat's despite 71 per cent of respondents saying they believe the current federal government has hurt the province.\u00a0\nThe poll was conducted online using a random stratified sample of panellists between Oct. 4 and 7.\u00a0The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of this size is plus or minus 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.\nIn many ways, that anger is manifesting in online memes and angry Twitter tirades, but the real test of a movement's strength is whether it can transform that online push into real-life action (or prove the proponents are real-life people).\u00a0\nTo that end, the Wexit movement is planning to host rallies next month in Red Deer, Edmonton and Calgary. CBC News reached out to Wexit leader Peter Downing but did not hear back.\u00a0\nHill doesn't think the result would be the same after Trudeau's re-election, and ThinkHQ warned another Trudeau victory could exacerbate feelings of alienation.\u00a0\nBut pollster Janet Brown, who was not involved with ThinkHQs poll, thinks the separatist sentiment is overplayed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Well, I think the frustration is real and the sense of alienation is real. I don't know that there's too many Albertans who really are looking at separatism as a real sort of tangible sensible idea,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"But I think when people talk about separation, it's not because they actually want to separate, it's just an expression of frustration.\"\nBrown says Kenney has no choice but to acknowledge the anger in the province\nSome muse that Alberta should follow the same path as Quebec, stoking nationalism and watching threats of separatism ebb and flow in order to get more out of Confederation, but there's no guarantee that works\u00a0or can be contained.\nThe dust is still settling from a bellicose federal campaign that saw Kenney stumping for the losing Conservatives.\u00a0\nRegional wounds are real, particularly in Quebec with its resurgent Bloc Quebecois, in Alberta and in Saskatchewan.\nThere's still a Trudeau in office, which for people like Hill is a problem in and of itself. And despite the highest wages in the country and a healthy GDP, Alberta still feels left behind and unable to get its main product to market.\u00a0\nProportional representation would even out some of the regional voting blocks, but that's not on the table since Trudeau trampled on the promise of electoral reform after his first election win in 2015.\nUniversity of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe suggests a focus on removing internal trade barriers, restrictions on labour mobility within Canada and improving federal transfer payments would help heal regional divides.\u00a0\nIn a recent column for CBC News, he noted a recent Environics poll found 71 per cent of Albertans feel the province is not treated with the respect it deserves in Canada.\u00a0\nAnd at least there are conversations taking place.\u00a0\n\"The good news is that\u00a0\u2026 there was sort of an opening between the feds and the provincial government,\" said Solberg.\u00a0\n\"And maybe an openness to work together to try and address some of the economic problems that Albertans are concerned about.\"\nIt won't be enough to quell feelings of western alienation. Short of a massive transfer of population out of Ontario and into Alberta, it's hard to see what would. Senate reform, maybe?\nWestern rage seems embedded in Confederation, but the caution is it's now tinged with a contemporary, digitally amplified populism.\u00a0\n\"So what's underlying the anger? It's fear and it's anxiety, and when people are sort of backed into a corner, when they feel their livelihoods are at stake, when they feel their future's at stake, I mean they don't always act in rational ways,\" said Brown.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"And you just have to look at what's happening in Britain right now with Brexit. You know, people who don't take this Wexit thing seriously\u00a0do so at their peril. I'm not saying we're going down the road of Britain, but you just can't count on the idea that people are going to back away from this idea just because it doesn't make sense to the premier.\"\n"}, {"author": "Kathleen Harris", "title": "Trudeau unveils $82B COVID-19 emergency response package for Canadians, businesses", "description": "PM says 'extraordinary' measures include tax deferrals, wage subsidies for small businesses", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/economic-aid-package-coronavirus-1.5501037", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5499815.1584403503!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/prime-minister-trudeau-coronavirus.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 18, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-19T11:34:53.717Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a massive $82-billion aid package to help Canadians and businesses cope with the\u00a0global COVID-19 pandemic, including income supports,\u00a0wage subsidies and tax deferrals.\nThe package includes $27 billion in\u00a0direct supports and another $55 billion to help business liquidity through\u00a0tax deferrals.\nCombined, the package represents more than three per cent of Canada's GDP.\u00a0Trudeau said the deep spending and delayed federal revenue will not drive the country into recession, insisting \"prudent\" decisions made over the last five years have put Canada on a strong economic footing to weather the crisis.\n\"We will be able to make sure our economy gets back up to speed very quickly,\" he said.\nParliament could be recalled as early as next week to pass\u00a0legislation to bring in the fiscal measures.\nThe supports aim to help\u00a0Canadians pay for rent and groceries, to help businesses continue to meet payroll and pay bills, and to stabilize the economy.

They are already having an effect on activity levels and the flow of cities, writes CBC's Andre Mayer, while planners, architects and designers are seeing changes both in Canada and around the world that could become permanent.\nEvery major calamity, from the 19th-century cholera outbreaks to the 2013 floods in Calgary, has provided valuable lessons in better city-building, said John Brown, dean of the school of architecture, planning and landscape at the University of Calgary. But COVID-19 poses a unique challenge. Ensuring people have access to transit, shopping amenities and fresh air, all while maintaining a two-metre distance, is difficult in high-density areas.\nAs a result of our collective self-isolation, there are fewer cars on the road. At the same time, people are seeking respite outdoors by walking. But it is increasingly challenging to maintain a respectful distance on sidewalks without veering into traffic. Some municipalities are taking bold action to address this. Last week, the Italian city of Milan announced a plan to transform 35 kilometres of streets to expand cycling and walking space. In reducing car capacity, it will have the dual effect of providing a safe outlet for walkers and reducing air pollution. Berlin, Budapest and Mexico City are just some of the cities proposing similar measures.\nPublic transit is also a crucial element of any cityscape, as many people can't rely on a car to get around. Most cities are reporting a drop in public transit use during the pandemic, and it's likely to remain lower than usual in the short term, said Ahsan Habib, director of the school of planning at Dalhousie University. During the pandemic, U.S. cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and Denver have made several adjustments to their transit systems, including suspending fares and allowing rear-door boarding. Habib said ultimately, cities must invest in ways to make buses and streetcars less prone to crowding.\nThe pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of letting a large part of the labour force work from home. While not everyone can telecommute, enough people are able to do so that it could reduce demand for physical offices, which could in turn affect the proliferation of highrise buildings. Brown, who also runs a Calgary-based architecture firm called Housebrand, said telecommuting may also have an impact on the layout of homes, as residents seek to carve out discrete corners in even the tiniest condo suite to have a private Zoom meeting.\nClick below to watch more from The National\nCanada is officially in a recession because of the pandemic, C.D. Howe says\nCanada is officially in a recession that's been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the C.D. Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council declared today. The council, which monitors recessions and recoveries in Canada, said the economy peaked in February, just before drastic measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus were implemented across the country.\nThere are no hard and fast rules for declaring a recession, although one rule of thumb used by economists is that an economy is probably in one if it has shrunk for two three-month periods in a row. The council rejects the \"two quarters\" rule and instead defines a recession as a \"pronounced, persistent and pervasive decline in aggregate economic activity\" based largely on GDP and the job market.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is still less than two months old in Canada, but the council said that the slowdown is already so swift and deep that it's safe to declare a recession already. In the council's view, this is the first recession Canada has seen since the financial crisis that began in 2008 \u2014 and the data suggests this one is on track to be quite a bit worse than that one. While the decline in March was record-setting, economists expect the data for April will show an even bigger drop, with the measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus in place for the entire month.\nRead more about Canada's economic situation \nOntario allows some businesses to reopen Monday, while Alberta's plan begins Saturday\nThe Ontario government announced today that it's allowing a limited number of businesses to reopen, as long as they meet \"strict public health measures.\" Lawn care and landscaping services, garden centres and nurseries with curbside pickup, community gardens, automatic and self-serve car washes, auto dealers, and some construction projects will be allowed to open on Monday, with specific rules around how they can operate.\n\"Today's news shows us if we stay the course, if we stay vigilant and take the measured approach, we can keep moving in the right direction,\" Premier Doug Ford said at a news briefing. In Alberta, meanwhile, Premier Jason Kenney detailed his government's plan for a multi-stage relaunch that will depend on the province's continued ability to control the spread of the coronavirus and curb the number of COVID-19 patients who need hospital care.\nThe first step in Alberta's plan to reopen its economy will emphasize outdoor activities, with golf courses to open Saturday, followed by shops, bars and restaurants by mid-May. Parts of the gradual relaunch plan, which Kenney announced Thursday, will begin Monday with the resumption of some non-urgent surgeries and office reopenings for dentists, physiotherapists and other professionals. Schools will remain closed until the end of the academic year, with instruction continuing online, but Kenney said the province is in discussions with school boards \"about allowing some limited reopening on a trial basis\" for summer classes and specialized programs.\nRead more about what's happening across Canada \nAir Canada anticipates return of worldwide air travel by Christmas\nAn Air Canada vice-president suggested that by the time winter holidays roll around again, Canadians will be able to board his company's planes and fly almost anywhere in the world. But Tim Strauss said he knows that one of the biggest tasks involved in bringing air travel back to life after pandemic restrictions lift will be convincing the public it's safe to fly.\nThe airline industry has been hammered by the pandemic. Some Canadian airlines have stopped flying entirely while others, including Air Canada, have scaled back more than 90 per cent because of the dramatic drop in demand. At a virtual Canadian Club Toronto event today, executives at several major airlines talked about what the North American airline industry could look like post-pandemic. Air Canada, Sunwing and American Airlines said corporate conversations about post-pandemic operations are focused on making sure planes are kept clean. Some airlines are changing how often they sanitize their planes and are even considering changes to how air is circulated in passenger cabins.\nTransport Canada has made it mandatory for all passengers to wear masks while on board and in airports when they cannot physically distance two metres from others. While Air Canada predicts better times for the industry by Christmas, airline analyst Helane Becker points out that other countries will need to lift their pandemic restrictions and reopen their economies first in order to convince people to travel. \"We need to get all these governments on the same page to kind of open things up. Everyone wants it to be done safely because no one wants the recurrence of cases,\" Becker said\nRead more about the pandemic's impact on air travel \nIs Canada looking into using remdesivir?\nCBC News readers, viewers and listeners have sent in countless questions about the COVID-19 pandemic, including this one. If you have a question of your own, reach out at covid@cbc.ca.\nAs for the issue at hand: The U.S. is fast-tracking approval of the antiviral drug remdesivir to help treat COVID-19. Top U.S. health official Dr. Anthony Fauci said it has a \"clear cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,\" after favourable results of a clinical trial.\nRemdesivir, which impairs the coronavirus's ability to replicate, was initially used to treat Ebola, but is not officially approved for use in Canada. Yet, some hospitals are getting access to it through \"individual compassionate use.\"\nWhat does this mean? Health Canada has a program that allows particular, unapproved drugs to be used in unique cases. Health Canada said the maker of remdesivir, Gilead, is transitioning to this \"provision of emergency access\" but can no longer accept more requests because of \"an overwhelming demand.\" In an email to CBC News, Gilead said it is ramping up production but did not specify how much remdesivir would be sent to Canada.\nAlberta artist offers daily, online painting class for kids\nCochrane, Alta., artist MJ Stead wanted to do what she could during the pandemic to help keep children occupied and inspired.\nShe created a Facebook group called Paint with MJ and every weekday, Stead does a free, hour-long, Facebook Live painting class for kids. Stead expected 20 to 30 kids to sign up for the live painting class, but now her group has more than 1,500 members from all over the country \u2014 and many families have more than one child participating.\nStead was inspired after painting helped her get through \"a nasty cancer.\" Two years ago, Stead was diagnosed with breast cancer, which involved chemo, radiation and a double mastectomy. Stead said art got her through the treatments; when she couldn't get off the sofa, she challenged herself to do a painting a day for 100 days.\n\"My breast cancer and my treatment brought me to a place where everybody else is right now \u2014 a place of uncertainty, of being isolated. I had no immune system,\" she said. \"When school was cancelled, I knew how everybody was going to feel and that prompted me to get moving.\"\nRead the full story about the art classes \nSend us your questions\nStill looking for more information on the outbreak?

Reporters were free to ask whatever they wanted, though there was no opportunity for follow-up questions.\nOverall, Cong presented an impression of continuity with the previous ambassador, Lu Shaye \u2014 and offered no indication of movement in Beijing's\u00a0position on either the two Canadians detained in China or the dramatic situation in Hong Kong.\nCong\u00a0began his remarks by talking about the economic advances China has made over seven decades of Communist Party rule. He described China as the main motor of growth in the world's GDP\u00a0and the nation that has lifted the largest number of people out of poverty.\nHe also talked about China's commitment to be more open to the world\u00a0\u2014 although he described that openness in strictly economic and business terms.\nHe spoke about China's desire to have friendly relations with other countries, including Canada, but stressed that those relations would have to be conditioned on \"mutual respect\" and \"equality\" among nations.\n\"We believe that the countries should live in harmony, and treat each other as equals in this community of the world, just as President Xi Jinping has been pointing out,\" he said.\nCBC News asked Cong about China's treatment of Canadian detainees Michael\u00a0Spavor and Michael\u00a0Kovrig, who are being held in solitary confinement while\u00a0Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou\u00a0\u2014 taken into custody by the RCMP on an American warrant\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is able to spend her pre-trial period in one of her two Vancouver homes.\n\"We have always stressed that (the Meng case) is by no means a purely judicial case,\" said the ambassador, \"but instead a very serious political incident plotted by the United States.\n\"And for Canada, it has abused its treaty of extradition between Canada and the United States, and arbitrarily detained [Meng Wanzhou], which violates her legitimate rights.\"\nCong said that Kovrig and Spavor were \"engaged in suspected activities endangering national security of China. But there is nothing like arbitrary detention.\n\"These two cases they are very much different in nature. Meng Wanzhou's case is arbitrary detention by the Canadian side. For those two Canadian citizens there is no arbitrary arrest at all. So that's my answer.\"\nAsked about the possibility that China might be open to a dialogue with the Hong Kong protest movement, Cong replied that the protesters were \"violent and radical criminals.\"\n\"Supporting the Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing the law, and supporting the Hong Kong judiciary in bringing those criminals to justice according to law, that's our position. And we are determined to safeguard our national sovereignty, our core interests, our security and development interests, and we are determined to oppose any foreign intervention.\"\nCong said that any voices in Canada calling on Beijing to respect the principle of \"one country, two systems\" in Hong Kong are misguided, insisting China has respected that commitment since 1997 and continues to do so.\nAnd he was sharply critical of legislation that passed almost unanimously through the U.S. Congress yesterday, setting up potential sanctions for Chinese officials involved in suppressing Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.\nThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, if signed into law by President Trump, would also require the State Department to certify annually that Beijing is still respecting its commitment to the \"one country, two systems\" principles under which the territory returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.\nCong warned that Canada would be unwise\u00a0to follow the U.S. example.\n\"If somebody here is really trying to push the decision to have this kind of law like that in the United States, it's very dangerous, we would certainly be firmly opposed to that,\" he said.\u00a0\"And if anything happens like this, we would suddenly have very bad damage to our bilateral relationship. And that's not in the interests of Canada.\"\nWatch: China's new ambassador warns Canada against intervention on Hong Kong\nThis morning, President Donald Trump told the Fox News show Fox & Friends that he was considering vetoing the U.S. legislation.\n\"We have to stand with Hong Kong,\" the president said, \"but I'm also standing with President Xi. He's a friend of mine. He's an incredible guy, but we have to stand \u2026 I'd like to see them work it out, okay?\"\u00a0\nTrump has until the end of the month to decide whether he will sign the bill, but the overwhelming strength of the bill's majorities in both houses suggests that any presidential veto probably would be blocked.\nNo such law is currently under consideration in Canada, but Canada already has a law \u2014 the Magnitsky Act \u2014 that could be used to sanction Chinese officials.\nThe Hong Kong democracy bill was one of two setbacks China suffered this week in the United States.\nToday, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted unanimously to ban companies that use equipment and services from either Huawei or Chinese tech company ZTE from accessing U.S. government broadband subsidies.\nThough not strictly speaking a ban, the move eliminates any cost advantages the Chinese firms may have enjoyed in the U.S., making it very difficult for them to sell into that market.\n\"They are mobilizing their national resources to try to cover, to contain the obvious development [of Chinese technology], and its intention actually is trying to pin down our high tech industry,\" said Cong.\n\"As you can see, some senior officials of the United States, wherever they travel they will say something very negative\u00a0against Huawei, and claiming Huawei is posing a security threat to the country they are visiting without providing any evidence.\"\n\"Actually it's those countries which have the PRISM program who have used these kinds of things to spy and have this surveillance, large-scale impact on foreign countries and companies.\"\nPRISM is the code name of a U.S. surveillance program, exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden, that conducted massive eavesdropping operations in foreign countries.\nCong suggested foreign countries would be safer installing Chinese equipment.\u00a0\n\"There's nothing like back door devices being installed by Huawei,\" said the ambassador. \"So that's a groundless accusation.\n\"So we do hope that the Canadian side will provide a fair, just and a non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies.\"\nCong closed his remarks with what sounded like a message for the new Trudeau government.\nTalking about the past year of \"twists and turns, even setbacks\" in the relationship, Cong said \"we do hope that the Canadian side will reflect on what has happened and take concrete measures to push our relationship back to the normal track. So that's the task for the government.\n\"And we do hope that those important people in the new cabinet will play an active role in making sure that relations of our two countries return to their normal track on the basis of mutual respect and equality.\"\nIn our upcoming CBC News series, China's Power, we examine Beijing's expanding circles of influence both around the world and here at home \u2014 watch starting Monday night\u00a0on the National at 10 p.m. on CBC TV and CBC Gem.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Teamsters point finger at CN Rail over propane shortage from strike", "description": "Garneau says train with propane heading to Quebec, repeats support for collective bargaining", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/teamsters-cdn-strike-1.5369359", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5370553.1574462020!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cn-rail-strike-20191122.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 22, 2019 11:45 AM ET", "2019-11-22T22:34:23.476Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The union representing striking Canadian National Railway workers said early Friday there was \"no substantive progress\" in talks aimed at ending the dispute, and they hit back at what they characterized as a \"fabricated\" narrative of a propane shortage that has emerged through politician statements and media reports.\nAs the strike entered its fourth day, the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) said there are still hundreds of employees on the job operating trains, and that what those trains carry is a decision made by CN.\nLyndon Isaak, TCRC\u00a0president, speculated that the company may be throttling the supply of propane.\n\"CN is far from operating at full capacity, but we believe there are enough trains going around to allow the company to supply propane to Ontario and Quebec,\" said Isaak. \"The question is whether CN refuses to transport propane to create a crisis and force a special back-to-work law.\"\nCN\u00a0said in a statement it was doing the best it can given the limited resources in a strike scenario.\n\"CN has a small pool of qualified managers that only allows the company to operate at approximately 10 per cent of normal service across its extensive 22,000-kilometre-long Canadian network safely,\" the corporation said. \"Currently, very limited amounts of various commodities are moving across the country. This includes container traffic to keep Canada's ports fluid to be able to return to normal operations after the strike.\"\nAcross the country, politicians and industry leaders have raised the prospect of critical shortages resulting from a prolonged strike that would impact a number of economic sectors.\nThe governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan have called on Ottawa to intervene. Quebec, which sees 85 per cent of its propane supply transported by rail, has also done so.\nAt least for the time being, the federal government is not considering such action.\nTransport Minister Marc Garneau said Friday that\u00a0a train has left Edmonton with 100 propane cars, but will take some time to get to Quebec, and that he was told there are some trucks with propane that could also come from Sarnia, Ont.\n\"We want to resolve this as quickly as possible,\" Garneau said, reiterating his statement\u00a0 from the previous day that the collective bargaining process is the best way forward.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford appeared to agree with Garneau's view on Friday after meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\"Calling back the legislature is one thing. But it doesn't happen right way,\" said Ford.\nFord, however, agreed it was a \"critical time right now\" with respect to propane supply, citing shortages in the northern and rural areas of his province.\nJonatan Julien, Quebec's national resources minister, gave an update on the province's status on Friday.\nHe said the province has a current supply of six million litres of propane, with another 14 million from various sources expected soon. By rationing supply, Julien said Quebec can \"get to the end of next week.\"\n\"We are looking at all solutions, but if it continues, things will get more complicated to provide propane in Quebec,\" he said.\nNegotiations between CN Rail and the union are continuing with the help of a federal mediator, but the Teamsters have rejected CN's call to enter a process of binding arbitration.\nIndustry groups representing petroleum producers, and the chemistry, mining and propane industries, are among those expressing concern about the impact of a strike, especially if it drags on. It is estimated that 60 per cent of crude-by-rail exports in Canada are transported by the Montreal-based company.\nHours-long delays have been reported by truckers in Sarnia, Ont., the end point of propane shipped from Western Canada by pipeline, where it is then transported\u00a0by truck or rail.\nThe Canadian Propane Association has urged the federal government to take \"whatever action is necessary\" to ensure transportation of propane is not interrupted.\nNathalie Saint-Pierre, president and executive director of the association, noted that in a 2007 strike, CN Rail had a contingency plan with reduced delivery to ensure propane was available in Quebec.\nPropane distributors are adjusting as a result of the strike. Ian Wilson, the president of Wilsons Heating in Nova Scotia, said his company is exploring bringing propane in by truck, a more expensive proposition.\nWilson said his company is prioritizing customers who use propane for heating, and in some cases are making smaller deliveries to customers than would normally be the case.\nThe Grain Farmers of Ontario is\u00a0among the groups concerned about the impact on the agricultural industry in what has described as a challenging growing season.\nFarmers need propane for grain dryers, among other uses, and a prolonged strike's impacts \"might be downloaded to the consumer at a certain point,\" according to Grain Farmers chair Markus Haerle.\n\"Is it going to be right away? I doubt it will be. But there will be a financial impact to the consumer,\" said Haerle.\nQuebec farmer Dominique Leroux described the feeling as \"desperation,\" as a late growing season has meant hectares\u00a0of crops have yet to be harvested and dried.\nAvery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, said Friday they were monitoring developments and if necessary would adjust its fourth-quarter forecast for the Canadian economy, in which projections for growth were already expected to be modest.\n\"Should this strike drag on, it would clearly be disruptive to the Canadian economy and to the company in question, both due to the direct reduction in the transportation services component of GDP,\u00a0the resulting backup in unshipped inventories, and\u00a0the further spillover from that into production\u00a0in affected sectors,\" Shenfeld said via email.\nA five-day strike could cost the Canadian economy between $800 million and $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, TD Bank's senior economist, Brian DePratto, told Reuters.\nAbout 3,200 conductors, train personnel and yard workers are on strike.\nThe workers, who have been without a contract since July 23, say they're concerned about long hours, fatigue and what they consider dangerous working conditions. Wages are not among the critical areas of dispute.\nThe union has said passenger rail services in the country's three biggest cities would not be affected by the strike.\nThe strike went into effect days after CN confirmed it would be cutting jobs in response to a weakening North American economy depressing demand for railroaded transportation, though it did not specify how many workers would be affected.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "How will Scheer's views on abortion and same-sex marriage impact the Conservatives?", "description": "The Canada Votes newsletter is your weekly tip-sheet as we count down to Oct. 21.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-votes-newsletter-issue21-andrew-scheer-abortion-lgbt-rights-1.5266068", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5266110.1567189594!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/party-leaders-composite.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 01, 2019 4:00 PM ET", "2019-09-01T20:00:00.141Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Vassy Kapelos, host of Power & Politics\nGood question. Maybe there's a better way to ask it: will it help the Liberals?\nThis week wasn't a great one for federal Conservatives. They were neck and neck with the Liberals in the polls and coming off some good weeks, with the release of the ethics commissioners' report. But then the Liberals went on the attack - and it stuck. Nobody's talking about Mario Dion today.\nThe Liberals changed the channel by reviving a 2005 video of Scheer speaking out against same-sex marriage. As the Conservatives pointed out at the time, Scheer wasn't alone in his opposition to same-sex marriage at the time; even Ralph Goodale, the Liberal minister who tweeted out the 2005 video, voted to endorse the traditional man-woman version of marriage in 1999.\n\"My views have evolved,\" Goodale says today. Have Scheer's views changed?\nScheer was asked that question multiple times last week, in a variety of ways. At no point did he offer a clear answer.\nScheer did say that a Conservative government led by him would not re-open the abortion and same-sex marriage debates, and that while backbench Conservative MPs are free to follow their individual consciences, he would \"oppose measures to reopen\" these debates and is \"confident\" the caucus \"understands that.\"\nBut when it came to Scheer explaining what he actually thinks \u2014\u00a0personally, even some of his supporters found his words a little wishy-washy.\n\"On the issue of same-sex marriage, I think what would have helped would have been to hear him say that his own personal views had evolved since 2005, much as (Alberta Premier) Jason Kenney did during the Alberta provincial campaign. He didn't say that,\" Rachel Curran, former director of policy to Stephen Harper, told me on Power & Politics.\nAs Curran pointed out, Liberals likely will be talking about this day in and day out during the campaign (and in the pseudo-campaign period we're in right now).\nWill it work?\nTo answer that question, it helps to look at who might be motivated or affected by the aforementioned wishy-washyness.\nThe Conservatives' base, most pollsters will tell you, is rock-solid. Yes, there are a number of 'progressive' Conservatives who are unhappy with what Scheer said (or didn't say) this week. That's not likely to be enough to push them over to a new party - though it could leave many of them less than motivated to get out and vote.\nBut they're not the targets for this strategy. Think about the battle for the \"progressive\" vote shaping up now between the Liberals, NDP and Greens. Think of the bloc of those voters who came out for the Liberals in the last election. They might be disappointed by the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, or by Justin Trudeau breaking his promise on electoral reform.\nThe Liberals might be worried about those voters throwing their support behind the NDP and Greens. They're probably more worried about them staying home on election day. What might motivate those voters to get out and cast ballots? A desire to keep Scheer out of office. Why might they want to do that? If they decide his views \u2014\u00a0even his personal ones\u00a0\u2014\u00a0aren't aligned with theirs.\nDon't take my word for it. I was told explicitly by Liberal cabinet ministers last month that this is the strategy, particularly in Quebec: to associate Scheer with austerity in voters' minds while pulling on any dangling social conservative threads.\nSome Conservatives recently pointed out that, in Alberta's recent election, the NDP tried to make an issue of Jason Kenney's social conservatism and still lost. Others say the provincial context in that election \u2014\u00a0especially the state of the provincial economy in Alberta - swamped any concerns about social conservatism.\nChristian Bourque of the Leger polling firm told me the Liberals' strategy could work in Quebec.\n\"One way it may be effective in Quebec is the fact that the pool of social conservatives in the province is very small,\" he said.\n\"So I believe what they're trying to do here is to try to send the message that we are here to reduce that level of support for the Conservatives to that smaller social conservative circle\"\nShachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute cautioned that the Liberals' will still have to offer their base and progressive voters something more in order to motivate them to show up and vote.\n\"Obviously some of these things are going to dominate campaigns on certain days of certain weeks,\" Kurl said.\n\"But as we get down to the real essence of a campaign period once that writ is dropped, I think the Liberals are really going to have to emphasize their track record on things like carbon taxation to speak to those left-of-centre voters.\"\nAt the end of the day, those issues and others (climate, the economy, the cost of living) will all move votes.

Provincial elections in Manitoba haven't exactly been harbingers of federal election outcomes \u2014 not since 1988 has the federal party that won the most votes in Manitoba shared the same political hue as the provincial government.\nBut there's good reason to wonder what's going to happen in the federal election in Manitoba: the province is setting up to be surprisingly competitive this fall.\nPerhaps as many as half of Manitoba's 14 federal seats could change hands. The New Democrats will be playing defence in the two seats they hold \u2014 one in the north, one in Winnipeg \u2014 while the Liberals will be hard-pressed to replicate the big numbers they put up in Manitoba four years ago.\nPolls suggest the Liberals have lost a lot of support throughout the province. After taking Winnipeg by a margin of about 24 percentage points over the Conservatives, the Poll Tracker estimates the Liberals to be trailing by about three points in the city today.\nThat means the Conservatives are targeting Liberal seats like St. Boniface\u2013St. Vital, Winnipeg South, Charleswood\u2013St. James\u2013Assiniboia\u2013Headingley and Kildonan\u2013St. Paul.\nThose could prove to be important battlegrounds. Not every seat in Manitoba will be competitive, so realistically the Liberals and Conservatives might be fighting over just four seats in the Winnipeg suburbs.\nBut that's nearly half the margin separating the two parties in the Poll Tracker's seat projection \u2014 so those four seats could loom large on election night.\nTap here to go to the full poll tracker \nWe want to know what YOU want to know.\u00a0\nNorbert Klaue asks: What is the most recent amount of our national debt and how did it change over the last years?\nShort answer: It's increased about nine per cent in the last few years.\u00a0\nThe federal debt was $671.3 billion\u00a0at the end of the 2017-2018 fiscal year\u00a0(so, March of last year).\u00a0 Back in March 2016,\u00a0it was $616 billion.\nHowever, it's about the same debt-to-GDP ratio\u00a0\u2060\u2014\u00a031.1\u00a0per cent in 2016, versus 31.3 per cent last year.\nThis year's\u00a0budget\u00a0forecasted that the ratio will decline every year, reaching 28.9\u00a0per cent by 2024 (when the debt is projected to be $766.1\u00a0billion). Keep in mind: Canada already has one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in the G7.\u00a0\nLet's take a look at the deficit.\u00a0\nA quick refresher: The federal debt is all the accumulated deficits, minus the surpluses, at the federal level (the overall national debt is significantly higher when provincial deficits are added).\u00a0A deficit is when Ottawa spends more revenue than they bring in over a specific time period\u00a0\u2060\u2014\u00a0usually a fiscal year.\nAs you'll likely remember\u00a0\u2060\u2014\u00a0and as the Conservatives have been trying to remind Canadians\u00a0\u2060\u2014\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a balanced budget while on the campaign trail in 2015. He backed down from that promise in early 2016.\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer also made an ambitious promise in 2017 that he would balance the books in two years. This May, he stepped back from that pledge, increasing the timeline to\u00a0five\u00a0years.\nNow to the numbers.\nThe deficit this year is expected to be around $15.7 billion,\u00a0increasing to $22.3 billion by 2021. After that, it's set to decline pretty significantly.\nThe last year that Stephen Harper was in office, the government posted\u00a0a surplus\u00a0of $1.9 billion.\u00a0\nBut right after the 2015 election, a report from the Parliamentary Budget Officer showed things weren't actually so\u00a0rosy. He predicted\u00a0deficits averaging $4.3 billion a year for five years\u00a0if Harper had won another mandate and continued on the same fiscal track.\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0Elise von Scheel, Parliamentary bureau reporter\nHave a question about the October election?

Maybe there's a better way to ask it: will it help the Liberals?\nThis week wasn't a great one for federal Conservatives. They were neck and neck with the Liberals in the polls and coming off some good weeks, with the release of the ethics commissioners' report. But then the Liberals went on the attack - and it stuck. Nobody's talking about Mario Dion today.\nThe Liberals changed the channel by reviving a 2005 video of Scheer speaking out against same-sex marriage. As the Conservatives pointed out at the time, Scheer wasn't alone in his opposition to same-sex marriage at the time; even Ralph Goodale, the Liberal minister who tweeted out the 2005 video, voted to endorse the traditional man-woman version of marriage in 1999.\n\"My views have evolved,\" Goodale says today. Have Scheer's views changed?\nScheer was asked that question multiple times last week, in a variety of ways. At no point did he offer a clear answer.\nScheer did say that a Conservative government led by him would not re-open the abortion and same-sex marriage debates, and that while backbench Conservative MPs are free to follow their individual consciences, he would \"oppose measures to reopen\" these debates and is \"confident\" the caucus \"understands that.\"\nBut when it came to Scheer explaining what he actually thinks \u2014\u00a0personally, even some of his supporters found his words a little wishy-washy.\n\"On the issue of same-sex marriage, I think what would have helped would have been to hear him say that his own personal views had evolved since 2005, much as (Alberta Premier) Jason Kenney did during the Alberta provincial campaign. He didn't say that,\" Rachel Curran, former director of policy to Stephen Harper, told me on Power & Politics.\nAs Curran pointed out, Liberals likely will be talking about this day in and day out during the campaign (and in the pseudo-campaign period we're in right now).\nWill it work?\nTo answer that question, it helps to look at who might be motivated or affected by the aforementioned wishy-washyness.\nThe Conservatives' base, most pollsters will tell you, is rock-solid. Yes, there are a number of 'progressive' Conservatives who are unhappy with what Scheer said (or didn't say) this week. That's not likely to be enough to push them over to a new party - though it could leave many of them less than motivated to get out and vote.\nBut they're not the targets for this strategy. Think about the battle for the \"progressive\" vote shaping up now between the Liberals, NDP and Greens. Think of the bloc of those voters who came out for the Liberals in the last election. They might be disappointed by the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, or by Justin Trudeau breaking his promise on electoral reform.\nThe Liberals might be worried about those voters throwing their support behind the NDP and Greens. They're probably more worried about them staying home on election day. What might motivate those voters to get out and cast ballots? A desire to keep Scheer out of office. Why might they want to do that? If they decide his views \u2014\u00a0even his personal ones\u00a0\u2014\u00a0aren't aligned with theirs.\nDon't take my word for it. I was told explicitly by Liberal cabinet ministers last month that this is the strategy, particularly in Quebec: to associate Scheer with austerity in voters' minds while pulling on any dangling social conservative threads.\nSome Conservatives recently pointed out that, in Alberta's recent election, the NDP tried to make an issue of Jason Kenney's social conservatism and still lost. Others say the provincial context in that election \u2014\u00a0especially the state of the provincial economy in Alberta - swamped any concerns about social conservatism.\nChristian Bourque of the Leger polling firm told me the Liberals' strategy could work in Quebec.\n\"One way it may be effective in Quebec is the fact that the pool of social conservatives in the province is very small,\" he said.\n\"So I believe what they're trying to do here is to try to send the message that we are here to reduce that level of support for the Conservatives to that smaller social conservative circle\"\nShachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute cautioned that the Liberals' will still have to offer their base and progressive voters something more in order to motivate them to show up and vote.\n\"Obviously some of these things are going to dominate campaigns on certain days of certain weeks,\" Kurl said.\n\"But as we get down to the real essence of a campaign period once that writ is dropped, I think the Liberals are really going to have to emphasize their track record on things like carbon taxation to speak to those left-of-centre voters.\"\nAt the end of the day, those issues and others (climate, the economy, the cost of living) will all move votes. But the 'who' matters as much as the 'what': people want to know who their leaders are and what they stand for. And while everyone is entitled to their own views and beliefs, when it comes to politicians campaigning for high office, voters are entitled to know what those views are.\nVassy Kapelos is host of Power & Politics, weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on CBC News Network.\nThe Power & Politics Power Panelists on where the big parties will be focused this week\nAmanda Alvaro\u00a0 president and co-founder of Pomp & Circumstance The Liberals will continue to push Andrew Scheer to clarify his murky response on questions about a woman's right to choose and equal marriage rights.

Of the 48 seats in Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Conservatives won all but one.\nIn response, the Premier of Saskatchewan, Scott Moe, wasted no time in calling for \"a new deal with Canada.\" In an open letter, he makes three demands:\nCancel the federal carbon tax.\nCommit to negotiate a new equalization formula that is fair to Saskatchewan and Alberta.\nCommit to develop a plan to ensure Saskatchewan and Alberta can get our exports to international markets. This means pipelines.\nIn voicing these frustrations, the premier is not alone.\nRegional alienation \u2014 primarily in the West \u2014 is on the rise. In recent polling from Environics, 45 per cent of Canadians feel their province isn't \"treated with the respect it deserves in Canada.\" In Alberta, this sentiment is shared by a staggering 71 per cent.\nBut it's hard to think of more divisive policies to focus on if the goal is to strengthen national unity.\nOf course disagreement and debate is natural. And federal policies will always affect different regions differently. Such disagreements, though, should be seen for the family squabbles that they are. Important to hash out, but not at the expense of the whole.\nProvinces don't need a \"new deal with\u00a0Canada,\"\u00a0but the federal government may need a new deal for Canada.\nInstead of the three demands laid out by Premier Moe, consider three others: improve internal trade, ease labour mobility, and expand federal transfers to better protect provinces in need.\nWith concrete improvements in these areas, Canada can kill two birds with one stone: improve national unity and increase prosperity at the same time.\u00a0\nMuch has been written about the damaging effects of barriers to inter-provincial trade (see, for example, the recent report from the Senate of Canada.)\nI won't rehash that, but instead I'll make another point: if our trade linkages were stronger, economic shocks to one province (both good and bad) would spread to other provinces.\nBusinesses in Alberta buy from suppliers in Ontario and Quebec. And businesses in Quebec buy from suppliers in British Columbia and Newfoundland. Provinces currently trade more than $370 billion per year with each other. That's about 18 per cent of total GDP in the country.\nThese linkages bind economies together, but trade barriers in Canada keep these linkages weaker than they could be.\nThose inter-provincial trade numbers could be larger. Much larger.\nRecently published analysis by the IMF (I was a member of the research team)\u00a0suggests that if internal barriers to trade between provinces were eliminated, total trade volumes would increase by about $300 billion per year.\u00a0\nWith a near doubling of trade between Canadians in one province and suppliers in another, we could more clearly see how our own success is tied to the success of fellow Canadians elsewhere.\nMoving goods and services across provinces is one way to bind economies together. Moving people is another.\u00a0\nIn Newfoundland and Labrador, for example, workers earned roughly $1.1 billion in 2014 from jobs in other provinces. That's nearly 10 per cent of total labour earnings for\u00a0the entire province.\nIn Quebec, $5.2 billion is earned by work in other provinces. In Ontario and B.C., that amount is roughly $4 billion.\nNationally, more than $21 billion was earned by nearly half a million workers who lived in one province\u00a0but worked in another in 2014. And one-third of them chose to work in Alberta.\nBut policies make this type of work unnecessarily hard.\nIf you are certified to work in one province, you aren't necessarily allowed to work in another. If these restrictions were eased, labour could flow more freely. Opportunities in one region would therefore have a better chance of benefiting others.\nIt would bring Canada's extended family closer together.\u00a0\nFinally, when talking about equalization reform, Moe is missing the lowest-hanging fruit to both improve federal transfers and bring provinces closer together: better federal insurance for the provinces.\nFederal policy connects our provinces through myriad revenue and spending programs. These programs can be improved, starting with ways to help buffer provincial budgets when revenues suddenly drop.\nThe current \"Fiscal Stabilization Program,\"\u00a0which provides insurance to provinces in sudden need, is weak.\u00a0\nWhen oil prices fell, Alberta received only $251 million. Barely a drop in the bucket, due to a $60-per-person limit implemented in 1986 that hasn't been adjusted since.\nTo be clear, Alberta knowingly, willingly, and repeatedly takes known risks in funding public services with volatile resource revenues. This need not be insured. But even insuring declines in non-resource revenue more fully would have seen much more than the $251-million payment Alberta received.\nI estimate that if the federal stabilization program operated as it did originally in 1967, but excluded natural resources, Alberta would have qualified for roughly $2 billion in 2016.\u00a0\nHowever the program is improved (and enlarged), tighter fiscal connections between provinces will also help spread one province's gains and losses more equitably among the whole. Canadians already contribute collectively when natural disasters strike. We can similarly share in the burden of economic disasters, too.\nAt the very least, it's a conversation worth having.\nFederal policy affects different regions differently. This is unavoidable.\u00a0\nWe can debate the pros and cons of policies like C-69, C-48, equalization, or whatever else, but on their merits. There is no need to escalate the debate to inflame regional animosity.\nOur focus should be on policies that unite us, not divide us. Improved internal trade, labour mobility, infrastructure, federal transfers, and so on, can and should be higher federal priorities.\nI'm reminded of the words former prime minister John Diefenbaker spoke often on the campaign trail over 60\u00a0years ago: \"I have come to discuss with you the future of Canada \u2014 not just of this section or that \u2014 but of the nation as a whole.\"\nHe ran on a platform of \"One Country \u2014 One Policy \u2014 One Canada.\"\u00a0\nToday, we have an opportunity to do the same. To boost both national prosperity and national unity.\u00a0\nWe should look, as Diefenbaker said, to the nation as a whole.\nThis column is an opinion.

Both failed.\nThe bill could receive unanimous support in\u00a0its final votes, following an agreement Wednesday between the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland to address the Bloc's concerns about protecting Quebec's aluminum industry from offshore competition.\nIn anticipation of C-4's passage, a\u00a0Senate\u00a0trade committee has started organizing\u00a0a\u00a0pre-study of the bill.\nCanada's chief negotiator, Steve Verheul, told the committee Wednesday that officials project\u00a0gains and losses as part of their negotiation process. They\u00a0analyzed\u00a0the potential losses if the Trump administration pulled out of the 1993 agreement altogether, a threat \"we were facing at the time,\" he said.\nConservative Canada\u2013U.S. relations critic Chris Lewis questioned\u00a0the department's decision to base its comparative analysis on this withdrawal\u00a0scenario, rather than the deal Canada already has.\n\"Would it be a fair statement to say that the only way ... that\u00a0you could make ... the numbers look good, is to compare it to no deal at all?\" Lewis said.\n\"No it's not,\" Verheul said.\u00a0\"That was the reality of that path, if we had not negotiated.\"\nCommittee members asked if it would be possible to run another scenario through the model, comparing the new CUSMA with the status quo of sticking with\u00a0the original NAFTA.\nVerheul\u00a0said he did not see the sense in doing that.\nComparing new NAFTA to no-NAFTA \"sets a stunningly low bar for ascertaining whether the new NAFTA deal is positive for North American trade,\" Conservative trade critic Randy Hoback\u00a0said in a statement.\u00a0\"Almost any trade deal, no matter how unbalanced or restrictive, would be better than having nothing at all.\"\n\"For Parliamentarians to understand the impact of the new NAFTA deal on the Canadian economy and Canadian families, we must compare the new deal to the original NAFTA,\" he said.\nIt's unclear whether the trade committee will ask for more data from Global Affairs.\nWhile the Trump administration's threat to blow up NAFTA\u00a0was taken literally, another more recent threat by the U.S. to pull out of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Government Procurement was\u00a0ignored in the Global Affairs analysis.\nCanada's negotiating objective to gain more access to\u00a0American public sector contracts\u00a0was unsuccessful: CUSMA changes no procurement obligations between the two countries.\nBased on that, the department's study assumes Canadian companies can continue to access some types of U.S. government contracts under the terms of the multilateral\u00a0agreement. But that trade now appears at risk.\nConservative MP Colin Carrie accused the government of holding back information until after last fall's federal election. He said he was \"outraged\" that the committee was only given the report minutes before the start of Paquet's\u00a0testimony Wednesday morning.\nThe positive effects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Pacific Rim trade deal negotiated by the previous Conservative government, were\u00a0shared much sooner in its\u00a0process, he said.\n\"If the information is already there ... I just don't see why it isn't possible to release more information earlier on,\" said NDP MP Daniel Blaikie, who last week struck an agreement with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland\u00a0for more transparency in how\u00a0future trade deals are negotiated, in return for his party's support for C-4.\nPaquet said the department was already studying CUSMA's potential economic impacts when she joined Global Affairs in 2017, but in recent weeks they \"re-did\" their analysis, which was\u00a0only finished Tuesday evening.\nThe committee was\u00a0told\u00a0Feb.5 that the department had not modelled the new automotive chapter and was trying to figure out an analysis \"it could defend credibly\" for the deal's qualitative improvements to reduce trade barriers.\nPaquet\u00a0said she was unable to analyze the entire\u00a0agreement, because some parts aren't suited to economic modelling. Because NAFTA\u00a0already cut most tariffs to zero, this negotiation focused\u00a0on other trade barriers.\nFour parts of the deal were modelled, based on\u00a0their magnitude and feasibility: new\u00a0tariff rate quotas for supply-managed agricultural products like dairy;\u00a0revised rules of origin that\u00a0determine what North American automobiles qualify for tariff-free status;\u00a0new measures\u00a0on\u00a0data storage for financial services; and changes to the way goods are processed at the border\u00a0to facilitate trade.\nDan Ciuriak, the trade analyst who wrote the C.D. Howe\u00a0paper, said\u00a0his analysis is pretty much in line with the department's, forecasting only marginal effects.\nInu Manak, from the Washington, D.C.-based Cato Institute think tank, said the Canadian government's analysis was far more modest than the optimistic\u00a0figures\u00a0presented to the U.S. Congress last spring, but still warrants scrutiny.\n\"If anything, the results are an endorsement of the old NAFTA, plus liberalization achieved through CPTPP [the TPP's successor] and the World Trade Organization, which are making up for the negative impacts of the recent changes,\" she said.\nIn her view, CUSMA\u00a0should be compared with not only the 1993 NAFTA deal, but also the TPP that the U.S. negotiated, along with Canada and Mexico,\u00a0and then opted not to ratify. Contrary to CUSMA's new restrictions for\u00a0the auto sector, the TPP\u00a0would have liberalized automotive rules of origin and set a new standard for the North American market, she said.\nManak's troubled by the\u00a0assumption in Wednesday's analysis that Canada secured exemptions to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs in CUSMA when in fact, the U.S. could re-impose them\u00a0based on its vague criteria.\n\"There's nothing to suggest any agreement made with this administration guarantees any specific outcome,\" she said.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Michael Gorman", "title": "Budget aimed at health care, education and poverty likely to fuel N.S. election talk", "description": "Fallout from Northern Pulp closure and coronavirus could hurt province's economic growth", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/budget-aimed-at-health-care-education-and-poverty-likely-to-fuel-n-s-election-talk-1.5475294", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5475301.1582651006!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/karen-casey.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 25, 2020 1:16 PM AT", "2020-02-25T19:23:37.360Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "If Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil hoped to quell recent talk of a pending provincial election, his government's budget on Tuesday won't help.\nWith estimated expenses of $11.5 billion and a $55-million surplus, the 2020-21 budget sees major infrastructure projects beginning to ramp up, further increases in spending on health care and education, and the McNeil government's most targeted effort to date in trying to reduce poverty, all while some economic uncertainty looms.\nIn her budget speech, Finance Minister Karen Casey said that while the province might be in a \"positive fiscal position,\" the budget is intended to support people \"who may not have been feeling the success of the province.\"\nTo that end, the government will spend $18 million to increase the low-income threshold for the Nova Scotia Child Benefit, extending it to families with incomes below $34,000. The change is expected to help 28,000 families and 49,000 children.\nThe standard household rate will become fully funded this year thanks to an additional $17.3 million and there's $16.6 million for the Disabilities Support Program.\nAmong other things, the government is promising that new money will help transition residents from larger care facilities into community-based living. In her speech, Casey said 50 people would make the move this year, with more in the following three years.\nHousing Nova Scotia will add 560 new rent supplements, 120 of which will be directed to people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The government is also planning to spend $20.5 million in the next five years for the Integrated Action Plan to Address Homelessness. The intention is to help people find permanent, stable and safe housing.\nCommunity Services officials said the increased funding reflects how stubborn the poverty issue has been and that efforts to date haven't moved the needle far enough. Nova Scotia has lagged behind other provinces in recent Statistics Canada reports on poverty rates for children and families.\n\"We saw numbers come out that saw us drop\u00a0\u2014 the largest drops inside of Canada, but it's still too high,\" McNeil told reporters.\n\"And this is an acknowledgement of that and this is an investment in those kids, kids in our province who are living in poverty.\"\nHealth care, as always, gobbles up the largest proportion of the budget.\nThis year, the Health Department's budget will hit $4.8 billion, almost 42 per cent of the total.\nThere's $75.3 million more for doctors following the recently announced new master agreement. There's also previously announced money for more seats at Dalhousie University's medical school and for resident training, and money to create 70 new nursing seats \u2014 62 at Cape Breton University and eight at Dalhousie's satellite campus in Yarmouth.\nThere's more money for a variety of drug programs and $1 million for a new ovarian cancer research program at Dalhousie.\nThe Nova Scotia Health Authority will see its budget increase by $77.7 million, while the bottom line at the IWK Health Centre will go up by $8.4 million.\nThe government will also spend $3.2 million to implement the new Human Organ Tissue Donation Act, money that will go toward doing more transplants.\nThe Education Department's major increases include $21.5 million to complete the rollout of pre-primary and another $15 million for the recommendations in the Commission on Inclusive Education's report.\nThe student loan forgiveness program is increasing by $2.2 million to now include graduates of the Nova Scotia Community College, a move that should affect 1,400 people as of this summer.\nThen there's the capital plan.\nAs Casey announced last week, it will hit $1 billion this year, driven primarily by hospital construction and renovation, buying and building 46 schools, and work on highways, roads and bridges. This year's operating grant for the Nova Scotia-to-Maine ferry is $16.3 million.\nThere's also about $40 million dedicated to green programs, such as energy efficiency programs and community-based projects to address climate change.\nThe spending is helped by $395 million more from Ottawa this year, including more money for equalization ($200 million) and the federal health transfer ($41.3 million).\nOpposition leaders and others were critical of the budget, saying it either didn't go far enough on certain issues or\u00a0placed too much emphasis on some things at the expense of others.\nTory Leader Tim Houston called the document an\u00a0election budget filled with investments that should have come \"years ago.\"\nHouston pointed to the $700,000 to create the new nursing school seats as an example.\n\"They could have easily started that three years ago and we'd be graduating nurses today instead of trying to look for someone to go in the program,\" he said.\nHouston said the level of transfer payments the province is receiving from Ottawa is proof that things aren't as fiscally strong as the government would have people believe.\n\"There is huge headwinds before this province for sure and easily our economy could shrink this year and that's a major concern,\" he said.\nNDP Leader Gary Burrill\u00a0called it a tale of two budgets, with\u00a0\"a great banquet feast\" laid out for the business community while the most needy get \"crumbs.\"\n\"It has the character of a fiscal deathbed confession,\" he told reporters.\n\"After years in which the province has really been starved for social spending, now, on the front porch of an election, we have all these crumbs being tossed in all kinds of different directions. So the spending, yes, fine, but it's a little bit little and it's a whole lot late.\"\nChristine Saulnier with\u00a0the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said the new funding aimed at addressing poverty doesn't go far enough.\n\"We need to do much\u00a0more than wait for a business sector to do something with a tax cut,\" she said.\n\"We've had 30 years to know what they're going to do: they're going to sit on it, their shareholders are going to be enriched, maybe some of their top employees, but we're not going to see the trickle down that apparently the premier thinks will be different here.\"\nHealth-care advocates said there were some things to be happy about, such as extending dialysis to rural communities, but\u00a0both Nan McFadgen of CUPE and Chris Parsons of the Nova Scotia Health Coalition were concerned there aren't any new long-term care beds included in the budget or support for the workers who staff those homes.\n\"It's a problem for anybody that wants access to any kind of health care because it just flows through all of the system,\" said McFadgen.\nThe government may be opening up its wallet, but this budget will require people who smoke and vape to do the same. All tobacco taxes will increase as of Feb. 26. That includes a two cent increase per cigarette, increasing the tax on cigars from 60 per cent to 75 per cent and an increase on fine cut and other forms of tobacco to 40 cents per gram.\nVape products will begin being taxed in September and retailers will require a permit, the cost of which has yet to be finalized, in July. The vape tax, the second in the country after B.C., will include $0.50 per millilitre of liquid and 20 per cent of the retail value of all devices. For example, the taxes would amount to $10.40 for a $45 starter vape kit.\n\"A small price to pay for our youth health,\" Casey told reporters.\nCasey said the measures, along with a previously-announced ban on flavoured vape products, are intended to target youth vaping rates.\nThe premier's previously announced tax breaks for small business (down from three per cent to 2.5) and the reduced corporate rate (down from 16 per cent to 14 per cent) are included in this budget, moves that will cost $81 million.\nOther tax measures include a five-year extension of both the digital media tax credit and digital animation tax credit. The Nova Scotia Film and Television Production Incentive Fund will rise to $25 million.\nThere are risks in this budget, as with any. The government has not accounted for the short-term effects of the coronavirus outbreak, and that includes what effect it might have on seafood exports to Asia, a market that in recent years has been the engine for economic growth.\nThere is also the question of the long-term effects of Northern Pulp's closure. The government estimates the tax hit of losing the mill is about $32 million, something Finance Department officials say is offset by an otherwise strong economy. But offsetting mitigations and transitions related to the mill closure are not factored into the budget.\nMcNeil told reporters the shutdown of Northern Pulp had no correlation\u00a0with the increased capital spending, other than money tied directly to already-announced funds and initiatives designed to help the forestry industry transition.\nThe province's real economic growth is expected to slow to 0.4 per cent in 2020 before reaching 1.2 per cent in 2021. The 2020-21 debt is estimated to hit $15.7 billion, with the debt-to-GDP ratio coming in at 33.3 per cent.\nThe debt is projected to increase in each of the next four years, driven by construction of hospitals, highways and schools. The government is also projecting balanced budgets in each of those years, aided in part by favourable debt servicing costs as long-term high-rate loans come off the books and are replaced by loans at much lower rates.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": "Jonathon Gatehouse", "title": "The NDP platform: ambitious promises, lots of uncertainty", "description": "More than 90 per cent of party's new tax measures judged difficult to deliver on by PBO", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-platform-costing-fact-check-1.5318913", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5318951.1570829273!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-ndp-20191011.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 12, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-10-12T08:00:25.328Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The claim: \"The system is rigged. And the NDP is going to un-rig it to work better for everyday people.\"\n\u2014 Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party, unveiled the costing for his party's platform in Ottawa, Friday morning.\u00a0\nThe facts: The NDP has finally put a price tag on the 70 new spending measures it has proposed during the federal election campaign \u2014\u00a0$35 billion in fiscal year 2020-21.\nAnd the party also has explained how it hopes to pay for them in part, forecasting $30.5 billion in new revenues in 2020-21, rising to $34.34 billion a year by 2023-24.\nUnder their plan, the New Democrats would run a $32.7 billion deficit (including a $4.58 billion contingency fund) during their first year in power, and then whittle the shortfall down over the course of their mandate to $16.57 billion in 2023-24.\nThe party's ambitious spending measures range from a plan to spend $13 billion over four years to build 500,000 new affordable homes, to $5.8 billion for clean transit and transportation, to\u00a0$43.1 billion for a national pharmacare program. Over the course of an NDP mandate,\u00a0there also would be $10 billion for universal childcare, $2.5 billion for green home renovations\u00a0and $2.4 billion to provide clean drinking water to Indigenous communities.\nMost of the new revenue would\u00a0come from tax increases on businesses and wealthy Canadians \u2014 like a three per cent rise in the corporate tax rate that would bring in $27.65 billion over four years, or $21.75 billion realized from \"cracking down on corporate tax havens.\" And the NDP has taken a page from the Liberals by also promising a tax on luxury boats, aircraft and vehicles, setting it at 12 per cent \u2014 two points\u00a0higher than Justin Trudeau's proposal.\nThe 13 new tax measures have all been costed by the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO). But just three of the spending measures \u2014 pharmacare, free dental coverage for families making $70,000 or less, and eliminating interest on future and current student loans \u2014 have been put under the same scrutiny.\u00a0\nThe University of Ottawa's Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy (IFSD), overseen by former PBO chief Kevin Page, has produced a quick analysis of the NDP costing giving\u00a0the party a barely-passing grade on its fiscal projections and management \u2014 3 out of 6, and 3.5 out of 6, respectively.\nHowever, the institute failed Singh on transparency, noting that, like the Conservatives, the NDP waited until after the debates to release their costing ... on the Friday before a long weekend, just 10 days out from the Oct. 21 vote.\u00a0\n\"Overall, the fiscal strategy in the NDP Party Platform Costing is one of significant fiscal expansion and a commitment to a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium-term,\" says the report-card. But it warns that the \"historic\" tax increases \"come with significant economic and fiscal risk,\" and that the equally huge spending increases likely would require tough and bitter negotiations with the provinces.\n\"The New Democrats are proposing significant changes to the tax and spending structure of the federal government,\" Mostafa Askari, the chief economist for the IFSD, told CBC News. \"Those objectives are very difficult to achieve without causing significant disruption in the economy.\"\nThe NDP costing doesn't provide much detail about its spending promises. And there is reason to question the accuracy of the party's revenue projections as well.\nThe PBO judged nine of the 13 new tax measures to have \"high uncertainty\" due to incomplete or old data, and the well-recognized reality that the ultra-rich have the means and motivation to frustrate, or even evade, collection attempts. In total, $30.2 billion of the NDP's projected $32.2 billion in additional revenue in fiscal 2021-22 is rated highly uncertain by the PBO.\u00a0\nTake, for example,\u00a0that $5.562 billion that the party is hoping to bring in that year from its tax haven crackdown. To date, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has a woeful record when it comes to finding money that Canadians have hidden offshore \u2014 even when they are provided with a roadmap.\nIt's been more than three years since the leaked Panama Papers \u2014 11.5 million documents\u00a0from 200,000 accounts \u2014\u00a0revealed the sheltered assets of the world's financial elite. Countries like the U.K., France and Spain have used the information to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and penalties.\nAs of June, the CRA had only examined 116 of the 894 Canadians implicated, assessing just $14.9 million in taxes and fines. And it's not clear how much \u2014 if any \u2014 of that money has actually been collected.\nPercy Downe, a senator for P.E.I and former chief of staff to Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien, has been studying offshore tax havens for years and said he is mystified by how successive governments \u2014 Conservative and Liberal \u2014 have shown so little interest in cracking down.\n\"There's a terrible double-standard. The CRA does an excellent job on domestic tax evasion. The chances of being detected, caught and jailed are very high,\" he said. \"But the corresponding effort for overseas tax evasion is simply not there.\"\nThat could change with a government that makes enforcement a priority, said Downe. But it won't happen overnight, as the NDP (and the Green Party) are forecasting in their platform costings.\n\"We have a massive problem that has gone from the very rich, to the rich, to the upper middle class,\" said Downe. \"It won't be easy to fix.\"\nThe NDP isn't alone in offering a mix of perhaps-over-estimated revenues\u00a0and probably-under-estimated costs.\nThe Greens, who had the PBO cost 23 of their 102 promises, saw 13 of them come back tagged \"high uncertainty,\" throwing $49.73 billion of the $63.98 billion in new revenue that the party hopes to collect in 2021-22 into question.\nThe Liberals submitted 24 of their 55 spending and revenue proposals to the PBO. Ten of them were judged to have \"high uncertainty,\" accounting for $3.073 billion of the $6.285 billion in new revenue the party is counting on for 2021-22.\nAnd the Conservatives, who also released their platform costing on Friday, have sent 44 of their 81 promises for scrutiny at the budget office. Seven were found to have heightened uncertainty. But with a relatively small footprint \u2014 the Tories are projecting $8.5 billion in tax breaks and new spending in 2021-22, versus $8.89 billion in additional revenue and program cuts \u2014 the nine shaky estimates total just $2.6 billion.\nAskari said the IFSD found that the Liberals and Conservatives were both \"inside the box\" of traditional government spending and taxation.\nThe NDP and the Greens, on the other hand, are dreaming big.\n\"It's very ambitious,\" said Askari. \"But it may not be feasible, or doable.\"\nThe verdict: It's complicated. The NDP are aiming to fundamentally transform Canada if elected. They've attached price tags to their promises, and the PBO has checked some of their math, but their assumptions on the revenue side might prove to be overly optimistic.\u00a0\nSources: A New Deal for People: Our Fiscal Plan, New Democratic Party of Canada; Liberal Party Costing Estimate: Luxury Goods Sales Tax, Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer; 2019 Election Proposal Costing: New Democratic Party, Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer; IFSD Fiscal Credibility Assessment: New Democratic Party (NDP) Platform 2019 Costing, Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy; Panama Papers spur billion-dollar global tax windfall, with $15M found in Canada, CBC News; Why Can't the Canada Revenue Agency Catch Tax Cheat?, Policy Options; Green Party Costing Estimate: End offshore tax dodging by corporations, Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer; A Responsible Fiscal Plan, Liberal Party of Canada; Platform 2019 Costing, Green Party of Canada; Andrew Scheer's Plan for you to get ahead, Conservative Party of Canada.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Robson Fletcher", "title": "What Canada's economy would look like if Alberta's recession never happened", "description": "Politicians often say a 'strong Alberta' means a 'strong Canada.'

That's also correct.\nMaybe your mind went to federal politics, though. No problem. If you said Michelle Rempel, the Conservative MP for Calgary Nose Hill, that is a\u00a0correct answer, as well. So, too, is Kent Hehr, the Liberal MP for Calgary Centre.\nOther correct answers include Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi, former B.C. premier Christy Clark\u00a0and even former Ontario finance minister Dwight Duncan.\nIn this age of partisan talking points repeated ad infinitum, variations on the \"strong Alberta, strong Canada\" theme represent a rare turn of phrase that cuts across provinces, government jurisdictions and party lines. If you listen for it, you'll hear politicians of all stripes make the point, and with good reason. The evidence bears it out.\n\"There are very deep and important interconnections between Alberta's economy and the rest of the country,\"\u00a0says University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe, who recently completed a quantitative analysis on just that topic.\nJust how deep are those connections? Think $130 billion \u2014 per year. Think a federal deficit that would be virtually wiped out. Think an unemployment rate that would have dropped to levels never before seen in this country.\nThis is what Canada missed out on, Tombe says, because of Alberta's latest recession.\nThat recession, by most measures, started with the oil-price slump in late 2014 and lasted until late 2016. Alberta's economy then bounced back, to a degree, in 2017, but that recovery started to sputter in 2018.\nMultiple economic forecasts for\u00a02019 are pointing to another weak year, with the Conference Board of Canada saying a second, \"mild recession\" may even be in the cards for Alberta.\nTombe's\u00a0peer-reviewed analysis, produced at CBC's request, was released today by the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy. It looks at how Canada's economy would have fared if Alberta's recent recession had never happened and, instead, the provincial economy had simply matched British Columbia's growth from 2014 to 2019.\nThe analysis builds on previous work from the school's Ron Kneebone, who in 2014 investigated the opposite: What Canada would have looked like if Alberta's economy, which had been previously booming, had instead grown at only a moderate pace.\nIn both cases, the results were stark.\n\"What these numbers show is that Alberta's recession had a very real and significant impact on the national economy,\" says Tombe.\nIn terms of sheer economic growth, he says Canada has missed out on roughly $130 billion per year, thanks to Alberta's recession.\nAnd then there's the jobs.\nEarlier this year, Canada's unemployment rate hit a historic low, dipping to 5.4 per cent in June. That's the lowest level recorded by Statistics Canada since it started tracking comparable data nearly a half-century ago.\nIf Alberta hadn't experienced its latest recession, however, Tombe's analysis suggests the national unemployment rate would be even lower today.\n\"I estimate Canada's national unemployment rate would be 4.9 per cent\u00a0or 0.8 percentage points below its August 2019 rate of 5.7 per cent,\" he writes.\u00a0\"This is a significant drop.\"\nAnd this, Tombe says, is not simply due to Alberta's unemployment rate declining in a hypothetical scenario where the recession never happened, thereby dragging down the national rate, on average.\nTo understand why, just consider the impact the actual recession had on workers beyond the province's borders.\n\"In 2014, 150,000 people worked in Alberta but lived somewhere else,\" he says.\u00a0\"So the job losses that we saw during the recession \u2014 at worst, 130,000 job losses \u2014 a lot of that was actually felt by workers who lived in provinces elsewhere. So the unemployment rate being higher nationally is not just because Alberta's unemployment rate is higher.\"\nThen there are the broader economic effects.\nA stronger Alberta economy means more trade between it and other provinces, something that also affects jobs.\nTombe says total internal trade within Canada was roughly $380 billion per year prior to the recession, and Alberta represented about $75 billion of that.\n\"So when a recession occurs here, that's going to mean fewer trade flows between Alberta and the rest of the country,\" he says. \"And so that's another way in which businesses elsewhere can suffer because of a recession here.\"\nAll that trade also translates into tax revenue\u00a0for the federal government. Tombe's analysis suggests the GDP boost that would have occurred if Alberta's recession had never happened would have resulted in an\u00a0additional $13 billion flowing to the\u00a0federal government\u00a0in the fiscal year that just ended.\n\"The federal deficit was just a little bit over $14 billion,\" he says.\u00a0\"So this analysis suggests that almost all of the federal deficit for the prior year might be due to Alberta's recession.\"\nTo economists, this all might be obvious. The fact that economic growth in one part of the country comes with benefits for the country\u00a0as a whole\u00a0is not exactly a groundbreaking discovery in the field.\nBut Tombe worries recent political rhetoric that pits Alberta against B.C., or provincial governments against the federal government, or Western Canada against Central Canada, or pipeline supporters against pipeline opponents,\u00a0obscures this reality.\n\"I think a lot of Canadians don't recognize just how closely and tightly interconnected provincial economies are,\" he says.\nIt's something that troubles Jim Dinning as well.\nThe former Calgary MLA, who served as provincial treasurer and in other cabinet roles in Alberta's Progressive Conservative governments of the 1980s and 1990s, believes too much of politics these days frames disagreements between regions as an either-or scenario, ignoring the common ground they all share.\n\"It shouldn't be Quebec or Alberta,\u00a0or Ontario or the West. It's got to be Ontario, Quebec and a strong Western Canada,\" Dinning says.\n\"Really, every province in this country can be a contributor. And\u00a0if one or two or three are left behind because of poor or bad or ill-thought public policy, that's a drag on the whole economy.\u00a0And that's a tragedy.\"\nThere's a tendency in the public discourse, he says, to \"talk past each other too much.\" Admitting Albertans are as guilty of it as anyone else\u00a0\u2014 of\u00a0\"having a little too much swagger,\" especially\u00a0during the boom times \u2014 Dinning believes Canadians across the country\u00a0focus on narrow regional interests at the peril of the larger, national whole.\nTombe hopes his quantitative analysis will add weight to the political rhetoric discussed earlier:\u00a0the \"strong Alberta, strong Canada\" language that we've heard, at various times, from UCP and NDP premiers alike,\u00a0from Conservative and Liberal MPs, and from leaders at all levels of government.\nThis type of talk sometimes gets drowned out by more inflammatory kinds of political rhetoric,\u00a0which\u00a0tend to attract more attention for their bombast,\u00a0but Tombe believes it's important to hear.\n\"I think this does speak to national unity considerations that are not often talked about,\" he says.\n\"The economic health of one region affects the economic health of all.\"\nWest of Centre is an election-focused pop-up bureau based out of CBC Calgary that features election news and analysis with a western voice and perspective.\n"}, {"author": "Aaron Wherry", "title": "Liberals to boost spending and extend deficits while taxing luxury goods and internet giants", "description": "Trudeau offers support for students, sexual assault training for judges and new tax on internet giants", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-liberal-platform-release-election-1.5302042", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302125.1569786292!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-liberals-20190927.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 29, 2019 2:06 PM ET", "2019-09-29T22:14:12.753Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Justin Trudeau's Liberals launched their full campaign platform on Sunday with promises of new support for post-secondary students and graduates, paid for, in part, by new taxes on internet giants and luxury goods.\nIn total, the Liberals are proposing new investments of $9.3 billion in 2020-2021, rising to $17 billion in the fourth year of a second mandate. The federal deficit would increase to $27.4 billion in 2020-2021, declining to $21 billion in 2023-2024.\nThe Liberals promised in 2015 to run three years of deficits before returning the federal budget to balance in 2019.\u00a0\nWith the new promises, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio would still decline, from 30.9 per cent in 2020-2021 to 30.2 per cent in 2023-2024.\nPolitically, the Liberal platform increases the party's contrast with the Conservatives, between a Liberal proposal to spend more and a Conservative commitment to spend less. The Liberal proposals might also reduce the space between themselves and the NDP, their rivals on the left.\n\"We are making a different choice than the Conservatives do. We're choosing to invest in middle-class Canadians, invest in people's communities, because, quite frankly, that is what has worked over the past four years,\" Trudeau told reporters at an event in Mississauga, Ont.\n\"Conservatives are still making the argument that the way to grow the economy is through cuts and austerity and tax breaks that go to the wealthiest. We disagree. Our plan is focused on investing in Canadians, in a fiscally responsible way that means the size of our debt in relation to the size of our economy is low and will keep getting lower every single year.\"\nDuring his prepared remarks, the Liberal leader highlighted a series of cuts that are being made in Ontario under the Progressive Conservative government of Doug Ford.\nAt a news conference to respond to the Liberal platform, Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre\u00a0scorned the new spending commitments.\n\"This is Justin Trudeau's credit card campaign,\" Poilievre said, alleging that the Liberals were concealing future tax increases. \"He expects Canadians to believe that money falls out of the sky or grows on trees.\"\nThe Conservatives have not yet released their full platform. They have previously promised to balance the budget by 2024.\nIn his own response, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said his party would do still\u00a0more to help students and those struggling with the cost of prescriptions\u00a0and housing.\n\"What Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals are doing [is] they're trying to scare people into settling for less,\" Singh said. \"You don't have to settle for less.\"\nUnder the Liberal plan, the maximum annual amount available under the Canada Student Grant program would rise to $4,200, an increase of $1,200.\u00a0\nInterest charges on student loans would also not be charged for two years or until a graduate is making a salary of at least $35,000. In the event that an individual's salary drops below $35,000, interest charges would be suspended.\nFinally, graduates who are new parents would have the option to suspend student-loan payments until their child reaches the age of five.\nThe NDP, Singh noted, is promising to eliminate interest on all student loans.\nTo raise new revenue, the Liberals are proposing a 10 per cent \"luxury tax\" \u2014 an additional excise tax on luxury cars, boats and personal aircraft that sell for more than $100,000.\u00a0\nDigital companies that make at least $1 billion in annual global revenues and at least $40 million in Canadian revenues \u2014 firms\u00a0like Amazon, Google, Netflix, Apple and Facebook \u2014 would pay a three per cent tax on revenue generated through sales of online advertising and user data.\nThe Liberals would also undertake a new review of federal spending and tax expenditures, with a focus on tax measures that \"disproportionately benefit Canada's wealthiest individuals and large corporations.\"\u00a0\nThe Liberal platform does not specify any items in particular to cut, but the Liberals hope to find $2 billion in savings in 2020-2021, rising to $3 billion in four years.\nThe office of the parliamentary budget officer warned that the platform's projections for the new revenue measures came with a high degree of \"uncertainty,\" because of a number of variables. But the\u00a0Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy, a think tank that is analyzing party platforms for transparency and reasonableness, gave the Liberal platform a passing grade.\nThe 85-page Liberal platform restates a number of existing commitments and policies already implemented. But it does include a number of new promises.\nThe federal minimum wage, for instance, would rise to $15 per hour and the Liberals would create a $200 \"culture pass\" available to every child when they turn 12\u00a0to cover the cost of theatres, museums, art galleries and other cultural venues.\nThe federal child disability benefit would also be doubled.\nThe Liberals are promising to implement mandatory training for judges on sexual assault, effectively reviving a measure put forward in a private member's bill by former Conservative MP Rona Ambrose. Survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence would be provided with free legal aid.\nThe privacy commissioner would be empowered to enforce a new digital charter that gives internet users greater power over the use and retention of their data and social media platforms would be required to remove illegal content, including hate speech, within 24 hours.\nIn partnership with Indigenous leaders, a Liberal government would co-develop legislation to cover Indigenous health care, infrastructure in Indigenous communities and the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\nThe Liberals would also create a director of terrorism prosecutions, a new office with a mandate to pursue cases of Canadians who travel abroad to join terrorist organisations. Funding for the federal anti-racism strategy would also be doubled, to $90 million from $45 million.\nNot addressed in the Liberal costing is a commitment to invest in pharmacare. Trudeau said that will be subject to negotiation with the provinces.\nAmong the commitments already announced during the campaign, the Liberals have promised to:\n"}, {"author": "Jonathon Gatehouse", "title": "Trudeau's big \u2014 and underfunded \u2014 health care promises", "description": "Liberals' pledge to 'fix' gaps in health care system would cost billions more", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-health-care-fact-check-1.5295449", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294060.1571730710!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-liberal-20190923.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 24, 2019 2:00 PM ET", "2019-09-24T18:29:55.582Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The claim: \"A re-elected Liberal government will make sure every Canadian has access to a family doctor, to mental health services, to affordable prescription drugs\u00a0and to national pharmacare.\"\n\u2014 The federal Liberals tout their promise to boost health care funding by $6 billion over the coming four years.\nThe facts:\nOn Monday, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau unveiled his plan to close the \"gaps\" in Canada's health care system, promising an \"additional down payment\" of $6 billion to strengthen medicare and the public health system.\u00a0\nThe party reported the amounts \u2014 $750 million in 2020-21, rising to $1.75 billion in 2023-24 \u2014 but said a detailed breakdown of how the money would be spent will have to wait until later in the campaign.\nStill, that didn't stop Trudeau from raising expectations about what he might accomplish\u00a0in a second term, vowing\u00a0that Canadians in every province and territory would have access to a family physician, mental health services as needed and prescription medications via a universal \"pharmacare\" program.\n\"Every Canadian, no matter where they live, who they are\u00a0or what they do, should receive the care they need to stay healthy,\" Trudeau said during a campaign event in Hamilton, Ont.\nThe Liberals came to power in 2015\u00a0promising to negotiate a new \"collaborative\" health accord with the provinces and territories. But when the 10-year deal was finally struck in 2017, it wasn't nearly as generous as the premiers had hoped: it capped\u00a0increases to the Canada Health Transfer at three per cent per year, down from six\u00a0per cent under the old agreement.\nOttawa did sweeten the pot with $11 billion in funding over 10 years for improved home and palliative care, and mental health and addiction services. The Liberals have been talking about that a lot during this campaign, along with changes to prescription drug pricing that they say will save Canadians $13 billion over the coming decade.\nThe Canada Health Transfer in fiscal year 2018-19 was $38.6 billion, more than half of the total $75.4 billion that flowed from Ottawa to the provinces and territories.\nBut that remains a fraction \u2014 just 15 per cent \u2014\u00a0of overall public and private health care spending in Canada, which totalled $253.5 billion in 2018, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).\nPer capita health care spending has been increasing since 2014, up an average of 1.7 per cent per year, after declining by an average of 0.2 per cent a year between 2010 and 2014. In 2018, it worked out to $ 6,839 per person, or 11.3 per cent of Canada's Gross Domestic Product. That's still below the peak health care spending ratio of 11.6 per cent of GDP in 2010.\nThe Liberals can claim partial credit for that uptick, but if they're really intent on filling the gaps in the system, it's going to take a lot more money than they have budgeted and promised thus far.\nTake Trudeau's vow to implement national pharmacare and help the nearly one million Canadians \"who skimp on food and heat to be able to pay for the medications they depend on.\"\nIn June, the advisory council that the Liberals set up to look into pharmacare tabled a final report with some awfully big numbers. If, as recommended,\u00a0 the government starts with a stripped-down version of the program covering only \"essential'\"medicines in 2022, the net annual cost would be $4.1 billion. And as the list of eligible drugs expands, along with the number of users, the price tag would grow to $15.3 billion a year by 2027.\u00a0\nMichael Law, an associate professor of public health at the University of British Columbia and the Canada research chair in access to medicines, said it's hard to reconcile the Liberals' ambitions with the $6 billion sum and the multiple objectives on offer.\n\"It might go toward some of the groundwork to get things started,\" he said.\u00a0\"But what they are currently proposing to spend is nowhere near what they would have to spend to set up a national pharmacare program.\"\nTrudeau's promise to improve access to mental health services \u2014 so that \"Canadians can\u00a0get the support they need quickly, when they need it most\" \u2014 would also be costly.\nLast year, the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) produced a report that looked at spending on mental health versus physical health in Canada. Right now, only 7.2 per cent of the federal health care budget is dedicated to mental well-being. And the 2017 pot-sweetener that dedicated $5 billion more over 10 years barely moved the needle, increasing slightly the share of federal health spending going to mental health from 7 per cent.\nFardous Hosseiny, the CMHA's interim chief executive, said getting to nine\u00a0per cent would take an additional $3.1 billion a year \u2014 which would still be well below the spending level his organization wants to see.\n\"More investment is always welcome,\" he said. \"But it won't take one budget, or even one government, to right-size that funding gap.\"\nThen there's that Liberal pledge to provide everyone with access to a family doctor.\nIn 2017, Canada had 86,644 practising physicians, which works out to 234 doctors per 100,000 population. That's slightly more than Mexico, slightly fewer than the United States\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but well below the levels in Argentina, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, all of which have ratios closer to 400 doctors per 100,000 population.\nCIHI reports that gross clinical payments to physicians amounted to $26.4 billion in 2016-17\u00a0\u2014 a 2.8 per cent increase over the year before, with an average payment of $342,000 per doctor.\u00a0\nStatistics Canada estimates that there are now 4.7 million people who don't (by circumstance or choice)\u00a0have a primary health care provider. Offering them the same level of access as other Canadians would mean adding at least 11,000 more doctors\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which, at current payment rates, adds up to an additional $3.76 billion a year in health costs.\nAnd keep in mind that the country already is having difficulty finding enough residency spots for the record number of students graduating from medical schools.\nOf course, party pledges to \"fix\"\u00a0Canada's health care system are a staple of almost every election,\u00a0provincial and federal.\n\"The Liberals first promised medicare in 1919 under William Lyon Mackenzie King,\" said Dr. Michael Rachlis, a public health physician and adjunct professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health. \"And they took until 1968 \u2014 47 years \u2014 to pass the legislation.\"\nRachlis noted that these current Liberal goals come with a number of caveats and all depend\u00a0on more \"collaborative\" negotiations with the provinces and territories\u00a0\u2014 many of which are led by Conservative governments.\n\"If they're re-elected, they're going to face really hostile provincial governments who won't want to do any of this stuff with them,\" said Rachlis. \"These are nice promises that the Liberals are never going to have to fulfil.\"\nThe Verdict: False. Filling the gaps in Canada's health care system will take billions of dollars\u00a0more than the Liberals have put on the table, and a level of political goodwill that probably doesn't exist right now.\nSources: Liberals to boost investments in health care for Canadians, Liberal Party of Canada; Liberals promise improved access to family doctors, mental health care and prescription drugs, CBC News; A new plan for a strong middle class, Liberal Party of Canada; Divide and conquer: How the feds split the provinces in health talks, Hill Times; Manitoba signs on to Ottawa health accord for more mental health, home care funding, CBC News; Ottawa promises to save billions with tweaks to patent drug system, CBC News; Federal support to provinces and territories, Dept. of Finance; National Health Expenditure Trends, 1975 to 2018, Canadian Institute for Health Information; Final Report of the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare, Government of Canada; Mental Health in the Balance, Ending the Health Care Disparity in Canada, Canadian Mental Health Association; Physicians in Canada, Canadian Institute for Health Information; Density of Physicians, World Health Organization; Primary Health Care Providers, 2017; Statistics Canada; 'You feel like your world in over': Problems and solutions for medical graduates without residencies, CBC News.\n"}, {"author": "Elizabeth Fraser", "title": "N.B.

They identified three provinces \u2014 New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island\u00a0\u2014 that might be able to move forward with some recovery efforts.\nBut Higgs said this would only be done while protecting the borders.\nAt some point, the premier said, he will discuss the border question with the COVID-19 cabinet committee, Dr. Jennifer Russell, the chief medical officer of health, and other health officials, but he didn't see that happening soon.\n\"We can return to the new normal quicker \u2014 we have that potential\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as long as we don't take it for granted.

The province performed 586 tests on Thursday, the largest volume since testing started last month.\u00a0\nHere is a roundup of other developments.\u00a0\nPremier Blaine Higgs said he was disappointed to find out that New Brunswick's all-terrain vehicle trails reopened Friday.\u00a0\nA letter was sent out Thursday by New Brunswick ATV Federation president Roger Daigle about the opening.\n\"Even though we are in the middle of the woods, it is crucial that we respect the following rules: We must refrain from using our shelters and riding in big groups; also we must keep our distance and ride safely,\" Daigle said in the letter.\nThe move had the support of Natural Resources\u00a0Minister Mike Holland, but Higgs said he was concerned it might lead to\u00a0 gatherings, which are not allowed under the state of emergency.\n\"I think the messaging got a little offside here.\"\nAs the weather gets nicer, Premier Blaine Higgs is pleading\u00a0with New Brunswickers to avoid visiting their cottages over the weekend.\u00a0\n\"I am sympathetic to that situation,\" he said. \"I recognize that in New Brunswick, we have different areas that we like to go and I feel the same way personally.\"\u00a0\nHiggs said Public Health and government want to find a way that would allow residents to have \"some freedom\" to travel across the province.\u00a0\nBut this might not be possible until at least two weeks after\u00a0passed since the long Easter weekend, and the province knows how it's faring by the case numbers then.\nFor now, he's urging people to stay in their communities and avoid \"moving across the province.\"\n\"We'll find a way but I'm asking people just to be patient for a little bit longer.\"\u00a0\nPremier Blaine Higgs\u00a0spoke with 114 New Brunswick mayors and officials on a conference call Friday to answer some of their concerns about economic recovery.\nHe said he told the mayors the government is actively working on a recovery plan and strategy, and the details will be available in coming weeks.\u00a0\n\"But we cannot make the\u00a0mistake of returning to our normal life too soon,\" he said.\n\"Even when current restrictions are reduced, we are not going back to business as usual anytime soon.\"\nPremier Blaine Higgs said some summer concerts and events could also be cancelled this summer.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, the premier did say\u00a0couples also don't need to cancel upcoming weddings this summer.\u00a0\nBut if they do plan to get married, they have to do it in a way that respects physical distancing and keeping people safe.\n\"It's about finding a way to actually do what we want to do and do what we'd like to do, but do it in a safe manner that can adhere to the guidelines,\" he said.\nAt Thursday's premiers meeting, there was discussion about certain regions peeling back some of their restrictions.\u00a0\nThose provinces included New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan.\u00a0\nAlthough New Brunswick might be in a different situation from other parts of Canada, Higgs said the province will continue to follow direction from public health.\u00a0\n\"I don't see anything changing certainly in the control around our borders.\"\nUp to 70 workers\u00a0from a power services company in New Brunswick have been told to self-isolate at home after restoring power in Maine over the past week.\u00a0\u00a0\nThousands of residents in Maine lost power for just over a week after a snow and wind storm.

The end result will be for 2020 to mark the steepest one-year decline in GDP for all provinces.\"\nThe Conference Board of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion and National banks have each recently projected a severe economic contraction in New Brunswick this year of between 3.2 and 4.1 per cent.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat's significantly worse than the banking crisis and recession of 2008 when New Brunswick's economy declined by a combined 0.6 per cent over two years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe New Brunswick legislature met for a quick 25-minute sitting Friday to adopt three new measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWorkers will now be protected from being fired for staying home if they're self-isolating or if they have to care for a sick family member.\nThe bill amends the Employment Standards Act, which already has protections for workers, but \"none of them would directly apply to the unprecedented emergency situation we find ourselves in today,\" Labour Minister Trevor Holder told the house.\nMLAs also voted to give the government the power to establish emergency child care centres for children of essential workers who haven't been able to find other arrangements.\nThe province closed daycares last month as part its response to the pandemic but allowed some centres to operate for children of essential workers.\u00a0\nBut not everyone has been able to find spots, so the law will let the province set up centres \"in areas of need, when all other avenues have been exhausted,\" Public Safety Minister Carl Urquhart said.\nThe same bill, which amends the Emergency Measures Act, also suspends the deadlines for New Brunswickers filing court actions or complaints to provincial tribunals.\nThe deadlines will be suspended during the emergency and for 90 days after it ends.\nPeople concerned they might have\u00a0COVID-19 can\u00a0take a self-assessment\u00a0on the government website.

Their contempt for amateurs \u2014 columnists with broad audiences, for example \u2014 would sear the lungs if inhaled.\nSo, because criticism just makes me feel so terrible, let me phrase a whole set of nagging worries as questions. Can we agree there are no stupid questions? Probably not. But let's try anyway.\nQuestion No. 1: How in heaven's name did we arrive in a world where you must pay someone to borrow your money, and what does that mean to the punters? Like, um, me?\nAt the moment, there is more than $14 trillion US in negative-yielding debt extant in the world, meaning money is not just cheap, it's on sale at a loss.\u00a0\nLet's put that sum in perspective: Canada's GDP in 2018 \u2013 the entire economic output of a G7 country \u2013 was about $1.7 trillion US. Fourteen trill is a huge chunk of global wealth.\nGovernments, many of them European, are actually offering \u2014 and investors are buying \u2014 bonds that are worth less at the end of five or 10 or even 30 years than their purchase price.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd a bank in Denmark\u00a0is now offering\u00a0a negative-yield mortgage. Jyske Bank will lend customers a ten-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of -0.5%, which means those borrowers will actually pay back less than they borrowed.\nAs for the punters, some have pensions, private and public, which, if this trend continues, will be forced to severely reduce their payouts. Some have RRSPs and other savings, which are subject to the same market forces. The expectation my generation was raised on was that prudence and parsimony would result in a nest egg later in life, which someone would pay to borrow, which would help fund your retirement. Now, apparently, we will have to pay someone to \"hold\" our money for us.\nBloomberg, the financial news agency, moved an explainer piece on all this last week, which suggested that this is all perfectly normal.\u00a0\nRelatively flat economic growth in the developed world, explained the explainer, combined with ever-increasing concentration of wealth, has left rich people and companies sitting on vast piles of cash for which there is weak demand.\u00a0\nThe rules of economics being what they are, theorized the author, it only makes sense that financial institutions would begin charging to store this surplus money. After all, if you own something really expensive, don't you have to pay to store it safely? A safety deposit box costs money, doesn't it?\nWhat the explainer avoided was where a lot of this money came from in the first place. Which brings us to Question No. 2: Governments have printed unimaginable amounts of money, inflating the money supply, since 2008. That must have consequences for the punters, right?\nIn early 2008, before the criminal greed of America's mortgage and investment bank industry nearly destroyed the world's economy, the balance sheet of the U.S. Federal Reserve stood at about $870 billion.\n(Speaking of 2008, there is no better example of economists being wrong. Larry Summers and Alan Greenspan, two economists who rose to manage much of the American economy, not only didn't see the subprime crisis coming, they both fought successfully against regulation of derivatives, which are essentially bets on the rise and fall of asset values. Wall Street's creation of ever more insane derivatives basically caused the meltdown while regulators looked the other way.)\nBen Bernanke launches blog defending actions as Fed chief\nLessons from the 2008 recession\nThen-Fed chair Ben Bernanke and his fellow governors, desperate to avert complete disaster, plugged in the money-printing machine (actually, money printing is done electronically, with a few computer keystrokes).\u00a0\nThe Fed balance sheet is now at nearly $4 trillion.\nThe European Central Bank began printing money in 2015: $2.6 trillion Euros over four years, or about 7,600 Euros for every person in the currency bloc. Japan, the UK and Switzerland have all done the same in differing amounts. The technical term for it is \"quantitative easing.\"\nThe central banks have used the oceans of new money to buy bonds from their own debt-addicted governments, with the intended result of lowering the cost of borrowing and encouraging risk-taking, which is at least one explanation for the nosebleed stock market levels nowadays, and the staggering levels of household debt here and in the U.S.\nBut there is serious pressure to do even more. Which brings us to Question Number Three: Winter is coming, and so is another recession. It is inevitable; 10 years have passed since the last one. What will we do this time? And\u2026the punters.\nOne thing central banks won't be able to do this time is lower interest rates significantly. As negative rates are already here. U.S. President Donald Trump, judging by his weekly rants about the incompetence of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump appointed, seems to think monetary policy should be in the hands of politicians like him. (Now that would be a confidence-inspiring move, wouldn't it?). Trump thinks cutting U.S. interest rates even further is just the ticket.\n....proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much (and that I was right!). They must Cut Rates bigger and faster, and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening NOW. Yield curve is at too wide a margin, and no inflation! Incompetence is a.....\nOther politicians, on the left, are promoting Modern Monetary Theory, which posits that governments can print unlimited amounts of money without inflationary consequences. Some even want central banks to just start sending cheques to every household.\n(Actually, Trump is right over there with the leftists, if you think about it: pro-spending, pro-debt, and pushing for even looser monetary policy).\nAnd of course the central banks are increasingly shackled by the fact that citizens and governments owe so very much; at this point, having helped create this mess to save us all from the earlier mess, they haven't much choice but to leave interest rates where they are for many years to come.\nThis much is absolutely true: we are in unknown territory, out past the \"here be monsters\" sign. None of us has any idea how this will turn out, economists included. As we saw in 2008, the collateral damage when things start to go badly can be devastating. Personally, I have a bad feeling about it all, but then I'm not an economist.\nI'm with Bruce Springsteen, also a non-economist, who once put it this way: \"Blind faith in your leaders \u2026 will get you killed.\"\nBy \"you,\" he did not mean the top .5 per cent, with their insider information and high-speed trading algorithms and political influence and vast, expanding piles of cash. They'll be fine. When Donald Trump, a member of that cohort, said in 2015 that the system is rigged, he was right, just not in the way he meant.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

About half of the total survey of 1,200 respondents was conducted before stock markets and oil prices plunged (March 2-8).\u00a0The other half of the interviews took place after this economic shock (March 9-18). Our analysis found no real difference in public opinion about energy transition between the two periods. Growing concerns about the pandemic continue to shape public attitudes.\nAs with all polls, this one is a snapshot in time. CBC News \u2014\u00a0and the public opinion experts consulted on this survey research \u2014\u00a0believe the data offers some valuable insights into Albertans'\u00a0attitudes about the economy and politics just at the moment when COVID-19 changed everything.\nThis is the fifth article to come out of this research. Read the previous articles here:\nIt was sombre. It was serious.\u00a0\nPremier Jason Kenney's televised address to Albertans last week delivered a sobering reckoning of\u00a0\"perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation\" facing the Prairie province.\nFirst \u2014 and most pressing \u2014 the health crisis sparked by the coronavirus pandemic could, in a probable scenario, see as many as 800,000 infections, and between 400 and 3,100 deaths in Alberta.\nThe economic ramifications of the infection are profound, with the most recent forecast estimating that one in four Albertans will lose their jobs and the crisis will \"permanently reshape\" the province's economy. As\u00a0Kenney has said, it could be an economic disaster equivalent to or worse than the Great Depression.\nThe International Monetary Fund's most recent estimates forecast massive global decline, and a terrible situation for energy prices \u2014 Alberta's bedrock industry.\nThe future of the industry is unclear.\nA CBC News poll, taken just before the economic implications of the coronavirus were becoming clear, suggests 79 per cent of Albertans already thought that the province should transition toward renewable energy. More than nine in 10\u00a0Albertans also think the province should do more to encourage the development of the technology sector.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd 51 per cent think that the province should transition away from oil and gas.\u00a0\nWhile support for transitioning away from oil and gas is highest in Edmonton (58 per cent), it has similar levels of support in Calgary (55 per cent). Outside the province's two major cities, only about a third of Albertans (37 per cent) support moving away from oil and gas.\nThere is general agreement that Alberta needs more renewables. Albertans are divided on whether or not to wind down the oil and gas industry.\nThe question is, how do you fix and reshape Alberta's energy-dependent economy\u00a0while looking after people caught up in the change?\nAlbertans have debated diversification for years, but there's an argument to be made that the coronavirus crisis offers an opportunity to speed up diversifying the economy and transitioning to more renewable energy sources.\nCalgary-based pollster Janet Brown has detected an increasing desire amongst Albertans to diversify Alberta's oil and gas-dependent economy over the past couple of years.\n\"Albertans don't necessarily want to abandon the oil and gas industry, but that doesn't mean they don't want to see the economy transition away from the oil and gas industry,\" said Brown, who conducted the research for CBC News.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It's about\u00a0\u2026 keeping the industries that we rely on strong, and diversifying so that in the future we're not so reliant on any single industry,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd that's key: To keep oil and gas viable in the short term, while beginning a green transition.\nEven before COVID-19,\u00a0Kenney acknowledged that Alberta \"will see a gradual shift from hydrocarbon-based energy to other forms of energy.\"\nThat said, in recent weeks, Kenney has pressured the federal government to help the province's beleaguered energy industry, recently suggesting that he anticipates significant federal support for the sector.\u00a0\nThat assistance has been expected for some time\u00a0but hasn't yet arrived.\nThe renewable energy industry, for its part, is pressuring Ottawa to stimulate the pandemic ravaged economy by investing in wind energy, hydro power and electric vehicles.\nAt the same time, hundreds of academics \u2014 including prominent Alberta scholars \u2014 recently called on the federal Liberal government to reject bailing out Canada's energy industry, and instead accelerate a green transition.\nThey stressed that\u00a0\"growing demand for climate-friendly energy sources further threatens the viability of high cost, carbon-intensive oilsands production.\"\nIn an email statement to CBC News, Kavi Bal, the senior press secretary with Alberta's Ministry of Energy, said, \"We've always acknowledged the gradual energy transition, but by all accounts, oil and gas will be needed for decades to come \u2014 not just in Alberta, but globally.\"\nIn the same statement, Bal described the academics' open-letter as \"rich,\" noting that the \"Alberta-based signatories benefit from generous salaries, in part, because of the very oil and gas that they denounce.\"\nFor decades, Albertans have talked about economic diversification and energy transition, but the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic has intensified the argument.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs Rahm Emmanuel, former U.S. president Barack Obama's first chief of staff, quipped to the Wall Street Journal, \"you never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\"\nYears ago, energy analysts debated when we'd reach \"peak oil\" or run out of the stuff.\u00a0 Recently, some analysts have wondered when the demand for Alberta's crude will dwindle, replaced by alternative \u2014 greener \u2014 sources of energy. Others study how a balance could be achieved and how the transition could occur.\nRespected Calgary-based energy economist and investment strategist Peter Tertzakian foresees demand for oil returning after social distancing ends, but a \"bruised global economy with soft oil demand is a foregone conclusion.\" \u00a0\nTravel and commuting habits, he contends, may have forever changed because of the pandemic.\nAnd Tertzakian anticipates an acceleration of the renewable energy transition.\n\"I think it's going to happen. I support it,\" he said.\n\"But that should not be confused with the idea of putting the oil and gas industry here to bed.\"\nMorgan Bazilian, a professor of public policy at the Colorado School of Mines and the director of the Payne Institute, which researches public policy on earth resources, energy and the environment, says that the collapse in oil prices and the decline in its demand triggered by the pandemic highlights the need for Alberta to diversify its economy.\nBazilian believes government stimulus packages aimed at kick starting the economy in the wake of the global pandemic need to be balanced between fossil fuels and renewable energy.\u00a0\n\"But simply saying that we will move all the stimulus money on the energy sector to change and become low-carbon right away is unlikely to be the wisest use of the\u00a0\u2026 stimulus money,\" he added.\u00a0\nThe pandemic and the economic fracture it triggered have revealed that there's no \"going back to business as usual,\" predicts\u00a0Severson-Baker, the Alberta regional director for\u00a0Pembina.\u00a0\n\"It'll be a long, slow recovery, if it ever recovers fully,\" for Alberta's energy industry, Severson-Baker added.\n\"And it'll be immediately followed by another decline in demand as a result of the world responding to the challenge of climate change.\"\nIf change is upon us, the question becomes, how to deal with change the right way.\nAcademics have studied historical energy transitions:\u00a0what worked, and what didn't. They have identified some potential roads, and some potential roadblocks, ahead.\nWriting last May in the prestigious journal Nature, several respected energy analysts, including the above mentioned\u00a0Bazilian, described four possible paths to a low-carbon future.\u00a0\nIn the first scenario \u2014 what they call the Big Green Deal \u2014 government policies, investment and global co-operation accelerate a rapid decarbonization. Governments across the world spend billions on renewable energy, and financial markets divest themselves of fossil-fuel assets, reallocating to low-carbon investments.\nIn the second imagined future \u2014 Technology Breakthrough \u2014 significant technological achievements allow renewable energy to displace fossil fuels, mitigating climate change.\u00a0\nIn the third, somewhat dystopian future \u2014 Dirty Nationalism \u2014 populist governments protect the fossil fuel industries in their jurisdictions, fragmenting the global energy market and slowing the transition to a low-carbon economy.\u00a0\nIn the final predicted future \u2014 Muddling On \u2014 the status quo persists. Fossil fuels remain the world's main energy source. Renewable energy claims a share of the energy mix as its costs decline, but not enough to mitigate climate change.\nBazilian, believes the four models still hold up even in a post-pandemic world, adding that the \"dirty nationalism\" model was most closely aligned with the pre-pandemic situation where Saudi Arabia and Russia waged war over oil prices.\nTertzakian, who has written two books about energy transition, stresses that Alberta is already transforming its energy system, pointing out that the province is moving to mothball coal-fired power plants by 2030.\u00a0\nThe long-time energy watcher supports diversifying Alberta's economy and increasing renewable energy use. But he wonders what will replace the economic benefits of the oil industry.\nCanada remains, after all, the fourth largest producer and fourth largest exporter of oil in the world. In 2018, oil and gas extraction alone accounted for more than seven per cent of Canada's total gross domestic product (GDP), and it is our largest export.\n\"The reality is that the bulk of our oil and gas, the vast majority of it is exported and used elsewhere, for which we have substantial economic activity. So merely transitioning to renewables is not going to backfill that economic activity,\" Tertzakian said.\nBazilian says it's important for any energy transition strategy to take care of the people who lose jobs in the planned switch from, for example, coal-fired power plants to renewable power, such as wind-powered turbines.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"You have to think about how it affects society from a social perspective,\" he cautioned.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe speed of change must be handled carefully as well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Pace of change could really have some very negative connotations for citizens\u00a0\u2026 the poor and the marginalized will suffer even more.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nSo how to support both change and people?\nPart of Alberta's plan to reduce its carbon emissions could begin with the existing oil and gas industry.\nThe Pembina Institute's\u00a0Severson-Baker wants the federal government to invest stimulus money in carbon capture and storage and reducing methane emissions from upstream oil and gas production.\nThe energy industry, for its part, says any federal money should also help pay for the reclamation of inactive and orphan wells, creating jobs for out-of-work oil service workers.\nTertzakian expects some of the coming stimulus spending will be directed into renewable energy, such as wind and solar, and into energy efficiency retrofits. But again, he cautions that, in the long run, it won't be enough to replace the economic activity generated by Alberta's oil and gas industry.\u00a0\u00a0\nTertzakian suggests turning to other natural resources, including forestry and agriculture.\nAlberta also has the advantage of relatively low electricity rates that could power newer industries, such as manufacturing and high-tech.\u00a0\n\"Now we have the opportunity to use what we have under our feet and around us to create an economy that is more resilient,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut when you discuss jobs, livelihoods and people, you run into political territory.\nThe CBC News Road Ahead 2020 poll found that, just as the economic impact of COVID-19 was hitting, 54 per cent of Albertans believed oil and gas companies have too much say in Alberta politics.\nSome longtime political watchers say that, even before the coronavirus crisis began, the current provincial government was out of step with Albertans' hopes for energy diversification.\n\"The government is not, I think, listening to the public on these matters,\" said Duane Bratt, the head of the department of economics, justice, and policy studies at Mount Royal University.\nTaking a closer look at the polling data, we can break down Albertans based on their attitudes toward\u00a0both types of energy transition. Almost half (48 per cent) agree with both increasing renewable energy and decreasing oil and gas production. One in three (30 per cent) support more renewables\u00a0but don't want to move away from oil and gas.\u00a0\nContrast that with only 16 per cent of Albertans who are opposed to both types of transition. And a mere two per cent who hold the curious position of wanting less oil and gas\u00a0but not wanting more renewable energy sources.\nSo, the debate isn't about whether Alberta needs more renewable energy. The argument in Albertans' minds is about the extent to which oil and gas remains a part of the province's future.\nThese divergent Alberta opinions on what exactly our next moves should be are something the provincial (and federal) government must grapple with in a post-pandemic economic reality.\u00a0\nCertainly, there are efforts already underway in Alberta to transition toward green energy.\nA spokesperson for the province's minister of energy points out that Alberta already supports renewable energy projects, such as the country's largest solar energy project near Vulcan, south of Calgary.\u00a0\nBut current circumstances could force the UCP to accelerate economic diversification and energy transition, especially if demand for Alberta oil remains soft.\u00a0\nTertzakian thinks economics will ultimately underpin politics.\nHe predicts the UCP will definitely be talking more about diversification in the expected anemic economy that follows the coronavirus.\n\"I don't think it's lost on them,\" he said.\nMethodology:\nThe CBC News\u00a0random survey of 1,200 Albertans was conducted using a hybrid method between March 2 and March 18, 2020, by Edmonton-based Trend Research under the direction of Janet Brown Opinion Research. The sample is representative along regional, age and gender factors. The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For subsets, the margin of error is larger.\nThe survey used a hybrid methodology that involved contacting survey respondents by telephone and giving them the option of completing the survey at that time, at another more convenient time, or receiving an email link and completing the survey online. Trend Research contacted people using a random list of numbers, consisting of half land lines and half cellphone numbers. Telephone numbers were dialled up to five times at five different times of day before another telephone number was added to the sample. The response rate among valid numbers (i.e. residential and personal) was 13.2 per cent.\n"}, {"author": "Tim Querengesser", "title": "OPINION | Why Alberta's cities should prepare for a fight in 2021", "description": "Alberta conservatives have Calgary and Edmonton in their crosshairs for the next municipal elections", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-edmonton-calgary-municipal-election-conservative-tim-querengesser-1.5440233", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5442413.1580165394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/iveson-kenney-nenshi.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 29, 2020 5:00 AM MT", "2020-01-29T15:54:32.558Z"], "source": null, "content": "This column is an opinion from Tim Querengesser, a writer based in Edmonton.\nIn November, Kerry Diotte, the Conservative member of Parliament for Edmonton-Griesbach and a former Edmonton city councillor, sat on a three-person panel in Red Deer tasked with offering fellow conservatives strategies to win municipal elections in 2021.\n\"We should get in front of this,\" Diotte said. \"City councils and school boards are a breeding ground for socialists who will later cause us a lot of trouble.\"\u00a0\nThe Red Deer panel was organized by the Calgary-based Manning Centre. Since 2013, the group has spent money to help conservatives win municipal elections while it has shouted about big city \"waste.\"\nPut these two points together, and add in the anxious talk about party politics that spilled out of a meeting between Alberta mayors and the UCP in Edmonton this month, and you can make an unsettling prediction: Alberta conservatives have Calgary and Edmonton councils in their crosshairs for 2021.\nThis is not good.\nParties are not part of our city elections right now. Talk of parties and municipal councils usually creates debate on the merits or drawbacks. Pro: Voters will know what a candidate supports. Con: Parties stifle independent action.\nBut let's not waste time with this.\nInstead, if the governing UCP or those within its closest orbit descend on the councils of our two big cities in 2021, we have a bigger problem: The economy.\u00a0\nEdmonton and Calgary are home to more than half of Alberta's people and GDP. They are two of the fastest growing large cities in Canada and are central to the province's economic and cultural futures.\nThis puts the contempt many subscribers to the UCP's style of conservatism have for these cities in context. Here, please recall the easily found snark on social media about \"over-caffeinated\" \"urban elites,\" who are not the \"real,\" \"hard-working\" people.\u00a0\nThis camp does not have a viable vision for Edmonton and Calgary. Cuts, heavy-handedness and weakening institutions are not vision.\nOur two big cities, and the province as a whole, need better than austerity. Alberta's collective future is brighter only if its two big cities thrive. That's why Edmonton and Calgary need to fight back in 2021.\u00a0\nSo, what's actually happening?\nFlanking Diotte on the Manning Centre panel, which was called \"Local Councils in 2021,\" were Mike Nickel and Jeromy Farkas. Months after being re-elected to Edmonton council, Nickel ran for a provincial UCP nomination and lost. Farkas, meanwhile, is a conservative councillor in Calgary.\u00a0\nBoth offered their views on how conservatives can win municipal elections.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut beyond their strategizing, telling rhetoric is already flowing from the top.\nRight out of the gate, the UCP government established a pattern of singling out Edmonton and Calgary. Some greatest hits include Municipal Affairs Minister Kaycee Madu taking to Postmedia papers in October to chide the two cities on the \"unsustainable growth\" in their budgets, before cutting their city charters. Another came days later, when Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer kneecapped Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi with the epithet that he's \"Trudeau's mayor.\"\u00a0\nMeddlers are meddling, too. This is nothing new in Calgary but surely is in Edmonton.\nSome city watchers, me included, were taken aback in November when an Edmonton city councillor introduced a motion to explore bus rapid-transit at the eleventh hour of deliberations on an LRT expansion.\nThe LRT project will see the province provide Edmonton with $1.04 billion in capital. The councillor's motion failed in a 10-3 vote. Had it passed, the whole LRT expansion could have tanked, potentially leaving the provincial money unspent.\nThe cynic in me thinks those who pushed the councillor to introduce the motion wanted this exact scenario. The support letter he tabled showed several were conservative donors or fundraisers.\u00a0\nWhat comes next is anyone's guess \u2014 though most share that guess. Indeed, Edmonton mayor Don Iveson spoke last week of his worries about the province meddling in the next election within earshot of reporters.\u00a0\nFellow councillor Andrew Knack took to Twitter and put it even more plainly. \"There is no need for any part of partisan politics to enter municipal government,\" he wrote.\nThey can all see the signs.\u00a0\nIn April, Edmonton will host its first edition of the conservative \"Take Back City Hall\"\u00a0campaign, which was first spawned in Calgary. And multiple sources tell me they've heard about a potential provincial bill, which they expect this spring, that could reopen pathways for big money to flow into campaigns at the municipal level. This bill, they say, could add to the power of political action committees, or PACs.\nSpeaking vaguely to this, Madu said last week that the province is considering changes to the Local Authorities Elections Act, which regulates things like campaign finance rules, but added, \"Our government has no intention to introduce partisan politics into municipal elections.\"\nDespite the minister's assurances, I've spoken to many who expect conservatives to organize campaigns in both cities, likely in the form of slates (an idea that's rare but is used in Vancouver and Montreal).\nThe kicker? Edmonton's Iveson and Calgary's Nenshi are less than certain to seek re-election in 2021.\u00a0\nExpect fireworks.\u00a0\nWhy would Alberta's current brand of conservatives want to influence big-city governments?\u00a0\nI think it's about handcuffs.\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter scrapping their city charters and knocking Edmonton's and Calgary's real power back, the UCP government has now proposed it will force all municipalities to seek provincial approval before entering into agreements with the federal government.\u00a0\nBoth cities have to seek federal contributions to build desperately needed infrastructure and are doing so right now. A proposal that they must first obtain permission to make such deals with Ottawa, mixed with the city charter cuts, is not an idea. It's a set of handcuffs.\u00a0\nYou handcuff what you want to control or feel threatened by.\nEdmonton and Calgary flaunt progressivism. They show that the conservative dominance of the provincial zeitgeist hangs at best by a thread. Edmonton has declared a climate emergency and banned conversion therapy. Calgary has built bike lanes and, well, there's that guy named Nenshi.\nAnd the two mayors are popular. Iveson and his moderate progressive ways won more than 140,000 votes in 2017. Nenshi, who faced down a relatively organized conservative candidate in the form of Bill Smith, nonetheless garnered more than 112,000 votes that year.\u00a0\nFor those counting, the two big-city mayors won roughly 25 per cent as many votes in 2017 as the UCP did in the provincial election in 2019.\u00a0\nAs I say, handcuffs.\u00a0\nWhy should we care?\nIndeed, some will say that Calgary, and most especially Edmonton, need to feel the pain that less urban areas welded to the energy industry have felt for years.\nWe should care if we care about fairness.\n\"The real fiscal imbalance in this country is not between provinces and regions, it's between cities and everyone else,\" said Nenshi recently.\n\"Taxpayers in the cities pay the freight. As recently as 2015, Calgarians sent several billions of dollars a year more to the provincial government than we received back in provincial government benefits and services.\"\nWe should also care because of the provincial economic damage all of this comeuppance will create.\u00a0\nThe energy sector is not creating enough jobs to justify its pre-eminence in our province's concern. While \u2014 to pick but one example from our big cities \u2014 tech is.\nIn Edmonton, the tech sector has added nearly 6,000 jobs since 2014 and grew by 26 per cent. The city's internationally known artificial intelligence cluster has helped see the city rank seventh in Canada for the number of tech graduates it produces yearly.\u00a0\nIf things stay as they are today, will Alberta really be where those graduates work?\nThe UCP government has already given the tech sector its standard fare of cuts and indifference. Though the government has found time and money to send people on junkets to the United Kingdom to lobby for the energy industry, it didn't send a provincial representative \u2014 as every other province did \u2014 to a large tech conference in Las Vegas recently.\nAn Edmonton tech CEO was in Vegas and says he was approached by a Quebec representative to ask about his future plans.\n\"I think they can see when we don't have support or if we're kind of by ourselves,\" he told Global News.\u00a0\nIn a way, what we're seeing play out is almost punishment for success. The economy is working in the wrong place for Alberta: The city.\u00a0\nIn modern Canada, the big city offers options when legacy industries stumble. This is a large reason why more than 80 per cent of Canadians (and indeed, Albertans) now live in an urban setting.\u00a0\nMy own hometown, Kitchener-Waterloo in Ontario, has gone through this cycle.\nMy family's livelihood was once tied to the auto-manufacturing sector. The industry shrunk. Jobs disappeared. And in its place, Kitchener-Waterloo has built a diversified economy, by adding tech.\nManufacturing remains \u2014 Toyota builds SUVs in the region \u2014 but the economy also has Google, Shopify and many other tech names you've never heard of but that are nonetheless hiring thousands of workers.\u00a0\nStill, it might seem logical to cut provincial investment in transit, affordable housing or city-charter transfers to Edmonton and Calgary. Saving a billion on LRT means less taxes, right?\u00a0\nUnfortunately, it doesn't work. The fastest way to build a high-cost, high-tax, deficit-scarred city is to under-invest and let it just grow through sprawl.\nCities are by definition places of collaboration and negotiation. And our biggest cities in Canada are where our economies thrive today.\nEdmonton and Calgary, our big cities in Alberta, thrive if they can collaborate with the province rather than see it knock their power back, handcuff them and seek to meddle in their growth.\u00a0\nThey need a hand up, not handcuffs.\nFor the good of the entire province, our current brand of austerity conservatism should keep out of big-city politics.\nI don't think it will. Which is why Calgary and Edmonton need to prepare to fight back in 2021.\nThis column is an opinion.

It added there are also effects of climate-related investments on growth and employment.\nHamilton said\u00a0environmental regulations targeting emissions can give companies an incentive to invest in knowledge and technology.\n\"That's a big plus,\" he said, adding that such technologies can often then be applied in new ways to other sectors and activities, amplifying the positive impact.\u00a0\nHamilton said\u00a0getting governments worldwide to act on climate change has been hard because reducing greenhouse gas emissions is costly in the short-term, but the impact is uncertain, won't be felt for years, and is spread around the world: \"It looks like a bad deal.\"\nThe deal looks a lot better when co-benefits are taken into account, because their impact tends to be certain, immediate and local, he adds.\nIt's something that policy makers are starting to recognize.\nIn collaboration with the B.C. government's Climate Action Secretariat, Ann Dale, a professor in the School of Environment and Sustainability at Royal Roads University, has mapped some of the co-benefits of climate change action.\nThat way, policy makers will know how to look for and track them \u2014\u00a0the map shows, for example, that greener buildings lead to higher energy efficiency, better water quality, and new job opportunities:\u00a0\"So that you can show to political decision makers it's not jobs versus on the environment \u2014\u00a0there's money to be saved by doing the right thing, and there's benefits to be achieved.\"\nThat said, there can also be tradeoffs between reducing emissions and other environmental goals. For example, the UN report notes that inappropriate use of biofuels or diesel can lead to increased air pollution.\nDale said\u00a0it all points to the importance of more integrated planning by governments. \"What we need them to do is track the costs and benefits when they implement a climate action.\"\nMeanwhile, taking action to adapt to the impacts of climate change can have co-benefits that reduce emissions and also improve quality of life, notes Deborah Harford, executive director of the Adaptation to Climate Change team at Simon Fraser.\nFor example:\nGreen roofs to control flooding and reduce building temperatures can suck up carbon dioxide and also reduce emissions by reducing the demand for air conditioning.\nRestoring wetlands to reduce flooding can sequester carbon and cut emissions by reducing the energy needed to filter and pump stormwater.\nShe said\u00a0so far, the cost and benefits of things like removing or restoring natural infrastructure like wetlands isn't being considered often enough.\nBut it's an idea that's gaining traction, she added.\n\"This new narrative about low-carbon resilience and all the co-benefits is literally emerging now and is actually starting to be taken up very quickly.\"\nOn the flip side, not investing in climate change action could hurt countries economically in the longer term, Harford warned.\nShe thinks given all the benefits, the world would be moving toward greener technologies such as renewable power, albeit more slowly, even if climate change weren't a pressing problem.\n\"Countries that fail to get on this new shift are going to be the ones that are left behind in the new economy,\" she said. \"Because it's coming.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Canada's economy would be less hurt by climate change than other countries, Moody's says", "description": "Consulting firm says climate change will come with winners and losers, economically speaking", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/climate-change-moody-s-1.5199652", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5199836.1562254057!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/europe-weather-france.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 04, 2019 12:32 PM ET", "2019-07-04T17:06:21.233Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Consulting firm Moody's Analytics says climate change will take a heavy toll on the world's economy, but not all countries are likely to pay an equally heavy\u00a0price.\nIn a new report, Moody's tried to assess the economic impacts that would entail if some of the more dire predictions of climate change come to pass in the coming decades. The report is based on the extensive report that the Nobel Prize-winning\u00a0Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change put out last fall, in which the UN agency laid out a number of dire predictions for what may be in store for\u00a0the planet's climate in the years to come.\nThe main takeaway of that report is that it is basically already too late to hold the global temperature rise to just one degree Celsius\u00a0\u2014 and concludes much bigger temperature rises are quickly becoming more likely, if not inevitable.\nThe IPCC report concluded that the economic impact of a two-degree rise in global temperature could be as much as $69 trillion US, and even limiting the rise to 1.5 degrees would come with a $54-trillion price tag.\nThe Moody's report took a deeper dive into those scenarios, and tried to break down how different parts of the planet would see their economies impacted by a hotter climate. Broadly, the Moody's report breaks the impact of a hotter planet\u00a0into six areas:\nMoody's then looked at all those factors, and tried to come up with the likely economic impact based on how bad things get. One scenario assumes the global temperature rises by one degree in the next century. A second assumes an increase of 1.9 degrees. A third assumes a 2.4-degree rise, while the most dire scenario assumes a 4.1-degree average increase.\nAs Moody's crunched the numbers, one trend quickly became clear: emerging economies in parts of the world that are already generally warm fare worse. Bigger, industrialized economies in the northern hemisphere generally fare better.\nIf the more dire predictions come to pass, no country will be hit as hard as Saudi Arabia, by Moody's calculations. \"As the second largest oil producer in the world, Saudi Arabia is the most negatively affected country by climate change. Not only does it get hit on tourism and productivity, but the reduction in oil prices limits government revenue,\" the report says.\nIf the most dire scenario comes to pass, Saudi Arabia's economy will be more than 10 per cent smaller in 2048 than it would otherwise have been. Even under the best case scenario of just a one-degree uptick in temperature, the Saudi economy is expected to be 0.6 per cent smaller than it would otherwise be, three decades from now.\nThe second-most hard hit economy would be Hong Kong, largely because the Chinese territory is expected to lose a lot of valuable real estate to higher sea levels. \"As sea levels rise, and destroyed land cuts rents, weaker income growth results in weaker consumer spending,\" Moody's said.\nAmong large economies, India is hit harder than anyone. Because of the country's large itinerant labour force \"the country suffers greatly from the heat stress impact channel,\" Moody's said. \"Agricultural productivity also falls, and the hit from human health effects is roughly equivalent to the hit from agriculture.\"\nThe impact on China, meanwhile, is\u00a0fairly modest, with a loss of between -0.19 per cent in the best case scenario for the climate, to -0.62 per cent for the worst.\nOther big losers are clustered in Southeast Asia, the Middle East\u00a0and Africa, including Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Kuwait, Indonesia,\u00a0Russia, and Egypt, all of which can expect tough times ahead as the planet warms.\nBut not only will some countries not have to pay as heavy a price, some are poised to actually come out ahead. That's a list that includes Canada. Across all temperature scenarios, Canada's economy is poised to eke out small gains, according to Moody's.\nThat's because when all the changes to things like tourism demand, crop yields and the growing season are factored in, there's a slight net positive.\nAssuming a one-degree rise, Moody's forecasts a Canadian economy that's about the same in 2048 as it would otherwise be. If the impact is 1.9 degrees, the GDP impact inches up to 0.16 per cent. At 2.4 degrees, it's 0.1 per cent. And if the temperature rises by four degrees in the next three decades, Canada's economy is projected to be 0.3 per cent greater than it would otherwise have been.\nThe forecast for the U.S. is a bit of a wash, as the most optimistic temperature increase would hurt the U.S. economy to the tune of 0.9 per cent, while the most dire would see a 0.8 per cent expansion. \"But it would be too simplistic to say that climate change does not hurt the U.S.,\" Moody's said, noting that some parts of the country would be badly hurt by disasters and rising sea levels, whereas others would benefit.\nCanada and the U.S. aren't the only countries to come out relatively unscathed, in the economic aggregate. No country fared better than Luxembourg, where the economy\u00a0is forecast to grow by between 0.45 and 1.07 per cent, across all scenarios.\nBy Moody's own admission, the report doesn't calculate a number of climate change impacts that are likely to affect the economy, including the increased likelihood of expensive natural disasters. The costs of those storms are already enormous, and growing quickly.\u00a0\nAs Moody's notes, \"every dollar that federal lawmakers appropriate for disaster relief is a dollar that could have otherwise been spent on [programs]\u00a0or rebated as a tax cut. Natural disasters drain the federal government of resources and exacerbate the nation's fiscal situation.\"\nNor does Moody's tabulate the economic impact of geopolitical risk from things like\u00a0climate refugees.\n\"Slower economic growth in the most affected countries could prompt residents of those countries to relocate,\" Moody's said. \"If the degree of emigration is large enough, it could put strain on certain countries that are\u00a0receiving the immigrants,\" Moody's said, noting how\u00a0immigration has already become a thorny political issue in the U.S.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world May 13", "description": "Concerns raised about reopening Que. and Ont.; parts of Alta. to relaunch Thursday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-covid19-canada-world-may13-1.5567371", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5568579.1589403472!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-que-20200513.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 13, 2020 9:52 AM ET", "2020-05-14T01:31:53.041Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The latest:\nQuebec on Wednesday relaxed restrictions on some sports, such as tennis and golf, while CBC News has learned that Ontario is preparing\u00a0to announce when it will lift restrictions on construction work and loosen restrictions on most retail shops as part of its reopening plan.\nThese new developments, along with similar ones\u00a0across the country, come as some experts are warning\u00a0about the risks related to reopening amid the pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Institut national de sant\u00e9 publique du Qu\u00e9bec (INSPQ) has published new predictions showing what may happen in Montreal and the rest of Quebec once physical distancing measures are eased.

The amount had been unchanged for 20 years.\nWith restaurants and other institutional food services closed, the dairy industry has been reeling from the collapse in demand for certain dairy products this spring.

County beaches and many city-owned beaches along the coastline reopened Wednesday but with physical distancing rules.\nAlso Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump\u00a0called on governors across the U.S. to work to reopen schools that were closed because of the coronavirus, pointedly taking issue with Dr. Anthony Fauci's caution against moving too quickly in sending students back to class.\n\"I think they should open the schools, absolutely. I think they should,\" Trump told reporters at the White House, echoing comments he had made in a television interview. \"Our country's got to get back and it's got to get back as soon as possible. And I don't consider our country coming back if the schools are closed.\"\nFauci had urged caution in testimony before a Senate committee Tuesday, although he made clear that he believes reopening decisions will likely differ from one region to the next.\nWATCH | Beaches open in California as governor relaxes stay-at-home order:\nSpanish health officials say large-scale testing for the coronavirus\u00a0has demonstrated there is no herd immunity in the country. The head of the National Epidemiology Centre, Marina Pollan, says\u00a0a major\u00a0ongoing survey shows so far that about five\u00a0per cent\u00a0of the population \u2014 around two\u00a0million people \u2014 has been infected by the virus.\nOfficials on Wednesday presented\u00a0preliminary results from the survey of 30,000 households that were tested for the virus. The survey started in the last week of April and is scheduled to last eight weeks. Authorities hope it\u00a0will reveal the true scale of the outbreak, help them monitor its dynamics and steer health policy.\nPollan\u00a0said it has revealed deep regional differences, with the worst-hit areas showing a number of infections five times higher than in the least-affected parts of the country. She said no great difference in infection rates has been detected between age groups or sexes. Spain has recorded at least 27,000 COVID-19 deaths and almost 229,000 cases.\nItaly has approved a massive package of tax cuts and financial aid to help citizens ranging from hotel and restaurant owners to working parents who are struggling with the economic devastation of the pandemic.\u00a0The relief measures, aimed at reducing the damage to Italy's economy, which was already stagnant before the COVID-19 outbreak, have been estimated to cost some 55 billion euros ($84 billion Cdn).\nUnder the package, parents would receive 1,200 euros ($1,830 Cdn) to pay for babysitting or for summer recreation centres, since schools have been shut since March and won't reopen until September.\nChina reported seven new cases Wednesday, six of them in the northeastern province of Jilin where authorities have raised alert levels and suspended rail connections to a county where a cluster of unknown origin has been growing.\nAuthorities in Wuhan, the city where the pandemic began late last year, are preparing to test all 11 million residents for the virus.\u00a0The effort was initiated after a new cluster was discovered, the first local infections the government has reported in Wuhan since before a lockdown was eased in early April.\nChina has reported a total of 4,633 deaths among 82,926 cases.\nNew Zealand dropped most of its lockdown restrictions at midnight Thursday as the South Pacific nation of five million prepared itself for a new normal.\nThe reopening reflects New Zealand's success in its bold goal of eliminating the virus. The country reported no new cases of the virus on Tuesday and Wednesday. More than 1,400 of the nearly 1,500 people who contracted COVID-19 have recovered, while 21 have died.\n"}, {"author": "Murray Brewster, Catharine Tunney", "title": "Trudeau-Trump spat cast a shadow over a summit that got things done, say leaders", "description": "Trump called Trudeau 'two-faced' after the PM was caught talking about the president in a reception video", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nato-summit-leaders-candid-comments-1.5383451", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Dec 04, 2019 6:05 AM ET", "2019-12-04T20:44:35.298Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It was an unguarded misery-loves-company moment that went viral. It\u00a0ended with U.S. President Donald Trump taking another personal shot at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, calling him \"two-faced.\"\nNormally, royal receptions for visiting dignitaries at Buckingham Palace offer media outlets the video equivalent of\u00a0wallpaper: boring, harmless.\u00a0But Tuesday's reception turned into an international incident when video emerged of Trudeau at the reception\u00a0apparently venting to French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson about Trump's unexpected marathon news media availability on Tuesday.\nThe fuss threatened to overshadow the military alliance's 70th anniversary celebrations in London and appears to have driven another personal wedge between Trudeau and the mercurial Trump.\nTrudeau\u00a0attempted to calm the political storm today, saying that he simply expressed surprise to Macron and Johnson at having to conduct a 30-minute press conference with Trump ahead of their bilateral meeting.\nOn the video, Johnson can be heard asking Macron, \"Is that why you were late?\"\n\"He was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference at the top,\" Trudeau is heard\u00a0saying.\nTrump is not mentioned by name in the exchange, but the video provided fodder for more behind-the-scenes and in-front-of-the-camera drama.\nTrudeau said today that the U.S. president caught his own staff off-guard by saying the next G-7 summit will be hosted by the Americans at the presidential retreat at Camp David.\n\"Every different leader has teams whose jaws drop at unscheduled surprises. Like that video itself, for example,\" he said.\nTrudeau's attempt at a walkback did nothing to mollify Trump, who\u00a0took a shot at the prime minister today before leaving the NATO summit early.\n\"He's two-faced,\" Trump said at a media availability with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"I find him to be a nice guy, but the truth is, I called him out on the fact that he's not paying two per cent and I guess he's not very happy about it.\"\u00a0\nTrump appears to believe that Trudeau's quip was a response to an awkward moment during the two leaders' news conference the previous day, when he put the\u00a0prime minister on the spot over whether Canada is meeting its defence spending commitments.\nHe jokingly called Canada \"slightly delinquent\" on meeting NATO's benchmark of spending the equivalent of two per cent of GDP on defence.\nTrudeau said he's confident he still has a good working relationship with Trump.\n\"I think people know that the relationship between Canada and the United States is deep and goes far beyond the relationship between the prime minister and the president, although I will say, as you all know, we have a very good and constructive relationship between me and the president,\"\u00a0Trudeau said.\nThe personal sniping as the NATO meeting ended was an echo of Trump's public meltdown after the Charlevoix G7 in 2018, when the U.S. leader took offence at remarks Trudeau had made at that summit's closing news conference. Back then, Trudeau told journalists Canada would retaliate against U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum products, calling the tariffs \"kind of insulting.\"\nTrump was barely in the air following the summit when he tweeted from Air Force One, accusing Trudeau of\u00a0being \"very dishonest and weak\" and of making up \"false statements.\"\nThe reaction from Trump this time was nowhere near as visceral, even though conservative news outlets in the U.S. have portrayed\u00a0the incident as Trudeau and other world\u00a0leaders laughing behind Trump's back.\nAs with last year's meltdown, the timing of this latest Trump eruption could have been better from a Canadian perspective. The spat blew up\u00a0as the U.S., Mexico and Canada\u00a0have been pushing for the final ratification of the new North American free trade deal \u2014 and after NATO allies had tried to present a united front and smooth over the divisions that marred the run-up to the summit.\nA source in the Canadian government tells CBC News the Trudeau PMO is less concerned about this spat with the president than it was after the\u00a0Charlevoix\u00a0blowup, saying the trade talks are coming to a positive conclusion and the Canada-U.S. relationship is solid.\nPrime Minister Johnson steered around the fallout from the dispute. He declared that the alliance is \"rock solid\" after seven decades and the moments of discord during the summit\u00a0\u2014 including a tense public exchange between Trump and Macron over the Turkish incursion into Syria and the repatriation of ISIS fighters \u2014 were no more than family squabbles.\n\"There is far, far more that unites us than divides us,\" he said.\nNATO Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg downplayed the rifts and focused on the decisions made on Wednesday.\n\"Most of the time we agree and reach concrete conclusions. Sometimes we disagree,\" he said.\n\"And the meeting today was a meeting where there was a good atmosphere. It was very constructive and most importantly it was very productive.\"\nNATO agreed to put more forces on high readiness under the \"four-30s\" plan\u00a0\u2014 a U.S. initiative that requires the alliance to mobilize 30 troop battalions, 30 squadrons and 30 warships within 30 days of an emergency.\nCanada's contribution to the readiness initiative will see the Liberal government add six fighter jets and a frigate to existing NATO deployments.\nThat brings the total Canadian commitment to 12 CF-18s, an expeditionary air task force, a C-140\u00a0maritime patrol aircraft, three frigates, a submarine, a mechanized infantry battalion, a mobile hospital\u00a0and a platoon for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear decontamination.\nTrudeau promised the government would provide the\u00a0necessary funds to ensure the units are trained and deployable on short notice.\nStolenberg also said NATO has declared that all 29 member countries would agree to use secure wireless telecommunications networks \u2014 a nod to American concerns about the Chinese tech giant\u00a0Huawei and the security of the soon-to-be built 5G network service.\nCanada has yet to decide whether it will ban Huawei\u00a0from participating in building the system here.\nAlliance delegates also talked about bringing\u00a0China into the international arms control framework, pointing to the superpower-in-waiting's massive military expansion.\nBack in Ottawa, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer cited the NATO summit video in a speech to his caucus.\n\"At a time when Canada needs strong relationships more than ever, Justin Trudeau's poor judgment, lack of professionalism and love of drama continues to weaken Canada's position on the world stage,\" Scheer said, as assembled Tory MPs yelled, \"Shame!\"\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also seized on the moment, saying Trudeau has a record of saying one thing in public and something else behind closed doors.\n\"There's many reasons to criticize Mr. Trump, but criticizing about making someone late to a cocktail party is not one,\" he said.\nDavid MacNaughton, Canada's former ambassador to the U.S., said the video gaffe must not be allowed to distract from efforts to get the trade deal ratified.\n\"The most important thing in the relationship is getting the USMCA passed,\" he told CBC, using the Americans' preferred title for the new North American free trade agreement. \"And we shouldn't be distracted by this kind of stuff. We should get the deal done.\n\"The Mexicans know what they have to do to get this across the finish line, and they should just do it.\"\nThe deal has stalled in the U.S. Congress, where Democrats have been pushing for stricter enforcement measures on its labour and environmental standards. The American labour movement fears U.S. jobs will continue to head south if Mexico doesn't raise wages and bring in collective bargaining in a timely manner.\n\"What the Democrats have asked for in terms of enforceability, and what [U.S. Trade Representative Robert] Lighthizer has asked for in terms of enforceability, is what they're going to have to do to get this thing done,\" said MacNaughton.\n\"I know it's interesting, speculating ... and gossip and everything else, but it isn't actually enduring.\"\n.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JustinTrudeau</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EmmanuelMacron</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a> and other VIPs shared a few words at a Buckingham Palace reception Tuesday.

Not a bad way to describe Alberta and Saskatchewan.\nSir Frederick Haultain, the first premier of the North-West Territories, argued the territory that went on to become the two provinces in 1905\u00a0should enter Confederation as one province named Buffalo\u00a0\u2014\u00a0an idea Sir Wilfrid Laurier rejected.\nAs former Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall says, \"It's on the record, maybe quite prescient, that the province, if it was admitted as recommended, would rival the centre for economic and political influence.\"\nWall recalls that the unofficial motto in Saskatchewan is \"hard to spell but easy to draw,\" referring to the straight line between the two provinces. But that line is a bit more blurry to the eye these days as a combination of factors \u2014 political, economic and social \u2014 has been working to reconstruct the \"Buffalo\" Haultain envisioned.\nSaskatchewan got out of the Confederation gate with the kind of alacrity that Alberta could only dream of. Its population growth was explosive in the early years, easily outpacing its neighbour to the west.\nA rich deposit of oil, discovered in Leduc, Alta., in 1947, changed all that. The trajectories shifted dramatically to where Alberta now has four times the population with a GDP that is more than four times the size.\nPolitical scientist Duane Bratt with Calgary's\u00a0Mount Royal University\u00a0argues this is why any alignment or alliance can't really be a partnership of equals. But he says it can still serve both.\n\"Saskatchewan benefits by having the greater heft of Alberta, and Alberta has the benefit of saying it's not just us.\"\nFor years, Saskatchewan was little more than a source of labour for an Alberta with the kind of swagger only wealth can buy. It must have been irritating.\nSaskatchewan was acknowledged for its role in creating social programs like medicare, but was an economic afterthought.\nAs Wall puts it, \"We saw so many Saskatchewan people seeking opportunity in Alberta. You know, that's the origins of the roots of the joke, or I guess the one-liner, about how McMahon Stadium, when the Riders are in town, is maybe the third-largest city in Saskatchewan.\"\nOil and gas, potash, uranium and gold finally helped Saskatchewan graduate out of \"have not\" status. The province no longer receives equalization \u2014\u00a0a word and a program that can make the staunchest Canadian recoil and retreat from the inevitable misinformation and inflamed rhetoric it engenders.\nBecoming a \"have\" province changed everything. Saskatchewan has embraced its heightened hubris and has joined the fight with Alberta.\nWhat is the fight all about? It's essentially about resource-based economies without sufficient electoral power within the federation. It's about being, in the view of the political leadership of Alberta and Saskatchewan, lectured and hectored about the source of their wealth and its impact on the climate, with little consideration to the realities of the economies and their respective contributions for the federal bottom line.\nAdam Legge, the head of the Business Council of Alberta, summarizes it this way: \"I think both Albertans and Saskatchewanians feel that many parts of the country are very happy to take the money that's transferred to them through the wealth generated out of our provinces, but are also very happy to obstruct the further development and progress of those sectors across the country.\"\nIt is for this reason that \"Buffalo\" has found common cause, according to Legge.\n\"It's easier to dismiss one voice,\" he says. \"Aligned voices of the two provinces, I think, can bring some additional heft.\"\nWall says each province has made different choices politically and economically that allowed Saskatchewan to lose its early advantage. Although the two provinces diverged in their paths for decades, this year's federal election results intensified an alliance that has been building over the past dozen years or so.\nWall was often emblematic of that alliance, even though \u2014 as premier \u2014 he never shied away from trying to lure people and businesses to move from Alberta to Saskatchewan.\nDuring the early years of Rachel Notley's time as Alberta's premier, before she got her elbows up when advocating for the oil and gas sector, Wall was, for many conservatives, the de facto political spokesperson for the energy industry.\nIn my conversation with him, he refers to \"Buffalo\" easily and often.\u00a0 (The word was also chosen for the name of the Buffalo Project, a conservative-leaning political action committee he helped get off the ground.)\nWall points out that Alberta and Saskatchewan have come together many times before in times of crisis, including the fight against the National Energy Program, in which Saskatchewan's NDP premier, Allan Blakeney, supported Alberta's PC premier, Peter Lougheed. It happened again during the fight for the notwithstanding clause in the constitution.\nWall says, \"I think there have been occasions throughout our history where\u00a0I'll call it the spirit of Buffalo, that place that was supposed to be both provinces together, was manifest in governments that didn't agree on everything ideologically, but understood their interests were aligned.\"\nThat alignment, that alliance, is hardening.\nSoon after the votes were counted in the federal election, and Saskatchewan and Alberta went blue with the lonely exception of one NDP seat in Edmonton, premiers Scott Moe and Jason Kenney each sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with a list of demands that were similar in content and tone.\nThose demands included getting the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion built, ensuring more pipelines can follow, equalization reform and scrapping the federal carbon tax.\nSince then, some language has changed.\nSaskatchewan is now asking for a one-year reprieve from the carbon tax. An equalization re-write is on pause and the more immediate request is for some kind of rebate or payment on a per-capita basis to resource-based economies.\nAs Wall says, \"If they propose some non-constitutional things to the federal government and they have an earnest partner, then the two of them could get a lot done. And I think that might alleviate some of the alienation ... the pressure that's building.\"\nWall seems to believe, based on his observations post-election, that Trudeau might be on the cusp of a kind of epiphany.\n\"I saw, for the first time that I could remember, maybe some humility. Or he was chastened, or something. But I just sensed that this might be different, that he wasn't just expressing words or thoughts and prayers for the West, but a desire to reach out. And, if he does, I think he'll find in those two premiers willing partners who are also federalists,\" says Wall.\nBut these \"federalists\" have also been among the loudest voices warning of a unity crisis.\nCritics have characterized it as stoking a separatist sentiment. Others have argued that both Kenney and Moe are simply reflecting a deepening and dark angst and sounding the alarm. No one disagrees that there is a strong feeling of alienation, anger and anxiety in both provinces.\nA recent Wexit rally attracting several hundred people in Edmonton is seen as a warning shot.\nIt's proving to be a struggle for business and political leaders to quantify and respond to voices growing louder and demanding a more radical reaction to perceived inequity in the federation.\nHowever, as Legge from the Business Council of Alberta says:\u00a0\"The escalating rhetoric around alienation and separation might bring the parties to the table in a more constructive way. It might not. I don't know.\"\nThat sense of uncertainty is shared.\n\"I'm sensing an intensity to it here that I have not witnessed,\" says Wall. \"I hear it from people who I know are federalists, they're proud Canadians \u2026 with disappointment and sadness as a tone, saying, 'No I don't know. I don't know what else we're going to do here ... What we should do?'\"\n\"This \u2026 is different somehow,\" Wall adds.\n\"I should be doing a better job of explaining why it's different. But that's the best I can do.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The candidates: Great Slave", "description": "Patrick Scott, Katrina Nokleby face off for seat vacated by former minister Glen Abernethy", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-votes-great-slave-candidates-1.5281945", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5285788.1568664617!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/great-slave.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 16, 2019 10:00 PM CT", "2019-09-17T04:00:00.878Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Election day in the Northwest Territories is Oct. 1, and CBC North is working to bring you all the information you need to cast your ballot.

There was little progress on social issues, a\u00a0collapse of economic activity, and little movement on environmental concerns, except for a tax.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\u00a0\u00a0\nI have negotiation\u00a0and community development experience, as well as media and advocacy work for injured workers with WSCC. I have raised eight children in YK and I am a small business owner.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\u00a0\u00a0\nBirchwood Coffee Ko (Scott is a co-owner).\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's a split between economic renewal through diversification, and resolving social issues such as universal daycare, homelessness, and seniors' housing..\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\u00a0\nFrom speaking with constituents at their door\u00a0\u2014\u00a0homelessness, downtown violence, and the cost of living.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\u00a0\nBuilding appropriate homes for homeless support, with programs, and getting the polytechnic university developed as an independent institution from the GNWT with\u00a0northern-focused faculties, including a fine arts department.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\u00a0\u00a0\nMore renewable energy, and to\u00a0get fly-in\u00a0mine workers living in the N.W.T. and making a contribution to the northern economy while reducing the carbon footprint.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\u00a0\nIf you mean the Legislative Assembly, I believe we need to look at our political system and vision and design what will be the best structure for the future.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\u00a0 \nDiversify, encourage e-commerce developments, improve tourism infrastructure, and build a world-class university.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\u00a0\nSettle outstanding claims, work directly with GNWT.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\nHaven't decided. It\u00a0will depend on who all is elected.\nWould you like to be premier?\nNot ready for that at the moment.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nYellowknife is my home and I love the North. I want to ensure that the N.W.T. is on a path toward a sustainable economy while addressing the social issues we are facing. With a strong background in sciences, experience working across the N.W.T., and my social advocacy background, I will bring a unique skill set to the Legislative Assembly. Through the sciences, I have learned critical thinking, problem solving, the analyzing of data, and attention to detail.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nI've been heavily involved with a variety of organizations during my time in Yellowknife including NAPEG (the regulatory body for Engineering and Geoscience), the YWCA-NWT, Girl Guides, the Association of Consulting Engineering Companies, and others.\nBeing on boards and councils has provided me with valuable tools such as the ability to work well in a collaborative, group setting; fiscal and budgeting knowledge; and strategic planning. My work as an environmental consultant has provided me with experience working across the territory on a variety of project sites and in the communities. I've worked closely with Indigenous people throughout my career which has given me a deep appreciation and respect for them as I see the struggles the communities are facing and the want for change.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nI'm most proud of the volunteering I do in our community, such as the time I spend with the Girl Guides. I believe in the adage you can't be what you can't see, and it's important to me that I be a role model to interest young people in STEM.\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nOur economy. Without a robust economy, the N.W.T. will not be able to pay to solve the wide range of social issues facing our territory. The Conference Board of Canada has reported we are on the edge of an economic downturn in the N.W.T. while the Yukon and Nunavut are growing. We need to be active participants in the development of the Arctic in order to safeguard it for future generations and to ensure the people of the Northwest Territories benefit.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nAs Great Slave borders Yellowknife Centre, I believe the situation in the downtown is one of the biggest issues for residents in my riding. Many have expressed concern for what they believe is a worsening problem and want the 19th Assembly to effect real change in this area.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nWe are one of the only jurisdictions in this country that ships some of our most vulnerable citizens, who are struggling with mental health and addictions, to other parts of Canada. The Northwest Territories has no comprehensive relapse prevention program.\nIf elected, I will advocate for a review of current practices and work toward\u00a0change for the better. We need to engage front-line workers and those administering policies for their input as to how to serve our vulnerable citizens better.\nUltimately, I would like to see a treatment centre\u00a0in the N.W.T. that includes aftercare programs and family trauma counselling.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nIn order to reduce the territory's diesel dependency, I believe we need to explore more green energy options such as community-specific, hybrid energy systems and the possible expansion of Taltson. We also need to expand our all-weather road system and ensure that our transportation system can withstand future climate uncertainty.\nEach year, our ice roads are becoming more unpredictable, and without ice roads our communities become stranded with the cost of airfare prohibitive for most residents.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\u00a0\nI believe the government needs to work harder on the collection of data and statistics regarding programming and policy and then use that data to make better informed decisions. We need to look at improving the efficiency with how we operate the territory and we need to solicit feedback from end-users and experts when making decisions that affect their lives and work. It appears that communication between departments could be improved to streamline processes and reduce costs.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nMining is over 30 per cent\u00a0of our GDP and with the diamond mines set to close within the decade, we need to act now to stimulate exploration. When speaking with exploration companies, I hear mining companies are not interested in the N.W.T. because they have sustainability mandates for their mines to be powered with cleaner energy. When all we have to offer is diesel operations, exploration companies can't sell their finds.\nWe must remember we are competing for mining dollars in a global economy and must make investment here enticing. This could be done by investing in infrastructure such as all-weather roads to reduce shipping costs and green energy sources.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nI would make sure I listened more than I spoke. There seems to be a real disconnect between the government and the Indigenous people of this territory. We need to move away from a colonial mentality when dealing with the First Peoples of this land.\nI have often been told when working in the communities that people don't feel that they are heard. I would work hard to be a bridge builder and advocate for the Indigenous people of this territory, rather than speak for them.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position? \nI think it's premature to decide this now.

It will take place in the modern surroundings of the new King Abdullah Financial District, with 59 towers and a few architectural wonders.\nBut for a taste of the real Saudi Arabia, summiteers need only take\u00a0a cab\u00a0south on King Fahd Road. In about half an hour they'll come to Deera Square, colloquially known as 'Chop-chop Square' for its frequent public executions.\nDespite praise from western governments for his supposedly modernizing ways, Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (often known as MBS) has overseen a near-doubling in the number of executions.\nThe swordsmen were busy on April 23, when Saudi Arabia executed 37 people in one day. All but four were members of the country's persecuted Shia minority.\u00a0The body and severed head of one of the 37 was put on public display.\nThe next group of condemned individuals\u00a0set for execution\u00a0in Saudi Arabia includes Murtaja Qureiris, who has been in prison since the age of 13. He's\u00a0accused of crimes that include leading a protest of children on bicycles during the Arab Spring movement\u00a0\u2014\u00a0when he was ten.\nMany of those executed in Saudi Arabia are poor foreigners. Saudi Arabia has sentenced people to die in recent years for such crimes as witchcraft, making potions and predicting the future. Under MBS, political opponents of the royal family have made up a large percentage of those executed.\nBut\u00a0the killing that made Saudi Arabia uniquely controversial as a site for a G20 summit was \u2014\u00a0unlike the ones in Deera Square\u00a0\u2014 never meant to be seen by the wider world.\nJamal Khashoggi's murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\u00a0has been a public relations disaster for a kingdom that has worked hard to present a face to the world very different from the one it shows at home.\nAccording to the report of UN\u00a0special rapporteur Agnes Callamard, Turkish microphones captured the killing and dismemberment of Khashoggi,\u00a0while his fiancee waited outside for him, unaware. Turkish cameras captured one of Khashoggi's killers leaving the consulate wearing the dead man's clothes.\nAnd Turkish wiretaps captured the communications between the hit squad and home base, leading foreign intelligence services to conclude that the murder realistically could not have been carried out without the approval of Mohammed bin Salman.\nThe prince's response was to deny everything and arrest the hitmen. Riyadh has made it clear that, if found guilty, they too will be headed for Chop-chop Square.\nCallamard said the Saudi investigation can't be expected to produce a true or just outcome. She wants to see a credible probe that assigns individual responsibility and examines the role of prime suspect Mohammed bin Salman.\n\"The holding of the G20 in Saudi Arabia next year is a slap in the face of all those who have fought and some of whom have died for accountability and human rights protections,\" she told CBC News, calling for the summit to be moved.\nCallamard said she admires the positions that Canada has taken on Saudi Arabia, particularly when compared to those taken\u00a0by other western nations.\n\"Canada has already taken possibly the strongest stance on Saudi Arabia and has paid a heavy price for it,\" she said.\u00a0\"The international community as a whole failed to support Canada a year or so ago when it criticized Saudi Arabia for its treatment of women activists.\"\nCallamard said Canada also has \"taken a number of stands when it comes to accountability for Mr.\u00a0Khashoggi. I think the government of Canada has probably taken the strongest stance against Saudi Arabia of all western countries, alongside with maybe Germany.\"\nIt was at the G20 Summit in Argentina in November 2018 that the crown prince made his first international appearance after the murder. Most leaders steered clear of him. Some, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, were friendly. But only one, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, spoke to him directly about the killing.\n\"It's important that Canada exercise leadership as it has so far,\" said Callamard. \"But it cannot do that on its own. Other countries must rally around Canada in a way that they haven't done so far.\"\nThe Trudeau government says it intends to keep speaking out about Saudi Arabia, but Canada is not prepared to skip the G20 summit to show its disapproval.\n\"The G20 provides a forum for Canada and its partners to take concerted action on some of the world's most pressing challenges,\" said Adam Austen, spokesman for Global Affairs. \"Canada supports the important inquiry of Agnes Callamard ... into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. This murder was an unconscionable attack on the freedom of expression of all individuals and on the freedom of the press.\n\"The explanations provided by Saudi Arabia to date are insufficient. We continue to call for a full, international independent investigation into the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\"\nCBC News also asked the Conservative Party if a Prime Minister Andrew Scheer would attend the summit \u2014 which happens after the coming\u00a0federal election \u2014 but the answer wasn't quite\u00a0clear.\n\"Conservatives have always been clear and consistent when it comes to the promotion of human rights in Saudi Arabia, China or any other country,\" said foreign affairs critic Erin O'Toole. \"We will raise these issues at the G20, the United Nations or any other multilateral gathering where members do not support human rights, the rule of law and the democratic freedom. The Trudeau Liberals have not been consistent in this regard and are not taken seriously on the world stage.\"\nAsked whether that meant the Conservatives would show up in Riyadh, party spokesperson Mey Fung replied: \"We haven't said that.\"\nGuy Caron, the NDP foreign affairs critic, said in a statement that Canada shouldn't take part in the Riyadh summit.\n\"When the Liberal government was elected in 2015, it promised the return of Canadian leadership on the international stage,\" Caron said.\u00a0\"Yet, more than eight months after committing to review arms export permits to Saudi Arabia, the government is still unable to give a timetable. In the meantime, Canadian weapons are fuelling the crisis in Yemen.\"\nCaron went on to say that the Liberals are \"not doing much better than the Conservatives before them.\"\n\"The atrocities committed by the Saudi regime are not consistent with Canadian values. Canada should not take part in the upcoming G20 summit in Riyadh. The Canadian government must stand up and reclaim its international leader status.\"\nDennis Horak, Canada's former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, was expelled during last year's diplomatic spat with the kingdom. He\u00a0told CBC News he feels that avoiding the summit, or trying to move it elsewhere,\u00a0would be an \"empty gesture.\"\n\"What would be the objective? What would we be trying to achieve?\" he asked.\n\"Normally when you put sanctions on a country or punish them in some way, it's because you're trying to get them to do something. What is that something we want them to do? Are we looking for them to remove the crown prince and put him on trial? Because that's not going to happen.\"\nThe G7, which Canada hosted last year in La Malbaie, Que., has always been a club for advanced economies that are also democracies. China has never been invited to join. Russia was expelled for bad behaviour (the annexation of Crimea) in March 2014.\nThe Group of 20, on the other hand, was never supposed to be about democracy. It was born as a leaders' summit in 2008 (previous meetings had been at ministerial level only), to provide a forum where the rich western democracies could engage with some of the biggest developing nations and emerging economies\u00a0\u2014 countries like Indonesia, India, Turkey, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico.\nA quick glance at the recent family photo in Osaka shows that the current crop of leaders is not limited to fans of democracy and civil rights. In addition to MBS, there is one other unelected autocrat:\u00a0President Xi Jinping of China, who hosted the G20 in Hangzhou in 2016.\nPutin's government is believed to have ordered several deadly attacks on\u00a0dissidents. Philippines President\u00a0Rodrigo Duterte has bragged about shooting people and throwing them out of helicopters during his time as a crime-busting mayor in Davao City.\nA willingness to rub shoulders with autocrats and killers is the price of bringing together leaders who represent,\u00a0in whatever fashion, most of the world's people and GDP.\nBut never has the group had to assemble in a venue as controversial as Riyadh. And few other members of the Group of 20 have had as rocky a recent relationship with the kingdom as Canada.\nWhile male visitors to Saudi Arabia may have to swallow their principles, women face additional challenges\u00a0\u2014 including the question of what to wear in a country where even the most conservative western clothing is considered immodest.\nRiyadh is one of the few places in the Muslim world where most women cover their faces in public.\nConversations with female members of the Trudeau government who might expect to attend the G20 reveal that they are already thinking about how to strike a balance between showing respect for local practices\u00a0and upholding their own beliefs. At the same time, they're aware that avoiding the event entirely would leave the G20\u00a0even more male-dominated than usual.\n"}, {"author": "Kazi Stastna", "title": "Emboldened by impending acquittal, Trump uses state of the union as stump speech", "description": "An emboldened U.S. president sees little reason to reach across the aisle", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/state-of-the-union-highlights-1.5452391", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5452412.1580908311!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-trump-speech.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Feb 05, 2020 10:35 AM ET", "2020-02-06T00:30:25.588Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Emboldened by an impending acquittal in his impeachment trial, a sputtering start to the Democratic caucuses\u00a0and his\u00a0highest\u00a0approval ratings\u00a0to date,\u00a0U.S. President Donald Trump gave a rousing state of the union address Tuesday aimed squarely at his base.\nThe mood may have started out ceremonial and civil in the hallways of the Capitol, but it became decidedly less so inside the House, culminating in a walkout by several Democratic legislators and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ripping up her copy of Trump's speech, later labelling it a \"manifesto of mistruths.\"\nWhile state\u00a0of the union addresses are supposed to unify the nation and energize supporters, Trump's speech tilted toward the latter while avoiding even a nod to his impeachment.\u00a0\n\"It was really a campaign speech,\" said Meena Bose, executive dean for public policy and public service programs at Hofstra University in New York state.\u00a0\n\"It's consistent with the kind of turbulent times that we're in. I think bipartisanship may be a bridge too far in 2020.\"\nThe evening\u00a0had all the trappings of a Trump rally, including\u00a0chants of \"USA, USA!\" interspersed with\u00a0\"Four more years!\" One of the\u00a0more bizarre displays of pageantry of the night was\u00a0a tribute to conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, who was recently diagnosed with cancer and received a Presidential Medal of Freedom partway through the speech.\nHere are a few key themes that emerged from the state of the union.\nWATCH | Speaker Nancy Pelosi can't hide her disdain\u00a0and rips up her copy of Trump's state of the union address:\nTrump had lots to brag about: U.S. unemployment is at a 50-year low, wages are rising and the stock market is booming. But economists warn that there are some shades of grey to Trump's \"blue-collar boom.\"\nThe corporate tax cuts passed two years ago generated a fiscal stimulus and job growth, but they haven't spurred businesses to invest. Economic growth, at 2.1 per cent last quarter, has been more modest than the four to six per cent Trump promised at the start of his presidency.\u00a0\n\"[Companies] have literally trillions of dollars on their balance sheets that they could invest if they wanted to. What they're doing instead is they're buying back their stock,\" said Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C.\nWATCH | 'This is a blue-collar boom': Trump points to employment gains across the board:\nWhile that might benefit the markets, the biggest boost from that boom has gone to the wealthiest 10 per cent of Americans,\u00a0who own more than 80 per cent of stocks.\nThe deregulation Trump highlighted in the speech has had a positive impact on investment and job creation in some sectors, but carries an environmental cost, which got no mention.\nAlso noticeably absent was any mention of the country's $1-trillion US deficit and the more than $23 trillion in debt, which is expected to reach 98 per cent of GDP by 2030.\nThe new NAFTA and the recently negotiated first phase of a trade deal with China are big talking points for Trump, and Tuesday night was no exception.\nBut Trump's take-no-prisoners approach to trade wars is widely seen as having a negative impact not just on the U.S. economy\u00a0but the global trading system.\nRetaliatory tariffs on steel, aluminum and other products have hurt the U.S. manufacturing sector, which is technically in a recession, and the agricultural sector, which in 2019 saw the highest number of farm bankruptcies in eight years.\u00a0\nWATCH | Trade tariffs a hallmark of Trump economy:\nThe unpredictable nature in which Trump wields tariffs as a negotiating tactic has injected uncertainty into the supply chain and made businesses reluctant to make long-term investments.\n\"Business confidence has fallen across the board and not just in tradable sectors,\" said Kirkegaard.\nOn Tuesday, Trump touted those tariffs, saying \"our strategy has worked\" and calling the recently signed deal with China \"groundbreaking.\"\nBut Kirkegaard and others say the deal is more of a detente\u00a0and it's gains are modest. It still preserves about $360 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, for one, and allows China to keep subsidizing some industries.\nA ceremony at the White House can't hide the stark truth about the \"phase one\" China trade deal: The deal does absolutely nothing to curtail China's subsidies to its manufacturers. All those \"forgotten men and women\" in U.S. factories have, once again, been forgotten.\nHealth care has been a differentiating issue in the Democratic race for president, and Trump seized on the Medicare for All policies that some Democrats have been advocating.\n\"One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our health care system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans,\" he said.\u00a0\nWATCH | Trump attacks Democrats' 'socialist takeover' of health care:\nHe warned that the coverage for undocumented immigrants that such plans include would \"raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors\" and drew a line in the political sand: \"If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free health care to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left.\"\nTrump stretched the truth several times in this part of his speech, vowing, for example, to protect patients with pre-existing conditions, which is a protection guaranteed under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act that has been challenged under the Trump administration.\nShefali Luthra of Kaiser Health News, who was fact-checking the speech for the\u00a0PolitiFact\u00a0website, also found that his claims about drug prices falling last year did not pass muster.\u00a0\n\"Prices may be stabilizing, but they are not coming down, and consumers are not experiencing that relief,\" she wrote.\nOn immigration, Trump repeated some familiar refrains that have defined his rhetoric on the issue since the 2016 presidential campaign, highlighting specific cases of violent crimes committed by \"illegal aliens\"\u00a0and decrying \"radical politicians\" who have declared their cities sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants.\nHe gave an accurate picture of the decrease in illegal border crossings in the last eight months \u2014 although the total for 2019 was still the highest since 2007 \u2014 but was less forthcoming about the wall on the Mexico-U.S. border that he has been promising since the start of his presidency.\nWATCH | Trump promises overhaul of immigration system:\nTrump told the assembled audience\u00a0that 100 miles (161 km) have been \"completed,\" when in fact all but one mile of that was a rebuild\u00a0of existing barriers.\u00a0The additional 500 miles (805 km) he has promised by the end of the year could face hurdles when it comes to acquiring the private land needed to build even a semi-contiguous barrier along the southwest border.\n\"It's more of a symbol than a reality,\" said Ryan Streeter, director of domestic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \"Most Americans don't really know what the administration is constructing along the border.\"\nTrump didn't shy away from some of the most polarizing wedge issues:\u00a0from abortion to religion to guns to Supreme Court judges.\n\"He really doubled down on all of them,\" said Scott Anderson, a governance studies fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"He sees where his bread is buttered. He's going back to his base.\"\nAnderson and other observers see it as a sign of what's to come in an election campaign catering to an electorate nearly evenly divided along partisan lines.\n\"If you're running to your base in the state of the union, which is usually an effort to put forward a kind of broad-based positive vision that a lot of voters can sign on to, then when you're in the middle of a more committed political race, you're definitely running to the base.\"\u00a0\nTrade, specifically the Canada-U.S.-Mexico deal, known as CUSMA or USMCA, was one area where it was thought Trump might highlight the bipartisanship that went into reaching a consensus.\u00a0But that didn't happen.\nNational security came up in the latter half of the 80-minute-long speech and contained few surprises. Trump highlighted the foreign policy accomplishments most observers had anticipated he would: the recently announced Israeli-Palestinian peace plan and the assassinations of Iranian Maj.-Gen Qasem Soleimani and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\nAs in other parts of the speech, Trump used the personal\u00a0stories of some of his invited guests to underscore policy accomplishments \u2014 in this case, the presence of Carl and Marsha Mueller, whose daughter Kayla, an American aid worker, was held captive in Syria by ISIS and killed in 2015.\nIn one orchestrated reveal worthy of day-time TV, he brought out a returning soldier to be reunited with his young family\nWATCH | Trump's vow to bring troops home earns applause:\nPerhaps sobered by the recent escalation of tensions with Iran, Trump struck somewhat of a conciliatory tone, urging the regime not to be \"too proud or too foolish\" to ask for help with the country's flagging economy. \"We are here,\" Trump said, while at the same time warning Iran to \"stop spreading terror, death\u00a0and destruction.\"\nAlthough he avoided explicitly mentioning the controversial withdrawal of troops from Syria, which some in his administration criticized as premature, Trump highlighted the need to draw down American troops abroad, specifically in Afghanistan.\n\"It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies,\" he said. \"We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home.\"\nIt's an issue that would have resonated with a wide swath\u00a0of Americans eager to disentangle from the protracted conflict, said Bose.\u00a0Trump punctuated it\u00a0with a signature\u00a0made-for-TV moment, reuniting\u00a0a young military family live on air in the middle of the state of the union address.\nOne foreign policy surprise was the presence of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader who had been in Miami days earlier rallying support to his cause.\nHe was an odd choice of guest at an event touting policy wins, given that his year-long attempt to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro has thus far been unsuccessful, despite support from the U.S., Canada and other Western nations, who've declared him the rightful president.\nGuaido's\u00a0presence, as well as\u00a0Trump's earlier reference to reversals of the \"failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba,\" might score him points with\u00a0Latino voters in the key swing state of Florida come November.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world April 22", "description": "Ontario now 2nd province seeking military help in care homes; COVID-19 deaths top 2,000 in Canada", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-covid19-april22-canada-world-1.5539330", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Apr 22, 2020 7:49 AM ET", "2020-04-23T05:57:36.430Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The latest:\u00a0\nCanada hit a grim milestone Wednesday\u00a0as the number of deaths across the country from COVID-19\u00a0exceeded 2,000, and later the number of overall cases topped 40,000.\u00a0More than half of the\u00a0deaths have come in long-term care homes, which have been hard hit by the pandemic, particularly in Quebec and Ontario.\u00a0\nThe news came as\u00a0Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced\u00a0he will be calling in the military to help deal with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis in the province's long-term care homes.\u00a0\nFord says he will formally request extra resources from the federal government today, including from the Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Forces personnel, specifically to help in five priority homes. He compared the situation in long-term care settings to a \"raging wildfire\" during his Wednesday news conference.\nCanadian Forces personnel have already been deployed to Quebec to help out in the hard hit long-term care facilities there. On Wednesday, Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said he's asked the federal government to send 1,000 additional soldiers to help staff the\u00a0 institutions.\nLegault told reporters at his daily briefing that he made the request because the province has not been able to find enough trained workers to meet the system's immediate needs, even after bringing in 350 medical specialists, as well as other nurses from elsewhere and nursing students.\nThe number of residences in Quebec considered to be in a \"critical situation\" nearly doubled in the past week, going from 41 to 80.\u00a0\nIn all, approximately 850 of the 1,041 people who have died from COVID-19 in Quebec were residents of CHSLDs or seniors' homes.\nIn Ontario, 128 residences are currently dealing with active COVID-19 outbreaks. As of today, there have been at least 448 deaths in long-term care amid outbreaks at 127 facilities.\nOntario is also expanding COVID-19 testing to every resident and worker in long-term care homes.\nDr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician at Toronto's Sinai Health System, says testing is only one part of the problem.\n\"We can test everyone and have the info to show the extent of the problem, but can you actually act on that information?\" he said in an interview with CBC News. \"Do you actually have the space to isolate people so that you're not causing more spread within the home?\n\"Do you have the personal protective equipment\u00a0to support having staff members go between residents' rooms? Do you have the health and human resources to provide the care that they need?\"\nWATCH | Dr.\u00a0Nathan Small says not enough attention was given to long-term care homes during pandemic planning.\u00a0\nSpeaking at the daily briefing by cabinet members and federal health officials, Tam again said that continued vigilance is essential and highlighted the continued concern around long-term care facilities.\n\"As we continue to make progress in slowing the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing some bumps in the road that remind us we can't let down our guard.\"\nTam said protections are also needed at other high-risk settings where people live in close contact and share common spaces, citing seniors' homes and homeless shelters.\nWATCH | WHO's Dr. Mike Ryan says countries will need to figure out how to minimize risk in long-term care homes:\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday reiterated that the federal government is talking with provinces\u00a0around support for long-term care homes, which are provincially regulated. Trudeau last week said the federal government was planning to consult with the provinces on topping-up wages of lower paid essential workers, but it's not yet clear how or when that might happen.\nTrudeau also said the federal government is co-ordinating\u00a0with provinces and territories about how to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but he said each will make its own decision\u00a0given the different circumstances of every region.\n\"We recognize that different provinces will make different decisions about how and where to start restarting and reopening their economies,\" Trudeau said Wednesday during his daily briefing.\nThe decision around when to reopen the border with the U.S. is a nationwide measure and any change in that decision will come from the federal government, he said.\nWATCH | Ontario calls for military help for long-term care:\nA federal official Wednesday expressed concerns that Indigenous communities\u00a0will face elevated risks of COVID-19 infections once provinces and urban centres begin easing\u00a0lockdown restrictions.\u00a0\nValerie Gideon, senior assistant deputy minister for the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, says\u00a0COVID-19 rates in Indigenous communities are currently running below the national percentage due to protection efforts.\u00a0\n\"There are communities that are 20 minutes from an urban centre. Some communities are in the middle of an urban centre. It is impossible for those communities to be completely closed off if cities decide to open up their operations.\"\nTrudeau's remarks come a day after\u00a0Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam made similar remarks. Tam, who was speaking at a daily briefing on Tuesday, urged continued vigilance around public health measures and\u00a0said steps taken by Canadians across the country to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus have prevented an explosion of cases.\u00a0\nTam said Tuesday that health officials across the country are closely monitoring for \"continued and stable slowing of the epidemic\" as they plan for what comes next.\n\"But we are still a ways off and the path remains uncertain,\" Tam said, adding that she knows questions around recovery and what comes next are on everyone's mind. While there are a lot of unknowns about the path forward, Tam said the actions Canadians have taken in recent weeks have been critical to slowing the spread of the virus.\n\"There is no doubt that our sacrifices and every day inconveniences over the past weeks have prevented an explosive outbreak in Canada like the ones that have overwhelmed health-care systems in places like Italy, Spain and New York.\"\nThe virus, which was first identified in China in late 2019, causes an illness called COVID-19. There's no proven treatment or vaccine for the virus, though researchers around the world are searching for potential treatments.\u00a0\nStrict public health measures meant\u00a0to clamp down on the virus have led to huge financial strain for families and businesses, as well as for\u00a0governments tasked with overseeing the response and assisting those who have lost income.\nThe federal government and provinces have launched a range of initiatives aimed at supporting families and businesses, but some critics argue that the funding has been both too narrow and too slow.\nTrudeau on Wednesday said\u00a0the government plans to roll out funding\u00a0and expanded job placement programs for post-secondary students who are struggling to find enough work during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has left thousands of Canadians infected and prompted health officials to introduce a range of measures aimed at keeping people home.\nWATCH | Trudeau outlines\u00a0aid available for students:\nTrudeau outlined a number of initiatives targeted at students, including supports for students who fill certain volunteer roles.\nThe prime minister said the government will work with opposition parties to pass legislation around the student supports.\nAs of 6\u00a0p.m. ET, there were 2,074\u00a0COVID-19-related deaths in Canada, plus two reported COVID-19-linked deaths of Canadians abroad, according to a\u00a0CBC News tally\u00a0based on provincial and local health data, as well as CBC reporting.\nThere are 40,190 confirmed and presumptive cases, and 13,994\u00a0resolved cases among the provinces and territories that make such data public.\u00a0\nRead on for a look at what's happening in Canada, the U.S. and around the world.\u00a0\nBritish Columbia\u00a0Premier John Horgan says he wants to be cautious about reopening the province.\u00a0He says two recent outbreaks at the Mission prison and at a Vancouver poultry processing plant are warnings that the public can't be complacent about the virus.\u00a0Read more about what's happening in B.C.\nAlberta has launched a website to help people\u00a0find places to volunteer during the pandemic.

Our Country is starting to OPEN FOR BUSINESS again,\" he tweeted, though it is not yet clear how safe it will be.\nA handful of mostly southern states have announced they will begin loosening economic restrictions later this week. The Republican governors of Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Ohio all announced on Monday they would begin peeling back the curbs on commerce and social activity aimed at stopping the coronavirus outbreak over the next two weeks. Colorado's Democratic governor said on Tuesday he would open retail stores on May 1.\u00a0\nLater, during the daily White House briefing, Trump said\u00a0he told Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp that he disagrees with his decision to reopen certain facilities in the state, but believes Kemp should do what he thinks is right.\u00a0\nThe United States has by far the world's largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases at more than 840,000, according to a Johns Hopkins University\u00a0tally.

France's increase was at a rate of 2.6 per cent, the same as Tuesday, and remained well below the four to five per cent rates seen a week ago.\u00a0\nBritain's government plans to test a sample of 20,000 households for the coronavirus\u00a0in the coming weeks to try to establish how far the disease has spread across the country. Health Minister Matt Hancock said Thursday the research would help the government better understand the trajectory of the disease, and that the results would be available in early May.\u00a0More than 18,000 British people have died in hospital of COVID-19 so far, and the country is now in its fifth week of lockdown.\nTurkey has brought\u00a0the coronavirus outbreak under control, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Wednesday, as data showed deaths from the virus increasing by 117 to 2,376, with 3,083 confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.\nBrazil's new health minister, Nelson Teich expressed doubts Wednesday about projections that have guided governors' decisions on how to handle the coronavirus outbreak. Teich says it is impossible that estimates for total death counts vary so much, adding there needs to be a standard model of analysis.\u00a0Teich took office on Friday after President Jair Bolsonaro fired his predecessor, whose repeated support for governors' stay-at-home measures ran counter to Bolsonaro's position that the Brazilian economy needs to keep moving.\u00a0\nSingapore's coronavirus infections surged past 10,000 after it reported 1,016 new cases Wednesday. The tiny city-state's tally rose to 10,141, maintaining its position as the worst-hit nation in Southeast Asia.\u00a0The health ministry said the vast majority of the new cases are again linked to foreign workers' dormitories, which have been locked down and where virus testing has been ramped up to curb transmission.\nChina on Wednesday again reported no new deaths from the coronavirus, but registered 30 more cases \u2014 23 of them brought from abroad. Of the domestic cases, all seven were reported in Heilongjiang province near the Russian border, where a field hospital has been set up to deal with a new flare-up related to people coming home from abroad.\nJust over 1,000 people are hospitalized for treatment, while about the same number are under isolation and monitoring as either suspected cases or after testing positive but showing no symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,632 deaths among 82,788 cases, the bulk of them in Wuhan where officials recently raised the death toll by 50 per cent\u00a0after a review of records.\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has sought support for an international investigation into the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 including the response of the World Health Organization \u2014\u00a0 in phone calls with U.S. President Donald Trump, and the German and French leaders overnight.\u00a0Later Wednesday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell responded, saying that any apportioning of blame could threaten international co-operation to confront the pandemic.\u00a0\"We will only defeat the pandemic through global efforts and co-operation,\" Borrell said, \"and this co-operation cannot be jeopardized by blaming one or the other about the origins.\"\u00a0\nBorrell also commented on Iran, saying the EU has urged the United States to ease sanctions and approve economic aid to help the country deal with the pandemic. Borrell said its calls were rejected.\nBorrell went on to say that the EU is\u00a0aiming to set up a humanitarian air bridge to help move aid, equipment and facilities to parts of Africa hit hardest by the coronavirus. Borrell says the bloc's executive arm, the European Commission, has \"means and tools\" and will study ways to proceed.

At times, the Trudeau government attempts to anoint itself as the great defender of that order \u2014 not a bad thing on its own, since multilateral institutions are supposed to keep any one country from acting unilaterally in a way that harms the rest of us.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization is one of those multilateral institutions. It's a military and political alliance, formed after the Second World War, between Europe and North America. At NATO's heart is the concept of collective defence, enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty that created it. It means that an attack against one NATO member is regarded as an attack against all of them.\nNATO has taken some heat over the past few years from Trump. The president has suggested the U.S. could withdraw from the alliance, questioned the utility of Article 5 and called member states \"delinquent\" in their defence spending.\nHe's not entirely alone on that last point; former presidents like Barack Obama also have come down on allies like Canada for not spending enough on defence, arguing the U.S. has to do too much of the heavy lifting.\nCanada appeared at first to be responding to Trump's goading on defence spending. The Trudeau government released its defence policy in 2017, promising a 70 per cent increase in defence spending over a number of years.\nBut that timeline is important. A lot of that spending is contingent on whether projects go ahead as planned. The nightmare that is military procurement in this country (ships, jets - you know what I mean) doesn't exactly bode well for any timetable.\nCanada's spending on defence this year amounts to 1.23 per cent of this country's GDP. There was a loose agreement among NATO members to shoot for the 2 per cent mark.\nWe aren't the only ones missing that mark, of course. According to NATO's latest analysis, only seven of the 29 member countries hit that target. They include the U.S., the U.K. and Greece.\nThis stuff matters as far as the 'rules-based international order' goes - but will it matter in the next federal election? Traditionally, defence issues aren't a big factor for Canadian voters.\nI remember asking an expert about that in the midst of one of our fighter jet procurement controversies: billions of taxpayer dollars on the table, millions misspent - why wasn't it bothering people more? He told me Canadians like to see themselves as peaceful people (or at least they like the image), while the sums involved are too big, too abstract to really matter at the polls.\nWhat might lift the defence file to the level of an actual election issue in 2019 is the government's handling of the military itself. I'm thinking particularly of Mark Norman, the former second in command of the military, and everything that's happened in his case over the past few months.\nNorman was accused of leaking cabinet secrets, investigated, charged and suspended from his job. Ultimately, the charge against him was dropped. Along the way, his legal team accused the Prime Minister's Office of withholding evidence and meddling in the case. Norman's case had ended but it wasn't clear if he'd get his old job back. Turns out Gen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's top soldier, was going to reinstate Norman - and Norman's replacement wasn't happy with that.\nIn the end, Norman settled with the government (no details were released); he won't be going back to his old job. But the man who replaced him, Lt. Gen. Paul Wynnyk, was so put off by the whole experience he decided to leave his job early. Basically, it's all a huge mess.\nWill Canadians buy the Opposition's claim that this is a mess created by the Liberals, that the military is in disarray because of unnecessary politicking? I don't know, but disarray in the Canadian military certainly strikes closer to home than NATO and defence spending. Stability in the military's top ranks really matters to the men and women tasked with defending our country. It might also turn out to matter to voters in October.\u00a0\nVassy Kapelos is host of Power & Politics, weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on CBC News Network.\nThe Power & Politics Power Panellists on where the big parties will be focused this week\nAmanda Alvaro,\u00a0president and co-founder of Pomp & Circumstance\nLiberals and Justin Trudeau, at the 100-day countdown to Election Day, are launching the largest Day of Action so far of 2019.

It's possible that the political environment has flipped from the Conservative lead that has prevailed for the past five months.\nBut some caution is called for here. Mainstreet Research and Nanos Research, the two pollsters that put the Liberals ahead last week, have tended to post better results for the Liberals than other polling firms.\nConfirmation of a Liberal lead would have to wait until more pollsters weigh in \u2014 particularly those that have been less bullish on the Liberals in the past.\nNevertheless, the Poll Tracker is moving and the margin between the two parties is now just 2.9 percentage points. In the June 10 update, that gap was 5.7 points.\nMost of the shift can be chalked up to Ontario. The Conservatives have slipped 2.7 points there since June\u00a010, while the Liberals have gained 3.1 points \u2014 a total swing of nearly six points that's responsible for most of the movement we've seen in the national numbers.\nThe Liberals now lead in Ontario with 36.7 per cent in the Poll Tracker, compared to 32.4 per cent for the Conservatives.\nThe dial also has moved in a similar direction in most other parts of the country, particularly in Alberta, the wider Prairies and in Atlantic Canada. But it's Ontario that has the biggest electoral implications.\nThat's why \u2014 despite the Conservatives still leading by just under three points nationwide \u2014 it's virtually a toss-up as to which party would win the most seats if an election were held today.\nThey don't call Ontario \"seat-rich\"\u00a0for nothing.\nTap here to go to the full poll tracker\u00a0\nWe want to know what YOU want to know\nIrene Beaupr\u00e9 asks: What are the Conservatives, NDP and Greens promising on Indigenous issues? Are they committed to following the recommendations of the TRC? Are the Liberals promising to continue with their commitments to First Nations?\nHistorically, federal political parties haven't done all that much to court Indigenous voters. The First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit demographics have seen some of the lowest voter turnout rates \u2014 no doubt owing to a legacy of mistrust between many of them and a federal government that didn't always have their best interests in mind (the Indian residential school experience and the Inuit tuberculous policy are two obvious cases in point).\nIndeed, status Indians\u00a0\u2014\u00a0First Nations peoples with 'status' under the Indian Act \u2014 weren't even allowed to vote until reforms were pushed through by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in 1960 to extend the franchise.\nIn the modern era of reconciliation, ushered in by the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) final report documenting the horrors of residential schools, there has been a shift in Indigenous voting patterns.\nIn the 2015 federal election, First Nations members living on reserve voted in record numbers, recording a massive 14 point jump in participation, from 47.4 per cent in 2011 to 60.2 per cent in 2015. While that's still much lower than the overall voter turnout rate of 69.1 per cent, a new generation of First Nations people was clearly motivated to vote. In 2015, Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde reversed what he called a long-standing practice and cast a ballot in a federal election.\nTo that end, political parties, particularly those on the centre-left, have made more of an effort to champion Indigenous policy options to court a growing voter bloc. The 33 federal ridings with substantial Indigenous populations could be very important to the fates of all the major parties, especially with Liberals and Conservatives deadlocked in the most recent polls.\nLiberal Party\nThe current Liberal government has had a mixed record on Indigenous issues. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau clearly made reconciliation a top priority, investing billions of dollars in new money in program spending (in the last federal budget alone, 25 per cent of all new spending was earmarked for Indigenous-related initiatives). His government has lifted 58 of 105 long-term drinking water advisories on-reserve, committed $333 million over five years to revitalize Indigenous languages, passed legislation to begin reforming a badly broken child welfare system, signed a host of self-government agreements and made a series of apologies for past wrongs against Indigenous people.\nIt's a good record by many measures \u2014 but it's undermined by Trudeau's conflict with former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, the first Indigenous person to hold such an important cabinet position, and by the government's championing of some natural resources projects (hello, Trans Mountain!) against the will of coastal First Nations in B.C. And even with the new investments, Indigenous activists have argued that much more money is needed to end persistent inequities.\nLook for the Liberals to propose further, deeper reforms to the Canadian state during the election campaign, including measures to enact the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) inquiry's \"calls for justice\" to address systemic levels of violence.\nConservative Party\nThe Conservatives have not been as vocal on the Indigenous file \u2014 Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said the word \"Indigenous\" only seven times in the House of Commons over the last four years \u2014 but former Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose signalled a shift early in the last Parliament by dropping the party's longstanding opposition to an MMIWG inquiry.\u00a0\nThe party's Indigenous critic, B.C. MP Cathy McLeod, said that while the party doesn't agree with the inquiry's final \"genocide\" finding, a government led by Scheer would draw up its own proposal to implement those \"calls for justice.\"\nTrue to form, the Conservative Party also has said that it will champion oil and gas projects \u2014 and energy infrastructure initiatives like the Indigenous-led Eagle Spirit pipeline \u2014 to bring more wealth and prosperity to remote Indigenous communities that have few economic opportunities beyond the natural resources sector.\nIn 2015, the Conservative platform had three pages of specific Indigenous proposals \u2014 including a promise to establish a property ownership regime for those reserves that want it, and pitches to expand anti-gang programming and rural broadband services. Scheer could very well recommit to those promises and build on them.\nThe NDP\nThe New Democratic Party has been a champion of Indigenous issues in this Parliament, with the party's MPs frequently lambasting the prime minister and his ministers for perceived inaction. They successfully pushed the government to begin fully implementing 'Jordan's Principle' to ensure equal funding for Indigenous kids in health care and other social services, and to end discriminatory practices in the child welfare system.\nJagmeet Singh will likely look to continue the party's strong legacy on the First Nations file by promising to introduce government legislation to enact the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (as the Liberals also have promised to do) and kill pipeline projects they think lack sufficient Indigenous support. The most important aspect of the NDP's Indigenous policy platform is the idea of spending more to tackle the on-reserve housing 'crisis' that has left so many First Nations people without adequate shelter.\nThe Green Party\nElizabeth May's Green Party also has said it will act on Indigenous issues if elected but their proposals to this point have faced criticisms. Robert Jago, a prominent Montreal-based Indigenous writer, businessperson and member of the Nooksack Tribe and Kwantlen First Nation, called them \"thin, unrealistic and riddled with embarrassing errors\" in a piece for the B.C.-based online news outlet The Tyee. The party's \"Vision Green\" platform proposes a phase-out of the Indian Act, \"ideally in less than 10 years,\" and better accommodation of Indigenous interests with respect to natural resources projects.\n\u2014 John Paul Tasker, senior writer\nHave a question about the October election?

All were presented with the same questions.\u00a0Clicking the candidate's name above will take you to their survey responses. The candidates were told they had a 200-word limit for answers.\nCandidates who did not provide surveys by the deadline are invited to still do so and their responses\u00a0will be added to this story when they are received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nMy goal as your MP will be to continue to listen and engage with our community to ensure our economy is strong, life is affordable, and we are protecting our environment for future generations.\nA Liberal government will continue to work to make life more affordable for Canadians. We lowered taxes on middle class Canadians and have a plan to give a hand-up to the most vulnerable in our society by making the first $15,000 of earned income tax-free, saving the average family nearly $600 a year and lifting 40,000 more people out of poverty.\u00a0\nBy working with communities, we created the National Housing Strategy and the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive to respond to concerns about affordable housing.\nI meet with students regularly and know one of Waterloo's greatest strengths is our post-secondary institutions. A Liberal government will make university or college education more affordable, providing $1,200 more each year in Canada Student Grants. Additionally, to ensure the fiscal situation of students, we will assist with interest relief until graduates are earning $35,000/year.\nWe have a plan that looks out for middle-class Canadians and the most vulnerable, not one that gives tax cuts to millionaires.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nOur plan to invest in the middle class and build an economy that works for everyone has had remarkable results. Since our government was elected in 2015, Canadians have created over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014 about 75 per cent of them full-time \u2014 pushing unemployment to historic lows.\u00a0\nThanks to the tax-free Canadian Child Benefit and the middle-class tax cut, the typical middle-class family has more than $2,000 extra in their pockets every year. Our debt-to-GDP ratio continues on a downward trend and Canada's fiscal position is among the best in G7.\u00a0\nThere's no place like Waterloo to start a business, and that's why we've supported small businesses by lowering their tax rate from 11% in 2015 to 9% in 2019. Canada now has the lowest small business tax rate in the G7.\u00a0\nWe've also enhanced support for research and development which is especially important in a tech community like ours. If we are re-elected, we will create the Canada entrepreneur account to provide up to 2,000 entrepreneurs with as much as $50,000 each to launch their new businesses. Small businesses are our job creators and we are committed to working with them.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nToday in Canada, if you pollute, you pay. We've taken the bold step of putting a price on pollution with 90% of the money returning to the pockets of individuals and families to make greener, cleaner choices more affordable.\u00a0\nWe acknowledge that we need to do even more. If re-elected, we have committed to legally-binding, five-year milestones, based on the advice of the experts and consultations with Canadians, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. When it comes to fighting climate change, one thing is clear: doing less costs people more. We are committed to transitioning to greener energy sources. To support this in a responsible way, we will ensure energy workers and communities shape their own futures by introducing a Just Transition Act, giving workers access to the training, support, and new opportunities needed to succeed in the clean economy.\nThe best way through the climate emergency is action, not inaction. We are committed to planting an additional 2 billion trees within the next 10 years and we will increase land and ocean protections by 25% by 2025. We must take climate change seriously to keep the world our children and grandchildren grow up in safe and liveable.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nUpon election four years ago, I chose to move the MP's office to Waterloo City Hall. Waterloo is the only riding that I know of in Canada where the MP, the MPP, and the mayor are all located in the same building. I believe that all levels of government should work better together for the good people of Waterloo.\nI've called Waterloo Region home all my life. I'm proud to be the child of immigrants and to have been educated right here in Waterloo. I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Science and have been employed since.\nOur government brought back the long-form census and we have returned to making decisions based on evidence, not ideology.\nWe have an incredible community. Over the past four years, I have connected our community's expertise in the work we have done as a country because as I always say, Canada needs more Waterloo. Over the past four years, we have worked together to bring investments to our community and showcased Waterloo and Canada to the world. I ask for your support and commit to continue working hard for you to represent our riding's interests in Ottawa as your MP.\nWebsite\nResponse not yet received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI've spoken to people across Waterloo over the last several months and the vast majority of them are nervous about the future and ongoing threats related to the climate crisis.\u00a0\nThe Trudeau Liberal government hasn't done enough to fight the climate crisis and their purchasing of a pipeline was frankly irresponsible. And the Conservatives have no plan to do anything meaningful to address climate change and its consequences.\nWhen I speak to people, they're hopeful about the NDP's plan to address the climate crisis without leaving anyone behind. We will set our emissions target based on what scientists say is required to meet our Paris Agreement targets to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and invest in the jobs of the future.\nOur plan involves continuing to put a price on carbon, immediately ending fossil fuel subsidies, retrofitting homes and buildings across the country, transitioning to fully-electric transit and incentivizing the building and buying of electric vehicles.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nHere in Waterloo, people are feeling the pressure of the increasing cost of living, in part because of stagnant wages and rapidly increasing housing costs.\u00a0\nThe NDP has a comprehensive plan to address affordability. We would focus on reinvesting in public services like universal pharmacare and education. With universal pharmacare, families can save up to $500 per year. And by removing the interest on federal student loans, we will ease the transition of students from post-secondary education to the workforce.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the NDP has put forward a plan to invest in affordable housing, building 500,000 new units in the next 10 years. As MP, I would make sure that Waterloo gets its fair share.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe federal government needs to be doing so much more to tackle the climate crisis. Our collective future relies on it.\u00a0\nFirst, we need to get serious about meeting our Paris Agreement targets. We need to use scientifically based targets so that we have the highest chance of avoiding the catastrophic effects of climate change.\u00a0\nSecond, we need to start thinking about how we are going to transition our society to become net-zero. The federal government can be a leader here, starting with retrofitting all federal government buildings, electrifying government vehicles, and being a partner with municipalities to electrify and expand public transit fleets across the country.\u00a0\nThird, and most importantly, this transition needs to be just. Indigenous people need a seat at the table and the economic opportunities need to be spread fairly across society so that no one is left behind.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm Cree-Metis, with family roots in Montreal Lake First Nation in Treaty 6 Territory.\nI have years of experience fighting for meaningful change by advocating for social, economic, and environmental justice issues. Every day, I refine my advocacy skills by taking every opportunity to listen to and learn from those around me.\nI have a strong work ethic and I work hard to amplify community voices. If elected, my main priority as MP would be to listen to constituents, amplify their voices in Ottawa, and work in a non-partisan way to get good things done for Waterloo.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address\u00a0it?\nWe are one of Canada's technology champions. We need to attract and hold talent to build our lead. To do\u00a0this, we need to promote a system-level strategy that improves transportation the regional transportation network and helps control housing costs at the same time.\nWe need to support the universities that are actually driving regional growth and continue to build an arts and culture sector around our high-tech lead to attract more talent and more jobs.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe cost of living problem is primarily in the housing/transportation nexus.\nThe key is to continue our forward-looking urban and regional planning and to win federal and provincial support for our infrastructure needed. More broadly, we in the region need to support a high speed rail system for the entires Quebec-Windsor corridor.\nWe also need to implement a national housing policy focused a massive expansion of social\u00a0 housing. I will work to strengthen our links with he relevant Federal agencies and decision makers.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe have to be clear \u2014 the climate emergency is the big threat\u00a0for the world and for K-W.\nAll our other great initiative will be undermined if we don't pick up our game in Canada and Ontario. My immediate task is to help people understand that we already have all the tools and technology we need, and that we can and must set much more ambitions targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a young mother and a systems design engineer. The first makes me very committed to improving the world and the other teaches me to look for and find solutions that really work.\u00a0\nSerious problems take serious thinking and serious commitment.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI thought long about the top issue facing our riding and my thoughts kept going back to it depends who you ask. I've addressed the tax burden and our landfill crisis below.\nFor the commuters the biggest issue is our transportation infrastructure. It is mind-boggling why K-W does not have high speed transport to the Pearson International Airport, and throughout the Toronto to Montreal corridor. We must stop expecting our big government to provide what for decades it has failed to do and look at handing the challenges over to the private sector to deliver.\u00a0By doing so, we eliminate the need for tax increases and only those who choose to use it will pay.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe PPC has a plan to balance the budget in two years, a plan for bold tax reform and policy to reduce prices of dairy, poultry, eggs and all goods produced in Canada and sold to neighbouring provinces. The PPC will also eliminate all capital gains taxes allowing investors big and small to make money while stimulating the economy.\nThe PPC will balance the budget by eliminating the billions of dollars spent on corporate cronyism, bail-outs, subsidies and all forms of corporate welfare; and by eliminating the billions of Canadian taxpayer dollars that are sent to other countries for unaccountable social causes. This foreign aid rarely ends up in the hands of those in need.\nThe PPC will increase the personal exemption to $15,000 and have a flat tax of 15% on income up to $100,000 and a flat rate of 25% on income over $100,000.\nThe PPC will eliminate supply management, the dairy cartel, which makes Canadians pay 400% more for milk, eggs, dairy and poultry.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe PPC will end inter-provincial trade barriers so we can buy product made in Canada without the punitive costs and barriers to trading among provinces.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur region is facing a trash and landfill crisis. As a community our biggest issue is what is going to happen in a few short years when the Erb Street landfill permanently closes. There is no rational back-up plan.\u00a0\nOur federal government doesn't know what to do with our trash other than to drive it to our port cities, put it in shipping containers and send it to third world nations who either send it back (the Philippines), burn it producing toxic fumes, or dump it in the ocean (which is why our Canadian recycle products are floating in the south Pacific).\u00a0\nThe green energy proponents have no plan for the end of life disposal of highly toxic electric car batteries, solar panels and windmills.\nThe PPC will focus on local solutions to local environmental issues. Accountability only works when power is decentralized. The PPC policy prioritizes clean and safe drinking water for all, and clean and safe air for all. On these issues we have seen that our federal government tends to stand in the way of innovation, stuck in old infrastructure and old way to do things, and simply not doing anything.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nIn 2018, the average Canadian family paid a whopping $40,000 in taxes while it paid only $32,000 toward food, shelter and clothing. We also know that\u00a0the average Canadian household is within $200 per month of bankruptcy. Household and government debt are at an all-time high.\u00a0Many families are struggling to make ends meet with no income left to pay for emergencies, job loss, prescription drugs, never mind a vacation. It is wrong that so much is paid for taxes with little access to social services and healthcare.\nI would like to get busy implementing the People's Party platform, policy and principles.\u00a0I would like to come back in four\u00a0years as your MP with a record of having accomplished what the People's Party's set out to do. We need bold reforms and to get back to our basic values as Canadians.\nI would be honoured to serve as your Member of Parliament for the riding of Waterloo.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The candidates: Hay River South", "description": "Rocky Simpson challenges Wally Schumann in Hay River South riding", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-votes-hay-river-south-candidates-1.5287580", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287601.1568759432!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hay-river-south.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 17, 2019 10:00 PM CT", "2019-09-19T21:11:23.493Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Election day in the Northwest Territories is Oct. 1, and CBC North is working to bring you all the information you need to cast your ballot. As candidates were announced, CBC provided each an opportunity to answer a questionnaire tackling a wide range of subjects, from their own qualifications to themes impacting their riding and the territory as a whole.\nRead their responses below, presented in the order they were received by CBC.\nSome answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nI want to build on the work I have done with my community to get Hay River on the road to a more prosperous future. There is also a critical need to steer the Northwest Territories toward a brighter economic future in which every community can thrive. The 18th Legislative Assembly set some important groundwork to help make this happen.\nI'd like to help keep the momentum going and work to make sure every one of us, and our future generations to come, can find success in the Northwest Territories\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nIn both my community and the greater Northwest Territories, concerns about our economic future is top of mind for many people. My past experience as a business leader was invaluable to me in my dual role as MLA for Hay River South and cabinet minister in the last term, and will no doubt continue to benefit my community and the N.W.T., should I be re-elected on Oct.\u00a01.\nIn addition to founding the largest sign manufacturing business in the Northwest Territories, I advocated sustainable, community-driven economic opportunities as a director for the Hay River Chamber of Commerce, a member of the N.W.T. Chamber of Mines Aboriginal Participation Committee, and a Director for the N.W.T. Manufacturer's Association.\nFurthermore, I believe a leader is only as strong as their ability to work with others and collaboration is crucial to success. I lived this in my two years as president of the Hay River M\u00e9tis Government Council, where I led a large-scale community consultation to develop a community wellness contribution funding agreement with the GNWT\u00a0(Government of the Northwest Territories). It was also essential to my roles as MLA Hay River South and cabinet minister to help get Hay River and the greater Northwest Territories back on the road to prosperity.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nI see my accomplishments as MLA\u00a0 as community successes, because each one involved the voice and dedicated engagement of my constituents. I'm proud that Hay River is headed toward a more prosperous future, thanks in part to the GNWT's purchase of Marine Transportation Services, which helped keep the local transportation sector vibrant and dozens of jobs secure. We've also created more opportunities for health, economic success and dozens of local jobs by securing plans to build a new fish plant and a 48-bed long term care facility.\nI'm also proud of a number of accomplishments that will set the Northwest Territories toward a brighter future, including crucial infrastructure projects such as plans for the Slave Geological Province Corridor and the completion of the Mackenzie Valley all-season highway, and a bilateral agreement with the federal government to secure nearly $760 million for infrastructure improvements.\nThese wins are multifaceted as they will help connect communities, create new local jobs, improve the skill set of our workforce, and make it easier for local businesses and people to find opportunities to prosper in the North.\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nRight now, people across the Northwest Territories are wondering if their families and children will be able to find opportunities to thrive in the North. Whether that's finding meaningful employment, good health, or education needed for long-term success. There has never been a more critical time to make sure our territorial economy will flourish now and into the future.\nThe solution is two-fold.\nWe must address the immediate need to sustain a core part of our current economy and GDP by keeping our mines working as long as possible and ensuring reclamation efforts are driven locally. At the same time, we have to make strategic investments to sustain an economy our future generations can grow into.\nThis\u00a0means growing strong and diverse local economies across the territory and making sure northerners have opportunities to lead the charge on solutions for a greener future. It is absolutely critical for the 19th Legislative Assembly to make sure that every person in every community \u2014 now and in the future\u00a0\u2014\u00a0has incredible opportunities to build healthy, prosperous lives in the North.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nAs a community, we've accomplished a lot over the last four years to set Hay River back on the road to prosperity. By working with constituents, the Town of Hay River, Indigenous leaders, and our territorial and federal partners, we have helped jumpstart the local economy with the GNWT's purchase of Marine Transportation Services, the launch of the Maritime\u00a0Training Centre, plans for a new fish plant, a new 48-bed long-term care facility, and much more.\nBut our work has just begun. Just like people across the North, Hay River residents want to know that every one of us and our future generations can find health and success in the Northwest Territories. We've already laid some important groundwork to make this happen, and we have to keep the momentum going. This means creating more jobs and opportunities for local businesses through continued support to develop growth of the local transportation and fishing industries and working toward the re-opening of Pine Point mine.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nI want to help the Northwest Territories \u2014 including Hay River \u2014 to become a strong, united, and self-sustainable territory in which every person in every community can find opportunities for long-term health and success. A territory that is both in control of its future, and able to find success with the ever-changing demands of the economy and environment.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nPeople across the Northwest Territories care about the future of the environment, but they also want to be able to keep the lights on and their houses warm.\nGiven my past role as cabinet minister in the last Assembly, I am confident the GNWT developed a strong climate change strategy focused on adaptation and mitigation with these concerns in mind. It will be important for the 19th Legislative Assembly to build on this work to ensure that living in the North is affordable as we move to a greener economy less dependent on fossil fuels. One way to do this is to make sure northern workers and businesses have opportunities to lead the charge in solutions to proactively combat climate change.\nProtecting our environment also means working in partnership with Indigenous communities, particularly in the remote regions that are on the frontline of climate change. This collaboration is key to keeping our land healthy and prosperous for generations to come.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nWhen it comes to building a brighter future for the Northwest Territories, everyone in every community can bring something to the table. I would like to see the GNWT continue its efforts to be more in tune with the voices of communities. The 18th\u00a0Assembly\u00a0took important strides toward a more open government by holding open houses with the premier and cabinet members in regional centres across the North.\nI would like to see the 19th Legislative Assembly build on this work and expand ways it can make itself more accessible to all communities in the Northwest Territories.\nGiven the tight fiscal reality of the next Assembly, collaboration will also be a critical part of making sure we're building a future that works for everyone. This means continuing to work in partnership with constituents, Indigenous groups, municipalities, the federal government and neighbouring territories and provinces to strengthen our ability to achieve common goals.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nTo build a self-reliant, prosperous territory we need to empower our people, businesses and communities with ongoing opportunities to contribute to our evolving economy. This means working now to grow strong, diverse and sustainable local economies, giving northern businesses opportunities to lead the charge on climate change solutions, and promoting 'buy North, hire North' policies to keep more dollars in the territory.\nAs we work toward long-term sustainability, it will also be important to support staples of our present economy to keep the territory on an upward trajectory over the next decade. This includes keeping operating mines in production as long as possible, continuing to work on the Slave Geological Province Corridor including the Taltson Hydroelectricity Expansion Project, making sure northerners drive mine reclamation projects, and continuing core infrastructure projects to connect communities.\nWe already have the businesses and workforce that can perform much of this work. These opportunities will help keep northerners employed as we transition to a more diverse economy that keep the territory prosperous for generations to come.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nI think it's really important that we support our Indigenous leaders and help groups settle outstanding land claims and self-government agreements. It will also be important to continue the work the GNWT is currently doing to be more inclusive involve all residents in when it comes to decisions about the future of the Northwest Territories, and making our strategies to grow healthy, prosperous communities across the North work for everyone.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\u00a0\nYes.\nWould you like to be premier?\nIf I have the honour of getting a second term as MLA for Hay River South, I would meet with the new members of the Legislative Assembly and learn about their issues and priorities before making a decision on whether I would consider putting my name forward as premier.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nI decided to run for office because our local economy is struggling, and many residents are very concerned about the future of Hay River. If we focus on community's strengths and capitalize on opportunities in our region, we can mitigate many of the negative impacts that we are experiencing and create a solid economic foundation for our future generations.\nUnfortunately, many people in Hay River feel that our current government has not taken these concerns seriously and has done little to address them. I am running because Hay River South needs a representative that is approachable, accessible and will listen to the concerns or all our residents while standing up for our community.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nI believe that my business and political experience, along with my education, would be of great benefit to my work as an MLA.\u00a0\nMy past roles as the president of the Hay River M\u00e9tis Local 51 and as a councillor and deputy mayor of the Town of Hay River have given me insight into the issues faced by Indigenous and municipal governments. One area that I feel is very important is my work assisting and promoting non-profits, as they provide a service that is so very important to our community.\nFor the past 16 years, I have owned and operated a Hay River-based business that has provided employment and training opportunities to hundreds of residents, so I am aware of the issues facing small businesses and their employees in the N.W.T. My work in the oil and gas industry and with electrical utilities has also made me familiar with challenges, concerns, and potential of our extractive and energy industries. As a practicing lawyer, I am familiar with many of the policies and pieces of legislation that govern our territory, and with the challenges that our residents often face when dealing with the legal system.\u00a0\nAfter completing my elementary and secondary schooling in Hay River, I earned a diploma in petroleum engineering technology from the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, degrees in business and computer science in the United States, and a law degree from the University of British Columbia. In addition to providing me with technical knowledge, this education has provided me the skills to research and analyze any topic from a variety of viewpoints. Given the vast and diverse nature of information that MLAs must be familiar with, I believe these would be invaluable skills.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\u00a0\nRaising a family that understands the importance of helping others in need and showing respect to all.\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nThe N.W.T.'s faltering economy is the biggest issue facing our territory.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile there is much concern about Hay River's current and future economic situation, the biggest issue affecting many residents daily is the state of our healthcare system and our community's lack of doctors.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\u00a0\nIf I could accomplish only one thing for Hay River while in office, it would be to ensure that our community recruit and retain an adequate number of doctors and that residents receive timely access to quality medical care.\u00a0\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nParticipate in action-oriented solutions to immediately address the problems. We need community, government and industry buy in to be effective. Although the issue is global, we can continue to do our part to minimize the impact.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nThe government needs a renewed focus on respect. There must be greater respect shown in the legislative assembly so that the voices of those elected to represent residents from across the territory can be heard. There must be greater respect shown to the public service.\nWe have many qualified people employed by the government and these people must be respected by and have the support of their leaders if they are to do their jobs effectively. Finally, the GNWT needs to understand that is serves the residents of the N.W.T. The politicians in charge of the government need to listen to and be accountable to the residents and need to ensure that they apply fairness in all aspects of the decision-making process.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nThe GNWT must do a better job working with and supporting Indigenous governments with the goal of completing claims and self-government processes. This will provide certainty and clarity that will help attract new investment to the N.W.T. and help local businesses grow.\nWe must continue to promote and look to improve our returns on our renewable and non-renewable resource industries and must be done in ways that minimize damage to our environment. We must also put greater efforts into diversifying our economy so that we can be better prepared for slowdowns in the mining and oil and gas sectors. This can be done by making better use of legislation and policies, such as the Business Incentive Policy, to ensure that businesses that have a real presence in the N.W.T. are able to grow, provide sustainable employment to locals, and contribute to the territorial economy.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nThe GNWT needs to recognize that the Indigenous peoples have constitutionally entrenched rights that must be fully recognized and supported. It is through the recognition of these rights and working for a common goal that the North will become stronger politically, economically, and socially.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\nI would be very interested but need to work at being elected first.\nWould you like to be premier?\nNo \u2013 if elected, a decision as to who I would support would be made through discussion with potential candidates and the residents of Hay River.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The candidates: Yellowknife South", "description": "Caroline Wawzonek and Gaeleen McPherson vie for Premier Bob McLeod's former seat", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-votes-yellowknife-south-candidates-1.5281946", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5285746.1568663675!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/yellowknife-south.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 16, 2019 10:00 PM CT", "2019-09-17T04:00:00.783Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Election day in the Northwest Territories is Oct. 1, and CBC North is working to bring you all the information you need to cast your ballot. As candidates were announced, CBC provided each an opportunity to answer a questionnaire tackling a wide range of subjects, from their own qualifications to themes impacting their riding and the territory as a whole.\nRead their responses below, presented in the order they were received by CBC.\nSome answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\u00a0\nI am running for office because I think change is needed in my community and the territory. I believe I have the necessary skills, background and experience to help provide some of the solutions to the many challenges we face including an uncertain economic situation, the need to improve our public services, providing education and training opportunities for our youth and addressing the social issues that affect too many of our residents.\u00a0\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\u00a0\nI was born, raised and educated in the North.\u00a0My family lives here and I am raising a family here. I've worked for much of my career in the mining industry and have held a number of progressively senior positions, including most recently vice-president of corporate affairs and a member of the executive committee for Dominion Diamond Mines.\u00a0\nIn those roles, I have had to work with senior executives from multinational corporations, with territorial and federal politicians and officials, with Chiefs and communities, and with working folks trying to make ends meet.\nMy ability to work with people, build positive relationships and craft solutions to complex problems are the most important attributes that I would bring to the role of MLA in the service of the people of Yellowknife South. And frankly, I think our legislature needs more of that.\u00a0\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\u00a0\nOf course, on a personal level, being a mom is my greatest accomplishment, and always will be.\nHowever, on a professional level, I would say that being recognized by the Canadian Institute of Mining in 2018 with the CIM-Bedford Canadian Young Mining Leaders Award confirmed to me that the choices I made as a young, Indigenous woman to work and make a difference in the mining industry was the correct choice.\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\u00a0\nOur territory faces many challenges, but I think the biggest issue is an uncertain economic future.\nI say this because I think a stronger, more vibrant economy provides us with more flexibility to address other important challenges, such as building a stronger education system \u2014 including the polytechnic institute\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or to invest in public services, including the training and recruiting of more health care professionals to staff the state-of-the-art new hospital that we have built.\u00a0\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\u00a0\nFrom what I have heard so far in visiting constituents, the people of Yellowknife South worry about the state of the economy, how long they will have secure employment, when affordable day care will be made available, when we will adequately resource our health care facilities and provide adequate health care, what the government is going to do to support small business, services and programs for seniors, and the social issues that we just can't seem to get a handle on.\nThere are a broad range of issues being identified; the next government has a lot that they will be taken to task on.\u00a0\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\u00a0\nI would hope that when I left office, I would leave a community better off economically and a government that provides improved public services to all residents and that we can better take care of those in our society most in need.\u00a0\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\u00a0\nI've focused a great deal on the economy in previous answers but as an Indigenous northerner, I feel strongly that we must ensure the environment and our wildlife are protected for generations to come. We need development, but it has to be done in such a way as to minimize the impact on our environment.\u00a0\nThe one area that I would focus on immediately if elected is reducing our reliance on fossil fuels for industry and communities. We need to make additional investments in renewable energy, such as wind, solar and biomass, both in the short and long-term.\nMore importantly, we need to work with the next federal government\u00a0to expand our hydroelectric capacity. A grid interconnect between the North and South Slave regions, and ultimately between the N.W.T. and the southern Canadian grid, will be one of my top priorities if elected. This will help to lessen our impact on the environment and to reduce our high cost of living.\u00a0\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\u00a0\nGiven the size and makeup of our territory, I am generally supportive of the consensus system of government. However, it seems clear that more must be done to address the increasing divide between cabinet and regular members.\nI don't have a simple answer to this question, but a start is to elect more people that bring a collaborative approach to politics. Secondly, we need to use the committee structure in better ways to ensure regular members have input earlier in the legislative and policy development process.\u00a0\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\u00a0\nWe need to ensure that we continue to support the mining industry. Mining has brought many benefits to the Yellowknife region and with the right focus and incentives we can ensure that we see these benefits for many more years.\nHowever,\u00a0we also need to focus our efforts on diversification of our economy, including the development of a sustainable tourism plan that attracts tourists to stay longer, encourages visits during current \"off seasons\" and results in more spending remaining in the North. The GNWT must shift focus from marketing to creating the right incentives for private sector tourism product development and improve our tourist infrastructure, such as improving and expanding the airport in order to accommodate international flights.\u00a0\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\u00a0\nWe need to prioritize building collaborative partnerships with Indigenous governments. To do this, we need better forums that allow for a government-to-government dialogue to resolve some of the issues that exist.\u00a0\nWhile I also understand that more needs to be done to resolve outstanding lands and resource\u00a0negotiations, I also appreciate that these are complex issues that will take time to bring to a full resolution.\u00a0\nI think my personal and professional background provides me with the skills needed to build and improve the relationships we have with Indigenous governments.\u00a0\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\u00a0\nMy complete focus at this time is on talking to the people of Yellowknife South, understanding the issues facing them and earning their trust to represent them as their MLA. While I understand that the selection of cabinet and premier are important issues, it is important that consideration of those offices wait until the people of Yellowknife South have made their choice.\u00a0\nWould you like to be premier?\u00a0\nSee above.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nWhen I realized that this is an opportunity to bring my knowledge of different sectors and industries and my advocacy work together into a powerful new arena.\nFor over a decade, I have helped individuals, businesses and community organizations solve problems by navigating laws, regulations and policies. Sometimes I read a policy and wonder what connection it has to the goals of the government vision it came from; other times I read a law and wonder where the action is to act on the vision and be accountable for the outcomes.\nNow I hope to be on the other side to support a strong vision for the N.W.T. and help drive the laws and policy to deliver on that vision.\u00a0\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nI have knowledge and experience across industries and sectors. My professional work has ranged from criminal law and child welfare to our environmental regulatory boards and boards of education.\nMy community level roles include serving as president of the Law Society of the NWT, on the Executive Committee of the NWT. Chamber of Commerce and being a director on the boards of the NWT YWCA, NWT Montessori Society and Avens.\nIn terms of specific skills, my career is built on an ability to identify issues, gather information, make strategic decisions, advocate for an outcome and, throughout these processes, communicate with people. I work professionally with boards, tribunals and other government decision makers to help them develop fair and transparent processes and to make reasonable and ethical decisions.\nI have trained a variety of organizations on the use of fairness when developing processes and on how to come to decisions that are accountable to the parties involved. I have also worked with community organizations to improve their governance through policy reviews, bylaw updates and projects that engage the perspective of the broader community.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nIn preparing for the election, I have been humbled to hear many people tell me that they know me by reputation. Throughout\u00a0my career, I approach my advocacy, whether in court or as a community advocate, with integrity, commitment and passion while treating others with respect and fairness. I am proud of the reputation I have built.\u00a0\nOn a personal level, I feel a sense of pride watching my children engage others with compassion and respect. I cannot take credit for all of their behaviour, but I do lay claim to some.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nBoth short and long-term economic growth. The N.W.T.'s GDP is flatlining and exploration investment has decreased, despite increasing in our neighbouring territories. New mineral resource projects seem to remain ever on the horizon. Access to land remains uncertain for investors and challenging for municipalities, while land and self-government negotiations appear to stagnate.\nThe N.W.T. has long had both higher costs of living and higher operating costs for business compared to Canadian averages; these high costs of living put pressure on business for wages while high operating costs get passed to consumers in a cycle that we need to break.\nMeanwhile, the impacts of a warming climate are being felt acutely from melting permafrost to eroding coasts and changing biodiversity. All of these realities need to be addressed and balanced for the N.W.T. to become a Canadian leader in economic development and prosperity.\u00a0\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nAfter a week of knocking on doors, there are two key issues that my neighbours are talking about: economic development and how to positively impact the social challenges being seen on the streets of our downtown, especially homelessness, mental health and addictions.\u00a0\nSomething that I think links these issues is the need for effective leadership that is accountable for measurable results. Four years ago, we already knew that our economy would face challenges when the diamond mines close with only smaller operations in the pipes and slow exploration investment.\nAs well, better supports for mental health and addictions was a key issue in the last election and in the government's mandate. From the outreach I have done over the last few months, I believe there are strong ideas and existing initiatives across sectors but there is a lack of confidence in effective leadership to follow through with outcomes.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nIn consensus government, I believe it is better to go in with more than one \"key deliverable\" so you have flexibility to engage with the other MLAs about shared priorities.\nI am reasonably confident we will agree on the need for continued efforts to bridge infrastructure gaps and settle land claims. I also suspect we will agree that mental health and addictions must again be a priority.\nOne issue where I would like to see change is for better results monitoring,\u00a0so that after four years we will see not only what processes may be underway, but also clearly identify what measurable impacts have been achieved.\u00a0\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nFirst, reduce our reliance on diesel fuel by: expanding both large and small scale hydro power; supporting biomass retrofits; and encouraging local equity partnerships for community-scale renewable projects.\u00a0\nI believe that the GNWT should take a leading and coordinating role in responding to climate change impacts and challenges. I believe the GNWT should lead an effort to include analysis of the impact of climate change on community and territory-wide infrastructure in order to be able to include these risks or realities in current and future planning for research, personnel and budgets.\u00a0\nFinally, I also believe we should try to use these challenges as an opportunity. In moving forward with a polytechnic\u00a0university, the territory\u00a0should be taking a leading role in initiating and supporting relevant research in Arctic climate science and related fields.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\u00a0\nReal accountability for measured outcomes as identified through evaluation and data.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nI believe we need to revitalize our mineral resource sector, support growth among northern-owned small and medium sized enterprise, and continue to seek opportunities to help diversify our economy.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome of the specific ways I believe we can accomplish these goals include:\u00a0\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\u00a0\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\u00a0\nIf elected, my first priority will be to build relationships with the other MLAs so we can work together to create not only the best possible cabinet based on our respective experiences and strengths, but also have the right group of MLAs ready to hold cabinet accountable.\u00a0\u00a0\nWould you like to be premier?\nI think it would be helpful for the premier to have some institutional knowledge about the Legislative Assembly that is most feasible for a returning MLA. In addition, as noted above, my first priority if elected is to learn about my fellow MLAs so we can work together to identify who is best suited to different roles.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Perth-Wellington candidates on environment, cost of living and top issues in this election", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/perth-wellington-federal-election-candidate-survey-1.5313132", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5315794.1570677080!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/candidates-in-perth-wellington.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-13T09:00:00.823Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Voters will head to the polls on Oct. 21 and in Perth-Wellington, people will have a choice between six candidates.\nThe candidates in Perth-Wellington are:\u00a0\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has asked the candidates to answer a survey. All were presented with the same questions.\u00a0Clicking the candidate's name above will take you to their survey responses. The candidates were told they had a 200-word limit for answers.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nTrust is the most important consideration facing residents of Perth\u2013Wellington in this election. Voters should consider two equally important questions.\nFirst, we must ask which leader, and which party, should we trust to take on serious national challenges.\u00a0Who do we trust to help make it possible for all of us to get ahead? Who do we trust to budget responsibly? Who do we trust to be a leader the world can take seriously?\nSecond, we must ask which local candidate has shown the ability to represent our values and capably serve our community. Which candidate do we trust to be accessible when we need them most? Which candidate has the experience we need to represent every community in Perth\u2013Wellington?\nTo earn voters' trust, I will continue doing what I have always done over the last four years: serving people to the best of my ability.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you return as the MP?\u00a0\nOver the last four years, we've been paying more for gasoline, home heating, hydro, housing, and much more. We must address the rising cost of living. As an MP, I would do what the Liberals did not do: I would oppose any measure that does not respect this reality facing too many Canadians.\nWe can start by trusting people with their own money. With the Conservatives' universal tax cut, the average Canadian family will save over $850 per year.\nAlso in our plan: tax credits for children's fitness and arts programs; tax-free maternity benefits; increasing the age credit for seniors by $1,000; and removing the federal tax on home heating.\nWe would also introduce four new measures to make it easier for first-time home buyers to buy a home.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nClimate change is real and requires immediate action. Andrew Scheer's plan would require the biggest polluters to reduce their carbon emissions or invest in new green technologies.\nIt is also a global problem requiring global solutions. For that, we must restore Canadian leadership on the world stage. We need a prime minister the world will take seriously.\nImposing additional taxes on people in our riding \u2014 who may have no choice but to drive to work or transport their crops to elevators \u2014 will make no meaningful difference in reducing emissions. It will just make life even more expensive.\nYou can read the Conservative plan for the environment at the website arealplan.ca.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nRaised on our family's farm near Mitchell, I learned early the importance of hard work. I believe in public service and our capacity to build strong, healthy communities\u00a0and a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I'm running to serve every person in every corner of Perth\u2013Wellington.\nService means representing our values and interests. That's what motivated me to introduce a bill to protect young people and those with disabilities from exploitation.\nIt's also why I have championed rural communities, stood up for local small businesses\u00a0and challenged the government to respect the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system.\nI'm running because I know we can build a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I will continue to be accessible to every constituent, no matter where they live, whether one-on-one or at community events. I ask for your support to continue serving everyone in Perth\u2013Wellington.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nSustainability is the top issue facing Perth-Wellington. I will work to ensure that life in Perth-Wellington is both economically and environmentally sustainable.\nWe owe it to our children and grandchildren to find solutions that are good for both the environment and the economy. The Liberal climate action plan is both ambitious and realistic. It includes innovation, research, clean technology, and putting a price on pollution. I am proud to support the Liberal plan that is committed to encouraging lower greenhouse gas emissions without putting a financial burden on households.\nWhen the Ford government cancelled Ontario's successful cap and trade system, the federal government implemented a carbon price (so-called \"carbon tax\") and a corresponding rebate called the climate action incentive payment.\u00a0\nLiberals value the small businesses in rural communities that create good jobs and the farmers that feed Canada and the world. We will help our family farms stay strong, help connect rural communities with high-speed internet, and continue to make rural success a priority with a dedicated minister of rural economic development.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Liberal government's plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class is working. It helped Canadians create over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014\u00a0most were full time positions \u2014\u00a0and brought the unemployment rate to a 40-year low. Despite that, many Canadians struggle to make ends meet given the high cost of living.\nA re-elected Liberal government will:\nCanada has the lowest debt to GDP ratio among G7 countries and this ratio has been reduced each year we've been in office. That means we will have the capacity in whatever economic situation to deal with that situation appropriately. To keep our economy strong and growing, we will also move forward with modest and responsible increases to immigration, with a focus on welcoming highly skilled people.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe've seen the impact of climate change, with floods and fires destroying entire communities in Canada. Our children are scared, because they know this will become their mess to clean up.\nThe Liberal plan isn't perfect, but it is both ambitious and feasible. Progress has already been made \u2014 putting a price on pollution, protecting our oceans, phasing out coal, banning single-use plastics. Canada is on track to reduce our emissions by 30 per cent\u00a0by 2030 and Liberals are committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That means not putting any more carbon emissions into the air than we take out.\u00a0\nA re-elected Liberal government will cut corporate tax in half for zero-emissions clean tech companies. We are committed to moving Canada forward \u2014 building a country where clean tech companies can thrive, where businesses and citizens are encouraged to go green, and where workers can succeed in the clean energy transition.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nPublic service means working to create a better community and country for our children and grandchildren \u2014 that is what motivates me to become the MP for Perth-Wellington. I will work to improve the environment, reduce the cost of living, and strengthen social services.\nMy varied work experience includes hosting a children's talent program on CFPL-TV in London; teaching special education students with the Thames Valley District School Board; and ministering to United Church congregations in St. Marys, Stratford, and Palmerston. My wife Ruth and I are residents of St. Marys; we have five children and three grandchildren.\nAs a former town councillor in Parkhill, I have political experience at the municipal level. I helped establish the London Convention Centre and was an early supporter of the Stratford Perth Rotary Hospice. I was a member of Stratford's Housing Committee looking for housing solutions for homeless people, and a co-organizer of St. Marys' Community Dinners.\nMy life's work has been focused on helping people in need. I will always stand up for the little guy. I know that public service is about addressing tough challenges, and I'm committed to continuing my work serving the citizens of Perth-Wellington at the federal level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nOne of the most important issues to citizens of Perth-Wellington is the climate emergency.\u00a0\nWe are keenly aware of the threat posed by climate change to the planet and our way of life. Extreme weather events like flooding, heavy rain, forest fires and intense hurricanes are seen across the country and we've felt the effects here in every part of the riding, both rural and urban. We have a number of active environmental groups such as Climate Momentum in Stratford, The Maitland Valley Carbon Footprint Initiative, and the City of Stratford itself has been a leader in a number of sustainability projects.\nI am inspired by the leadership of young people and was pleased to participate in the student-led climate action here in September.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy first order of business would be to press for action on affordable housing. Many people in Perth-Wellington can't afford to wait for solutions to the housing crisis.\nWe need the federal government to get back to work building social and non-market housing and supporting co-ops. I would work with colleagues from all parties to expedite the funding and assistance needed for municipalities, co-ops or social enterprises to get projects off the ground.\nDealing with precarious employment is a priority for the NDP. As a member of the NDP caucus, I will support the party's re-institution of a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour.\u00a0\nWe will work toward a living wage for all federally regulated workers which will set a standard for employers in every sector. We will give temporary and part-time workers access to the same compensation and benefits as their full-time counterparts.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe NDP knows that we don't have the luxury of time in taking action on climate change. On Day One, an NDP government would cancel the billions in fossil fuel subsidies as well as the Trans Mountain pipeline project.\nWe also stand firmly behind working people and will create 300,000 new jobs in our first mandate in the clean energy sector. Confronting climate change will require a massive mobilization of labour and resources to train and retrain Canadians.\nPriorities in a new energy economy include:\u00a0building a sustainable auto sector by manufacturing electric and zero-emission vehicles right here in Canada; retrofitting every home and public building by 2030 so that they are net zero ready; and expanding the availability of low-cost, zero-emission and accessible public transit.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI have been a social activist and a member of the NDP for the past 17 years. I\u00a0grew up in Markham and have an honours degree in political science from the University of Guelph. I was a member of the board of the Guelph Campus Co-op for five years, as well as serving as president of both the federal and provincial Guelph NDP riding associations. While in Guelph, I was the host of Words and Music\u00a0on 93.3 CFRU FM.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am also a person living with cerebral palsy. As such I know what it is to face and overcome challenges. I also know what it is to confront inequality and succeed.\u00a0\nIn Stratford, I am on the executive of the Rotaract\u00a0Club and have been working on the 211 database through the United Way of Perth Huron. I am committed to building a society where human need comes before corporate greed.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nClimate change is the world's biggest issue, but locally we won't see major frequent impacts until it's too late.\u00a0\nWe need to act because our cumulative emissions will continue to act for decades. To meet our 2030 goals, we have work to do, and only the Green Party's plan meets those goals. The Liberal government (and the Conservatives before them) continue to support the oil and gas industry despite the fact that continued resource extraction at this level will hasten the onrushing climate catastrophe. In 2017, just to extract the oil and gas, 200 of Canada's 700 megatons of CO2 were emitted.\nWe cannot maintain the status quo policy and have a livable planet. The Green Party will declare a climate emergency, work with the other parties in an inner cabinet, cancel all fossil fuel subsidies, ban fracking, support the adoption of electric vehicles, bolster public transportation, replace coal and natural gas electricity generation, modernize and expand the national electric grid, complete a national building retrofit, switch to biodiesel, ban foreign oil imports, and restore natural carbon sinks such as the soil and forests. It is all possible, we just need the political and personal will to do it.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nLife is expensive, and wages haven't kept up with costs. People are worried about making sure their families have what they need to get by and be happy. The Green Party wants to help financially with the things that matter the most.\nWe plan to abolish tuition at post-secondary institutions, expand public transportation (low cost and electric), and mandate a livable minimum wage ($15/hr).\u00a0 We will limit credit card interest rates to 10% and encourage competition in the cellular phone and internet markets to lower costs for everyone.\nGood health is currently a luxury and it shouldn't be; poverty directly affects your ability to care for yourself properly.\u00a0 We are proposing a guaranteed livable income (GLI) to replace the patchwork of federal and provincial programs that assist people who cannot work or are in low income situations. To pay for these programs, we will close tax loop holes used by the very wealthy and large corporations, so that they pay their fair share.\u00a0 Tax breaks for huge corporations don't help everyday people.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe climate crisis is the most important issue for Canadians, whether they realize it or not.\u00a0 The climate crisis requires a concerted effort at all levels of government and grass roots action by everyone.\u00a0\nFor the government to act in the long term best interest of the people of Canada, we need increased transparency and accountability.\u00a0The oil and gas industry is the largest source of emissions in Canada. The federal government needs to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry and put those funds into environmentally sound energy.\u00a0\nThe Transmountain Pipeline expansion should be stopped. The BC Liquid Natural Gas project should be stopped. We need to transition to 100% renewable energy sources. We need to do what is best of the health of our population and planet, not what makes the fossil fuel industry the most money.\u00a0\nThe argument that it is either\u00a0the economy or the environment is invalid, as there are more jobs in a renewable and sustainable economy (estimated 3 times\u00a0more). Corporate influence must be removed from politics and the science must be respected.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm a doctor and anesthesiologist. I've put my practice on hold to run for office\u00a0because I think climate change is the most important issue facing the country.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce I read the IPCC\u00a0(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate report last fall, I knew I had to get involved.\u00a0\nAt my regular job, I deal with sick people in complex situations as part of my routine work.\u00a0 For most people that would be stressful. After examining the evidence for climate change, I was losing sleep thinking about ways to change my personal environmental footprint.\u00a0 We need to make changes at the federal level because they control the sectors where the largest emissions occur.\nI got involved to try and make the changes we need to keep our planet in a livable condition.\u00a0The Green Party is the only political party with the ethics and conviction to stand up to the old parties and corporations, to get things done.\nI'm doing this so we have the best chance to maintain a livable planet, so my kids have a chance at a reasonable existence.\u00a0To not act given the current evidence will be disastrous, and future generations won't understand why we seemingly chose self-destruction because it was more convenient than change.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nHealth care is top of mind. Although this is a provincial responsibility, we can see that wait times and quality of care have been long time concerns without question. No one has been able to assist with changing this.\nThe People's Party of Canada understands that one of the issues here is that provinces have had an unreliable source of federal funding year to year, making it difficult for them to plan and deliver the necessary services. Ottawa's health care transfers to the provinces have doubled since 2006 from $20 billion to $40 billion this year with nothing to show for it.\nWe will give up the GST, which is expected to be around $40 billion and send it to the provinces each year in order to stabilize health care funding. Ottawa will stop meddling in health care\u00a0and allow the provinces to be fully responsible for delivery of this service as the Constitution states.\n2.\u00a0People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nPersonally, I will stand up as the MP for Perth-Wellington and speak out for what the residents of this riding need. Our party policies are extremely helpful in this regard.\nTo assist with the cost of living we will abolish the carbon tax, which is going to impact the cost of everything that we need from groceries to shelter and etc, and replace the tax with nothing.\nWe will simplify the income tax system by raising the personal exemption to $15,000, charging only 15% tax from $15,001 to $100,000,\u00a0and charging 25% for $100,001 and over. This will help the more vulnerable while assuring that more fortunate citizens will pay their fair share of tax.\nWe will end supply management which will allow Canadians to access nutritious food at a reasonable price. To assist the Canadian economy, one step is to ensure that pipelines get built by using the Constitutional laws and we will do that.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change has always happened, thankfully, as we could not live here in Perth-Wellington without it. Twelve thousand years ago, this area was under ice and the earth warmed up. It did not warm up due to human activity.\nWe do not believe that there is a climate emergency. Due to the fact that there is no scientific consensus on this issue, we will not invoke costly taxes that will hurt our prosperity. Until such time, if ever, there is clear consensus, our approach to climate change will be to assist those most vulnerable to flooding and other natural disasters.\nWe do believe in a clean environment and all of us need to assist with that each day, we can all do our part. What will you do? Give up single-use plastics? Walk and bicycle more? Stop burning large amounts of fossil fuels on personal vacations? Will you drink municipal tap water? Will you plant trees? Will you conserve electricity? All of these actions will help us build a cleaner environment.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a lifelong resident of Perth County, having grown up on a dairy farm. I built a successful tool and die business in Stratford and retired financially independent at the age of 38. I ran as an independent candidate in this riding in 2015.\nI am thrilled to be part of this grassroots movement, the People's Party of Canada, whose policies I align with. I stand for fiscal responsibility and a vibrant Canadian economy. I stand for secure Canadian borders and our rights as a sovereign nation. We must uphold the rule of law and I believe in putting Canadians first.\nI believe we need to stop sending billions of dollars overseas for various reasons while so many Canadians, such as our veterans and etc., are experiencing difficulty making ends meet. I believe we need to stop or minimize UN funding. I believe in ending corporate welfare in Canada, a policy which only makes the wealthy\u00a0wealthier. I stand for a bold, new, proud Canadian future for all of us.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThe national debt and interest payments of $70 million a day!\u00a0 We would treat the debt as a mortgage and begin paying it down.\nFamily breakdown is leading to a housing crisis and CHP CANADA would strengthen the traditional family unit by providing income to the parent, either or, who stays home to raise the children or care for disabled, elderly or others in their own home.\u00a0\nFibre [internet]\u00a0to the home is important and CHP Canada offers infrastructure loans to move this project forward.\nCHP Canada wants to maintain our borders, protect our sovereignty and slowly extend legal immigration to those most able to assimilate into our Canadian culture that was and still is, based on \"The Supremacy of God and the Rule of Law.\"\nOur Christian heritage protects the freedom of religion for all people while secularism and humanism would deny religious freedom to Christians.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nCHP Canada would eliminate the income tax \u2014\u00a0completely freeing Canadians from the associated compliance costs. Replacing the income tax would be a fair tax\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a national sales tax on NEW goods only. This would allow both rich and poor to decide when to pay tax.\u00a0\nFor example, the rich buy a new car and pay a higher tax, the poor buy a used car and pay no tax. It will lead to economic advantages! Strengthen the traditional family unit and teach individuals how to manage money. Playing the game Cash Flow with my preteen grandchildren has taught them to get out of the rat race and avoid doodads.\nIt is a shame that the government preys on people's weakness by the get-rich quick scheme of the lottery.\u00a0 If five\u00a0per cent\u00a0is returned to the town, then, after expenses, big bucks left town for big business profits.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change, and associated alarmism, is a financial movement in favour of big business and increased control over people all around the world.\u00a0\nC02 is not a pollutant. Farmers buy it to put into their greenhouses to make the flowers grow. Farmers inject it into soil to beneficially create plant growth.\u00a0\nThe more C02 the better everything grows. Canada was once much greener than today as the fossil records show. We will adapt as changes are slow! CHP Canada would protect water, air and soil by fighting nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulates.\u00a0\nOf greater concern is Canada's moral environment which is creating family breakdown.\u00a0The porn industry is harming everyone's ability to maintain strong family ties ... The lack of respect for life, from the not-yet born human beings who are not granted human rights, to the elderly and disabled who may be coerced to assisted suicide because of their life's circumstances. The moral compass of our nation is eroding leading to a weak and vulnerable populace.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI am a farmer and small business owner with my husband. We raised four children to be healthy adults and have grandchildren.\u00a0I love to read and learn and I read legislation, court cases and alternative news sites. I like to garden and scrapbook and play with grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Vassy Kapelos, Emily Haws", "title": "Full transcript of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's year-end interview with Power & Politics", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-power-lunch-full-transcript-china-alberta-national-unity-1.5403368", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Dec 19, 2019 8:35 PM ET", "2019-12-20T01:44:16.361Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sat down with CBC News Network's Power & Politics host Vassy Kapelos for a year-end interview in which the Liberal leader discussed Canada's relationship with China, trade, frustrations being expressed by Alberta and Saskatchewan, his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump and much more.\nHere is the full transcript of that interview, edited for length and clarity:\nVassy Kapelos (VK): Hi Prime Minister Trudeau.\u00a0\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau (PMJT): Hello\u00a0Vassy.\nVK:\u00a0 Great to see you. Thank you for doing this.\nPMJT: No. Glad to. Glad to welcome you to a great restaurant in the riding.\u00a0\nVK: Yes, a great restaurant. Normally we start off the Power Lunch by asking why\u00a0we are eating where we are, but as I was saying to you a little bit earlier, I feel like the 30,000 members of my extended Greek family are going to be deeply offended that we're at an Italian restaurant, as lovely as it is.\u00a0\nPMJT: We did a Greek restaurant last time.\nVK: We did, we did. So this time is somewhere different. Speaking of last time, I remember asking you what, at the time, what kept you up at night and your answer was NAFTA. What keeps you up at night right now?\nPMJT: Still Canada's role in the world, Canada's trade opportunities, Canadians' prosperity. We know that there is a lot of anxiety that people are feeling out there, we know there are potential challenges in the global economy, and focusing on Canadians continuing to be ambitious engaged, optimistic about their future. That's my focus.\nVK: Let me ask you about some of the Canadians who feel particularly challenged in that area. I'm speaking of those who live in economies that are challenged right now in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Do you think, or what is your assessment, of the current state of unity in this country right now?\nPMJT: I think people, obviously as you say in Alberta and Saskatchewan, have faced some very difficult years and are worried, like so many people are, about their future, about their kids' future, about where their jobs are going to come from. It's just particularly poignant in Alberta where the dominant industry is one that is directly challenged by the reality of climate change and how we need to\u00a0transform our economy to be greener. But the point and the perspective that I have is: Absolutely we need to make sure we're supporting Albertans in Saskatchewanians, but we can't just support them. We need them to be successful to help us develop these new energy solutions. The innovation, the leadership, thoughtfulness that Albertans, in particular, have always brought to bear on creating prosperity and solutions, is something we need them to do again, and we need to get them to a place where they can do that, and that means investing.\nVK:\u00a0 I want to ask you specifically how you're going to do that in a second, but do you, as the leader of this country, think that national unity is at risk right now?\nPMJT: I think Canada is a country of differences, of diversity. There's always different regional dynamics going on. I think we need to take very seriously the very real anxiety and frustration that people in Alberta and Saskatchewan are facing. But I also know that they remain Canadians who want to be contributing to the country, want to be building a better future for their kids, and we need to do a better job of showing them that the future doesn't just include them, but it needs them.\nVK: With respect though, that didn't really answer whether or not you think national unity is at risk. I ask only because many others, and other leaders in this country, are saying that it is. In fact, after the election, they said it's never been this bad. Do you share that assessment?\nPMJT: I do not share the assessment to the extent that others have. I think there is, there is a level of\u00a0rhetoric that is maybe not as reassuring as it could be. I think there are very real frustrations. I think there is very real anger that needs to be dealt with in Alberta and Saskatchewan. But I see that as problems to be solved when we all work together, and I don't think Albertans suddenly don't care about Canada, for example. I think they just want and know that they have a strong future and that's what we need for them too.\nVK: The anxieties that you referred to -- do you think you caused some of them?\u00a0\nPMJT: I think, quite frankly there's a lot of different reasons for it. There's a transforming global economy, there's the difficulty we've always had in getting our resources out to new markets other than the United States. I mean, Stephen Harper tried to do that for 10 years, was unable to do that. We're finally moving forward on getting a pipeline to market --\nVK: -- It's very late though --\u00a0\u00a0\nPMJT: Well, we did in three or four years what\u00a0Stephen Harper was unable to do in 10 years. So --\u00a0\nVK: But you haven't done it yet, to be fair, the pipeline is not built. The construction is underway, but it still faces a court challenge.\nPMJT: Well, there's always going to be people in the courts, but that pipeline is getting built. The shovels are in the ground, and we have put our entire government energies behind moving that forward because it's an important project not just for Alberta and Saskatchewan, but for the whole country.\u00a0\nVK: Can I ask you how you view the realities of the economy, or the realities that the economies in Alberta and Saskatchewan face? In 2017, you said we can't shut the oil sands down but we have to phase them out. Do you believe that the oil sands will be phased out?\nPMJT: I think there is a need to move to a different energy mix. I think we're always going to need fossil fuels in different forms probably for the coming centuries, but we're going to be far less reliant on them. But, we've already seen a lot of energy companies, including in Alberta, investing in renewables, developing much cleaner approaches, more innovative things, as Albertans have always done.\u00a0\nThere's just a need to continue that work and realize that as people buy more and more electric cars, as we're trying to reach net-zero by 2020 -- by 2050, sorry -- we have a different kind of industry that's going to be developing. There's going to be great jobs in Alberta well into the future because Albertans are going to be creating them as we continue to build great new solutions.\nVK: Do you believe, though, that the oil sands will eventually shut down?\u00a0\nPMJT: I think we're always going to need hydrocarbons, we'll just need less of them, and in different ways. And I know that that's not going to happen anytime soon, but we do need to manage better alternatives.\u00a0\nVK: When you talk about that transition -- there are 200,000\u00a0people, the best estimate I can find, directly employed by the oil patch. And up to half a million others indirectly employed. There are a lot of people looking to your words, and kind of hanging on them wondering 'at what point does that phase out happen, at what point am I out of a job? I know I'm hearing from politicians saying that there will be training programs for me' but can you really guarantee any of those 200,000 people that they are going to have a job?\nPMJT: I think one of the issues is, this isn't a decision by Ottawa that suddenly, you know, climate change is something you have to deal with. We're seeing the floods, we're seeing the forest fires, we're seeing the extreme weather events, you know, hitting us hard around the world. The world is looking at the reality of global warming and saying we need to shift our energy mix. We need to innovate. We need to reduce our carbon emissions.\u00a0\nThese are factors that exist around the world that are going to intensify over the coming years.So I am saying, and I have been saying, we can get in front of that. We can use the resilience, the resourcefulness, the innovation that Canadians have always shown -- including people in Alberta and Saskatchewan around energy -- and we can help develop what that path is forward. We cannot simply just hope that it won't happen if there's a change of government in Ottawa, and suddenly everyone will go back to consuming all the oil that we used to.\nI know consumption is still going up, but there is a recognition that the world is looking for different solutions and either we are part of shaping that in a way that supports people through this transition -- that will take the coming decades -- or eventually, there is a wall that we hit that is going to be a lot harder to deal with than an orderly transition.\u00a0\nVK: I get that, and I'm not trying to take away from the effects of climate change, but I'm thinking if I'm one of those 200,000 Canadians, and Canada has, you know, 1.6 per cent of global emissions, and I'm being told my job is in jeopardy, and don't worry there, you know, we can still work something out.\u00a0\nThere's really no specifics being offered to that, and I get it that it's not you making that choice about climate change, but there's no specifics being offered other than 'we'll try to help you through the transition.' But what does that help look like?\nPMJT: I've actually sat down with Premier [Jason] Kenny and Premier [Scott] Moe and said 'Look my focus is on supporting Albertans concretely. Not just because we need to support Canadians who are in difficulty, but we need Albertans to be part of the solution.\u00a0\nNow, there is a political context where over the past while there have been a lot of people saying that 'we can't fight climate change because your job is going to disappear if we do.' I don't think that's been a responsible frame that a number of local leaders have had --\nVK: -- Is it true that they'll lose their job though?\nPMJT: No...We're going to continue to need to rely on oil for many years to come. We're building a pipeline, they're moving forward on continuing to deliver our oil to markets, and to Canadians while we need it.\u00a0\nBut we also have to be clear-eyed about the fact that over the coming decades, there's going to be a different energy mix that is going to create new opportunities for new jobs that we need to start preparing for now. And that's part of the reflection that I want to have with folks in Alberta, with folks in Saskatchewan.\nVK: Let me broaden it out a bit and ask you about the election. I want to look ahead, but just for a second look back toward the election. When you think of the results and your government's reduced mandate, how much of that is on you?\nPMJT: I think politics is very leader-centric, so I certainly take part of that responsibility, there's no question about it. But Canadians also sent a message that they want better collaboration, more partnership with other parties, with the provinces, on the big priorities they put forward. Canadians said to two-thirds of us 'we want more action on climate change' and we're going to do that. But two-thirds of us also said 'we want that Trans Mountain pipeline expansion,' and we're going forward with that. So there are lots of things that we're doing that are representative of the desires that\u00a0Canadians want and I take responsibility for paying very close attention to these election results and working differently because of it.\nVK: I want to ask you about something specific, then, on what happened during the election and how you dealt with it since, and that is the emergence of those photos of you in blackface. I remember, I think it was in Winnipeg, when you acknowledged that growing up you had a blind spot partly because of your upbringing.\u00a0 When I look at the composition of cabinet right now there's one black minister, there's to my knowledge only one black chief of staff, three of the top positions other than Minister Freeland -- Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Justice -- all occupied by white men. Have you really learned from the experience, and have you really addressed it in your actions?\nPMJT: Well, I think there is always a lot more to do, and one of the things we've talked about is the need to step up on unconscious bias and systemic discrimination. And that means changing our hiring practices,\u00a0 changing how we reach out to bring in more diverse candidates so there can be more cabinet ministers down the line. This is a process --\nVK: There are four black MPs, with respect, there could have been more black ministers.\nPMJT: Listen, we're always going to make decisions based on what the right fit is. There's a lot of things that go into it, and we're going to keep looking for opportunities to present judges, cabinet appointments across the government that look more like Canada.\nVK: The UN Decade for People of African Descent Push Coalition says that your cabinet choices leave it questioning your commitment to improve the lives of black Canadians. Do they have a point?\nPMJT: I've worked with the committee, I've worked with the Federation of African Canadians on the UN Decade, we've put forward significant amounts of money for community programs, for educational programs not just, you know,\u00a0society in general, but within our government as well, making sure that where we're understanding the kinds of unconscious biases that exist. There's lots more to do, I certainly agree that, and we're going to work with the community to do that.\nVK: I guess my question is though, could you, given what happened during the campaign, done more, even just through the selection of your cabinet?\nPMJT: I think there's always ways to do more, but I don't think we can limit to just one choice or, you know, one area. It needs to be much broader than that. I'm pleased to have an extraordinarily diverse Cabinet, and we're going to continue to do that. We're going to continue to make sure that our appointments across the government, and that our staffing choices all reflect the diversity of Canada including fighting anti-black racism.\nVK:\u00a0 Taking a bit of a turn on an announcement that your government made today around vaping. The announcement was to restrict advertising because of the negative effects of vaping that we're seeing so predominantly among Canadian youth. Why didn't your government go further and announce restrictions on the nicotine level and just ban flavoured vaping altogether?\nPMJT: This is definitely a first step, and that's certainly what the health minister talked about. There's a lot more information to gather, there's a lot more understanding to know. We know that restricting access and restricting advertising, particularly in its impact on young people, is a significant step, but we're very worried about the reports of extremely negative impacts of vaping.\nVK:\u00a0Are you worried about the industry suing the government? Like what would hold you back right now from moving further and faster?\nPMJT: I think we need to leave room for proper science. We're a government that works on evidence-based decisions --\u00a0\nVK:\u00a0 -- With respect, Health Canada has known since 2014 that it was having a really negative impact on the health of youth. This isn't necessarily a new revelation for Health Canada.\u00a0\nPMJT: Yeah, and there's more to do and we're going to keep doing it.\u00a0\nVK: And when --\u00a0 Is there a timeline for those decisions?\nPMJT: As you saw, I sent out very strong instructions to our health minister to move forward on keeping Canadians protected.\nVK: Okay, you said at the beginning that you think a lot about Canada's place in the world. When you think of Canada's foreign policy towards China, how would you describe it at this point?\nPMJT: At this point, we are very much challenged because\u00a0our position is that these two Canadians who have been unfairly detained need to be returned home. And we have done nothing but stand up for the rule of law and abide by our international obligations. And we certainly hope that China understands that and we can come to solving this situation.\u00a0\nVK: If you were\u00a0to articulate though, what our foreign policy is beyond just being strained with China, like, what is the foreign policy that you want to pursue as prime minister with China?\nPMJT: Well, we recognize that China is one of the most important economies in the world, that it is a potential market for Canadian goods, it is a potential partner in investments. But the challenge of human rights, the challenge of these detained Canadians, is always something that we have to be very, very aware of. China has a different approach towards the rules-based order than Canada does, and we have to have our eyes open to that even as we look to engage in ways that benefit Canadians.\u00a0\nVK: Is it just the Canadians who are detained, though? I mean they've got one million Uyghurs set up in what look like concentration camps right now --\nPMJT: -- Concerns with Hong Kong and the 300,000 Canadians, their concerns with the situation. The Weavers which I brought up with Premier Li last time I met with him. These are a range of concerns we have\u00a0when we talk about human rights, and the approach that China has on that as being something that is of concern to us.\u00a0\nVK: Your defence minister said that China is not an adversary. Do you agree?\nPMJT: I think in some ways there is an adversarial context in that we want them to release those Canadians who've been unfairly detained. In other areas, we're able to work on trade and work through issues like the beef and pork issue we were able to resolve this summer. There's obviously a multifaceted, complex relationship with China, as there has always been, but right now it is dominated by the fact that they have unfairly detained two Canadians.\nVK: Does it have to be so multifaceted though? I think for a lot of Canadians it's hard to rectify. Okay we want to do more business with you, but at the same time, you've got these two Canadians detained, you've got a million Uyghurs, what's happening in Hong Kong -- should we be pursuing a bigger relationship with China, given that country's record?\u00a0\nPMJT: Well, talk to our canola farmers about that, talk to the lobster fishermen on the East Coast who are seeing exports to China being incredibly good for their communities. Talk\u00a0to the cherry farmers and the cherry growers in the Okanagan. You know, China is a really important market for many of our natural resources. We just have to be careful, as we always have, that as we engage, we say strong on standing up for human rights. As we look to create mutual benefits through greater trade.\nVK: How do you stay strong on human rights, though, if you're sending the message that you want to do more with them?\u00a0\nPMJT: Listen, if Canada only ever spoke with countries who share our values we'd only talk to like six countries around the world.\nVK: I'm not just saying just talk, I'm saying trade--\nPMJT: We are the one country in the world, the one G7 country in the world, that has free trade deals with all other G7 countries. Canada is a trading nation. We've always had more resources than we have a domestic market to fully benefit from them. We're always going to be reliant on trade. And trade is a way of having an influence and having an importance to countries that we want to see make changes. And that's been a longstanding position around China, but it's one that we continually re-evaluate and continually\u00a0focus on.\nVK: Given how they've treated this country over the last year, would you ever pursue a formal free trade agreement again with China?\nPMJT: I think we're a long way from that. I think there is a role that Canada can play in helping China understand and play, perhaps in a more positive way, according to the international rules-based order. But China will make its own decisions. And until there is room to find that common ground, I don't think that greater free trade with China is really something we can explore.\nVK: But you haven't, you won't rule it out if the situation were to be resolved with those two Canadians?\u00a0\nPMJT: Oh if the situation were to be resolved with these two Canadians and we were to see significant, positive motion in other ways, this might be interesting. But it's not for anytime soon.\nLook at the NAFTA principle, right, of signing labour deals with Mexico to bring up the quality of life and the quality of labour conditions for workers in Mexico. That is one of the goals, one of the side benefits, of having trade agreements with countries who have very different approaches, or resources, or even standards than us.\nVK: If my memory serves me right though, when you tried to bring that up with China when you were there for those initial free trade talks, they balked.\nPMJT: Yeah, they were resistant to it. And that was one of the reasons we realized 'okay maybe there's not a path we're at for a greater trade agreement right now.'\nVK: Do you believe that there is a path out for those two Canadians that does not involve the end of the case involving Meng Wanzhou?\nPMJT: I certainly hope so, and that's certainly what we're working for. We've been very, very clear that this is a context where Canada is simply applying the rule of law and a long-standing extradition treaty with our closest partner and for China to have detained two Canadians in retaliation demonstrates that they don't entirely appreciate how our justice system works.\u00a0\nVK: Another big relationship we have of course is with the United States. Yesterday the president of the United States was impeached by the House of Representatives. Many Canadians, I'm not sure but I'm guessing you among them, watched that unfold to a certain degree. What's going through your head as you're watching that unfold?\nPMJT: My focus is on what matters for Canadians. And what matters for Canadians is us moving forward with the Republicans and the Democrats on the ratification of the new NAFTA deal.\nVK: So you had no thoughts when you saw the President of the United States impeached?\nPMJT: I don't engage on the domestic side with that. My role is to stand up for Canada's interests. And Canada's interests is to make sure that Americans are able, and the American Congress is able, to move forward with ratification so we can give the certainty to investors, a certainty to businesses, but also the reassurance to the millions of Canadians whose jobs depend on free trade with the United States.\nVK:\u00a0 Do you think the president was wrong to ask a foreign country to investigate a political rival?\nPMJT: That's the conversation going on right now in the United States. My focus is on the ratification for Canadians.\nVK: Would you ever ask a foreign country to investigate Andrew Scheer?\nPMJT: I never have.\nVK: Would you ever?\nPMJT: No.\nVK:\u00a0That video of you at NATO talking about President Trump -- were you making fun of him?\nPMJT: No, I was talking about what happened in my day. We were talking about whether the president was going to be late for this event. I said 'well, he does press conferences, that I'm happy to be part of, at every time so it's possible he's gonna be running late. And oh, by the way, in mine, in case you're interested, fellow G7 countries, he announced that we're going to Camp David\u00a0and it surprised his advisers.' It was a conversation about how my day went and how my afternoon went amongst colleagues.\nVK: Were you surprised, then, that he called you two-faced because of that?\u00a0\nPMJT: You know, I think we've been through\u00a0interesting moments in terms of the relationship with the president before. We were able, just a few days later, to talk about the ratification, or the approaching signing\u00a0of the new NAFTA. We were ready to sign it a few days after that. We're staying focused on the big things despite the other things.\n.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JustinTrudeau</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EmmanuelMacron</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a> and other VIPs shared a few words at a Buckingham Palace reception Tuesday. No one mentions <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realDonaldTrump</a> by name, but they seem to be discussing his lengthy impromptu press conferences from earlier in the day.

When will it be introduced for ratification here in Canada?\u00a0\nPMJT: We've already started the process in the House last week.\u00a0\nVK: So when do you expect ratification will be up for a vote?\nPMJT: We're going to do it as quickly as we can. A lot will depend on the other parties in the House. We're reasonably comfortable that we're going to have the support to pass it because the Conservatives were in agreement and approval of it last year even before we got all the improvements we got to it through working with the Democrats. So I'm confident it's going to pass, but we still need to make sure that it passes quickly.\u00a0\nAnd that's what we're calling on all parties in the House, and indeed all Canadians, to tell parties in the House that it needs to be moved quickly because their jobs --\u00a0 so many Canadian jobs -- rely on trade with the United States.\nVK: When you talk about your place, and Canada's place more specifically, in the world, that video that I just referenced, the pictures of you in blackface, the trip to India. Do you ever feel like you've embarrassed Canada?\u00a0\nPMJT: I think on the side of actual serious accomplishments, having been able to win an election in talking about putting a price on pollution in a compelling way where there is a majority of Canadians -- two-thirds of Canadians saying yes we want more action on climate change -- is an example to the world that the world has noticed that I have many conversations about in NATO. How we've been able to sign. As many trade deals and enact them, as we have. As I said we now have privileged access to two-thirds of the global GDP. All other G7 countries. These are the kinds of things that the world looks at and says 'wow we're in a moment of real protectionism and you're welcoming in immigrants and you're able to sign big trade deals and you're able to move forward on fighting climate change.' The world is really noticing the things we're able to do.\u00a0\nVK: So do your actions not take away from that at all? Do you ever feel like they have?\nPMJT: No, I think there's\u00a0always challenging moments in every country and every democracy and every leader's experience. But I think my responsibility and certainly what I share with Canadians and with others is that I'm going to stay focused on the things that really matter to Canadians' day to day lives.\u00a0\nVK: Have you asked Rona Ambrose to be the next ambassador to the United States?\nPMJT: I am going to allow the Conservative leadership to unfold as it will and I'm not going to interfere in one way or another.\nVK: Well, the story about whether or not she might be the next ambassador proceeded the start of that, proceeded Mr. Scheer's resignation. Are you interested in her serving in that role?\nPMJT: Rona did a very good job on our NAFTA panel and has some reflections to make about what she wants in her future and I wish her well.\u00a0\nVK: Does that mean that you have asked her to serve in that role?\u00a0\nPMJT: I'm not going to comment on that, but no I haven't asked her.\nVK: You haven't asked\u00a0her. Are you worried about the possibility of her as leader of that party?\nPMJT: You know, I think the Conservative Party has some big reflections to make about whether or not they're going to stand up for women's rights and LGBT rights, whether they're going to call for real action on climate change and understand that there is a path forward to grow the economy and fight climate change at the same time, and those are pretty foundational questions that don't really hinge on which leader they choose.\u00a0\nThese are fundamental questions the Conservative Party is going to have to grapple with. I'm going to allow them to go through that process and I'll stay focused on the mandate and the agenda that we're putting forward for Canadians.\nVK: I ask because exactly what you just described is what your party was able to zone in on during the campaign, particularly Andrew Scheer's stance on social issues as well as the climate file. Ms. Ambrose, at least at this point, is viewed as someone who would be less vulnerable to those criticisms and I wonder if that is a worry to you given the current context of a minority government?\nPMJT: I'm not going to weigh in on who the Conservatives should or shouldn't have as leader. That's a decision for Conservatives to take, and I wish them luck. I know we've had some difficult leadership elections, we've had some successful leadership processes, some that didn't lead to the rebuild that we would have liked. It's a process the Conservative Party has to go through.\nVK: Do you think it was the right decision for Andrew Scheer to step down?\nPMJT: That was his decision and I respect him for taking it and wish him the best.\nVK: Speaking of decisions, the next fixed election date is in October 2023. Do you plan on serving that mandate? Will you leave it to the opposition to put that mandate in jeopardy? Would you ever do anything to cause an election?\nPMJT:\u00a0 Listen, our focus is on getting big things done for Canadians, continuing to work on affordability, on fighting climate change, on keeping Canadians safe, on working on health care. There's a lot of things to do. We're going to take as much time as we have to deliver for Canadians and I'm going to let Parliament decide when the next election is.\nVK: But what about from your party's perspective? Essentially, are you committed to serving until that date, until 2023, unless you lose a confidence vote to the opposition?\nPMJT: We have a fixed election date. I respected it last time. I intend to respect it, if it's at all possible, this time. But we know that minority governments have things happen and we need to be ready for an election as soon as possible, which is something that we're working on.\nVK: Okay, I'll leave it there. Prime Minister, thank you.\nVK:\u00a0Who is your political hero?\nPMJT: My father.\nVK: Who is your personal hero?\nPMJT: My mother.\u00a0\nVK: Donald Trump or Joe Biden?\nPMJT: I'm Canadian so I don't have a vote.\u00a0\nVK: Rona Ambrose or Peter MacKay?\u00a0\nPMJT: I'm a Liberal so I don't have a vote.\nVK: I handed that one to you. And do you have a new year's resolution?\nPMJT: You're already seeing it. More collaboration, more thoughtful engagement. Looking for common ground instead of forging through with my own perspective.\n"}]
