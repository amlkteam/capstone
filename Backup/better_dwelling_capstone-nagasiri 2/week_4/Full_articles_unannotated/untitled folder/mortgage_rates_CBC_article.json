But we know that debt levels are going to rise, so the right combination of economic policies will be important, too.\"\nOne of the issues on the bank's radar will be the number of people having\u00a0trouble staying on top of their mortgages.\nThe bank said that if no new policies had been implemented in response to the unprecedented economic impact of COVID-19, the mortgage arrears rate may\u00a0have risen\u00a0to 2.1 per cent of all loans by the end of this year. That means more than one out of every 50 homeowners would be at least three months behind on their payments\u00a0\u2014 almost 10 times the number that were before the COVID-19 crisis.\nAs it stands, because of some of the policies put in place, the bank says that under the current worst case scenario, the\u00a0mortgage arrears rate will spike to about 0.8 per cent and remain on a much flatter curve that doesn't peak until next year, once payment deferral plans offered by the big banks at the outset of this crisis\u00a0are set to expire.\nCurrently, the mortgage arrears rate is at slightly more than 0.2\u00a0per cent. If the rate peaks to 0.8 per cent, that would be roughly twice as high as its highest point during the financial crisis of 2009.\u00a0\nThe bank did caution that those forecasts are assuming the worst case scenario for its stress-test modelling, and far more optimistic scenarios could play out.\n\"The unprecedented nature of the pandemic .. makes the uncertainty around the results exceptionally high,\" the bank said.\nWe already know about record-setting job losses during the\u00a0pandemic, but the bank gave some new data regarding just how many people are finding it hard to make ends meet.\nBy its calculations, the bank says about one out of every five home-owning households\u00a0in Canada doesn't currently have enough money to cover two months'\u00a0worth of expenses, and almost one third don't have enough to cover four months'\u00a0worth.\nEven despite the financial support programs, such as\u00a0wage subsidies, implemented by the federal government, \"some households are likely to fall behind on their loan payments,\" the bank said.\u00a0\"This typically appears first in missed credit card and auto loan payments and later in mortgage payments.\"\nWatch | Deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins on the outlook for Canada's housing market:\nThat's not just a problem for homeowners, either, Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Brian DePratto\u00a0says.\n\"Renters are not immune, as they are more likely to work in industries most affected by COVID-19,\" he said. \"The longer the income shock, the greater the risk of increased consumer insolvencies.\n\"Broad-based income support measures can only last so long, making the gradual economic reopening crucial to the health of the Canadian economy's financial underpinnings.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Interest rates are plunging \u2014 so why aren't mortgage rates?", "description": "Bond yields and central bank rates have never been lower, but not all the savings are filtering down", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/interest-rates-coronavirus-evans-1.5515884", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5516600.1585684340!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mortgage-applications.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 04, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-04-04T13:24:14.398Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Central banks around the world have slashed their benchmark interest rates to pretty much zero in an attempt to stimulate the economy by making it as easy as possible to borrow, spend and invest.\nBut a curious thing is happening in Canada's mortgage market: rates aren't going down by as much as they probably should be. And in some cases, they're actually rising.\n\"Usually\u00a0when the Bank of Canada cuts rates like they have, by 1.5 percentage points in a month, you can expect all rates to fall,\" said\u00a0James Laird, president of mortgage brokerage CanWise Financial and\u00a0co-founder of\u00a0Ratehub.ca.\n\"At first they did ...\u00a0but a week and a half ago, we started to see a shift [and] now we are seeing our\u00a0lenders increase rates. Every two days, we get a different lender saying we are going up by point one, point two.\"\nMortgage rates tend to move up and down based on a number of factors, but one of the main ones is the costs borne by the lenders themselves.\nPeople tend to think that when someone walks into a bank to ask for a home loan, if they are approved, the bank just takes the cash out of some safe at the back, hands it over to the borrower and charges them interest over time to make a profit.\nBut, in fact, banks don't keep that much money just lying around either \u2014\u00a0they typically borrow it themselves\u00a0and make money on the spread between how much they're charged for it\u00a0and how much they turn around and charge the borrower for it.\nThe cost of financing a variable rate loan is strongly influenced by the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, because banks tend to set their own prime lending rates based on whatever the central bank's rate is.\nThe bank has cut that rate by 150 basis points \u2014 1.5 percentage points \u2014\u00a0in the past month\u00a0to try to make it as easy and cheap as possible for people to borrow, spend and invest to stimulate the economy that has been waylaid by COVID-19.\nA few short weeks ago, it wasn't hard to find a variable rate mortgage for something around prime minus one \u2014 a full percentage point below whatever a bank's prime lending rate was at the time.\nBut a funny thing has happened since then. Prime lending rates have gone down more or less in lockstep with the Bank of Canada's moves, but those discount rates for mortgages have evaporated.\n\"About half of the savings have been passed along and half kept by banks for a higher margin,\" Laird said.\nThe reason they're doing that is the same as why\u00a0stock markets plunged\u00a0and governments rushed to\u00a0implement lockdowns on millions of people: fear.\n\"Lenders are saying, 'Hold on a second,'\" Laird said. \"If a million people are going to lose their jobs and unemployment is going to rise, maybe we should build in a bit of a risk premium to our\u00a0pricing to account for possible defaults for this new money we are lending.\"\nWhen the economic outlook was more clear, banks were happy to cut rates as low as possible to try to gobble up market share. But now, they're saying \"We better earn a bit more of a spread on this money because these things might default at a higher rate than we're used to,\" Laird said.\nThe impact isn't dramatic. Laird says a few weeks ago, the best mortgage rates were something in the range of between two and 2.5 per cent. Today, they're between 2.5 and three per cent because, as he puts it, \"they are demanding a higher risk premium than what they typically do.\"\nOthers aren't quite so diplomatic.\n\"It's total garbage,\" Marcus Tzaferis with mortage brokerage Cannect said. \"It's complete profit taking.\"\nWhile banks borrow at a rate slightly above that government rate,\u00a0Tzaferis says \"the spread between their cost of borrowing and some of their five-year fixed mortgage rates is still around 250 points, which is highly profitable for them.\"\nFixed-rate loans aren't pegged to the Bank of Canada's rate and are instead more influenced by the bond market. And there, too, Tzaferis says what's happening in the market doesn't reflect what's happening behind the scenes.\nLenders finance fixed-rate loans on the bond market, where yields have fallen to record lows in the current COVID-19 crisis. The yield on a five-year government of Canada bond bottomed out at around 0.37 per cent this month and is currently hovering just over 0.5 per cent.\u00a0\nThough banks must pay a credit spread on bond yield and that may be widening, Tzaferis says they are also widening their profit margins. Most fixed-rate mortgages are currently going for around three per cent, he points out.\nThe difference for borrowers adds up fast. Laird calculates that a theoretical buyer who put down a 10 per cent deposit on a house costing $500,000 before this crisis would likely have been able to get a mortgage rate of 2.6 per cent, which would make their payment $2,102 a month.\nIf all three rate cuts since then were to be fully factored into that loan, that borrower's monthly payment would fall\u00a0as low as $1,769 a month\u00a0\u2014 that's\u00a0$333 per month or $3,996 per year on their mortgage payments, compared to what they were paying less than a month ago.\nThe overwhelming majority of first-time buyers opt for fixed-rate loans because they like the security of knowing that their monthly payment is guaranteed to not increase.\u00a0The banks know this, Tzaferis says, and it could soon have a heavy cost for borrowers.\n\"They're using this as an opportunity to lock people into big fat juicy\u00a0and profitable five-year mortgages,\" he said. \"When their rates drop those consumers are going to have massive penalties to break them ...\u00a0tens of thousands of dollars.\"\n\"It's absolutely insanity,\" Tzaferis\u00a0said. \"This is a totally manufactured crisis to profit.\"\nLaird and Tzferis both say that the current situation can't last forever. Economists are already predicting that the COVID-19 recession is likely to be incredibly sharp, but it's anyone's guess\u00a0how long it will go on for.\nLaird says the best sign that things are getting back to normal will be when the big banks start to act in a way that seems paradoxical.\nBanks are raising their rates right now because they feel just as uncertain about the future as Canadians do. Once that cloud lifts, they'll want to start lowering rates again, and \"they won't build in that uncertainty premium like they are now,\" said Laird.\n\"As confidence returns, you'll see rates fall.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Why worries about the coronavirus are pushing mortgage rates down", "description": "Fear has pushed investors to buy up bonds, which is causing cheaper borrowing for home buyers", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-mortgage-rates-canada-1.5443071", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5443215.1580239186!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/germany-dax.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 29, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-01-29T09:00:00.512Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Economists are busy trying to calculate the potential economic toll of the coronavirus\u00a0outbreak that's currently making its way around the world. But there's one marketplace that is already, quite unexpectedly, quantifying the full force\u00a0of the bug: mortgages.\nRates for fixed- and variable-rate home loans are based on a variety of factors, but one of the biggest is the price that lenders have to pay to borrow money themselves.\nFor fixed-rate Canadian home loans, the benchmark that sets the price that consumer rates are based on is the five-year Government of Canada bond.\nInvestors who covet bonds like that one do so because they are perceived to be safe. Investors\u00a0are willing to accept the relatively meagre returns that government debt\u00a0offers because it's better than the alternative \u2014 losing money on whatever other, riskier investment they would have had to buy instead.\nCounterintuitively, the price of a bond and its yield move in opposite directions. So when appetite for bonds goes up, the amount they pay out goes down, because lenders don't have to offer quite as good a deal to find a buyer for their debt.\nThe price of bonds tends to increase when people are feeling fearful,\u00a0a situation that certainly describes the state of affairs today amid a mysterious coronavirus emanating from mainland China\u00a0that has killed more than 100\u00a0people and infected\u00a0thousands more.\nThat fear is prompting investors to pour money into the safety of\u00a0government bonds, and all that buying is pushing down the yield on that debt.\nAs recently as the start of the year, the yield on the five-year Canadian government bond was about 1.7 per cent. This week, it dipped as low as just above 1.3. In the staid world of bonds, a 40-point drop in a relatively short period is huge, and it's filtering down into the mortgage market.\nFixed-rate loans are highly influenced by bond yields, because\u00a0a\u00a0mortgage lender makes money on the spread between the\u00a0bond rate and what they offer to consumers. If the five-year bond yield goes up, they can\u00a0just pass that cost on to consumers. If it goes down, as it is now, the lender's cost of borrowing goes down, so they can turn around and lower their rates for consumers to drum up new business.\nThat's what seems to be happening.\nFixed-rate loans are falling, according to James Laird, CEO of mortgage broker Canwise Financial and co-founder of rate comparison website RateHub.ca. While specific rates will vary based on the borrower and what part of the country they're in, currently the best deal on offer for a five-year fixed loan is 2.64 per cent with a trust company\u00a0and 2.74 per cent from a big bank. Barely a month ago, those rates would have been roughly 10 to 20 points higher.\nWhile bond yields have fallen by about 40 basis points in that period, that means lenders so far have only passed on about a quarter of those savings to consumers. But that is likely to\u00a0soon change.\nLenders are always slower to pass on savings than they are to pass on added costs, Laird said, but they can only hold off for so long.\n\"If\u00a0bond yields were up by 40 points, you can guarantee far more [lenders] would have changed rates and by a greater amount,\" Laird\u00a0said. \"On the way down they're a little slower ... they enjoy thicker margins for a while.\"\nCoronavirus fears have really only sped up the process of a move toward lower rates that was already underway, he said.\nIn its policy decision last week, the Bank of Canada elected to keep its benchmark interest rate where it is for now.\u00a0But by singling out concerns over the job market, international trade and other factors, it's clear the bank is leaning more toward rate cuts than hikes, Laird said.\nVariable-rate mortgages set their rates based on what the Bank of Canada is doing, not bond yields. And based on the central bank's last statement, traders think there's about an 80 per cent chance of at least one rate cut by the end of 2020. That means home buyers with variable-rate loans can expect some relief soon, too.\nThere's also some seasonality at play in all this. All things being equal, lenders like to hit the ground running on the busy spring home buying season, so Laird often sees rate cuts in mid-February or March, regardless of what bonds are up to.\u00a0\nThe sudden impact of the coronavirus is just causing that to happen a little earlier and a little more dramatically than anticipated.\n\"It's\u00a0not like rates were on the rise and the coronavirus\u00a0caused them to do a U-turn,\" he said. \"I'd say this is another area which is putting downward pressure on bond yields, and therefore downward pressure on mortgage rates.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "U.S. Fed chair rules out negative interest rates even as Trump trumpets them", "description": "U.S. president goes negative on Jerome Powell for rejection of below-zero interest rates", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/powel-trump-negative-rates-1.5567512", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5258204.1566589338!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/869482910.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 13, 2020 10:48 AM ET", "2020-05-13T15:17:41.088Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The head of the Federal Reserve said Wednesday the U.S. central bank is not considering using negative interest rates, despite President Donald Trump seemingly pushing for them.\nIn a tweet Tuesday night, the president said other countries are enjoying the advantages of negative interest rates, and he urged his own central bank to accept the \"gift\" they would bestow on the U.S. economy.\nTypically central banks tinker with lending rates in an attempt to control inflation, raising rates when they want to cool down an overheated economy, and cutting them when they want to encourage borrowing and investment.

That's the lowest range since the summer of 2017, he says, and a big reason why is the bond market.\nUnlike variable rate loans which take their cues from the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, lenders finance fixed-rate loans based on the rates they can get in the bond market. Essentially, they'll borrow money themselves at one rate, loan it out to a borrower at a higher rate\u00a0and make money on that spread.\nSo current rock-bottom interest rates on fixed loans are no coincidence, considering the yield on a five-year Government of Canada bond dipped below 1.3 per cent this month. If a lender can borrow funds for as little as 1.3 per cent then turn around and make money by loaning it out for twice that rate, they have every incentive to keep offering those deals.\n\"The hard cost of funding these loans is going down,\" Laird said. \"And at the same time we are at the tail end of the most competitive market, when lenders fight for [business], so that's when they are willing to thin out their margins a bit to attract volume.\"\nVariable rate loans are also sliding lower, too.\nMost borrowers prefer the peace of mind\u00a0of fixed rate loans, but lenders can tempt borrowers to variable rate loans with even better rates \u2014 even if they're only temporary.\nLaird says typically it takes a spread of about a full percentage point to entice most people to make the leap. Which is why those loans are even less popular than usual because that premium has almost completely vanished.\nHe says the best variable rate loans are about 2.65 per cent at the moment, which is barely better than the fixed rate, for a lot more risk.\nAnyone signing up for that loan today is \"assuming the Bank of Canada is going to be forced to drop their rate once or twice. That would be the only way to justify taking it,\" he said. The bank's benchmark rate is 1.75 per cent.\u00a0\nTrading in investments known as overnight index swaps suggests investors think there's about a 50 per cent chance of a rate cut by the central bank\u00a0this year \u2014 but two would be very unlikely, and never mind any more beyond that.\nLower rates could be good news for those who've already bought, too.\nA recent report by National Bank found that a little more than one out of every six mortgages in Canada is up for renewal this year, and as recently as January the bank was calculating that most of them could expect to be paying between 70 and 90 more basis points on their next loan than they were on their current one.

He said the industry could contract by 40 per cent.\nThe report notes real estate and population growth have been stunted by COVID-19 as well.\n\"The pandemic and its resulting travel restrictions will slow Hamilton's recent strong growth in net in-migration, which hit 8,325 in 2019\u2014the highest level since 1989. This year we expect 6,520 net new arrivals\u2014a 21.7 per cent decline compared with last year. This will cut Hamilton's population growth to 8,094, down from 9,133 in 2019,\" reads the report.\n\"The local retail trade sector will contract in 2020, as a depressed economy, a weak labour market, and slower household disposable income growth force nervous consumers to tighten their purse strings. Retail sales are forecast to fall by 3.3 per cent, leading retail trade output to contract by 3.8 per cent. A rebound of 5.2 per cent is expected in 2021.\"\nHamilton's GDP is set to decline by 3.2 per cent this year but will jump by 6 per cent and kick off a steady and strong resurgence \u2014 as long as the pandemic continues to become less of a threat and there isn't another set of shutdowns.\n\"When economic activity contracts so swiftly, on the other side of it you will have a stronger rebound,\" Crawford said.\nHe added Hamilton was in a great economic position before the pandemic, which has softened the impact.\nThe city is also planning an economic recovery task force to deal with the aftermath of COVID-19.\nBy summer, if the virus hasn't rebounded, Crawford thinks people will begin spending more as businesses open up and restrictions fade away.\n\"If cities like Hamilton, which have seen very strong population growth, which do have a strong and vibrant housing market, which do benefit from high-paying jobs \u2026\u00a0can just get through this lockdown period and successfully navigate the re-opening hopefully we can all put this in our rearview mirror and start the recovery in mid-summer moving on into the fall.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Housing starts up in some parts of Canada despite COVID-19", "description": "Multi-unit housing projects remained strong in some provinces in April, CMHC says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/housing-starts-april-1.5561214", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5358323.1573674927!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cranes-front-spadina.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 08, 2020 2:17 PM ET", "2020-05-08T18:17:56.530Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. says construction of multi-unit housing projects remained strong in some provinces last month despite the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCMHC estimates a 10.8 per cent month-over-month increase in its national seasonally adjusted annual rate last month compared with March, excluding Quebec.\nThe federal agency says there was growth in multi-family starts in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba in April but Quebec was left out of the monthly national tally because the province's COVID-19 containment measures were in place until April 20.\nThe April seasonally adjusted annualized rate, excluding Quebec, was 166,415 units, up from 150,224 units in March.\nExcluding Quebec, multiple dwelling starts in urban areas of Canada were up 35.7 per cent from March, while urban single-family starts fell 27.1 per cent.

Since then, said Giroux,\u00a0new\u00a0aid programs have been announced for commercial rent support, the agricultural sector, students and seniors \u2014 things he called \"very expensive measures.\"\n\"I think $252 billion is on the very optimistic side, as things stand now,\" Giroux said.\n\"In all likelihood the deficit will be higher than $252 billion. If I had to bet on that number, I'd say it's more likely to be worse than that than better than that.\"\nAs a result, the federal debt will rise to more than $900 billion \u2014 or roughly $24,000 for every man, woman and child in Canada.\nGiroux said it's \"not unthinkable\" that the federal debt could reach $1 trillion, and it's\u00a0both \"possible and realistic\" that the debt could hit\u00a013 figures by this time next year.\nIn fact, depending on how long the pandemic lasts, it's possible that pandemic\u00a0programs could cost more than what the entire federal government\u00a0spent last year on everything \u2014 which was roughly $337.8 billion for the 2018-19 fiscal year.\nWatch:\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's full press conference for Tue.

Before the pandemic, the government projected a ratio closer to 30 per cent.\nWhile that figure is high, Giroux said it's still well below the 66 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio the country reached in the 1990s\u00a0\u2014 when the Wall Street Journal branded Canada \"an honourary member of the Third World.\"\nThe cost of financing this massive increase in government spending, and the resulting debt, will be relatively low, Giroux said. He said interest rates have hit rock bottom \u2014 the Bank of Canada's benchmark interest rate is now at 0.25 per cent \u2014\u00a0and\u00a0the cost of servicing the debt will be manageable.\n\"We anticipate that debt charges will not go up, which is surprising and counterintuitive,\" Giroux said. \"Interest rates are so much lower than what we anticipated them to be just two or three months ago. It doesn't cost that much to finance that growing debt.\n\"Is the government in a worrisome position right now? The answer is no.\"\nHe said the debt load could become \"unbearable\" in the event of a sizeable spike in interest rates and added the prospect of such an increase is\u00a0\"concerning.\"\nThe Liberal members of the committee asked Giroux what the cost to Canadians would have been if the government hadn't\u00a0stepped in to flow funds to Canadians through programs like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the wage subsidy.\nGiroux said that, without government support, Canadians would have suffered considerable economic pain because of the pandemic.\n\"We would have seen widespread \u2014 and I mean widespread \u2014 bankruptcies at the individual and corporate level,\" he said. \"There would be lots of defaults on mortgages, repossession of homes and cars, credit card debts that would go unserviced.\n\"The cost of doing nothing would be high.\"\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "Time to buy?

Bidding wars are still occurring and it remains a sellers' market for condos under $700,000 and detached homes around $1.6 million, whereas the market for more expensive homes tends\u00a0to favour buyers. \u00a0\nSo far, there hasn't been a lot of panic or forced selling, but I believe that could change in the fall.\nWhen trying to forecast where the market is heading, there are two variables that I will be closely monitoring \u2014 the post COVID-19 employment numbers and the expansion or\u00a0introduction of new government programs created to combat the financial effects of the pandemic.\u00a0\nA low unemployment rate does wonders for real estate valuations as it is an indicator that the economy is functioning well. Strong economies attract new investments, businesses, immigrants, temporary workers, international students, refugees \u2014 all of which increases demand for housing\u00a0and results in higher rents and house prices.\u00a0\nA weak economy does the opposite. People will not move here unless they think they can find a job, while recently laid off workers with few ties to Vancouver may leave. In other words, we see less demand and more supply.\nAccording to Moody's analytics, for every one\u00a0per cent increase in unemployment, house prices typically drop about 4 per cent. Based on this ratio, if our unemployment rate were to double from pre-COVID-19 levels, home values would drop by roughly 20 per cent.\nThe main reason house prices are not currently dropping is due to government intervention.\u00a0The various levels of government\u00a0stepped in with a series of temporary programs to replace or subsidize the income of those affected by COVID-19. They also arranged for many of our expenses to be deferred \u2014 such as utility bills, taxes and mortgage payments. All these programs have bought struggling homeowners some time, and have taken the pressure off to sell their homes.\u00a0\nBut what happens when the safety nets disappear? That is when the ill-prepared or vulnerable homeowners will be forced to sell. \u00a0Many of the government programs are expected to wind down in the summer and\u00a0fall, and we may see a spike in new listings \u2014 a great time for buyers but terrible for sellers.\nIf I had plans to sell my home sometime in\u00a02020 or early 2021, I would be listing my home sooner rather than later. While I'm not expecting a 20 per cent drop in value over the short term, it also wouldn't surprise me if it did happen.\u00a0I also wouldn't be surprised if the government bailed out the housing market and valuations returned to all time highs. The B.C. government's tax base is heavily reliant on the construction and housing industries,\u00a0so they can't afford to have housing valuations drop too low. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile I'm very cautious on real estate over the short term, I still think it's a solid long-term investment.\nMy advice to prospective buyers, if valuations drop by 15 to 30 per cent in 2020 or early 2021, consider leaving the sidelines as it could be the buying opportunity that many of you have been waiting for.\nIf you have a COVID-19-related story we should pursue that affects British Columbians, please email us at\u00a0impact@cbc.ca\n"}, {"author": "Vianne Timmons", "title": "Put yourself in their shoes: Let's thank the women on the front line of the pandemic", "description": "Women are often in harm's way in this pandemic, says MUN president ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/vianne-timmons-pov-women-1.5559214", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["May 09, 2020 9:00 AM NT", "2020-05-09T11:30:00.782Z"], "source": null, "content": "Chances are the last time you bought your groceries, you were checked out by a woman.\nWomen are the majority of cleaners, cashiers and food-service workers.

The decline since February (-15.7 per cent) outpaces previous financial crises, including\u00a0the 1981-1982 recession, which resulted in a drop of\u00a0-5.4 per cent over 17 months.\u00a0\n\"Today's job numbers start to complete the picture of just how devastating the COVID-19 crisis has been to the Canadian labour market,\" said economist Brendon Bernard of job site Indeed Canada in an email.\n\"While April's decline was a bit more modest than expected, that 6.4 per cent\u00a0of all Canadian adults could lose employment in a single month is staggering.\"\nJob losses are not the only way the COVID-19 crisis has impacted employment. In addition to those who are now out of work, the number of people who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours because of the pandemic increased by 2.5 million from February to April.\nThat means the cumulative effect of the economic shutdown \u2014 people\u00a0both no longer employed or working far less \u2014 was a staggering 5.5 million as of the week of April 12.\nAll provinces have been hard hit by the crisis. Employment dropped in all provinces for the second month running, with losses of more than 10 per cent everywhere.\nQuebec had the worst losses in April at -18.7 per cent, or 821,000 jobs.\u00a0\u00a0\nHere are the jobless rates last month by province (numbers from the previous month in brackets):\nAs for Canada's three territories, due to logistical challenges,\u00a0Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey methodology is somewhat different there than in the rest of Canada, said Bernard.\n\"Employment rates in the territories haven't been hit as hard as the rest of Canada. That said, Nunavut saw a noticeable drop in the share of the population with a job in April, a sign of how public health concerns and economic uncertainty have extended beyond just the pandemic's hot spots.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nThere is evidence to suggest, however, that\u00a0many pandemic-related\u00a0job losses are temporary.\nIn the month of April, almost all of the newly unemployed \u2014 97 per cent \u2014 were on temporary layoff, indicating they expect to return to their previous places of work as the shutdown is relaxed.\nAt the same time, workplace participation declined to\u00a03.7 percentage points, bringing Canada's participation rate to 59.8 per cent, as more than 1 million dropped out of the labour force, said Porter.\nAmong those still employed, the Labour Force Survey found that an additional 3.3 million workers were working\u00a0from home in April.\nLosses continued to be more rapid in jobs with less security and poorer pay.\nOver the two-month period since February, overall employment (not adjusted for seasonality) declined 17.8 per cent.\nBut it was\u00a0above average among employees with temporary jobs (-30.2 per cent) and those who had been in their jobs one year or less (-29.5 per cent).\nDeclines were sharper for employees earning less than two-thirds of the median hourly wage of $25.04 (-38.1 per cent) and those paid by the hour (-25.1 per cent).\nStatistics Canada said this is consistent with job declines observed in accommodation and food services, and wholesale and retail trade, which tend to be more precarious and lower paying.\nThe\u00a0number of people age 15 and older living households where no one is employed increased\u00a023.5 per cent \u2014 or more than 1.6 million \u2014 in the two months between February and April.\nAmong couples, the number where neither partner is employed increased by 22.5 per cent, or 845,000,\u00a0while single parents who are not employed increased by 53.9 per cent, or\u00a0126,000.\nSmaller companies \u2014 defined as those with fewer than 20 employees \u2014 have shed 30.8 per cent of their workers, medium-sized firms have let 25.1 per cent of workers go, and large companies have seen employment decline by 12.6 per cent.\nHard-hit sectors at the outset include retail, hotels, restaurants and bars, which continued to see losses in April. The losses in the service sector also continued in April, down 1.4 million, or 9.6 per cent, Statistics Canada says.\nProportionally, the losses were greater in goods-producing sectors like construction and manufacturing, which combined lost 621,000 jobs for a drop of 15.8 per cent after being virtually unchanged in March.\nThe federal government announced Friday it will extend its emergency wage-subsidy to the end of June. The program \u2014 which covers 75 per cent of employees' pay, up to $847, to help employers keep their workers on the payroll for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis \u2014 was previously set to end June 6.\nAverage wages in April were up 10.8 per cent compared with a year ago.

That's down 244,000 from mid-March, when social-distancing measures had only just begun.\nCombined with the roughly 117,000 people who lost work in March, the province has now seen a decline in employment equal to about 10 per cent of its total, working-age population\u00a0\u2014 in the span of two months.\nThat's by far the largest and fastest decline the province has seen\u00a0since Statistics Canada's modern employment records began in 1976.\nThe new numbers further reveal the extent of the economic shutdown across Canada, as well.\nNationally, there were nearly two\u00a0million fewer Canadians working\u00a0in April, compared with March. That's on top of the roughly one million people who lost work in March, compared to February.\nThe global pandemic has had a more pronounced effect on some types of employment, particularly service-industry workers, who tend to be younger.\nOver the past two months, the employment rate \u2014 that is, the percentage of people working\u00a0\u2014\u00a0among Albertans under the age of 25 has fallen by nearly 20 percentage points.\nYoung women in the province saw their employment rate nearly cut in half, falling from\u00a055.9 per cent in February\u00a0to just\u00a030.3 per cent in April.\nThis trend was evident in March, as many service-industry employers were among the first to shut down in the wake of COVID-19.\nHope Sheridan, 25,\u00a0worked as a recruiter with GoodLife Fitness in Calgary until the gym closed down in mid-March and she was laid off on a temporary basis.\nShe said her employer hopes to reopen as soon as possible but it's still not clear exactly when they will be allowed to resume operations and, as a young mother, the uncertainty has been difficult.\n\"It's been extremely stressful,\" she said.\n\"There are no answers on whether we're coming back anytime soon.\"\nAnd while younger female workers were hit hard again in April, Tombe said the effects of the pandemic expanded to other, more male-dominated sectors, as well.\n\"What we saw in April is, as the economic contraction proceeded, losses in the construction sector and in manufacturing really closed that gender gap quite a bit,\" he said.\nThe overall unemployment rate in Alberta jumped 4.7 percentage points from March, rising to\u00a013.4 per cent in April.\nBut Tombe says that figure masks the extent of the job losses, given how many people are not looking for work amid the deliberate shutdown of the economy, and are not included in that count.\nWhen looking at the total\u00a0\"potential\" labour force, he said, 32 per cent of Albertans who could be working are not.\nAnother unusual aspect to this economic shutdown is the number of people who are still employed but working fewer hours.\n\"There are a large number of individuals who didn't actually lose their job but have basically lost all of their hours worked,\" Tombe said.\nAbout 330,000 people in Alberta recorded zero hours worked in April, he said.\nOverall, the number of hours worked in province was down 24.8 per cent compared with February.\nThe number of hours worked was down even more sharply in other provinces, particularly Quebec.\nTombe noted Alberta was already in an economic slump, even before the pandemic arrived.\n\"In Alberta's case, the downturn due to the virus is following many months of disappointing economic performance and, indeed, employment losses even prior to February,\" he said.\n\"We were potentially entering a second recession even before the virus hit in Alberta, so it's a particularly challenging time for this province.\"\nThe province's employment numbers were the subject of an exchange between Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley and Premier Jason Kenney in a rare Friday question period at the Alberta legislature.\nNotley called on Kenney to extend provincial measures like eviction protections and utility bill deferrals beyond the end of June.\nKenney said his government has already provided $15 billion in relief for Alberta workers and businesses, including emergency isolation payments and a break on WCB premiums.

What could emerge from that process is what the senior\u00a0official described as a \"glide-and-launch phase,\" where some direct aid programs slowly wind down while economic stimulus programs are launched.\nTrudeau revealed\u00a0one of the first steps of that review on Friday when he announced that the wage subsidy program would continue beyond June to help kick-start the reopening of provincial\u00a0economies\u00a0and allow people to move from the CERB to paid work.\n\"We need an economy to come back to and direct support is a key part of that,\" said a finance official speaking on background.\u00a0\"Everything is going to be largely dependent on where we are and what the needs are.\"\nBut even as the federal government prepares for the next phase of its pandemic response, it's\u00a0still busy trying to deal with the first wave of challenges. The already-extended wage subsidy is still in the getting-money-out-the-door phase. There's also the\u00a0unfulfilled promise of direct financial help for seniors to address. And hard-hit sectors such as airlines, energy and hospitality will need some kind of sector-specific bailouts.\n\"The big business bailout is the hardest one to do out of all of them,\" said the senior federal official. \"How do you bridge people to a better time and what do you get in return for that?\"\nPart of the government's\u00a0concern here is the risk of being seen bailing out companies that use tax havens or engage in tax avoidance. There's a desire at the federal level\u00a0to make sure that any bailout includes a degree of public oversight and can support\u00a0the argument that it was done in the public's interest.\n\"We will, over the coming days, start looking at specific sectoral supports,\" Trudeau said Friday. \"But even then, our focus will be on the workers \u2026 and not on the corporate well-being of an industry or sector.\"\nAnd while airlines have been promised some sort of help, public transit companies are also knocking on Ottawa's door.\u00a0The Trudeau government is a big booster of mass public\u00a0transit and a big spender\u00a0when it comes to capital investment to boost transit capacity.\nBut transit operations are largely a municipal responsibility. Ottawa is trying to find a way to help that sector without becoming a long-term player in transit policy.\nAs this crisis continues, jurisdictional lines are blurring. Many municipal and provincial governments were in\u00a0precarious\u00a0financial situations going into the pandemic and will be even more\u00a0vulnerable as they emerge from it. The Bank of Canada already\u00a0has launched a multi-billion dollar program to buy provincial government bonds because provinces like Newfoundland and Labrador have had trouble borrowing on the open market.\nAll of this will require Ottawa's attention when the dust settles \u2014 and billions of dollars more in federal spending may be required. Senior Liberals are already conceding they may need to go slower and be less aggressive on their campaign commitments, because the virus\u00a0has presented them with an urgent new\u00a0set of priorities.\n\"We are not yet talking about stimulus,\" Trudeau said. \"We are still very much in the support and emergency phase right now.\"\nBut the costs will keep growing. We still have no clear idea of how much this will cost the country. And the government's view is that it's still too early to talk about paying the bill.\n"}, {"author": "David Cochrane, Vassy Kapelos", "title": "Tiff Macklem to lead the Bank of Canada", "description": "Stephen Poloz\u2019s term as governor ends in June", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bank-of-canada-tiff-macklem-1.5551828", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5552086.1588341998!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/boc-governor-20200501.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 01, 2020 12:09 AM ET", "2020-05-01T15:08:34.449Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Finance Minister Bill Morneau has appointed Tiff Macklem, the former senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, to take over the top job at the central bank\u00a0as it navigates the uncertainty of a pandemic-driven recession.\nMacklem is currently the dean of the Rotman School of Management in Toronto, but had spent decades with the Bank of Canada before starting that appointment.\u00a0\nMacklem began his career at the bank in 1984. He was widely expected to win the contest for bank governor in 2013, but was beaten out by Stephen Poloz, who was then CEO of Export Development Canada.\nPoloz's term ends June 2.\u00a0\nThe transition to new leadership comes as millions of Canadians have signed up for government aid and companies big and small are relying on federally backed wage subsidies to weather the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring Friday's announcement,\u00a0Morneau\u00a0said he's confident Macklem's expertise in financial markets will help the central bank\u00a0navigate\u00a0an economic crisis never before seen in Canada.\nBank of Canada holds rate steady at 0.25% and hints it has no plans to go any lower\nStephen Poloz to step down as Bank of Canada governor at end of term\n\"The bank has to be humble about what it doesn't know.

There's a lot that medical experts don't know about this disease,\" Macklem said during his unveiling in Ottawa.\n\"But the Bank of Canada has tremendous analytic economic financial capacity to analyze what's going on in the economy, and the important role for the Bank of Canada is to provide Canadians with as much information as it can honestly provide as to what is happening and what the recovery could look like, recognizing that we're probably going to have to look at more than one scenario.\"\nIn the past months, Poloz and Morneau have appeared at several joint news conferences to show a co-ordinated approach on monetary and fiscal policy to deal with the economic fallout of the pandemic and global oil shocks.\nMorneau has announced more than $250 billion in direct financial aid, credit support and tax deferrals to help offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPoloz has cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25 per cent, committed the central bank to buying billions in government bonds each week until the economy is in recovery and taken steps to strengthen liquidity in the banking sector.\nThe person who replaces Poloz will be facing an economy that, according to the bank's own projections, could shrink by 30 per cent or more in the second quarter.\nThe next government will have practically no room to use interest rate cuts to help the economy. Poloz has already taken the unprecedented step \u2014 in Canada at least \u2014 of directly buying government bonds.\nThat limited flexibility is compounded by the rapid use of the federal government's fiscal firepower to put a financial floor under Canadian households and businesses.\nThe parliamentary budget officer said it's likely the federal deficit for the year will hit $252 billion as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and could go even higher if emergency measures remain in place longer than planned.\nIn selecting Macklem, the government passed over Poloz's top deputy, Carolyn Wilkins, the first woman to serve as the bank's senior deputy governor. She\u00a0would have been the first woman to serve as governor.\nWilkins was viewed by many as the front-runner for the position and would have provided some continuity at the country's central bank as it navigates the uncertainty of a pandemic-driven recession.\nWATCH |\u00a0Morneau announces Tiff Macklem as governor of the Bank of Canada:\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada's big banks cut credit card interest rates to ease coronavirus impact", "description": "Big Six will temporarily reduce credit card interest rates amid COVID-19 pandemic", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/big-six-banks-credit-card-interest-rates-relief-covid-19-1.5522343", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5253932.1570659856!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/transunion-debt-report-20190820.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 04, 2020 6:55 PM ET", "2020-04-04T22:55:15.561Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada's Big Six banks all said they will reduce interest rates on credit cards to provide relief to customers affected by COVID-19 pandemic.\nBank of Montreal said on Saturday it will temporarily reduce credit card interest rates to 10.99 per cent\u00a0for personal and small business customers receiving payment deferrals due to the outbreak.

null, "content": "Imagine a mortgage that pays you the interest, not the other way around. Or a savings account where it's the bank, not the saver, who collects interest.\nWelcome to the upside-down world of ultra-low and negative interest rates that is taking hold in many parts of the world where economic growth has been sluggish. Now more than a decade old, economists think it could be a feature of the global economy for years to come and change the way people save and invest.\n\"This will mean that we must save more, work longer, and expect less,\" said Olivia Mitchell, an economics professor at the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania.\nThe latest chapter is the drop in interest rates on some bank deposits below zero as central banks, particularly in Europe and Japan, try to support the economy amid uncertainty about trade by making borrowing cheaper to spur spending and investment. Official data released Friday showed that Germany's growth ground to a halt at the end of last year.\nEconomists think there are also longer-term factors causing low rates, such as aging populations in rich countries and high rates of savings in China and other emerging economies.\nLow rates first hit in the wake of the global financial crisis. The U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank slashed rates close to zero. In 2014, the ECB went negative.\nUltra-low rates have helped push up stock markets to record highs, as vanishing returns on safe assets lead to a search for returns elsewhere. Pushing people to invest in riskier assets is part of the stimulus effect central banks are trying to impart. But there are also fears that very low rates can cause markets to bubble up, and crash back down with painful consequences. So far, the dire predictions haven't come true. The current bull market in U.S. stocks turns 11 years old on March 9.\nIn Germany, some banks are now telling companies and others with large amounts of cash that they must pay a rate on large deposits instead of accruing interest. The penalty typically applies to big accounts, such as more than 500,000 euros (about $727,000 Cdn), according to financial website Biallo.de. Banks are doing this because they themselves have to pay a 0.5 per cent\u00a0penalty on deposits they hold at the European Central Bank. If banks can't find a home for depositor money, it winds up in their ECB holdings and results in their being charged.\nSmall depositors like individual consumers are so far not being charged on savings. The idea is politically toxic, especially in Germany.\nBut the low rate environment raises questions about preserving wealth, especially for those trying to save for retirement. German newsmedia are full of stories about \"penalty rates\"and criticism of the European Central Bank for, as they put it, expropriating savers.\nGerhard Michel, a financial coach in Duesseldorf, says people need to be aware that inflation eats away at savings even in more normal times, though people may be less aware of it when rates are above zero.\n\"If you look at it historically, people with savings accounts never had any kind of interesting performance,\" he said. \"The inflation rate ruins any returns on the government bond market or the savings market - and it has always been that way historically. What shocks people now is that people must say the word zero, or even negative, interest.\"\nMichel, who is 53, teaches his coachees about value investing, a more time-consuming approach that analyzes financial statements to look for companies the market may be underestimating.\nHis approach with his own money: \"I will buy stocks until the end of my days.\"\nFour trillion euros worth of government bonds of the 19 countries that use the euro now yield less than zero. Trillions more in Japanese and other government bonds trade below zero around the world. Even Greece, which defaulted on government bonds in 2012 and carries the highest debt load in Europe, was able to sell three-month notes at a negative rate.\nWhy, in fact, would anyone pay for the privilege of buying a bond?\nOne way of viewing the phenomenon is that the investor is paying for the safety of the investment. Or buyers may hope to sell the bond at a profit. That is possible if rates go even lower - as some analysts think they will.\nOn the positive side of the ledger, low or negative interest rates can make it easier for companies and consumers to borrow, stimulating economic activity. The European Central Bank says its policies created 11 million new jobs since 2013. In the U.S., home sales have picked up as mortgage rates have fallen to 3.7 per cent.\nNow, even some home buyers can get into the negative rates game.\nThe Danish bank is unusual in offering the negative rate, but mortgage rates for credit-worthy borrowers are also not far above zero in Germany. For instance, a 10-year mortgage with a large down payment can carry interest of only 0.7 per cent.\nIt's worth noting that real interest rates \u2014\u00a0in other words, when official and market rates are below the rate of inflation \u2014\u00a0have been negative at several points in history, such as in the 1970s, when inflation in the developed world ran into double digits.\nWhat's unusual today is that the actual quoted rates are below zero and that rates have been low for so long.\nInterest rates are always a tradeoff, says economist Adalbert Winkler, professor of international and development finance at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. \"Low real rates favour borrowers like mortgage holders at the expense of savers, and when rates rise it's the other way around.\"\n\"This is always the case when you have expansionary monetary policy and it doesn't make sense to deny that,\" he said.\nLow rates make it easier for governments to borrow and build infrastructure that can spur economic growth, although political pressures have meant that Europe's biggest economy, Germany, prefers to balance its budget than borrow. Other governments, such as Italy, are constrained by high debt.\nNegative rates have not yet appeared in the United States, but they could if the economy stumbles into recession, some economists say. The Federal Reserve would almost certainly cut the short-term rate to nearly zero, as it did for seven years beginning in the Great Recession.\nSince the U.S. 10-year yield is already very low by historical standards, at 1.6 per cent, it wouldn't take much to push it below zero, said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics. The Fed may try to prevent it from happening, possibly by selling Treasuries, but it's not clear they would succeed.\n\"We're not immune to it,\" he said. \"That's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-type world that we don't want to go into.\"\nSo far, Federal Reserve officials have downplayed the potential for negative rates in the U.S.\n\"That's not a tool we're looking at,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday during a congressional hearing. He cited research that negative rates can hurt banks' profits and restrain their willingness to lend.\nThe German Economic Institute in Cologne studied multiple factors believed to cause low rates and concluded it's not just due to central banks but represents a longer-term trend. So low or negative rates could be around for years.\nWith that in mind, Mitchell, the professor, persuaded her two daughters to save 18 per cent of their salaries when they found their first jobs.\n\"We're in a very different capital market regime now than in the last 30 years,\" she said.\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Ottawa unveils new mortgage stress test rules that will make it easier to pass", "description": "New rules will be in force as of April", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mortgage-stress-test-1.5467330", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5467396.1582053724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mortgage-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 18, 2020 3:04 PM ET", "2020-02-20T19:59:49.770Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Starting in April, the government will change the rules that cover mortgage lending in a way that should, in the short term at least, make it easier to qualify for a loan to buy a home.\nThe Department of Finance says that as of April 6, the so-called \"stress test\" for mortgages will be calculated in a new way.\nThe stress test was implemented in January 2018 as a way to let some of the speculation out of the housing market at the time. It does\u00a0so by making sure borrowers will\u00a0be able to pay down their debts even if rates move\u00a0higher. A would-be borrower is tested against his or her\u00a0ability to pay down the loan at a higher interest rate,\u00a0and if the borrower fails\u00a0the test, a lender isn't allowed to loan them money.\nThe rules had the effect of cooling the market, especially for first time buyers, which brought down prices in many markets because it shrank the pool of buyers.\nAt the time it was brought in, the benchmark was set at whatever the five-year posted rate at Canada's big banks is, which is currently at 5.19 per cent. But under new rules announced on Tuesday and set to be implemented in April, the new bar will be \"the weekly median five-year fixed insured mortgage rate from mortgage insurance applications, plus two\u00a0per cent.\"\n\"This will ensure that people only take on mortgages that are appropriate for the situation, but it does mean the changes in the stress test will be there if the average\u00a0\u2026\u00a0rates provided by the banks actually goes down or up,\" Finance Minister Bill Morneau said of the changes. \"It will actually adjust appropriately to dynamic market conditions.\"\nThe change tinkers with one of the major criticisms of the stress test in the first place, which was that the bar was set arbitrarily high. And non-bank lenders don't like that the\u00a0stress test rules give the big banks even more control over the market than they already had. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, says the banks would always drag their feet in changing their posted rates, no matter what was happening in the market, \"because it's the rate they use in calculating the penalty for breaking a mortgage,\" she said in an interview Tuesday. \"This takes the big banks out of it.\"\nJames Laird, co-founder of rate comparison website Ratehub.ca, says the industry will welcome anything that gives the big banks less power. \"The industry also did not like how the stress test rate didn't ebb and flow with real rates\u00a0lowering or increasing,\" he said in an interview.\nPosted rates at Canada's big banks are often much higher than rates being offered in the real world\u00a0and that gap has widened recently. It's not hard right now to find a fixed-rate mortgage for far less than three per cent, for example, despite the fact that four of Canada's five biggest banks have a posted rate of 5.19 per cent. (The fifth, TD, lowered its rate to 4.99 two weeks ago. Prior to that it was 5.34 per cent.)\nBen Gully, the assistant superintendent at banking regulator the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, said\u00a0in a\u00a0speech at the end of January\u00a0that the watchdog\u00a0was aware that the gap was\u00a0a problem. \"The difference between the average contract rate and the benchmark has been widening more recently, suggesting that the benchmark is less responsive to market changes than when it was first proposed,\" Gully said.\u00a0\n\"We are reviewing this aspect of our qualifying rate, as the posted rate is not playing the role that we intended.\"\nTuesday's rule changes are seemingly a result of that review and will have the effect of thinning out that gap \u2014 at least for now.\u00a0That should make it easier to pass the stress test, and therefore easier to buy a home. Theoretically, that should help bump up prices because\u00a0more people will be qualified to buy.\u00a0\nA quick look at the numbers shows how.\nAccording to Ratehub.ca, the average rate for a five-year fixed term mortgage is currently\u00a02.89\u00a0per cent. Under current rules, a borrower approved for that loan would nonetheless have their finances tested at the five-year posted rate of 5.19 per cent. If they don't pass the test, they can't get the loan.\nBut under the new rules, that same borrower would be tested at 4.89\u00a0per cent \u2014 a combination of their actual mortgage rate, plus two per cent.\u00a0That's a difference of 30\u00a0basis points and though small it can add up to thousands more in purchasing power.\nLaird calculates that under the old rules, a buyer with an annual income of $100,000 with a 10 per cent\u00a0down payment would have qualified for a mortgage at 2.89 per cent and could buy a home valued at $511,424 under today's stress test.\u00a0Under the new rules, that same buyer can now afford $526,632 \u2014 that's more than $15,000 more purchasing power.\n\"It's going to be a welcome change for the mortgage industry and consumers,\" Laird\u00a0said.\nCooper agrees with that assessment. \"All other things equal, it certainly boosts buying power,\" she said. \"And it's psychologically very positive.\"\n"}, {"author": "Truc Nguyen", "title": "Financially impacted by COVID-19?

Over a million individuals have already filed for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits, and the government is expecting up to four million applicants for its new Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).\u00a0\nFor answers to some of your most pressing personal finance questions related to COVID-19, we talked to Shannon Lee Simmons, a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), Chartered Investment Manager (CIM) and founder of the advice-only financial planning firm The New School of Finance. Here are her tips on how to deal with a financial emergency, and suggestions on how to approach issues such as cash flow, mortgage deferral and retirement investments right now.\nNote: This is a rapidly evolving situation. Government programs and specific benefits related to COVID-19 may change in the coming weeks; refer to official websites for the most up-to-date program details and guidelines around eligibility.\u00a0 \u00a0\nWhat is a financial emergency?\nAccording to Simmons, there are two types of emergencies that can negatively affect your finances: when you have a large unexpected, expense that comes up (such as a leaky roof that requires repair), or when income is unexpectedly cut off. With the COVID-19 crisis, a lot of people are experiencing or are worrying about the latter scenario. \"An unexpected layoff, or a massive slump in sales if you're self-employed, would be an emergency [because] the income tap has been turned off,\" says Simmons.\u00a0\nWhat are some steps I can take if I'm experiencing a financial emergency related to COVID-19?\u00a0\nFirst, address the gap between your income and your expenses. \"You want to fix that gap as soon as possible,\" says Simmons.\u00a0\nIf your income has been disrupted or if you've been laid off, start with finding out if you qualify for regular EI benefits or other government programs like the CERB. \"Your future cash flow is your biggest asset and your best friend right now,\" advises Simmons. She notes that many of the government's initiatives related to COVID-19, including the CERB and the wage-subsidy program, are still being rolled out and it might take time for you to access support and receive funds.\u00a0\nOnce you know what if any money you can expect through those programs and/or any regular income sources, look to where you can lower expenses. \"In an emergency, you can slash expenses in ways that may not be sustainable over the long run,\" says Simmons. \"I'm usually really against slashing expenses because, much like a crash diet, it's not sustainable; I think it sets a lot of people up for failure... and it adds to this cycle of guilt.\" But in a financial crisis, Simmons suggests pausing things like subscriptions to lower your monthly expenses, and diverting money budgeted for things that are on hold, like daycare fees and extracurricular activities for kids. \"All that money that used to go out the door every month is now not \u2026 that should provide a little bit of breathing room, so that the money that is coming in can go toward paying bills, keeping a roof over your head, and buying groceries,\" says Simmons.\nIf I'm still working but am concerned about my future income stream, what are some preemptive actions I can take?\u00a0\nUse any money that has been freed up to pay down debt, suggests Simmons. \"If you have a little bit of debt, whether it's on credit cards or on a line of credit, funnel money now toward [it] so that if you have an income disruption down the road, you wouldn't have to make those minimum payments every month,\" says Simmons. \"Plus, you're saving the interest on [the debt].\"\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you don't have debt, Simmons suggests starting to build an emergency fund that covers your spending and bills for at least a month. \"Ideally, we want to have three to six months' worth of emergency money saved up, but that's not practical for a lot of people,\" says Simmons. \"In an emergency, the goal is at least one month [of expenses].\"\u00a0\nInterest rates are ultra low right now. Should I try to renegotiate debt?\u00a0\nThis is absolutely a good time to talk to your mortgage broker, says Simmons. If you have a mortgage with a higher interest rate, for example, they can help you calculate what the potential savings (and penalties) might be if you were to renew your mortgage early. Simmons adds that depending on your specific situation, you might want to discuss with your broker whether you should break your mortgage to roll in credit card or other more expensive debt into a new loan at a lower interest rate; the broker can tell you all of the costs involved, and what your monthly payment would be. \"They can crunch the numbers and let you know if it's worth it or not,\" says Simmons. \"If you have an opportunity to roll in debt at lower interest rate, that's always a good financial planning practice to take.\"\nWho should be taking advantage of the mortgage deferral program?\nSimmons recommends mortgage deferral only under the most serious circumstances: \"If you've lost your income source and the EI programs that are coming in, whether it's regular EI or the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, is not sufficient to pay your mortgage, bills and grocery and living expenses.\" If a deferral allows you to avoid taking on expensive credit card or line of credit debt, then it could be a good option that can help you \"breathe a little bit easier,\" says Simmons.\u00a0\nBut if your current income (even if reduced) is sufficient to cover your very basic expenses, Simmons recommends that you don't defer mortgage payments because, as she puts it, you would simply be \"funding debt with debt.\" You're not getting out of making payments for that period of time; those skipped payments and the interest that you owe the bank will be added to your mortgage. \"As the mortgage deferral programs have been outlined, the banks [would be] essentially lending you that money,\" says Simmons. \"It's basically compound interest, you're paying interest on the interest that you already owed,\" she explains.\nShould I be worried about my investment and retirement accounts?\u00a0\nIf you're in a situation right now where the market value of your investments have dropped significantly but you need to take a significant portion of money out, Simmons says one strategy for retirees is to take Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) payments for the year monthly, instead of in one annual payment. \"Hopefully [then] you're minimizing damage, or at least diversifying what the potential market is doing over the course of a year,\" says Simmons. \"By taking whatever that targeted annual payment is, and spreading it out over smaller, more incremental monthly withdrawals, we can use that dollar cost averaging strategy \u2026 and try to smooth out the losses.\" (She also notes that for 2020, the government is reducing minimum RRIF withdrawals by 25 per cent.)\nIdeally, anyone who is retired or looking to retire soon would have at least one year to 18 months' worth of living expenses sitting in a cash-like product such as a GIC, suggests Simmons. \"Then, if there's a market crash .. you don't have to pull out money while your investments are low, and you can relax and wait for things to correct,\" Simmons says. \"In the future, that's a good practice for everyone to get into.\"\nSimmons advises against taking any extreme measures right now when it comes to your investments. \"The goal for everybody should be not to panic, as hard as that is to do,\" says Simmons. \"I think staying the course of whatever plan you've got going on is the smartest and calmest thing to do right now.\" And, if you can, avoid looking at your statements or investment apps for now; it's unproductive and can create anxiety. \"Unless you intend to do something about it, it is useless information,\" says Simmons. \"It doesn't even mean anything; [the numbers] could change tomorrow.\"\u00a0\nTruc Nguyen is a Toronto-based writer, editor and stylist.

In the current fiscal year, there were\u00a0219 claims to the end of November.\nA drop in property prices and increase in insurance costs since the 2016 fire have put pressure on homeowners in the town. Many homeowners bought when prices were much higher and there were abundant jobs\u00a0in the oil and gas industry.\nBut the work has disappeared, household incomes have dropped and many are walking away from their homes to seek opportunities elsewhere.\u00a0\nForeclosure statements of claim are court documents, usually filed by a bank to begin repossessing a property from a borrower who has fallen behind on mortgage payments.\nThe process isn't complete until a judge rules and issues a foreclosure order.\nRyan Chernesky, founder of Calgary-based Alberta Foreclosure Stoppers, which helps people stave off foreclosure and get their finances back on track, says about 15 per cent of his business is coming from Fort McMurray, a\u00a0community which\u00a0accounts for\u00a01.6 per cent of Alberta's population.\n\"I think the hard times are already here,\" Chernesky\u00a0said. \"There's a lot of homeowners that are very much underwater and they're simply biding time, hoping the property market will increase.\"\nHe said some of his clients from Fort McMurray have seen their property value drop by 50 per cent.

That number grew to\u00a0178 by\u00a02018. As of Dec. 11, 2019,\u00a0177 foreclosed homes were sold.\nAndrew Weir, realtor and director with the Fort McMurray Real Estate Board, said the number of foreclosures on the market at any one time over the last few years has been stable at\u00a0around 100 units.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The market is a lot more balanced now than it was, and there's a lot less inventory out there,\" Weir said.\u00a0\n\"Prices have fallen a lot, to the point where we are more in line with communities outside, throughout the rest of Alberta,\" he said.\nThose\u00a0prices are now more affordable for potential homeowners, he added.

Another 23 per cent of the 9,000 members who responded to the CFIB survey indicated they would not make their April rent payments.\nIt's led many to question why Canadian banks aren't doing more to help.\nFormer Conservative leadership candidate Rick Peterson wrote an op-ed piece this week criticizing the banks for failing to be proactive and for continuing to charge high fees and credit card interest rates.\n\"It's basically business as usual,\" he wrote in The Edmonton Journal. \"Sure, the banks have deferred payments for up to six months on mortgages and some loans \u2014 but the interest charges continue to accrue. Credit card payments have been deferred as well, but interest charges and transaction fees stay the same.\"\nNew Democrat MP Peter Julian issued his own public appeal to the banks earlier this week.\n\"All Canadians are making sacrifices to get our country through this crisis,\" he wrote in an open letter. \"Financial institutions, particularly Canada's six big banks, can play their part by waiving interest fees and charges on bank loans, line of credits and mortgages for the next two payment cycles.\"\nNew Democrats urged the Trudeau government to use its authority under the Bank Act to reduce interest rates, and to work with the provinces to freeze any rent increases and utility payments.\nGovernment officials, who spoke on background, said banks are cooperating and using the hammer of the Bank Act would be counterproductive.\n\"We get that people want relief,\" said one official. \"To be fair here, the banks are very aware that they are a critical piece of keeping the economy healthy.\"\nThe Canadian\u00a0Bankers Association says it is working with both governments and customers to help them weather the pandemic.\nSpokesman Mathieu Labr\u00e8che replied to written questions from CBC News on Friday to say nearly a half a million requests for mortgage deferrals were either completed or were in the process of being completed over the past two weeks \u2014 about 10 per cent off the mortgages held by the country's six largest banks.\nWatch:\u00a0Trudeau asked about Canada's talks with OPEC on reducing oil production:\nOver that same period, the banks have dealt with about 100,000 credit card deferral requests.\n\"Canada's banks assembled quickly and made a commitment to work with their customers to provide flexible solutions to help them manage through financial hardship,\" Labr\u00e8che wrote. \"Many banks have programs in place to help ... make debt more manageable and structure the right solution, for example rolling in credit card debt into term products with lower interest rates.\"\nBut that relief is temporary. And for many people, the cost\u00a0of servicing those debts\u00a0will actually increase in the long run.\nCIBC announced Friday that any clients with personal credit cards who want to skip a payment will receive a temporary lower rate of 10.99 per cent\u00a0retroactive to March 15.

As we re-examine our lives in the light of the COVID-19 outbreak, there are signs that risk may be losing some of its appeal.\nWhen things are going right and we feel safe, it is reasonable that many of us throw caution to the wind and live a little closer to the edge.\nBut from Canadian investors redeeming $14B in mutual funds in March to our sudden urge to fill our homes with supplies of food and toilet paper, the risk-taking mood seems to have changed. As worries appear in the property sector and markets repeatedly soar and crash, the effect could be lasting.\n\"Consumer stockpiling in the face of the coronavirus outbreak can be viewed as unconventional inventory accumulation activity, mainly meant to minimize a perceived threat of loss,\" Xiaodan Pan, an expert in supply chains at the Molson School of Business at Montreal's Concordia University, told me in an email conversation.\nEffectively, says Pan, behavioural economics tells us that squirreling away supplies is a natural human response to risk and uncertainty, where we are more afraid of losing what we have and less willing to strive for future gains.\nSuddenly, as the Alberta government investment fund loses billions of dollars on what was supposed to be a foolproof derivatives play, and people approaching retirement watch their nest eggs shrink, the world just doesn't seem so safe anymore.\nAnd it is by no means just a Canadian phenomenon. On Friday, there were reports that U.S. banks were becoming more cautious about lending to European businesses. Some governments are finding sources of lending tapped out.\nAccording to an editorial in an influential business publication, the pandemic has taught companies they must adopt a reduced risk strategy by switching from \"just in time\" to \"just in case.\" But avoiding risk can be costly.\nDavid Rosenberg, the market analyst who now runs his own research firm and has repeatedly warned that the boom would end one way or another, can now say \"I told you so,\" as boomers saving for retirement suffer a \"huge negative wealth shock\" which he says will encourage them to save more and spend less.\nAt the same time, the risk-reward nexus that has been a business justification for low taxes on investment gains is being turned on its head as taxpayer cash rushes to the aid of business and the economy.\nBut there are winners. The risk-averse who listened to Rosenberg's gloomy advice in recent years, those who kept reserves of cash savings, bought houses they could afford and paid them off and who shunned debt now look like the smart ones.\nBut if others follow their lead, a growing trend to save and reduce risk rather than borrow and spend does not bode well for near-term economic growth. And it is not just consumers and investors who are wary.\nOnly last year, it seemed as if every visit to the bank resulted in offers of a little more consumer credit.\nNow, despite the latest fall in interest rates, money isn't so easy to get, and there are reports from mortgage brokers that banks are making more careful choices about the security risk of those they lend to.\nThe new mood against risk may be the impetus that many have called for to make all Canadians, not just aging boomers, be more frugal.\nAs the CBC reported last week, for those who've kept their jobs, a decline in spending due to the lockdown is allowing some to save more, a trend that experts say may last after the economy begins to open up.\nBut Martin Boyer, professor of finance at University of Montreal's Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales, says even if Canadians are now learning the wisdom of saving for future catastrophes, for those without jobs, those who own struggling businesses, those carrying crushing mortgages or are burdened with credit card debt, playing it safe won't be so easy in a weak, post-COVID economy.\nMeanwhile, he said, the savings of the consumers and businesses who did keep a cushion to tide them over what they saw as an eventual if unpredictable downturn, form a crucial core of economic stability. Boyer said those savings are part of what allows the government to borrow and bail out the risk-takers who assumed nothing bad would happen.\nAs in the fable of the self-denying ant and the self-indulgent grasshopper, Boyer said, the ants end up paying for the grasshoppers.\nBoyer believes bailouts are reasonable for people who lost jobs through no fault of their own and those who had moderate levels of borrowing. But if the economic contraction continues, governments should not bail out those who took large risks in the expectation of large returns.\n\"The speculators should suffer,\" said Boyer. Otherwise, \"no one's going to save, and everyone is going to expect someone else to bail them out.\"\nWhile a trend toward higher levels of saving may be good for the country in the longer term, Jennifer Robson, a specialist in poverty and inequality at Ottawa's Carleton University, worries that a large number of people in the bottom half of the income spectrum simply don't have assets to fall back on.\n\"I think one of the lessons from the 08-09 financial crisis was that households ended up in the situation where they took on a lot of credit risk,\" said Robson.\nBut with borrowing now near record levels and roughly a third of households without enough savings to last a month, that may be hard to repeat this time around if lenders themselves become less risk-tolerant.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\nMore from Don Pittis\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "As COVID-19 bailouts pile up, Canadians ask for relief on credit card rates", "description": "Credit cards have much higher interest rates than other forms of debt and so far, are drawing less scrutiny", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/credit-card-rates-coronavirus-1.5517766", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5253932.1570659856!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/transunion-debt-report-20190820.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 03, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-04-03T17:38:25.032Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As governments rush to offer financial relief packages to homeowners, renters, small businesses and employees impacted by COVID-19, some Canadians are wondering why credit card bills aren't included in those measures.\nMost Canadians pay an interest rate that's far higher on their credit cards than they do for other forms of debt, which can make them an even more onerous burden that they have to carry in these unprecedented economic times.\nVicky Assad runs a small digital print shop in Ottawa.

The Canadian Bankers Association says there are 30 different credit cards available for Canadians right now that charge under 13 per cent per year.\nThat's still much higher than rates for other forms of debt, including mortgages and business loans, and there are, indeed, many valid reasons why that's the case. Credit cards are known as \"unsecured\" debt because the credit on them isn't secured to any specific asset \u2014\u00a0there's no collateral against the loan.\nThat differs from something like a mortgage, where the loan is secured against the house, which theoretically makes it easier for the lender to seize that asset should the borrower not pay their bills.\nCredit cards have higher rates in order to offset that higher risk, but the rates are still high considering how relatively low the default rate is. Credit monitoring firm TransUnion says that at the end of last year, less than three per cent of Canadians were more than 90 days behind on their credit card's minimum payment.\nThe average Canadian credit card had\u00a0about $4,326 on it as of the end of December.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government is working with credit card providers to offer some sort of relief to customers.\n\"We recognize that they are a significant challenge for many Canadians at this point,\"\u00a0Trudeau said at his daily press conference on March 26.\u00a0\"That is why we are encouraging them to take action to alleviate the burden for Canadians.\"\nLast month, Canada's five biggest banks\u00a0\u2014 the Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank and CIBC \u00a0\u2014\u00a0came out in unison with pledges to work with homeowners to offer interest-rate relief on their loans if necessary.\nThey all say they are also working closely with customers who have business loans to make sure they can stay afloat.\nThe joint statement said the banks would also offer\u00a0\"the opportunity for relief on other credit products\" but have had scant details to add to that since.\u00a0\nThe Canadian Bankers Association told CBC News in an email that its members have \"stepped up to help our country work through these challenging times.\"\nIts mortgage relief programs have been inundated with more than 213,000 requests for payments deferrals, the association said.\nThe\u00a0CBA says the big banks are willing to work with their customers who are having trouble with credit card debt to find solutions,\u00a0but\u00a0its statement did not give specifics of what that might look like.\n\"Banks will work with their customers to offer relief on other credit products, including credit cards and lines of credit,\" the CBA said.\n\"Many banks have programs to help their customers make their debt more manageable and structure the right solution, including rolling in credit card debt into term products with lower interest rates.

It was complicated to access and\u00a0has taken weeks to arrive.\nEven promised loans have provoked frustration among many Italians.\nUnlike Canada, where the government has issued interest-free loans to small businesses, it's Italy's banks that will decide which small businesses will get the loans\u00a0(with a ceiling of about $40,000 fully guaranteed by the government) and what the interest rate will be.\n\"It's a system that is not going to produce any good results for the Italian economy,\" says Rome tax consultant Giovanni Barlassina.\u00a0\"Apart from the fact that it won't be easy to get the money from the banks, small businesses don't want loans.\u00a0They need money\u00a0that they won't have to pay back. Gifts. And that's because many simply won't be in a position to repay loans.\"\nItaly itself, with a debt of over 130 per cent of GDP and rising fast, is pushing for gifts\u00a0from the European Union.\nThis month, European finance ministers will meet again to try to agree on a comprehensive rescue package that will benefit hard-hit countries like\u00a0Italy the most. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is pushing for much of the financial help to come in the form of pooled debt and grants, something most observers say is unlikely.\nIn the meantime, high-density cities are coming up with ways to fast-track the revitalization of urban life. Rome has promised 150 kilometres of new bike lanes, though the few it has now are poorly maintained.\nMilan has\u00a0in recent years been on the vanguard of urban planning and green architecture,\u00a0rolling\u00a0out a program to facilitate remote working;\u00a0transforming streets into bike lanes; widening sidewalks to encourage cycling and walking to work; and\u00a0setting up tables in public squares and parking spots\u00a0to help restaurants and caf\u00e9s stay in business.\nPlexiglas\u00a0separations between workers and the public\u00a0may be required for\u00a0food establishments, something renowned architect Stefano Boeri urges caution around.\n\"In some cases, Plexiglas barriers\u00a0will clearly be needed, above all to protect front-line workers dealing with the public,\" says Boeri, who notes that creative ways to extend retail space outdoors are the best solution. \"But an exaggeration of walls, barriers and obstructions would be a disaster. We need above all to focus on externalizing commerce.\"\nBut Pierfrancesco Maran, Milan's deputy mayor, says his biggest concern is increased car traffic. With physical distancing in place, the Milan subway, once the linchpin to its sustainability plan, can only accommodate a third of its capacity.\nHe worries people will opt for cars, and smog will once again descend on Milan.\n\"Some people will say the economy is so important that we should abandon\u00a0ideas of energy efficiency and sustainability. I disagree,\" says Maran. \"Now we have the two ways in front of us. We not only have to get over coronavirus, but we have to do it in the most sustainable way possible.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "When Halifax was running out of rental apartments in the mid-1980s", "description": "Low vacancy rate meant that in some areas, only 1 in 1,000 apartments was available", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/archives/when-halifax-was-running-out-of-rental-apartments-in-the-mid-1980s-1.5434472", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Jan 31, 2020 10:30 AM ET", "2020-01-31T15:30:00.730Z"], "source": "CBC Archives", "content": "Thirty-five years ago, it was getting hard to find a\u00a0place to rent\u00a0in Halifax.\nThe city had one of the lowest vacancy rates in the country, which meant hardly any apartments were up for grabs.\n\"In a healthy market, it's usually three or four per cent.

A result of this flight to safety is that fixed-term mortgage rates are dropping. Lower mortgage rates increase the amount a home buyer can borrow, which pushes up prices as borrowers are able to make higher offers.\u00a0\nWe also cannot forget about the mortgage stress test. On Feb.\u00a018, the federal government announced that the hurdle rate of the stress test would be lowered effective April 6.\u00a0 In anticipation of this change, many buyers re-entered the housing market, increasing demand on a real estate market with limited inventory.\u00a0 However, as of last Friday, the Department of Finance announced that changes to the stress test have been put on hold.\u00a0\nAll these factors are fuelling the housing market and not even COVID-19 appears to be able to slow it down\u00a0\u2014 yet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIt was just a month ago when stock markets were at an all-time high, largely due to the fear of missing out, whereas today it's\u00a0the opposite:\u00a0many people are panic selling.\nThe same could happen,\u00a0but to a lesser degree, with real estate, as buying psychology is fickle.\nIt's important to also keep in mind that, since all financial markets are interconnected, a stock market drop should affect the housing market. For example, many new buyers turn to the bank of mom and dad to help with their down payment. However, after experiencing a drop in their investment portfolio many parents will be less inclined, or no longer able, to help their children fund a down payment.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother important factor to consider is the potential loss of income that COVID-19 may cause. Some lenders might be hesitant to lend to applicants working in areas affected by the pandemic such as the travel or oil and gas industries.\u00a0\u00a0\nAll these variables can affect demand.\nIf I were a buyer, I would be cautious. Don't underestimate COVID-19's negative impacts on the economy, jobs and buyers' sentiment and avoid overstretching your budget \u2014 something that tends to happen when buying in a seller's market.\nMy advice to sellers who are looking to cash out or downsize\u00a0is to list their properties right away. Momentum is on your side and there is limited inventory, so sellers of quality homes are getting top dollar. The demand is currently high, but I wouldn't be complacent and assume that it will last. If offered a reasonable price, I would take it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you don't need to sell, I wouldn't and I'm not.

And that will be reflected in dire economic numbers in the coming months.\nCanadian economists are expecting that economic activity will shrink somewhere\u00a0between 25 and 35 per cent\u00a0over the course of the spring - a drop that is unprecedented in such a short period of time.\nOver the course of 2020, the International Monetary Fund expects Canada's GDP to shrink\u00a0by 6.2 per cent.\nIn fact, the only comparable detonation in the economy\u00a0happened during the Great Depression from 1929\u00a0through the 1930s, until the beginning of the Second World War.\nCanadian economic activity dropped by about a third over that period, which was much longer than the current situation.\nThis has raised the question of what to call this downturn.\u00a0\nIs it a depression, a recession, a great recession?\u00a0Or somewhere in between?\nRosenberg pointed out that the\u00a0Great Depression lasted for 12 years and was characterized by a real reluctance on the part of government to get involved.\n'We're going to use the United States as the microcosm,\" said Rosenberg. \"The Great Depression really began in late 1929, but it wasn't for another four years really until after F.D.R. [President Franklin D. Roosevelt]\u00a0got elected that there was really an aggressive policy response.\"\nDecades later in\u00a0Canada, the federal government and Bank of Canada moved quickly to respond to the impact of COVID-19,\u00a0pouring tens of billions into the economy, while slashing interest rates.\nWhile the stimulus will significantly add to Canada's debt load, the financial pain for Canadians could be much worse without it.\nIn terms of the longer term impact on the economy, the so-called \"Great Recession\" of 2008-2009 might be a better point of comparison, even though\u00a0on the surface, the numbers Canada faces\u00a0right now are much worse.\nCanada's economy went into recession in 2009, and contracted by 3.3 per cent over a nine month period.\nThat\u00a0number is a much smaller contraction than we are likely to\u00a0see this spring, but in 2009 it was stretched out over the course of nearly a year.\n\"A\u00a0lot of the reason these numbers look so bad on the surface is that we're compressing what would typically take eleven to twelve months to pull down on the economy into a much shorter period,\" said Frances Donald, chief economist at Manulife Investment Management.\n\"So the total extent of the damage on the economy might be similar to 2009 but we're going to go through it much more quickly and for that reason almost every economic figure that we've seen so far and we'll continue to see we'll be quite literally off the charts.\"\nWhatever phrase we use to describe our current downturn is far from the most important question. What does matter is how Canada's economy recovers.\nThe general expectation at the moment is for recovery in the summer, but how strong that recovery will be depends on health measures such as the level of physical distancing still required to fight the pandemic.\nThere is a lot of pent up demand in the economy already.\nFor example,\u00a0people will want to go for dinner or get a haircut after weeks of services being unavailable.\nBut\u00a0there are\u00a0also problems looming which are particular to Canada's economy.\n\"There's another important part of this story which is that Canada, unlike the United States in 2009, did not experience the same sort of pop in their housing bubble in 2009,\" said Manulife's Frances Donald.\nThat overhang of debt could make Canadians less likely to spend in the coming months.\nAs a result, people could\u00a0change their approach toward savings and spending after this crisis, according to researcher David Rosenberg.\n\"Because the one thing that we found out is that nobody had any cash on hand.\u00a0So the old saying about saving up for a rainy day. Well\u00a0all of a sudden, we had not just a rainy day.\u00a0We had a hurricane and there is no cash to draw from.\"\nWritten and produced by Tracy Johnson.

The halts mean both stock exchanges were\u00a0shut down for 15 minutes for a breather in the hopes that investors would calm down.\nThey did not. When trading reopened, the selling continued, with the TSX closing down by 1,355\u00a0points, or almost 10 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared even worse, losing 2,997 points or more than 12 per cent.\n\"When the circuit breakers kick in because of\u00a0declines, it really highlights the uncertainty in the markets,\" said David Madden, an analyst with CMC Markets.\nThe reason for the panic selling was the novel coronavirus, as investors wake up to the serious economic consequences that the virus will have.\nBusinesses have been closing their doors in an attempt to fight the spread of the virus.\u00a0\n\"Consumer spending will go down as people stay home because of the coronavirus,\" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, the CEO of financial literacy website WalletHub.\u00a0\"That will hit a number of industries particularly hard, such as the service industry, travel providers, live entertainment venues, movie theatres and more.\"\nInvestors are worried about the domino effect that all those related economic shutdowns will have on corporate profits, and by extension their stock prices.\n\"If a restaurant owner can no longer pay rent, the property owner might not be able to pay its loan, and the bank that made the loan might end up suffering as well,\" Papadimitriou said.\nThe U.S. central bank said its interest rate would stay low\u00a0until the economy shows it can survive a near-shutdown of activity in the United States. The Fed's decision was designed to calm markets, but one observer says it may have had the opposite effect.\u00a0\n\"It seems to have sparked more questions than answers for investors, particularly what has spooked the Fed so much that they couldn't wait until their regularly scheduled policy decision on Wednesday for this announcement?\" said\u00a0Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management in Toronto.\n\"In my opinion, the biggest problem for investor confidence is not knowing how bad things could get and how long disruptions could last.\"\nThe Bank of Canada on Friday also cut its key interest rate target by half a percentage point, to 0.75 per cent, as part of a co-ordinated plan by the federal government to help the economy. Canada's central bank is widely expected to cut again, especially after the Fed did so.\n\"After the Fed's action last night, the bank is almost certainly going to cut rates again this week,\" said CIBC's foreign exchange strategist Bipan Rai. \"There's no reason for the bank to have a benchmark rate that is higher than the Fed's ahead of an upcoming recession and with oil prices this low.\"\nEconomists have warned that Canada is headed for a recession this year due to the impact of COVID-19 and a crash in oil prices. Canada's main stock index posted its biggest one-day drop on record last week. It followed that up with a small rebound the next day.\u00a0\nLarge swings up and down have been the norm of late, as investors react to the uncertainty that this worldwide pandemic presents for the economy.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "P.E.I. vacancy rate improved, but still lowest in country", "description": "Charlottetown vacancy rate now at 1.2% ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-vacancy-rate-improves-january-2020-1.5427715", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4029461.1588246762!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/toronto-rental-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 15, 2020 1:20 PM AT", "2020-01-15T22:44:37.997Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "P.E.I. has the lowest vacancy rate of all Canadian provinces, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's 2019 rental market survey, released Wednesday.\nThe vacancy rate across the Island was 1.2 per cent in October 2019.

Not everyone believes it's a sure thing, but the probability goes up as the illness spreads.\nAt the start of the year, the odds of Canada cutting its rate\u00a0at the March meeting were barely one in 20. Even a\u00a0week ago, the odds of a cut were barely\u00a0one in six. But that was before the virus that causes COVID-19 started its spread around the world, infecting markets everywhere with something almost as dangerous as the pathogen itself: fear.\nBoth Canadian and U.S. stock markets are in correction territory, meaning declines of more than 10 per cent. Supply chains at technology companies like Apple\u00a0have been disrupted as Chinese factories shut down, making it impossible for manufacturers to get finished products to market.\u00a0\nAirlines have seen their ticket sales plunge\u00a0as consumers decide to stay home. Businesses around the world are cancelling conferences and other events that require people to meet face to face. And if coronavirus\u00a0becomes widespread here, many businesses will struggle with shortages of workers and supplies.\nAll things being equal, central banks raise interest rates when they want to cool down overheated economies. They cut when they want to stimulate an economy that needs a little warming up.\nFaced with the potential of a sickly economy because of coronavirus, central banks around the world are expected to try to flood the system with cheap\u00a0money in the hope that it's the shot in the arm the economy needs to get better.\u00a0\nChina, Brazil, Russia, the EU, Indonesia, India and Mexico have all cut in recent months.\nTypically in times of uncertainty, investors flock to the relative safety of the U.S. economy. But\u00a0the world's largest economy also is going to be dealing with the spread of coronavirus. And despite lowering rates three times in the past year, it's\u00a0not immune to the\u00a0trend toward lower rates.\u00a0\nTraders are pricing in effectively a 100\u00a0per cent chance of a U.S rate cut next month, and there's a 50/50 chance of up to two more cuts after that.\u00a0\nThose odds are three times\u00a0as high as they were as recently as Wednesday, before U.S. President Donald Trump appointed vice-president Mike Pence to head public health efforts to contain the virus' spread.\nThe U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve,\u00a0has been signalling for months that it thinks the\u00a0underlying numbers in the U.S. economy are strong, and telling investors not to expect any more rate cuts unless something drastic happens.\nReaction to the coronavirus suggests something certainly has. Even if the Fed is inclined to sit tight, it is under pressure to do something for the sake of looking like it is doing something.\n\"The Fed's desire to be data-dependent may capitulate to market sentiment,\" as Jon Hill, an interest rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets put it.\nThat goes for Canada, too. While most economists who study trends at the Bank of Canada expect the bank to stand pat next week, almost half of them think the bank should cut, according to a survey by rate comparison site Finder.com.\nBrett House at Scotiabank is among them. \"Our call\u00a0is for two cuts in 2020, which we've been saying since August of last year,\" he said in an interview. That call was based on underlying weaknesses in the economy, something that was borne out by Friday's GDP release that showed economic growth slowed to its slowest annual pace in almost four years at the end of 2019.\n\"And that was\u00a0all before the coronavirus,\" he said.\nSince that call, more than 40 major central banks around the world have moved to cut rates, he notes. \"If anything Canada has\u00a0been one of the tardiest to the [rate cut] party.\"\nOthers aren't sure the coronavirus will be enough to compel the bank to take action \u2014 yet. \"Although we think a certain degree of easing is warranted, two cuts priced by the end of 2020 seems somewhat unrealistic,\" CIBC's economics team said in a note this week.\u00a0\nThe bank thinks a cut is coming, but possibly not until the next meeting in\u00a0April.\n\"We are reluctant to pencil-in an additional cut as we don't know how long the associated uncertainty will last,\" CIBC said.\nSherry Cooper, chief economist with Dominion Lending Centres, says the panic in the stock market right now shows the central bank is under pressure to do something, even if it's just for the sake of doing something.\n\"None of this is good for psychology or the economy,\" she said.  \"The Bank of Canada meets next Wednesday, and clearly, their press release will address these issues. It's unlikely the bank will cut rates in response on March 4, but if the economic disruption continues, rate cuts could be coming by mid-year.\"\n"}, {"author": "Krystalle Ramlakhan", "title": "Rental vacancies up in Ottawa, but so's the rent", "description": "2-bedroom units in city's west end led surge in rental prices in 2019", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/rental-market-vacancy-canadian-mortgage-housing-corporation-1.5429258", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4536224.1579204472!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/apartment.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 16, 2020 2:59 PM ET", "2020-01-16T19:59:05.928Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Rental apartments in Ottawa became slightly easier to find\u00a0but significantly more expensive last year,\u00a0according to an annual update from the Canada\u00a0Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).\u00a0\nThe average monthly rent increased by 8.4 per cent in 2019, from $1,174 to $1,281, driven largely by the asking price for smaller units.

But once the effects of the\u00a0pandemic begin to wane, there are fears in some quarters that the massive government spending could lead to inflation. That would mean\u00a0a confusing and uncertain outcome.\nAfter more than a decade in which official measures of rising prices showed inflation close to zero, a return to rising prices, and the rising interest rates that central banks have traditionally used to contain them, could well upend the way we think about money and investment.\nNot only are\u00a0central banks lowering rates and buying up bonds in the hope\u00a0bond holders\u00a0do something else with the money,\u00a0governments around the world are spending trillions of dollars they don't have to keep households and businesses solvent.\n\"Let's just call this simply what's going on. We're printing a lot of money to provide liquidity in the system,\" former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge told David Parkinson at the Report on Business last week.\nWhile Dodge agreed that the Bank of Canada's plan to pour money into the economy with quantitative easing\u00a0(QE) was the right thing to do, he said there will be consequences.\nQE\u00a0may be hard for most people to grasp intuitively, although some of us will be familiar with the term from when the U.S. and Europe flooded markets with cash to prevent the 2008 credit crunch from spiralling into something worse.\nIn an era when almost all money consists of digits in computers, when the Bank of Canada's Stephen Poloz began QE last Wednesday, he wasn't actually \"printing\" $100 bills. What the bank did was conjure a billion dollars into existence and used it to buy bonds on the market.\n\"It is the last best trick our governments have to save the good ship economy,\" economist Armine Yalnizyan once told Michael Enright on CBC Radio's Sunday Edition in an explanation of QE that stands the test of time.\nBut, of course, the Bank of Canada is not the only source of cash flooding into the Canadian and world economy.\nGovernments around the world are\u00a0borrowing from the future and running up deficits at levels not seen since the Second World War as they hand\u00a0out emergency aid to businesses and ordinary people.\nIn the short term, with so many people out of work and whole industries in contraction, inflation is the least of our worries.\nOne of the reasons for all that government spending is to prevent the exact opposite of inflation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a spiral of deflation. Aggregate prices could fall because of the crash in demand as people stop buying, not just gas and plane rides and cars and houses, but the industrial inputs that go into their creation.\nMost economists worry that\u00a0deflation is much worse for an economy than inflation because, rather than spending their money, consumers can benefit by holding off until prices are lower, leading to even lower demand.\nBut like everything else about this unprecedented pandemic and the unprecedented government reaction, it is not entirely certain what the longer term effects will be.\n\"Though it seems like deflationary end times to some right now, the COVID-19 scare is going to pass, and we will be left with monetary and fiscal bazookas having been fired,\" worries market analyst Gary Tanashian on the site Seeking Alpha.\nOnce a government has started pouring stimulus money into an economy, it is notoriously hard to start pulling it back out again, especially, as in the U.S. case, during a presidential election year. Similar forces will be at work in Canada where, because of the Liberal minority government, an election could happen at any time.\nTanashian suggests the inflation is already happening now, but is disguised by the temporary COVID-caused crash in demand. And once the lockdown begins to lift and everyone roars back to working and shopping and eating out, there will be too many dollars chasing too few goods and services. And that's the classic definition of inflation, which he sees showing itself by the end of 2020, and surging over the next two years.\nIf we do see a return to inflation,\u00a0it's hard to predict how it will play out. But central banks likely will start raising rates to keep it in hand.\nExisting bonds,\u00a0a great investment over the past decade as interest rates fell lower and lower, will no longer be good to hold. The value of assets such as housing will fall as borrowing costs rise. Outstanding consumer loans will become a bigger burden.\nEmployment incomes that rise with inflation will be a better source of money for the working young than cash piles held by the rich and old. Spending money now will be better than waiting, because the price of things you want will go nowhere but up. And a generation who's never seen it will have to figure out inflation all over again.\nFollow Don @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Get informed on the top stories of the day in one quick scan", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/morning-brief-january-29-2020-1.5444097", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5443824.1580253767!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/humber-negative-pressure-room.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 29, 2020 7:07 AM ET", "2020-01-29T12:07:59.484Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Good morning!

A rate cut is an admission that an economy is struggling and many saw the size of this cut (half a per cent) as a \"desperate\" move by a panicked central bank. As a result, the markets sold off.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWill the half point cut in interest rates have the desired effect and help stabilize the economy and stock market?\nA drop in interest rates normally encourages people to borrow and spend, thus benefiting an economy and encouraging growth. However, with the coronavirus \u2014\u00a0unless it's toilet paper\u00a0\u2014 people don't seem to be in a buying mood and that likely won't change until the virus is contained,\u00a0regardless of how low rates go.\nI do believe the rate cut will help stabilize the economy, but not until the coronavirus peaks and begins declining. That's when we should see an uptick in economic activity as global economies recover, demand picks up and businesses increase production.\u00a0\nHow long will the coronavirus disrupt global economies?\nIt depends on the economy. In China, the virus appears to have peaked and is declining (see chart below), and their economy is normalizing.\u00a0For example, 85 per cent of Starbucks\u00a0stores\u00a0have re-opened and Foxcomm, the company that\u00a0manufactures the iPhone, expects to resume normal production by the end of March.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile the Chinese are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, North America is just entering the tunnel.\u00a0However, if we follow a trajectory similar to China's, the virus should run its course in a month or\u00a0two, but as I said at the outset \u2014 nobody knows with any certainty.\nDo you think the impact of the coronavirus will push our economy into a recession?\nWe will likely experience a technical recession in 2020. The definition of a recession is a decline in gross domestic product for two or more consecutive quarters.\u00a0That's just six months of declining growth \u2014 which seems plausible given all the slow downs we are experiencing.\u00a0\nIf I'm right, when the word \"recession\" starts trending \u2014 I will take that as a good sign as it often means we are on the road to recovery. In terms of timing, my estimate would be mid-summer when viruses are less prevalent.\u00a0\u00a0\nFollowing a shock-type disruption like a viral outbreak or natural disaster, there is often an uptick in economic activity that helps an economy recover and lifts it out of recession.\u00a0It is at this point where the stimulus created by the interest rate cuts would take effect.\nWhile I do expect a technical recession \u2014 I don't expect it to last long or be as severe as the one we experienced in 2008.\nWith stock markets down over 10 per cent for the year \u2014 is now a good time to invest?\nYou might be surprised to hear that the Shanghai Stock Exchange has fully recovered since experiencing their big drop on Feb 3.\u00a0The China Shenzhen Small/Medium index is faring even better, nearing all-time highs. It only took a month for the Chinese markets to recover.\nIt would be great if the North American markets followed a similar path, but I'm not sure they will.\u00a0I'm adjusting my portfolio and preparing for the recovery.

Despite my teams' innovative approach to an ever-changing landscape, we must immediately deal with the current market conditions and pessimistic outlook for the real estate office market,\" said CEO Riaz Mamdani in a statement posted to Strategic's website on Wednesday.\nMamdani told CBC News that the situation is the hardest he's faced in his career.\u00a0\n\"Our Alberta office portfolio is in year five of a pretty distressing situation,\" he said. \"It's an incredibly challenging environment.\"\nThe company said that between 2014 and 2019, Strategic had 78 tenants occupying more than 573,000 square feet that didn't survive or otherwise didn't remain in their leased spaces, despite being under lease agreements.\nCalgary's overall office market\u00a0stands at 32 per cent vacant or available for sublease, Strategic said in its court affidavit, a number that only stands to increase with the recent completion of Brookfield Place and the soon-to-be completed\u00a0Telus Sky.\nIn its third-quarter office market report, realtor Avison Young said the overall Calgary vacancy rate was 22.3 per cent, but the downtown rate was 24.6 per cent. Edmonton's office vacancy rate was 14 per cent, and the Greater Toronto Area's downtown office vacancy rate was 2.2 per cent.\u00a0\nCalgary's vacancy rate is \"the highest by a large margin\" among major Canadian cities,\u00a0Greg Kwong,\u00a0regional vice president for real estate brokerage company CBRE\u00a0Alberta, said.\u00a0\n\"Calgary, in the heyday of oil at over $100, we got to a low 0.2 per cent vacancy rate,\" Kwong said. \"What's happening with Strategic Group is not unique to them, there are many levels that are suffering \u2026 it's just finally taking a toll.\"\nThis year, 21 tenants in Strategic's Calgary portfolio\u00a0shut their doors.\n\"We've had midnight moves, tenants who just surrendered. We've had situations where brand name tenants you simply wouldn't expect to close their doors. We've had Starbucks, Five Guys, Boston Pizza \u2026 and the landlords have to take the brunt of it,\" Mamdani said.\nThe situation, the company said, was compounded by increased property taxes on businesses outside the downtown core.\u00a0\nSince the economic downturn, buildings in Calgary's core have lost a total value of $14 billion \u2014 leaving a $250-million hole in the city's finances, leaving thousands of businesses to pick up the financial slack.\n\"High vacancy and default rates have reduced revenues and left the rental portfolio entities with no means of recovering the increased property tax burden placed on affected properties. Second, reduced rental revenue has led to a material reduction in the market value of many buildings and properties in the rental portfolio,\" the company's affidavit reads.\u00a0\nKwong said likely not all of the buildings will be put up for sale \u2014 some might be refinanced.\n\"Keep in mind this is not a bankruptcy, it's creditor protection status \u2026 so I don't think you're\u00a0going to see you know, the whole portfolio on the market or sell all at once. It might be bits and pieces down the road.\"\nThe company said it's taking actions to stabilize the business, including:\nBut despite those actions, the company said, it currently has more than 586,000 square feet of vacant property, which could peak at more than 700,000 square feet.\u00a0\nThe company said the affected properties represent about five per cent of the city's Beltline and downtown Class B and C office space, and about seven per cent of Calgary's suburban Class A office space.\nCalgary Chamber of Commerce president Sandip Lalli said the situation is representative of the difficult\u00a0position\u00a0 Calgary and Alberta will likely be in for years.\n\"This is just another proof point of the fact that we are in a prolonged economic difficulty and uncertainty \u2026 and so it's not surprising that they're having to take this move,\" Lalli said.\nLalli said she hopes that by Strategic sharing its plight and taking steps to remain in business, it will highlight the need for policy-makers to take urgent action.\nThe initial filing, which was granted on Tuesday, gives\u00a0the company a stay until Dec. 20 but the company is seeking an extension until March 31, 2020. The company's next court date is scheduled for Dec. 19.\n\"I am an optimist and I believe tomorrow's a better day, but I'm also a realist,\" Mamdani said. \"You look at almost 25 per cent of our office space is vacant, that's one in four buildings. And you look at historical absorption rates in Calgary, this is a 12 to 15 year solution before we get to a normal market. And that's a long time to wait.\"\nThe Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act allows companies to restructure while continuing operations, similar to a Chapter 11 proceeding in the United States.\nThe stay means Strategic Group will continue to manage the properties, but gives it time to restructure and sell properties without creditors taking action. Projects under construction won't be affected.\nThe Alberta Court of Queen's Bench has appointed Hardie & Kelly Inc. as monitor of proceedings under the CCAA for the Calgary properties, as well as\u00a0six in Edmonton.\nStrategic Group owns a total of 171 properties, a total of about 7.5 million square feet.\nA full list of the affected properties is below:\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Taryn Grant", "title": "Tight rental market has Dartmouth renters worried over looming 'renoviction'", "description": "Tenants can reapply to the building after renovations, but rents will be hundreds of dollars higher", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dartmouth-renoviction-low-vacancy-rates-1.5493999", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 12, 2020 6:00 AM AT", "2020-03-12T09:00:00.807Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "By May 1, Cyril Hatfield has to be out of the apartment he's lived in for the past decade, and he sums up the way he's feeling about it with one word: scared.\n\"My hands are shaking just talking about it.\"\nHatfield lives in a bachelor apartment at 23 Crystal Dr., a 15-unit apartment building in the north end of Dartmouth, N.S.\nHis living space is tightly packed with some basic furniture and eclectic decorations:\u00a0bed, chair, small side tables, painted wooden masks and potted houseplants.\nHatfield has an affinity for plants. For 10 years in this apartment, he's tended to dozens of vines that have climbed up walls and now drape overhead. With his pending eviction, he said\u00a0he's been thinking about how to disentangle them for the move.\nBut first, Hatfield has to find a new place to live, and he, like many of his neighbours, is struggling to find something he can afford. He currently pays $550 per month, all-in. The average rent for a bachelor apartment in Halifax is $812.\nEvery tenant at 23 Crystal Dr. is being evicted this spring so the property owners can renovate the building and raise the rent. The owners have told tenants they want to keep the building \"affordable,\" and tenants can reapply after renovations.\nBut the proposed new rent, $875 per month, is too high for many people currently living there.\nIn a notice dated Jan. 30, 2020, the owners told tenants they would have to move out by the end of April for \"extensive demolition, repairs and renovations.\"\nIt's signed by Central East Developments,\u00a0a company co-owned by Spencer Meens and Adam Barrett, according to the Nova Scotia Registry of Joint Stocks. They did not respond to interview requests from CBC\u00a0News.\n\"It's what has been, I guess nicknamed, or phrased as 'renovictions,'\" said\u00a0Hatfield.\nIt's a scenario the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) described in its latest report on the Halifax rental market. It said\u00a0a record-low vacancy rate, coupled with record-high new development, is driving rents up and making housing less affordable.\nIn January, CMHC reported rental vacancy had dropped to one per cent,\u00a0which is\u00a0the fifth annual drop in as many years,\u00a0and the lowest number since it started reporting rental vacancy data in Halifax in 1990.\nMore than 4,000 new rental units have entered the rental market since 2017, but \"new apartment supply is not coming onto the rental market fast enough to offset increased demand,\" the report said. CMHC attributes growing demand to high rates of immigration and interprovincial migration.\nThe new construction has created what CMHC called a \"very high\" proportion of newer units on the Halifax market, compared to other Canadian cities.\n\"This has increased the quality of rental stock, incentivized older buildings to upgrade in order to compete and affected affordability, because rents have increased faster than disposable income,\" the report said.\nThe one per cent vacancy rate is top of mind for tenants in the building.\n\"That's really, really, really daunting when you're looking for a place,\" Hatfield said.\nProspective rentals have either been \"too gross\" or too expensive, so Hatfield is trying to find a roommate. But, he said\u00a0he worries about splitting living expenses.\n\"You're depending on other people to pay their bills, and you can't always do that,\" he said.\nIn the January eviction notice, Central East Developments listed five companies \"with apartments currently for rent.\"\nHatfield's downstairs neighbour, Daniel Kearley, said he's looked for apartments with each of the suggested companies. In some instances, he said he applied and was rejected.\u00a0In others, the prices were too high.\nKearley and Hatfield are both on fixed incomes, paid for by the province's disability support program.\n\"I'm having extreme difficulties finding anything,\" Kearley said.\nAfter 10 years working around housing and homelessness, Darcy Gillis has seen cases like the one at 23 Crystal Dr. before, but he said\u00a0they're becoming more common.\nGillis is a housing support worker at Dartmouth Housing Help, a non-profit that works with individuals who have challenges finding and keeping stable housing.\nGillis said\u00a0many apartment buildings in North Dartmouth are around the same age as 23 Crystal Dr.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which was built in 1976\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and renovations are to be expected.\nThere have been five recent complaints filed against 23 Crystal Drive's\u00a0owners under bylaw M-200, which sets minimum living standards for all residences, said a spokesperson for the Halifax Regional Municipality.\nThe spokesperson would not divulge the specifics of the complaints, but said HRM responded to each of them and closed the files.\nCentral East Developments bought the building in December, and Gillis said he respects the new owners for taking on deferred maintenance, but evicting tenants leaves them \"in a lurch.\"\n\"It's really unfortunate,\" Gillis said. \"There's no plan for individuals who are being mass evicted for building renovations.\"\nGillis is currently trying to help six tenants at 23 Crystal Dr. find new housing, but he said it's challenging.\n\"Really, there's just nothing available,\" he said.\n\"Low income is always going to be a barrier. And with the vacancy rates so low, the landlords aren't really considering people who don't have as much money.\"\nThe Nova Scotia government added more than 500 new rent supplements \u2014 which are meant to close the gap between what renters can afford and what the market is charging \u2014 to the 2020-21 budget.\nBut Gillis said additional rent supplements can become redundant in a tight rental market.\nSome tenants have already moved out of 23 Crystal Dr. The doors on six units hang open and renovations are well underway.\nIn empty units and common hallways, the floors have been stripped down to plywood\u00a0and construction crews are putting up walls to turn the bachelor apartments into one-bedrooms.\nIf any tenants remain come May 1, Gillis said\u00a0they have a few options.\nIf they're on income assistance, the province could move them into a hotel, temporarily. If not, Gillis said\u00a0he would usually refer them to a shelter. But lately, many Halifax shelters have been full.\n\"So... if the individual doesn't have family or friends, most of them would have to go out onto the streets, which is scary,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2428721495", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "John Paul Tasker", "title": "Ottawa announces $10 billion business credit line, plans to roll out stimulus package as COVID-19 spreads", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-19-fiscal-package-1.5496928", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5497191.1584125517!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/morneau-poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 13, 2020 1:31 PM ET", "2020-03-13T20:42:53.937Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced Friday that the government will establish a $10 billion credit facility to lend money to businesses under stress\u00a0as a result of the spreading COVID-19 pandemic.\nMorneau said the money will flow to the Business Development Bank of Canada\u00a0and Export Development Canada, both Crown-owned entities, to help companies access cash and keep exporting to markets abroad at a time when COVID-19 is dramatically affecting the functioning of the economy.\nMorneau said this sort of credit facility was an effective tool during the 2008 financial crisis and will be again now.

The eldest had entered the workforce and were laid off in the period after the 2008 market crash. Those who graduated in the late aughts recall the sparse job offerings and widespread financial anxiety. As a result, they're feeling more prepared for whatever's coming now.\nThe Canadian Press spoke to three Canadian millennials on what they learned during their first recession and how to get through the current one.\nDon't be too hard on yourself, says one Toronto financial counsellor.\nThirty-four-year-old Jessica Moorhouse spent the majority of her first year in the working world unemployed.\nShe graduated from Simon Fraser University with a degree in film in 2009. Though she'd heard whisperings from her parents and older friends about the toll the 2008 housing crisis had taken on the country, Moorhouse didn't expect to face a job market as stripped of job prospects as the one she saw.\n\"As I was approaching that graduation deadline, then I kind of realized, 'this seems a little bit harder,\"' Moorhouse says. She lived with her parents for a stint to save money while passing out resumes, all the while thinking, \"this is not the future I was promised after studying and working so hard and getting a degree.\"\nShe eventually found work at a Vancouver-based newspaper, where she stayed for three years, making just enough to move out of her parent's house and into a basement suite with two roommates. \"It was tough. I was broke,\" Moorhouse says.\nGrowing tired of living paycheque to paycheque, she began reading personal finance blogs and books on investing, and eventually completed a digital marketing certificate program and built a career as a financial counsellor and blogger.\nMoorhouse says researching past financial crises \u2014 including the forces behind market crashes and the course of their inevitable rebounds \u2014 brought her a sense of comfort through the darker hours of the 2008 recession.\n\"Give yourself that kind of background that this isn't the first time this has ever happened. It's the first time it's happened to you, but not the first time in history,\" she says. \"Hold tight for a few years and you're going to be just fine.\"\nMoorhouse also says it's important to be kind to yourself if you're experiencing financial strain, as finding ways to make spare cash under lockdown orders is virtually impossible.\n\"Cut yourself a bit of a break, realize this is special, and it's not your fault,\" she says.\nFor Calgary web designer Nick Heer, resourcefulness is key.\nAt just 30 years old, Heer says the current recession is the third he's experienced in his adult life.\nThe Calgary-based web designer turned 18 as the market was crashing in 2008. He graduated from university in 2014, just as his province's economy took a sharp downturn due to plunging oil prices. Understandably, applying for jobs was a challenge.\n\"I sent out resumes for, I don't know, probably like 50 jobs,\" Heer says. \"And I got one call back.\"\nFortunately, that interview turned into a job. \"I've been really lucky,\" he admits. But looking back, he says the amount of economic turmoil he's witnessed in little over a decade is troubling.\n\"Something is deeply wrong if I've gone through this three times in my adult life,\" he says.\nHeer says it's difficult to dole out financial advice in periods when the population is in survival mode. But if there's one thing he's found to be central to making it through a recession, it's resourcefulness.\n\"Every piece of financial advice that I have been given has had to be stretched out or maximized in some way,\" Heer says. \"It's no longer enough to save a little bit every paycheque for a short-ish period of uncertainty. It's now necessary to save more for more uncertainty.\"\nVancouver-based animator Amanda Wong's advice is to stay busy.\nWong graduated from design school in 2009, at a time when \"there were absolutely no entry points for new graduates\" in her industry.\nNow 36, Wong says she had to rely on her background in commerce (for which she earned a bachelor's degree prior to venturing into animation) to get through the recession. She got a job in marketing at the Vancouver Film School, where she spent a year. Eventually, she was able to pivot back into the work she wanted to be doing, but says many of her classmates weren't as lucky.\n\"There was at least a third that never made it into the industry,\" Wong says, noting that in recent years, prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus, she's seen graduating classes at major film schools achieve hiring rates closer to 90 or 100 per cent.\nWong says it's important not to blame yourself if you're struggling financially at the moment. With the job market tenuous and many working conditions unsafe, the most productive way to get through the coming recession will be to enhance your employability.\n\"Go to a resume workshop. Network. Try to keep yourself busy with an individual project to boost your portfolio,\" Wong suggests. \"It's important to keep your mental health up and not blame yourself too much for worldwide economic conditions that you cannot control.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada's unemployment rate climbs to 5.9%", "description": "Regionally, Quebec suffered the biggest decline in jobs from the previous month", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stats-can-jobs-report-nov-1.5386624", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5386644.1575640240!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/statcan-labour-force-20191011.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 06, 2019 8:57 AM ET", "2020-01-06T19:53:02.511Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Canadian economy posted its biggest monthly job loss since the financial crisis in November, pushing the unemployment rate higher and raising the possibility the Bank of Canada may cut interest rates next year.\nStatistics Canada said Friday the economy lost 71,200 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose four-tenths of a percentage point to 5.9 per cent, its highest point since August 2018, when it hit six per cent.\nEconomists on average had expected a gain of 10,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 5.5 per cent, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nBrett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank, said the drop in jobs puts pressure on the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates next year.\n\"It really undermines the notion from the Bank of Canada in the last few days that they've communicated that they chart their own course,\" House said.\nThe jobs report followed a decision by the Bank of Canada earlier this week to keep its key interest rate on hold at 1.75 per cent, where it has been set for more than a year.\nMany of the Bank of Canada's international peers have moved to cut rates and loosen monetary policy in response to weakness in the global economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut its rate three times this year.\nIn making its decision this week, the central bank said the Canadian economy has remained resilient despite the global uncertainty caused by the trade war between the United States and China.\nHouse, who noted that the jobs numbers are notoriously volatile, said he expects the Bank of Canada to cut its key rate as early as the first quarter of next year and certainly within the first half of 2020.\nThe loss in jobs came as both full-time and part-time employment moved lower. The number of full-time jobs fell by 38,400, while part-time employment fell 32,800.\nThe goods-producing sector lost 26,600 jobs in the month as the number of manufacturing jobs fell by 27,500 jobs and the natural resources sector shed 6,500.\nMeanwhile, the services sector lost 44,400 jobs as the number of public administration jobs fell by 24,900 jobs in November, due in part to the federal election in October.\nRoyce Mendes, senior economist for CIBC Capital Markets, said job growth had been running ahead of other indicators of economic grow, but the figures now look more in line with each other.\n\"However, the fact that a significant portion of that narrowing came from a drop in employment, isn't what policy-makers were hoping for,\" Mendes said.\n\"The Bank of Canada seemed very content with the current setting of rates earlier this week, but if this trend continues there may be a need for a rate-adjustment yet.\"\nRegionally, Quebec lost 45,100 jobs in November due to a decline in manufacturing as well as accommodation and food services. Alberta and B.C. both lost 18,200 jobs.\nThe bright spot in the jobs report was an increase in the year-over-year growth in average weekly wages to 4.5 per cent compared with 4.3 per cent in October.\nAs well, compared with November last year, the Canadian economy has added 293,000 jobs.\n"}, {"author": "Amy Tucker", "title": "Average rent in Calgary climbs by 1.7% as population, labour force grow", "description": "New rental units added to market also tend to demand higher rent, analyst says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-rental-market-labour-1.5428390", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3451244.1455691912!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/calgary-apartment-building.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 15, 2020 4:02 PM MT", "2020-01-15T23:02:29.944Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "There's good news for Calgary landlords but not so much for renters\u00a0\u2014 the average cost of rent is increasing in the city, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nThe Crown corporation does research relating to the housing market and offers advice.

Regardless of what deals they may have\u00a0been offered by a lender in the real world,\u00a0for regulators to sign off on the loan, the borrower's finances must be tested as though their mortgage rate is at a higher level. The idea is to save borrowers from biting off more debt than they can chew\u00a0and ensure they have some financial wiggle room if rates rise.\nThe stress-test level is set at either two percentage points above the actual mortgage rate\u00a0or whatever the average five-year posted rate is at Canada's big banks, as calculated by the Bank of Canada \u2014 whichever is higher.\nThat bank rate hasn't changed since May 2018, when it rose to 5.34 per cent. But this week, it inched down to 5.19 per cent,\u00a0the first time it has decreased in almost three years.\nThe impact\u00a0of the slight lowering of that bar is to let people qualify for a bigger mortgage than they could before, even if everything else in their finances has stayed the same. It has the effect of giving them slightly more purchasing power, allowing them to fish in a slightly more expensive pond full of homes.\nIt's not a huge move, by any stretch.\nRate comparison website Ratehub.ca calculates\u00a0the typical borrower can now afford about 1.4 per cent more home than they could previously. Assuming a borrower had a down payment of at least 20 per cent, no other debts to speak of, and\u00a0earned\u00a0$100,000 a year, under the previous test level, they would have qualified for a home valued at $589,000. Today that same family can buy a house worth $597,000.\nIt doesn't make their mortgage any easier to pay off. It just allows them to theoretically buy a slightly more expensive home than they would have previously been allowed to.\nSamantha Brookes, CEO of broker Mortgages of Canada, says overall, the stress test has put a chill on the market, but she doubts that this week's move will make a major dent in its impact.\n\"It allows someone purchasing to buy a little bit more but it's not that significant,\" she said. \"Consumers are in this wait-and-see pattern \u2014 it's still difficult to get into the market because that stress test is there.\"\nAnd the tiny amount of extra wiggle room that this week's move may make the dollars and cents add up a little better on paper, but the real impact may be all in our heads, says\u00a0Nick Kyprianou, president of RiverRock Mortgage Investment Corporation, a Toronto-based alternative mortgage lender.\nKyprianou\u00a0is somewhat of a\u00a0rarity in that he makes his money in real estate, but isn't among those who blame the implementation of the stress test in 2018 for taking away the punch bowl\u00a0and ending a real estate party in full swing.\u00a0\nHe may have a bias in that the stress test made his business busier, as people shut out of traditional lenders by the new rules flocked to alternative lenders. \"But it was a reasonable thing to do,\" he says. \"As a homeowner and a citizen it wasn't the wrong decision \u2014 things were irrational.\"\nKyprianou says the stress testing level moving almost imperceptibly lower is likely to help the market just by instilling confidence, because it's not just the theoretical testing level that's lower \u2014 actual mortgage rates are falling too.\nFixed mortgage rates are priced on what's happening in the bond market, which has been signalling for months that it expects cheaper lending rates to come.\nThe U.S. central bank could cut its benchmark interest rate as soon as the end of this month, and while Canada is expected to stand pat for a while, the Bank of Canada is not immune to the global forces that may push rates down even lower.\nAs long as house prices don't crater, rates in the real world moving lower will have a much bigger impact than this week's tiny wobble in the stress test, Kyprianou says.\n\"This is a psychological game. If people feel confident they'll get back in the market.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "What's happened in Canada since WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic", "description": "Canada had more than 100 confirmed cases on March 11 when pandemic declared", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/covid-19-timeline-canada-who-pandemic-1.5529920", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5529964.1586632836!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-test-kits.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 11, 2020 3:48 PM ET", "2020-04-11T20:17:48.312Z"], "source": null, "content": "Saturday marks one month since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.\nHere are some key developments for Canada since then:\nMarch 11: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promises $1 billion for COVID-19 to help the health-care system and workers force to self-isolate ...

It\u00a0was a long farewell. Now in her 70s, the performer still takes to the stage, and her shows are racier than ever.\nIt's not clear whether Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz\u00a0would have Cher's\u00a0stamina, but at least his long goodbye \u2014\u00a0which continued with a speech and news conference in Vancouver yesterday\u00a0\u2014\u00a0has a deadline.\nPerhaps a little like the singer of Gypsies Tramps and Thieves,\u00a0as he counts down the months toward his June departure, the country's top central banker is getting saucier.\nOf course everything is relative. The latest outing by Poloz, who has often been forthright, could only be considered racy by the standards of a staid central banker.\nBut with comments that warned of the impact of a new Donald Trump presidency in the U.S., heaped\u00a0opprobrium on\u00a0Canadian premiers\u00a0for absurd trade barriers and\u00a0noted\u00a0the dangers of an explosion of uncertainty and flawed statistics, perhaps\u00a0the governor senses a\u00a0lightening of the\u00a0yoke of decorum\u00a0as the end of his\u00a0term approaches.\nSome of the Canadian central banker's\u00a0most revealing remarks came in his \"fireside chat\" with\u00a0Bridgitte Anderson, CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, who congratulated Poloz for what has so far been a successful seven\u00a0years. Such recognition at\u00a0each recent public appearance adds to the farewell tour feeling.\nIn fact, Poloz maintained that not only has the economy improved on his watch but that it continues to do very well, and that's despite a period of global uncertainty of the type that has led to this week's crash of a Ukrainian passenger aircraft in Iran that killed all 176 people on board.\nHe said uncertainty, especially over trade, has knocked a full percentage point off global economic growth that has gone for good.\nEffectively, he said, uncertainty during\u00a0the Trump administration has \"exploded higher,\" making companies reluctant to spend and invest. And Poloz said that uncertainty is not over yet.\n\"You know, if President Trump were re-elected, I don't think he would suddenly change the tools of how he operates, so I think we would be in for continued uncertainty,\" he told Anderson in response to a question about the effects on Canada of the coming U.S. election.\nThat said, he conceded that a vote against Trump could lead to uncertainty of a different kind, a seeming nod to the more left-leaning politicians who could win the Democratic Party nomination.\nThe startling thing about the Canadian economy, said Poloz, is that it has done so well. While he worries about the effect of a sudden downturn on consumers made vulnerable by too much borrowing, there are growing signs that foreign and domestic businesses are investing in the economy.\nCanada's economy 'sound and growing,' says Morneau\nBut the country could do much better if the premiers\u00a0would just get together and get rid of trade barriers and red tape within Canada that research shows have cut four\u00a0percentage points off Canadian economic growth.\n\"Take for example, in one province the construction worker's toilet seat must be an open front toilet seat,\u00a0in another province it must be a closed front toilet seat. Seriously!\"\nFixing issues like that\u00a0rather than making more cuts in interest rates would have a greater effect on Canadian productivity.\nAnd when it comes to measuring items like productivity Poloz insists there are increasing signs that Canada's statistical methods are flawed and out of date.\n\"As far as I can tell there's high productivity everywhere in Canada except in the statistics,\" he quipped. Some studies have shown what he called a missing two\u00a0per cent in\u00a0productivity readings.\nThe Canadian economy is changing and has grown quite different from the United States, said Poloz, and Canada's statistics have not caught up. While manufacturing and resource\u00a0extraction remain important to the economy, information technology services in Canada's increasingly knowledge-based economy are\u00a0bigger and\u00a0growing at eight\u00a0per cent per annum.\nWhile describing Statistics Canada as \"the best statistics agency in the world,\" he says they need to be properly funded to keep up.\u00a0\nDespite repeated calls for rate cuts to boost the economy,\u00a0the governor's intransigence in the face of repeated advice has so far\u00a0proved correct. But there is still time for things to go wrong before the central banker's final exit.\nCanadian singer and songwriter Neil Young who, like Cher, has about a decade on Poloz,\u00a0takes a different view on farewell tours.\n\"When I retire, people will know, because I'll be dead,\" he's reported to have said.\nYesterday Poloz said that while he is stepping down as a central banker, he's not retiring. His wife, he says, wants him out of the house.\nBut unlike performers like\u00a0Young or Cher, the real test of success for someone like Poloz\u00a0will be,\u00a0once he his has stepped down from his current job and the road show is really over,\u00a0whether the machinery of the Bank of Canada keeps working just as\u00a0smoothly in his absence.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Bank of Canada follows U.S. with half-point rate cut to soften blow of coronavirus", "description": "Bank rate reduction comes amid economic concerns over coronavirus outbreak", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-of-canada-interest-rate-march-1.5485031", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5394144.1576174626!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-regulators-fair-lending.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 04, 2020 9:58 AM ET", "2020-03-04T19:05:34.399Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Bank of Canada is cutting its key interest rate target by half\u00a0a percentage point, dropping it to 1.25 per cent in response to the economic shock from the novel coronavirus outbreak.\nThe central bank says its target for the overnight rate is being trimmed because COVID-19, the disease caused by\u00a0the virus, \"is a material negative shock\" to the country's economic outlook.\nIn a written statement about the announcement, the bank said that prior to the outbreak, Canada's economy had been operating \"close to potential with inflation on target.\"\n\"However, COVID-19 represents a significant health threat to people in a growing number of countries.

CREA says the average figure can be misleading because it tends to be skewed by activity in big, expensive cities. So they say another number, the House Price Index (HPI), is a better gauge of the market because it adjusts for the size of the market and the type of housing.\nThe HPI rose by 0.2\u00a0per cent on an annual basis in July.

Officials were also concerned that inflation still hadn't reached its target of 2 per cent.\nStill, many Fed policymakers said at the Dec. 10-11 meeting that the risks of a U.S.-China trade war had diminished and that the probability of a disruptive Brexit had also declined. The meeting occurred two days before the United States\u00a0and China reached a preliminary trade deal, though press reports had already suggested that an agreement was near.\nFed officials also noted that the U.S. economy was \"showing resilience\" despite the trade fight and weak global economy, the minutes said. Changes in interest rates also \"suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had fallen noticeably in recent months.\"\nSince the meeting, however, tensions have flared in the Middle East as the U.S.\u00a0has struck Iranian forces in Iraq. That escalated oil prices on Friday and caused the U.S. stock market to decline.\nYet many analysts say higher oil prices could potentially benefit the U.S. economy because of the sharp increase in the past decade in U.S. oil production. Higher oil prices encourage energy companies to invest in more drilling wells, which boosts demand for steel pipe and other equipment from U.S. factories, and creates jobs. Those trends increasingly offset the drag on consumer spending exerted by higher gas prices.\nThough the Fed's policy-making committee voted unanimously in favour of keeping rates unchanged, several members voiced concerns about the long-term impact of very low rates.\nKeeping rates so low could fuel excessive risk-taking on Wall Street, a few participants warned, which could lead to dangerous asset bubbles. If those bubbles were to burst, it \"could make the next recession more severe than otherwise.\"\nBut a greater number of Fed officials felt that the job market could still strengthen and draw more people off the sidelines into jobs, without sending inflation up too much. That sentiment would favour keeping rates low to further reduce unemployment and stimulate economic growth.\nChairman Jerome Powell echoed that view in the post-meeting news conference, signalling that the central bank was comfortable with keeping rates low for the foreseeable future.\n\"We have learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation,\" Powell said at the news conference.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Non-bank lenders taking a bigger bite out of Canada's mortgage market, CMHC says", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cmhc-mortgage-lenders-1.5213604", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4608263.1526058958!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/open-house-sign-guelph-for-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 16, 2019 12:50 PM ET", "2019-07-16T18:45:43.829Z"], "source": null, "content": "An increasing number of homeowners turned to alternative lenders last year, while new mortgage growth reached its slowest pace in more than a quarter of a century amid government interventions aimed at cooling the housing market, according to a new report.\nAlternative lenders, which take on clients with riskier profiles for shorter terms at higher interest rates, held one per cent of Canadian mortgages last year, according to a first-of-its kind report from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nThere were 200 to 300 active alternative lenders in Canada last year holding $13 billion to $14 billion of outstanding Canadian mortgages. That's up from $11 billion to $12 billion the year prior and $8 billion to $10 billion in 2016.\nThe data suggests that \"their share in this space is growing,\" said Tania Bourassa-Ochoa, a specialist in housing research with CMHC.\nLoans from alternative lenders typically have terms between six months and two years. In 2018, they offered interest rates between 7.3 and 11 per cent, with an average of 8.99 per cent. Banks, by contrast, offered 3.3 per cent to 5.4 per cent rates on mortgage loans with terms that generally last several years.\nPeople who turn to alternative lenders have riskier profiles, according to the report. Their clientele includes people who are self-employed, investors carrying more than one property, and borrowers who need short-term cash due to poor credit history, health problems, divorce or other issues.\nSuch mortgages have higher delinquency rates than those given by other lenders. In the third quarter of 2018, the delinquency rate for alternative lenders was 1.93 per cent, according to the report. Mortgage finance companies, credit unions, caisses populaires and banks all reported delinquency rates at 0.25 per cent or lower during that same time.\n\"It gives me great concern,\" said Laurie Campbell, CEO of the non-profit agency Credit Canada, of the rise in alternative lending.\nThe short terms and high interest rates put people in a vulnerable position, she said, especially if interest rates are rising. It doesn't help that many of these borrowers are people who could not qualify for a bank mortgage, making them higher risk, she said.\nThey could get into a situation where rates are higher when their term is up and not even alternative lenders will renew their mortgage, she said, forcing them to sell their property.\nShe suggests people desperate to get into the housing market who fail to be approved by a traditional lender determine what prevents them for qualifying, like a low credit score, and whether it's possible to fix it going forward.\nIf they do decide to sign a mortgage with an alternative lender, they need to recognize that it's going to cost them a lot more over the long run, she said.\nAn April report from CIBC's deputy chief economist raised concerns over the rise in alternative lenders in Ontario. In 2018, alternative lenders made up nearly 12 per cent of transactions in Ontario and about 15 per cent in Greater Toronto, according to the report. That represented a roughly two-per-cent rise since Ottawa's new mortgage stress test for traditional lenders came into play.\nAlternative lenders account for close to seven per cent of the market based on dollars, since average loan size is about half the size of bank loans.\nBenjamin Tal said at the time that alternative lending is part of a normally functioning mortgage market, but a fast-growing segment is not.\nA one-per cent market share is still a relatively small figure, said Bourassa-Ochoa.\n\"We're going to have to monitor how these numbers are changing in time in order to really see and understand more clearly if there is a vulnerability and what it is.\"\nLast year also saw the slowest year-over-year growth in total mortgage debt in more than 25 years, according to the report. Throughout 2018, mortgage debt grew by between 3.4 per cent and 5.2 per cent with the pace maintaining at 3.4 per cent in the first quarter of this year. That's down from between 5.2 per cent and 6.2 per cent in 2017 and 6.1 to 6.5 per cent in 2016.\nThat decline comes from tougher government lending rules, higher borrowing costs and other factors.\nThis is the first report of its kind by the CMHC, which plans to produce it on an annual basis and provide quarterly updates.\n\"This report is really looking at filling so many missing pieces of the residential mortgage landscape,\" said Bourassa-Ochoa, adding businesses, policy makers and others can use the data to make more informed decisions.\nCMHC's report comes on the heels of a similar effort by Statistics Canada. The agency last week released its first set of data from a survey of non-bank mortgage lenders.\nIt noted this data was previously \"only collected by some organizations at the provincial level, for certain industries and with varying levels of detail.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "What profits at Canada's big banks are saying about the odds of a recession", "description": "Royal and CIBC revealed numbers last week.

That's because Canada's five biggest lenders \u2014 Royal Bank, TD, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank and CIBC \u2014 have a hand in nearly every aspect of Canada's economy, from loaning businesses money for expansion to funding the mortgages that finance much of the housing market.\nThose same banks are in the midst of revealing their quarterly earnings this week, and the numbers should offer a good glimpse of where the economy is headed.\nThe Royal Bank of Canada was first to report last week, showing profits rising to a record $3.3 billion\u00a0in the third quarter. CIBC was next, with a quarterly profit of $1.4 billion\u00a0in the three months up to the end of July.\nBoth figures are up only slightly from last year's level, but in a world in which the financial media is warning of negative rates, inverted yields and huge stock market swings on a seemingly daily basis, rising profits are good to see at the banks. Because if the banks are making money, there's a good chance many of their customers are doing well, too.\nThe Bank of Montreal and Scotiabank\u00a0will\u00a0report their earnings\u00a0Tuesday morning. TD's expected to show its hand on Thursday.\u00a0\nWhile the forecast for the two banks we've already heard from was generally sunny, that's not to say there weren't a few clouds on the horizon \u2014 potential storms that investors will be on the lookout for in the other banks' outlooks.\nRoyal managed to grow their residential mortgage business by almost 6 per cent in the past year to $298 billion, an impressive feat considering how big a player they were in the market to begin with. As CBC News has reported, mortgage rates have been headed lower in recent months, a development that's a double-edged sword for banks \u2014 because each mortgage individually is less profitable for them, but they are also able to sell more of them because they appear to be cheaper.\nPolicymakers have spent years worrying about Canadians' debt loads, but Royal Bank's performance suggests there's room for more. Borrowers wouldn't be taking on all that new debt if they weren't feeling confident about their prospects, either. As TD Bank analyst Mario Mendonca put it, \"We expect mortgage growth to make a healthy recovery this quarter, reflecting a reasonably strong spring selling season, particularly in Ontario.\"\nThe mortgage picture\u00a0at CIBC, meanwhile, wasn't quite as rosy. Despite handing out $9 billion in new mortgages during the quarter, the total value of CIBC's mortgages actually shrank by a little more than one per cent\u00a0to $222 billion.\nWorse still for the bank is where many of them are.\u00a0\"CIBC is the most-exposed to mortgage loans in Ontario and British Columbia,\" Bloomberg analyst Paul Gulberg said.\u00a0\nWhile Canada's housing market overall has shown signs of stabilizing, activity in Toronto and Vancouver is still causing worry, so it should be interesting to see what the other banks have to say about their mortgage businesses.\nAnother possible dark cloud on an otherwise blue sky could\u00a0be what the banks are saying about their loans to businesses. That's because both\u00a0banks reported higher credit loss provisions \u2014 money that banks set aside to write off bad loans. While it's still a tiny slice of their overall business, if more businesses are having trouble paying back their bank loans, that's a bad sign for the economy.\u00a0\nAt Royal, credit losses came in at $425 million, a 27 per cent increase year over year. At CIBC, the figure stood at $291 million for the quarter, a 21 per cent increase year over year.\nThe worst part is those credit losses seem to be spreading beyond certain problematic parts of the economy.\n\"It used to be oil and gas but it looks like it has spread ... to some other areas,\" said James Shanahan, a senior equity research analyst\u00a0with Edward Jones.\nThe\u00a0oil and gas sector has been hit hard and has been a black mark on Canada's economy for a while, but there's some evidence that weakness is spreading to businesses in forestry, agriculture, and other industries, he said.\n\"It's not too surprising given the tremendous growth, but this could be a problem for the banks,\" Shanahan said.\nLoans going bad are a bad sign for any business \u2014 never mind the broader economy \u2014 but the two banks did give a surefire indication that they are feeling confident about their prospects: they raised their dividend.\nNo major Canadian bank has missed a dividend payment in more than a century, but with a track record like that, banks are incredibly careful not to promise any more cash than they are confident they'll be able to come up with.\nCompanies that have to snatch back a dividend payment tend to be punished heavily on the stock market, so the banks have been raising their payouts steadily, but cautiously, for decades.\u00a0\nBased on Royal and CIBC\u00a0not increasing\u00a0their dividends during the previous quarter, Mendonca\u00a0was expecting both banks\u00a0to hike this time around. And that's exactly what they did \u2014 another three cents for Royal and four for CIBC.\u00a0\nHe's expecting a bump up at Scotiabank, too, but not for BMO since\u00a0that bank already hiked last quarter.\nBased on how much they are paying out, Shanahan\u00a0says the banks have some capacity to keep the dividend hikes coming, but on the whole he thought the\u00a0numbers at Royal and CIBC showed they are \"in pretty good shape.\"\nAnd as for the rest, \"I think results will continue to come in similarly,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Melissa Mancini & David Common", "title": "'Renoviction' rates soar due to big-city housing crunch", "description": "'It's a way of making outrageous profits in a very short time,' housing advocate says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/renovictions-housing-shortage-1.5400594", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5403512.1576797750!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/martin-blanchard.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 30, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-30T09:00:00.299Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It was a knock at the door that ignited the battle.\u00a0\nAs Yanick Marion hustled early one morning to get to work, the manager of his apartment building had a message: \"You have to leave. You don't have a choice,\" he recalls.\u00a0\nThe manager, Marion says, was insistent that electrical upgrades were needed in the aging 36-unit complex in Montreal.\u00a0\n\"It's dangerous for your life, and the bank wants you to leave,\" Marion says he was told.\nOther tenants received the same message \u2014\u00a0and many left, watching as their former apartments were given a fresh coat of paint, new windows and appliances, and the rent went up as new tenants came in.\u00a0\nSo-called \"renovictions\" are up sharply across Canadian cities, complicating an already challenging housing situation.\nIn 2018, there were 37,000 new apartments built nationwide, but demand increased by 50,000 units, according to tracking done by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nThe smallest provincial capital, Charlottetown, has one of the lowest rental vacancy rates in the country. It hovers just above zero per cent, and new Kijiji rental listings last just minutes before apartments are snapped up.\nIn Montreal, housing advocate Martin Blanchard says it's a scenario that has happened before \u2014\u00a0every time vacancy rates drop toward zero, new owners snap up rental stock, renovate the units and increase the rent.\n\"We used to get 50 to 100 calls per year,\" from people complaining about being forced out of their apartments by landlords, says Blanchard, a community organizer with Comit\u00e9 logement de la Petite Patrie, a housing advocacy group. \"Now we get many hundreds every year. It's a crisis.\"\nBlanchard points largely to foreign firms, which are buying up older apartment complexes in Canada's big cities and attempting to jettison existing tenants so the rent can be jacked up beyond limits set by provincial governments.\n\"It's a way of making outrageous profits in a very short time. So they've got a little money put down, you can make a lot of profit, but it involves putting people on the street.\"\nLegislation protecting renters varies from province to province, but often a tenant cannot be evicted simply because a landlord wants to renovate. Renters should be able to remain at an apartment under existing rules.\nIf construction is so significant that a tenant must temporarily move out, the landlord is often required to allow them to return to the unit \u2014\u00a0at the same price.\nBut building owners don't always follow the rules, says Kenneth Hale, director of legal services for the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario.\n\"These kinds of evictions deserve special scrutiny about whether the applications are being brought in good faith.\"\nTenants Ontario urges renters facing these circumstances not to agree to anything and to contact them, though acknowledge they are inundated with calls now as they seek to bring cases forward to the provincial tribunal, the Landlord and Tenant Board.\nMany of the cases that come across his desk involve low-level renovations that, he believes, are largely an excuse to get renters out in favour of those who will pay more.\nThe group has tracked a nearly four-fold increase in renovictions over the past couple of years, with cases reported to the centre soaring from 18 in 2015 to 71 in the 2018-19 fiscal year. It says the actual number is likely much higher, since the advocacy centre can only rely on what is reported to its office.\nHale wants new legislation to better protect tenants from renoviction.\n\"They should take away the economic incentive to evict people. And that would be by putting restrictions on the amount of rent increase that can happen in between tenants,\" says Hale. \"Because right now it's unlimited. And we just see it as an opportunity for landlords to rent-gouge, and that shouldn't be allowed.\"\nToronto city Coun. Paula Fletcher says she wants the provincial government to require that a building permit is obtained before a renoviction, and have building inspectors ensure that the renovation/demolition is so substantial that it is indeed imperative the tenant move out.\n\"I think the Ontario government needs to change the bar for the Landlord Tenant Board,\" she says.\nMarion is still holding on to his basement unit in Montreal, though two-thirds of the other apartments have been vacated, including that of his former neighbour Radina Papukchieva.\u00a0\n\"It was eight months of pressure, and it just became like a psychological stress,\" Papukchieva says.\n\"We had mice. Garbage wasn't getting picked up. They were doing everything to make us feel uncomfortable and unwanted in our own place.\"\nBut Papukchieva and Marion's former landlord disputes that. Abraham Kellner, the manager of the building, says plumbing fixes alone cost $100,000.\u00a0\n\"I can tell you that we did plumbing, electricity, kitchens, toilets, windows, floors,\" he says. \"I mean, it wasn't minor at all.\"\nThe company that bought the apartment tried to do the best for all parties and did everything in good faith, Kellner says.\nKellner wouldn't say how much rent new tenants coming in after the renovations\u00a0are being charged, but denied it had doubled.\n\"It depends on the apartment, but after it's renovated ... it's normal that it's going to be more,\" he says. \"But I wouldn't say double, and in some cases\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it's hard to say, it's a lot of apartments.\"\nPapukchieva\u00a0said she, too,\u00a0is paying more because of the move, going from a monthly cost of $725 to $1,000 just to stay in an increasingly pricey neighbourhood.\n\"They want to simply do cosmetic changes to the apartments, make them look super nice, keep it like that \u2014\u00a0they're not doing anything to the exterior of the building,\"\u00a0Papukchieva\u00a0says.\nSome tenants pre-empt renovictions by offering to pay more to stay. But others aren't given the choice.\nIn Toronto, Ivan Wadgymar resisted an eviction notice \u2014\u00a0but lost in a tribunal because the new owners converted the building from residential to commercial. It was at the hearings, seeing other tenants in the same position, that he says he realized the impact the rapidly growing number of renovictions is having on the fabric of his city.\n\"It took me going to those meetings and seeing people cry who are getting evicted as well to make me understand what a home is \u2026 how important it is to feel that you have a home. And then get kicked out of it.\"\nThe owner of the company that bought his building says they \"approach all projects with the rights and respect of the tenants and the law in mind.\"\n\"We care about our community and we are dedicated to working with our city throughout the process,\" says Basem Hanna.\nBut Wadgymar feels the neighborhood is changing and is increasingly unaffordable.\nHe now helps others fight against renovictions, though he's doing so from a bedroom in his mother's house, because the small-business operator is no longer able to afford rent in the area he called home for three years.\n\"I've been pretty depressed since this happened,\" Wadgymar says. \"I haven't even unpacked my stuff \u2026 I'm still absorbing this.\"\nThe building where he used to live is now fenced off, with construction supplies visible through the windows. His name has been removed from the buzzer on the door.\nWith its proximity to the downtown core, Toronto's Leslieville neighbourhood has become increasingly desirable. Many of its low-rise apartment buildings are more than 50 years old and are being scooped up by companies with a track record for renovictions, according to Fletcher, the city councillor for the area.\n\"I always say we cannot build affordable housing as fast as tenants in these types of rental situations are being evicted,\" she says.\nWhen some tenants in Fletcher's ward got notices to leave recently, she joined them in a protest outside the building. She also wants the Landlord and Tenant Board to demand proof that planned renovations are so extensive, that there is no other option but for a tenant to move out.\n\"There's only a few companies that come in and do this, but they seem to have a plan. Get in. Get the building. Give the notices. Renovate. Triple the existing rent,\" she says. \"It's a pattern.\"\n"}, {"author": "John Last", "title": "N.W.T.

Housing Corporation spent $4.2 million more in 2018-2019 than in the previous fiscal year, but more than half of that went to programs for private homeowners, its annual report shows.\nExpenditures on maintenance for public housing, meanwhile, dropped by a little over two per cent \u2014 and outside a partnership with the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation (IRC) that saw ten units constructed in the Beaufort Delta region, the housing corporation built no new public housing units this year.\nThe N.W.T. Housing Corporation administers more than 2,400 social housing units across the territory. In addition, it runs a number of programs to improve access to market housing and support private homeowners with renovations and upgrades.\nThe annual report, tabled in the legislature Dec. 12\u00a0but describing the year ending March 31, 2019, offers a window into the corporation's operations, which have been the subject of, at times, intense criticism.\nThe corporation's biggest spending increase was in support of \"homeownership assistance programs,\" which includes funding for would-be and current homeowners to acquire and renovate private properties.\nThat includes STEP, a series of courses designed to educate homeowners; PATH, a home ownership\u00a0assistance program for N.W.T. residents; and CARE, a funding program for preventive repairs.\nThe report says the \"notable increase\" is due to policy changes made to make the programs easier to access \u2014 including reduced co-payment requirements.\nAt the same time, the corporation decreased its spending on public housing repairs and maintenance, despite survey numbers showing a dramatic increase in core housing need.\nA 2019 community survey showed 42 per cent of houses had major problems with affordability, basic amenities or crowding,\nThe annual report says about 14 per cent of public housing is in need of repair. An increase in public housing costs of approximately one per cent is \"primarily attributable\"\u00a0to write-downs on the new IRC properties acquired last year.\nThe report also says the corporation increased their revenue from public housing tenants by eliminating subsidized utility rates.\n\"Public housing tenants now pay the same electricity rates as private households,\" the report reads. \"In addition to assisting with the decline in CMHC\u00a0[Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation] funding, this initiative is also helping to promote tenant self-reliance and environmental stewardship through reduced power consumption.\"\nIn 2018-2019, the corporation saw increased funding from the territorial government for the first time since 2015. But the $77.8 million the territory spent is still less than it did before a major spending cut three years ago.\nIt also came as the CMHC\u00a0shrunk their contribution by more than 20 per cent, to $19.5 million from $25.1 million.\nThe CMHC plans to end their contribution to territorial housing programs by 2038-39, but a new federal funding agreement guarantees the corporation more than $84 million over the next nine years.\nThe corporation also signed an agreement for $3.6 million in bridge funding until that agreement takes effect, and collected more than $10 million in transfers from the IRC.\nAs a result, the corporation enjoyed one of its biggest surpluses in years, reporting $22.6 million in revenue over its expenses.\nThe report says a surplus is necessary to support more than $12 million in third-party loans. It also notes, however, that the corporation \"recognizes the importance of having its available net financial assets reinvested in a timely manner.\"\nA \"reinvestment plan,\" already in place, will see the surplus spent on housing projects that have already been planned and approved.\nThe surplus year means the corporation now holds $47.8 million dollars in cash or cash-equivalent reserves \u2014\u00a0 80 per cent of which the report says is earmarked for reinvestment.\nOver the past fiscal year, the corporation says it has built eight new market units and replaced 20 old units of public housing.\nIt's also piloting a new funding program for Indigenous governments and municipalities that want to invest in public housing, and has created a new \"housing stability worker\" position, which provides support for 13 public housing tenants in Behchoko.\n"}, {"author": "Shane Magee", "title": "Moncton, Dieppe break building permit records as construction booms", "description": "Residential construction is increasing but vacancy rates are falling ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-dieppe-construction-vacancy-rates-housing-1.5436533", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5436545.1579723120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/highfield-hotel-construction.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 23, 2020 5:00 AM AT", "2020-01-23T09:00:00.931Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The skyline tells the tale: new buildings are popping up across the Moncton region thanks to a construction boom that's seen record-setting building permit values amid an increasingly competitive residential housing market.\n\"We have some pretty impressive stats,\" Moncton Mayor Dawn Arnold said at a city council meeting Monday.\u00a0\n\"We're shattering building permit records \u2026 We've got cranes every direction we look, and we are, as has been said, the economic engine of the province.\"\nAcross the metro area, new hotels and apartment buildings are rising as large new commercial and industrial buildings are built or expanded.\nJohn Wishart, CEO of the Greater Moncton Chamber of Commerce, called it \"a nice collision of metrics\" leading to economic growth.\nBuilding permits worth\u00a0$378 million were issued in Moncton, Dieppe and Riverview last year, the municipalities reported.\nThe building boom comes as residential vacancy rates continue a multi-year decline and rent costs rise.

Effectively, Powell\u00a0said, after successive cuts totalling\u00a0three-quarters of a per cent, the central bank will now sit tight and wait for the effect of that stimulus to kick in.\u00a0\n\"One thing that we're mindful of is that we've cut rates three times since July,\" Powell told a gathering of reporters at yesterday's\u00a0monetary policy news conference. \"And we do believe that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and that it will take some time before the full effects of those actions are seen in the economy.\"\nPrevious research has shown that while rate cuts have an immediate impact on stock and bond markets, their stimulus effect can take six months to\u00a0a year to work their way into the wider economy. And like\u00a0cannabis edibles, you don't want to have too many before you've seen the effect.\nThe group of bankers who participate in making the interest rate decision were not only confident in their outlook, dropping the word \"uncertainties\" from their statement, but in agreement, approving the policy unanimously.\nOne of the uncertainties that seems to be off the table is the North American trade agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico\u00a0\u2014\u00a0now revised with the support of Democrats\u00a0\u2014\u00a0into what some are now calling\u00a0NAFTA 2.1.\nThe final resolution of that agreement, which is expected to be ratified by Congress in the new year, secures Canada's close integration with what Powell sees as a strengthening U.S. economy.\nWhile the percentage of Canadian jobless rose in the latest November figures, that could change if an apparent worker shortage in the U.S. continues to disseminate north across the border.\nU.S. unemployment figures fell to 3.5 per cent the last time around and wage growth was well above inflation. As one report noted, the rate of wage increases\u00a0outpaced the mortgage rate for the first time since 1972.\u00a0\nPowell expects unemployment to stay low and wage growth to stay relatively high.\nQuestioned as to why the low jobless rate and rising wages had not pushed inflation back up to the central bank's target of two\u00a0per cent, Powell noted the weakening relationship between\u00a0falling unemployment and rising inflation. He also seemed to say the official unemployment rate was an imperfect measure of how many workers were available to be enticed into the U.S. labour force.\n\"Even though we're at 3\u00bd\u00a0per cent unemployment, there's actually more slack out there,\" said Powell, noting that the risk of keeping rates low to draw more people into the workforce is not something to be feared.\nIn fact, Powell once again said that a lack of inflation was a greater risk. In a circular phenomenon, he said, persistently low inflation led to low inflationary expectations, which led to lower inflation, and thus lower interest rates.\nAnd persistently low rates make it impossible to stimulate the economy with cuts once a downturn comes.\u00a0\nPowell hopes to break that cycle.\nAs noted previously, Canada has a relatively healthy rate of inflation, though the statistics for calculating the Canadian core rate are different than\u00a0those used by the Fed.\nBut one of the reasons sometimes given for Canada's higher inflation rate is that poorer people get a bigger slice of the income pie, meaning they spend instead of saving, helping to push prices higher.\nFor Canadian homeowners or those looking to buy, the prospect of\u00a0U.S. interest rates remaining low may be reassuring, because no matter what the Bank of Canada does, five-year mortgage rates are heavily influenced by the U.S. central bank rate.\nTrump may be disappointed that Powell did not add more stimulus, but the 2020 election may tie Powell's hands even further. By tradition, central bankers avoid hiking or cutting in the immediate run-up to an election on the grounds that they do not want to be seen as interfering in politics by boosting or weakening the economy in a way that may offer one party advantage.\nPowell noted the positive effects of a North American trade deal in reducing investment uncertainty. He also\u00a0implied that the greater danger for the U.S. economy was not the resolution of NAFTA 2.1, but\u00a0the much more dangerous dispute between the biggest\u00a0global trading powers:\u00a0China and the U.S.\nAnd the fact is that\u00a0while it is reassuring that the team formulating yesterday's outlook were both unanimous and moderately optimistic, it is useful\u00a0to recall that a year ago,\u00a0the Fed got things quite wrong,\u00a0as Powell described in his look-back at events of 2019, when it was forced to bail out an unexpectedly weak economy.\n\"Rather than modestly increasing the target rate for the\u00a0federal funds rate this year, as\u00a0seemed appropriate a year ago, we reduced it by three-quarters of a percentage point,\" he said.\nWhile it may not have been intended that way, the description was a salutary reminder that no one\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not even the U.S. Federal Reserve\u00a0\u2014 can reliably predict the economic future.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada's economy grew at 0.3% pace in fourth quarter, slowest level in almost 4 years", "description": "Bad weather and strikes slowed growth to a crawl", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-gdp-december-1.5479368", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4757643.1538604600!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/factory-worker-chris-rebelo-at-automatic-coating.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 28, 2020 8:58 AM ET", "2020-02-28T13:59:50.737Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada's economic growth slowed to an annualized rate of 0.3 per cent\u00a0in the fourth quarter, the worst performance in almost four years, thanks in part to strikes, bad weather and shutdowns, Statistics Canada said on Friday.\nThe increase matched both the forecast of analysts in a Reuters poll as well as the Bank of Canada's prediction.

Especially when rates are already so low.\nThe bigger the loan, the bigger the difference it makes.\nIn the wake of Tuesday's surprise rate cut by Jerome Powell at the U.S. Federal Reserve, the equally large cut by Stephen Poloz at the Bank of Canada yesterday was not as astonishing as it would have been if Canada had moved first.\nAs BMO Chief Economist\u00a0Douglas Porter said yesterday, just\u00a0after the Bank of Canada cut, the world has changed in a very short time.\n\"As recently as 10 days ago, any move by the bank today would have been seen as a long shot,\" said\u00a0Porter.\nWhile generally approving of\u00a0new monetary stimulus, especially in light of the economic effects of recent rail blockades and the struggling oil and gas sector, the BMO economist\u00a0noted the dangers to Canadians already mired in debt.\nThough\u00a0it is hard to dispute that making money cheap has the effect of boosting the value of assets, whether houses or stocks, many economists worry that monetary policy may be\u00a0too\u00a0blunt an instrument to try to solve an economic problem that\u00a0requires finesse.\nCanadian monetary policy specialist Louis-Philippe Rochon\u00a0is one of those economists who worries that rate cuts now are not an effective solution to the economic problems created by the global outbreak of COVID-19.\nRochon said\u00a0he knows he's part of the economic problem as he considers whether, as a diabetic, he can afford to travel to Rome next month where he is supposed to be visiting professor.\n\"It's a tough decision to make,\" he said.\nBut he has trouble seeing how lower interest rates will fill empty planes, replace parts cut off by factory shutdowns or convince people to go\u00a0out to restaurants or\u00a0theatres and feel comfortable taking public transit. Cheap money\u00a0will not stop people from getting sick.\nMaking such a hefty cut in rates may create other problems, he said, including reducing the capacity to reduce rates in the future should the continuing impact of coronavirus\u00a0lead to the kind of serious\u00a0financial\u00a0breakdown\u00a0warned of by OECD chief economist Laurence Boone.\nJust about everything about the coronavirus and its economic impact remains up in the air, from how long the disruption will last, to how profoundly it will affect the global economy.\nCertainly,\u00a0businesses are being hurt. A glance at the headlines in business newspapers and wire services yesterday showed\u00a0many economic problems were virus-related. The lumber market threatened by falling demand, the virus pushing the aviation industry toward crisis, worries over how many employees could work remotely if the virus worsens, to name\u00a0 just a few.\nBut as Rochon points out, an across the board interest rate cut\u00a0is a handout to everyone who has borrowed money;\u00a0among U.S. corporations or Canadian consumers, that's just about everyone.\nThat's why, everything else being equal, a cut in interest rates has an immediate positive effect on stock prices and real estate. When the carrying cost of loans declines, assets are worth more.\nCommentators have suggested that Tuesday's sharp decline in stocks despite the Fed cut showed everything else was not equal. Lower rates, they said,\u00a0were not enough to save the economy from coronavirus shocks and the sudden move by the Fed only increased financial\u00a0worries.\nThe\u00a0sudden rise in stocks on Wednesday, a day after the Fed cuts,\u00a0may have more to do with Joe Biden's wins on Super Tuesday,\u00a0reassuring shareholders that the previous left-leaning\u00a0leader of the Democratic pack, Bernie Sanders, was not going to take some of their wealth and give it to the poor.\nWhile strapped Canadians burdened by loans and mortgages may be thrilled by the prospect of lower interest payments, there may be negative consequences. Yesterday, fresh indicators showed the Canadian real estate market may be\u00a0once again overheating, as the Toronto Real Estate Board reported a sharp increase in sales and prices.\nThe cut in borrowing costs both here and in the U.S. may be merely storing up problems for an eventual reckoning.\nWhile Poloz is usually\u00a0reluctant to say he is following the Fed, perhaps one of the best reasons for yesterday's\u00a0move is that the impact of a large and sudden\u00a0asymmetry in rates between Canada and its biggest trading partner would have only added to the economic impact of the coronavirus.\nLater today, the Bank of Canada governor will have a chance to explain why he decided a cut in interest rates was essential in a Toronto speech\u00a0followed by questions.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Real estate market hits new heights in Ottawa-Gatineau", "description": "Record comes amidst affordable housing shortage", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/housing-real-estate-homes-1.5415644", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5238836.1565195419!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/house-for-sale-ottawa-vanier-sign-real-estate-august-7-2019.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 06, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-01-06T09:00:00.663Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The number of house sales and\u00a0property\u00a0prices\u00a0soared in\u00a0the capital\u00a0last year and aren't showing any signs of slowing down.\nThe trend looks set to continue in 2020, but\u00a0comes at a time when the region is grappling with a lack of affordable housing.\n\"Each quarter, the properties have increased in value,\" said Angelo Toscano, a\u00a0real estate agent based in Orl\u00e9ans.\nOne of the biggest factors driving the\u00a0increase is\u00a0market demand.\n\"We started the year fairly stable.

The CMHC\u00a0estimates that Ottawa's rental housing vacancy rate was at 1.6 per cent in 2018, the last year for which there is data.\nAcross the Ottawa River, the vacancy rate in Gatineau\u00a0sits at 1.2 per cent, the lowest in the province.\nThe Quebec government has put in place an emergency assistance program to help people who are homeless, as well as to assist cities that are coping with\u00a0a housing shortage.\u00a0\nWhile the price of homes in the region continues to grow, advocacy groups persist in their\u00a0push for investments in affordable housing.\u00a0\nThere are approximately 10,000 people on the waiting list for social housing in Ottawa,\u00a0according to data from the City of Ottawa.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Home Capital Group to sell $425M worth of uninsured mortgage-backed securities", "description": "Move by alternative mortgage lender is likely to be welcomed by the Bank of Canada", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/home-capital-1.5295195", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4106067.1494333486!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/home-capital.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 24, 2019 12:45 PM ET", "2019-09-24T16:45:49.465Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Alternative mortgage lender Home Capital Group plans to sell $425 million worth of its uninsured mortgages to investors, its first sale of so-called mortgage-backed securities since the financial crisis and a move likely to be welcomed by the Bank of Canada.\nThe Toronto-based lender says it plans to sell the first tranche of the loans in a private placement that will close by Friday.\nThe investments, which consist of some of the lenders mortgage loans bundled together and sold off to secondary buyers, will pay a rate of 3.011 per cent.\nHome Capital says the underlying loans are all\u00a0residential mortgages to what it calls \"near-prime\" borrowers, and the loans are uninsured. They will only be available to accredited investors, not the general public.\nBy bundling the loans to get them off its books, Home Capital can raise money to give out in new mortgages, and also spread the risk of default around.

And things are changing quickly. Only last week there were\u00a0accusations\u00a0that the central bank was scheming to restart the economy on the backs of overborrowed Canadians.\nSuddenly, what seemed like a reasonable concern over the threat of more reckless borrowing has transformed into new worries that the spring property market and the retail sector are crumbling as house hunters and shoppers stay home.\nAnd housing is only one sector\u00a0under assault by a tangle of interdependent consequences of the new coronavirus for which no one had developed strategies. Canada's fossil fuel sector knew there were challenges ahead, but they did not include a sudden plunge in demand followed by a vicious price war.\n\"The macroeconomic backdrop is completely uncharted waters for oil and gas companies,\" said\u00a0Tom Ellacott, vice-president of the energy research company Wood MacKenzie.\nWith no way to know what energy prices for the rest of the year will be, investment plans made a few weeks ago have become meaningless.\nThe caricature of so many of us closeting ourselves with bales of toilet paper and emergency supplies in the safety of our homes applies to investors as well. As world leaders, including\u00a0Prime Minister Justin\u00a0Trudeau, repeatedly announce updated ways of coping with the virus, investment plans made yesterday\u00a0are out of date today.\nAs the Bank of Canada governor once told us during the disputes with the U.S., the main economic impact of trade uncertainty was that companies and individuals considering whether to spend money\u00a0cut their investment plans\u00a0until they could see the way forward.\nIf that is how investors reacted to ambiguity over the future of trade, it is no wonder the current set of unknowns has\u00a0them bewildered.\nWill government\u00a0rules to slow the spread of the virus get stricter yet? Will the shortage of parts we saw when Asian factories closed recur in the U.S., our biggest trading partner, as cases and deaths climb? Will the path of the disease in the U.S. and Canada be staggering like in Italy or mild like in Singapore?\nWill job losses lead to a vicious circle of collapsing demand? How many consumers or businesses will default on loans? Can the consumer confidence that has recently been leading the economy bounce back?\nAnd just as the bizarre quest for too much toilet paper was accelerated by social media feedback, a new round of uncertainty for investors has been caused by investors themselves.\nWhy do markets keep selling off even as experts reassure us stocks will bounce back? Is there something wrong that we don't know and everyone else does? Will the economy and the market structure crack under the strain?\nWith so many questions unanswered, even more rate cuts and a suite of government plans to inject money into the economy at various levels apparently are not enough\u00a0to make that uncertainty go away. And there is no point in telling people not to panic.\n\"First, those who are already panicking are unlikely to listen. Second, those who aren't will start to wonder if they should,\" wrote emergency preparedness expert Simon Wessely in the\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0on the weekend.\nEverything will change when we know \u2014\u00a0or at least think we know \u2014\u00a0the answers to some of those questions. And while we are waiting,\u00a0rather than staring into the abyss, perhaps this is the time to think ahead and imagine\u00a0an inevitably brighter future.\nFollow Don on Twitter\u00a0@don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Wallis Snowdon", "title": "'It's been tough': Edmonton's job market limps into new year", "description": "'I'm beginning to see now that the statistics ring true so it's been tough'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-unemployment-1.5436283", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5436301.1579716641!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/brian-wolfe.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 26, 2020 6:00 AM MT", "2020-01-26T13:00:00.155Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Brian Wolfe was so desperate for a job he took to the streets with a sign reading, \"Ready to work.\"\nFor six hours on Jan. 13, the out-of-work welder stood on the corner of a busy Edmonton intersection at -30 C, pleading for someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 to give him a job.\nWolfe, 49, had been without steady work for nine months.\n\"I applied to hundreds of places and there was no response,\" said Wolfe, who had supported his family with a welding torch for 15 years.\u00a0\n\"My welding tickets ran out, and the way things fell there wasn't any money to renew the tickets.

So it's been tough.\"\u00a0\nStamhuis had been a water meter reader for Epcor for four years. Most of that time, he worked full-time hours but was a temporary employee. He had been made permanent in April.\n\"At my age, I still have lots left in the tank,\" he said. \"But I want something with stability, and I thought I had that. So I'm very apprehensive about applying for temporary positions.\n\"That's probably been the toughest thing, is seeing how little is out there.\"\nLess reliant on the energy sector than other Alberta cities, the provincial capital has been surprisingly resilient during the ongoing downturn. But that seems to be changing.\nGrowth in Edmonton's real gross domestic product (GDP) hovered around 0.5 per cent in 2019, the lowest it's been since 2015, soon after oil prices started to plunge.\nFull-time employment has been declining year over year since last September, weakening growth in average weekly wages.\nThe figures show Edmonton is lagging behind other parts of Alberta, and elsewhere in Canada.\nAlberta lost roughly 1,000 positions in December as the provincial unemployment rate ticked down from 7.2 to 7 per cent.\u00a0\nIn contrast, the Canadian job market bounced back in December to post a gain of 35,200 jobs and reverse some losses posted in the previous month, which saw the biggest monthly loss since the 2008 financial crisis.\u00a0\n\"We seem to be bucking the provincial trend and the national trend,\" said Raja Bajwa, president of the Economics Society of Northern Alberta and a professor of macroeconomics at NorQuest College.\n\"Hopefully it doesn't continue into 2020 and we see some bounce-back, but it might be going on for a little while.\"\nEdmonton's labour market has been showing signs of stress for some time, Bajwa said.\nGrowth has been stagnant, oil prices remain volatile, but more than anything Edmonton has been hit by the provincial budget, Bajwa said.\u00a0\n\"It was a pretty quick hit in terms of the impact,\" Bajwa said. \"There is going to be an adjustment. Hopefully we recover quickly.\"\nThe city's workforce is dominated by government, public sector and non-profit employers who have been spooked by spending cuts introduced by Premier Jason Kenney's government, Bajwa said.\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of it has to do with the provincial budget that came out in October,\" he said. \"It was a pretty quick hit in terms of the impact, whether municipal governments or some of the non-profits that rely on provincial funding. And as a result, a lot of the places that were looking to hire full time or had full-time positions coming to end, those didn't get extended. We've also seen a lot of major projects come to an end in town, so a lot of those construction jobs have moved on as well.\"\nPost-budget, Edmonton has slipped behind Calgary, which ended 2019 with an unemployment rate of 7.1 per cent, Bajwa\u00a0said.\n\"Back in 2017, Calgary was three per cent higher than us with their unemployment and now it's sort of flipped,\" Bajwa said.\u00a0\n\"We were insulated at that time and now it's our turn to get hit.\"\u00a0\nCharlene Stowe said the level of competition in Edmonton's job market has become \"insane.\"\u00a0\nStowe worked in auto body shops for 10 years but was laid off and\u00a0can't find a job.\u00a0\nShe most recently applied to work as a labourer in Edmonton.

Going on five months, it's starting to get pretty darn scary.\u00a0\n\"My savings are dwindling down to nothing. EI certainly doesn't give you a whole lot, and when you apply for jobs you're competing against not just hundreds but thousands.\"\u00a0\nYoung people, especially young men, have been among the hardest hit by the employment slump, said Bertrand Leveille, an economist with Stats Canada.\nThe unemployment rate for Albertans aged 15 to 24 for the year increased 3.9 percentage points, to 15 per cent. The rate in Edmonton now hovers around 17 per cent, up from 9.2 per cent in December of 2018.\n\"We're seeing an increase in employment for young females but it declined for young males, a significant decline, which ends up giving us a pretty flat employment level for young people,\" Leveille said.\u00a0\n\"You have more young people that are looking for work, and there are not more jobs for them.\"\nIt's not all bad news, according to the latest quarterly report from the city.\u00a0\nWhile labour force growth outpaced the region's employment gains, Edmonton gained 3,100 positions in December, with most of the growth coming from the trades, finance, insurance, real estate and food services.\nFor 2019 as a whole, employment growth in Edmonton increased by 1.1 per cent from the year before, and\u00a0average weekly wages for 2019 were almost two per cent higher.\u00a0\nThe city expects employment in Edmonton to grow by a modest\u00a0one per cent in 2020.\u00a0\n\"The unemployment rate is forecast to decline, though the rate is unlikely to move much lower than the seven to 7.5 per cent range,\" according to the latest quarterly outlook from the city.\nAfter being out of work for two years, house painter Aaron Deneiko, 39, is feeling more positive about this prospects.\nDeneiko sought some professional advice and now plans to return to warehouse work.\u00a0\nHe was a house painter for 15 years before the work dried up.\u00a0\n\"The economy dropped,\" he said. \"Lots of places were downsizing staff.\n\"Four months ago I was feeling pretty down about finding a job.

Especially when rates are already so low.\nThe bigger the loan, the bigger the difference it makes.\nIn the wake of Tuesday's surprise rate cut by Jerome Powell at the U.S. Federal Reserve, the equally large cut by Stephen Poloz at the Bank of Canada yesterday was not as astonishing as it would have been if Canada had moved first.\nAs BMO Chief Economist\u00a0Douglas Porter said yesterday, just\u00a0after the Bank of Canada cut, the world has changed in a very short time.\n\"As recently as 10 days ago, any move by the bank today would have been seen as a long shot,\" said\u00a0Porter.\nWhile generally approving of\u00a0new monetary stimulus, especially in light of the economic effects of recent rail blockades and the struggling oil and gas sector, the BMO economist\u00a0noted the dangers to Canadians already mired in debt.\nThough\u00a0it is hard to dispute that making money cheap has the effect of boosting the value of assets, whether houses or stocks, many economists worry that monetary policy may be\u00a0too\u00a0blunt an instrument to try to solve an economic problem that\u00a0requires finesse.\nCanadian monetary policy specialist Louis-Philippe Rochon\u00a0is one of those economists who worries that rate cuts now are not an effective solution to the economic problems created by the global outbreak of COVID-19.\nRochon said\u00a0he knows he's part of the economic problem as he considers whether, as a diabetic, he can afford to travel to Rome next month where he is supposed to be visiting professor.\n\"It's a tough decision to make,\" he said.\nBut he has trouble seeing how lower interest rates will fill empty planes, replace parts cut off by factory shutdowns or convince people to go\u00a0out to restaurants or\u00a0theatres and feel comfortable taking public transit. Cheap money\u00a0will not stop people from getting sick.\nMaking such a hefty cut in rates may create other problems, he said, including reducing the capacity to reduce rates in the future should the continuing impact of coronavirus\u00a0lead to the kind of serious\u00a0financial\u00a0breakdown\u00a0warned of by OECD chief economist Laurence Boone.\nJust about everything about the coronavirus and its economic impact remains up in the air, from how long the disruption will last, to how profoundly it will affect the global economy.\nCertainly,\u00a0businesses are being hurt. A glance at the headlines in business newspapers and wire services yesterday showed\u00a0many economic problems were virus-related. The lumber market threatened by falling demand, the virus pushing the aviation industry toward crisis, worries over how many employees could work remotely if the virus worsens, to name\u00a0 just a few.\nBut as Rochon points out, an across the board interest rate cut\u00a0is a handout to everyone who has borrowed money;\u00a0among U.S. corporations or Canadian consumers, that's just about everyone.\nThat's why, everything else being equal, a cut in interest rates has an immediate positive effect on stock prices and real estate. When the carrying cost of loans declines, assets are worth more.\nCommentators have suggested that Tuesday's sharp decline in stocks despite the Fed cut showed everything else was not equal. Lower rates, they said,\u00a0were not enough to save the economy from coronavirus shocks and the sudden move by the Fed only increased financial\u00a0worries.\nThe\u00a0sudden rise in stocks on Wednesday, a day after the Fed cuts,\u00a0may have more to do with Joe Biden's wins on Super Tuesday,\u00a0reassuring shareholders that the previous left-leaning\u00a0leader of the Democratic pack, Bernie Sanders, was not going to take some of their wealth and give it to the poor.\nWhile strapped Canadians burdened by loans and mortgages may be thrilled by the prospect of lower interest payments, there may be negative consequences. Yesterday, fresh indicators showed the Canadian real estate market may be\u00a0once again overheating, as the Toronto Real Estate Board reported a sharp increase in sales and prices.\nThe cut in borrowing costs both here and in the U.S. may be merely storing up problems for an eventual reckoning.\nWhile Poloz is usually\u00a0reluctant to say he is following the Fed, perhaps one of the best reasons for yesterday's\u00a0move is that the impact of a large and sudden\u00a0asymmetry in rates between Canada and its biggest trading partner would have only added to the economic impact of the coronavirus.\nLater today, the Bank of Canada governor will have a chance to explain why he decided a cut in interest rates was essential in a Toronto speech\u00a0followed by questions.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Bryan Labby", "title": "Calgary realtors bracing for a 'double whammy'", "description": "Price declines already predicted for 2020, now COVID-19 brings more uncertainty", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-real-estate-covid-19-1.5501583", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5501792.1584555691!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/house-for-sale-in-n-w-calgary.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 18, 2020 6:30 PM MT", "2020-03-19T03:20:59.486Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Uncharted territory.\u00a0\nThat's how\u00a0long-time Calgary realtor Len Wong responded when asked how the city's real estate industry is going to get through the tumult we're experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Everybody is still in shell-shock mode,\" he said from his Calgary office.\u00a0\nNo one is willing to predict\u00a0how the health crisis is going to affect buyers and sellers or\u00a0prices and inventory.

And things are changing quickly. Only last week there were\u00a0accusations\u00a0that the central bank was scheming to restart the economy on the backs of overborrowed Canadians.\nSuddenly, what seemed like a reasonable concern over the threat of more reckless borrowing has transformed into new worries that the spring property market and the retail sector are crumbling as house hunters and shoppers stay home.\nAnd housing is only one sector\u00a0under assault by a tangle of interdependent consequences of the new coronavirus for which no one had developed strategies. Canada's fossil fuel sector knew there were challenges ahead, but they did not include a sudden plunge in demand followed by a vicious price war.\n\"The macroeconomic backdrop is completely uncharted waters for oil and gas companies,\" said\u00a0Tom Ellacott, vice-president of the energy research company Wood MacKenzie.\nWith no way to know what energy prices for the rest of the year will be, investment plans made a few weeks ago have become meaningless.\nThe caricature of so many of us closeting ourselves with bales of toilet paper and emergency supplies in the safety of our homes applies to investors as well.

Will the shortage of parts we saw when Asian factories closed recur in the U.S., our biggest trading partner, as cases and deaths climb? Will the path of the disease in the U.S. and Canada be staggering like in Italy or mild like in Singapore?\nWill job losses lead to a vicious circle of collapsing demand? How many consumers or businesses will default on loans? Can the consumer confidence that has recently been leading the economy bounce back?\nAnd just as the bizarre quest for too much toilet paper was accelerated by social media feedback, a new round of uncertainty for investors has been caused by investors themselves.\nWhy do markets keep selling off even as experts reassure us stocks will bounce back? Is there something wrong that we don't know and everyone else does? Will the economy and the market structure crack under the strain?\nWith so many questions unanswered, even more rate cuts and a suite of government plans to inject money into the economy at various levels apparently are not enough\u00a0to make that uncertainty go away.

He pointed to a debt forgiveness plan for Prairie farmers during the Great Depression and to bank bailouts around the world during the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn Canada, the aid was in the form of loans which were repaid with interest and the government's purchase of insured mortgage-backed securities from the banks.\nLamont did not provide a price tag for his suggestion, but said there is more than $2 trillion in individual debt held by Canadians, mostly in mortgages. That figure does not include debt held by provinces, which would include $350 billion in Ontario alone.\nLamont said the idea would be to let people, especially low-income earners, have enough of their debt forgiven so that they were no longer in danger of bankruptcy.\n\"You're not talking about necessarily saying, 'Well, you don't have any debt at all.' But sometimes it's about letting people negotiate their debt down to a point where they can afford to pay it.\"\nA retired economics professor at Carleton University said the idea would likely lead to a dramatic rise in inflation.\n\"The only thing the Bank of Canada can really do, when it comes right down to it, is print money,\" said Nick Rowe, who specializes in macro-economics.\n\"If you wanted a way for the Bank of Canada to create a hell of a lot of inflation, this would do it.\"\nA universal program of debt forgiveness would primarily benefit richer people with access to credit \u2014 people to whom the banks have been willing to lend, Rowe added.\n\"If you really wanted to print money and throw it around, at least throw it out fairly. Give everyone the same amount or something, not just according to whether they borrowed or lent risky loans. It's a very bad idea.\"\nLamont said he would like to see debt forgiveness targeted to individuals who need it. Details would have to be worked out.\nHe also countered the idea that his plan would lead to spiralling inflation. Forgiving provincial government debts would ease the financial strain facing government-run energy utilities such as Manitoba Hydro, and that would keep consumer rates down, he suggested.\nLamont has not yet received a response from the prime minister.\nThe Manitoba Liberals hold three seats in the 57-seat legislature.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Here's some of the financial help available in B.C. during the COVID-19 crisis", "description": "This list will be updated as more funds and programs become available ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-financial-help-1.5501743", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5515086.1585594330!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-robson-street.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 18, 2020 3:57 PM PT", "2020-05-04T19:24:32.041Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Many British Columbians are facing a steep loss of income, bills they can't pay and uncertainty about their eventual return\u00a0to work to begin financial recovery as the COVID-19 crisis paralyzes the economy.\nIn response, both the provincial and federal governments have introduced billions in financial help for residents struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic \u2014\u00a0including tax breaks, bill deferrals, wage subsidies and breaks on loan payments.\nThe B.C. government has announced a $5-billion economic action plan to help families and businesses.

Powell and other Fed officials, however, argue that their rate cuts, by lowering borrowing costs on mortgages and other loans, have spurred home sales and boosted the economy.\n\"It now looks increasingly likely that the Fed will move to the sidelines for an extended period,\" Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm, said.\nRecent data suggests that growth remains solid if not spectacular. The economy expanded at a 1.9 per cent\u00a0annual rate in the July-September quarter, down from 3.1 per cent\u00a0in the first three months of the year. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low of 3.6 per cent\u00a0and hiring is strong enough to potentially push the rate even lower.\nInflation, according to the Fed's preferred gauge, is just 1.3 per cent, though it has been held down in recent months by lower energy costs and most Fed officials expect it to move higher in the coming months.\nPowell on Wednesday also urged Congress to lower the federal budget deficit so that lawmakers would have more flexibility to cut taxes or boost spending to counter a future recession.\n\"The federal budget is on an unsustainable path, with high and rising debt,\" Powell said. \"Over time, this outlook could restrain fiscal policymakers' willingness or ability to support economic activity during a downturn.\"\nOther Fed officials have voiced similar concerns. Patrick Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said Tuesday that the large deficit, and the constraints it imposes on Congress in the event of a recession, \"is one of the things I do lose sleep over.\"\nPowell also noted that with the Fed's benchmark rate at historically low levels, the central bank will have less room to manoeuvre whenever the next downturn arrives.\nThe Fed is exploring an alternative policy framework, Powell said, that it hopes will provide more flexibility. In typical recessions, the Fed cuts short-term rates by roughly five\u00a0percentage points.\nPowell's testimony comes after many Fed officials in the past two weeks have voiced support for the Fed's recent moves and expressed confidence in the economy. That contrasts with the Fed's previous meetings when as many as three officials dissented.\nNeel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in an interview on CNBC last week that \"if the economy continues to perform as we expect\" than the Fed is likely done cutting rates. Kashkari is one of the most dovish officials on the Fed's 17-member policymaking committee, though he doesn't have a vote this year.\nJohn Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and several other Fed officials last week said that the three cuts have left the benchmark interest rate low enough to support growth.\nMost analysts forecast that the Fed will hold rates steady when it meets next month. But some economists expect growth will slow in the coming months and the Fed will likely have to cut again next year.\nSal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Economics, says Powell \"stayed true to the patience script\" by indicating that that the Fed's key policy rate is likely to remain unchanged for an extended period unless economic risks increase.\nAndrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said Powell's testimony on Wednesday indicated that a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in December was unlikely. Hunter said he believed Fed officials have been encouraged by more hopeful news on the U.S.-China trade talks.\n"}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "Vancouver keeps crown as Canadian metropolis with highest rents and lowest vacancies", "description": "Property values went down \u2014 but average rents increased higher than inflation ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-cmhc-rental-highest-canada-2020-1.5426911", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4536226.1556073525!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancouver-rental.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 15, 2020 7:00 AM PT", "2020-01-15T18:22:35.896Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When it comes to rental housing, Vancouver is still number one\u00a0\u2014 at least when it comes to prices.\nThe\u00a0Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation annual rental report was issued Wednesday morning, showing the region continues to have the highest rents and lowest vacancies of any Canadian metropolis with at least 500,000 people.\u00a0\nThe vacancy rate for apartments intended for rental in\u00a0Metro Vancouver rose from 1.0 per cent to 1.1 in 2019, while the average rent for two-bedroom units increased from\u00a0$1,649 to $1,748\u00a0\u2014 a six per cent increase from the previous year.\u00a0\nThat's even with more supply.\u00a0The number of condominium apartments in long-term rental increased by an additional\u00a011,118 units\u00a0\u2014 an\u00a018.9 per cent across the region\u00a0\u2014 which a CMHC spokesperson attributed to\u00a0investor-owners increasing their involvement in the long-term rental market.\nThe greater Victoria area had the overall lowest vacancy rate in Canada, while the next most expensive two-bedroom apartments were found in Toronto ($1,562) and Calgary ($1,305).\nVacancy rates for a bachelor unit in Metro Vancouver were 0.7 per cent, 1.0 per cent for a one\u00a0bedroom rental, 1.5 per cent for a two bedroom unit and 1.0 per cent for anything with three or more rooms.\u00a0\nVancouver's rental situation remained relatively static in spite of housing prices dipping across the region, and assessed values decreasing by as much as 15 per cent in the last year.\u00a0\nBut CMHC\u00a0analyst\u00a0Eric Bond said upward pressure on rents remained, in part because the price of buying a home or condo remained out of reach for so many.\u00a0\n\"We have this situation where entry-level home prices remain high relative to local incomes,\" he said. \n\"And so that means many potential homebuyers that face financial barriers to entry into homeownership choose to rent for a longer term, which then contributes to that [rental] demand.\"\nBond added that while there were some regional changes in Metro Vancouver's rental\u00a0market\u00a0\u2014 vacancy rates rising in Vancouver and Surrey, but declining in Burnaby and New Westminster\u00a0\u2014 it was still tight across the board.\n\"There is very strong demand for rental apartment, and that's been supported by population growth, employment growth and continued barriers to entry into homeownership.\"\u00a0\n\"We've got to build more rental housing. That's all we have to do,\" said\u00a0Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart, a point he has repeated since being elected in 2018.\u00a0\nStewart argued it wasn't a given that the region would continue to be the worst in Canada for\u00a0rental prices, but said it was incumbent on some of Metro Vancouver's 20 other municipalities to approve more new rental buildings.\u00a0\n\"We have about 25 percent of the population, but we're providing 40 percent of the rental housing. So I would hope that other municipalities would kind of pick it up a little bit,\" he said.\u00a0\nBut not every municipality takes the same philosophy as Stewart.\n\"There's different attitudes across the region toward housing,\" said North Vancouver District councillor Mathew Bond.\u00a0\nLess than five per cent of housing starts in 2019 in the district were dedicated to rental in 2019, and a majority of councillors\u00a0in 2018 were elected on a platform of slowing down growth.\u00a0\n\"Right now I think we're in a bit of a holding pattern,\" said Bond, adding that it was important to remember that the entire region\u00a0went decades without approving much new rental.\u00a0\n\"It's going to take more than a few approvals every few years to get out of this problem.\"\n"}, {"author": "Clare Hennig", "title": "Businesses in B.C.

Those wage subsidies have yet to be delivered, and the government's been forced to adjust eligibility for the other measures to ensure people who need help can get it.\n\"We tried to be aggressive in getting measures out to support people and recognize that perfect was going to be the enemy of the good.

Those deaths could have been prevented, said Margaret Gillis, president of the International Longevity Centre Canada, which advocates for the human rights of older people.\n\"It wasn't like we were without warning,\" she said in a separate interview on The House. \"There have been issues with long-term care in our country for many years.\"\nThe good news is that the rate of infection appears to be slowing, at least in some parts of the country. That's led\u00a0to calls for\u00a0governments to begin easing some of the restrictions now in place that have slowed the economy to a standstill.\nMorneau said he\u00a0isn't even considering that yet.\nThe finance minister used the word \"crisis\" six times in the interview \u2014 underscoring his pre-occupation with the short-term challenges of assisting people who are struggling financially because of the pandemic.\nWhich explains why Morneau is reluctant to say how long he thinks these programs will need to continue, and why he's unwilling to join the governor of the Bank of Canada, Stephen Poloz, in predicting\u00a0when the economy will rebound.\nPoloz told the Commons finance committee on Thursday that in a best-case scenario, it would take the economy roughly\u00a0a year to regain what it lost. Even then, the recovery is expected to be uneven as resource-intensive sectors await a rebound in other parts of the world.\n\"We are obviously hopeful that the impacts of the crisis are temporary,\" Morneau said. \"What I don't know, what no one can know, is exactly how long that will be.\"\nCaution. Prudence. These are things every finance minister wants to be known for.\u00a0Morneau's not disagreeing with Poloz. He's not agreeing with him either.\n\"Right now, what I'm doing is making sure we don't tell people things we can't know well enough to be sure,\" he said. \"So I don't have enough information at this stage to inform people what exactly the economy will look like in six months or in 12 months.\"\nFor now, Morneau\u00a0said, he'll continue to look at ways to support jobs and carry on refining\u00a0those income support programs for those who can't work.

In the normal course of events the bank tends to make rate changes on the occasions when the governor, Stephen Poloz, holds a media\u00a0conference to explain his actions.\nBut this may well be a time when even the most staid central banker will err on the side of haste.\nAs well as plenty of pressure from\u00a0investors for rate\u00a0cuts as a measure to stop\u00a0stock market declines, OECD\u00a0chief economist Laurence Boone yesterday called on governments, including central banks, to act quickly to prevent damage to the wider economy.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> presents the \ud83c\udf0d economy with its greatest danger since the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FinancialCrisis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FinancialCrisis</a>, raising the risk of:<br><br>\ud83d\udd39 Restrictions on movement (people, goods &amp; services)<br>\ud83d\udd39 Lower business &amp; consumer confidence<br>\ud83d\udd39 Slowing production<br><br>\ud83c\udd95 Interim <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EconomicOutlook?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EconomicOutlook</a> \u27a1\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/Ur8AjvAzzy\">https://t.co/Ur8AjvAzzy</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kD2dWTXQUz\">pic.twitter.com/kD2dWTXQUz</a>\nIn the past, markets have responded to rate cuts with a pop up in share prices, something traders would relish after seven long days of declines. But according to Boone, there is much more at stake.\nIn a new report titled\u00a0Coronavirus: The world economy at risk the Paris-based think-tank laid out some worrying scenarios.\n\"The main question for the economic outlook is how long and how widely the virus will spread, and with it the containment measures,\" said Boone.\nAs others have said, the illness caused by the coronavirus\u00a0is only the indirect cause of economic damage. Instead,\u00a0it is the methods governments have used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 that have led to simultaneous\u00a0supply\u00a0and demand shocks to the economy.\nOn the supply side, a quarantined workforce means factories stop production, an effect that can spread around the world as unique parts become unavailable, leading to a shortage of some goods.\nOn the demand side, inactive factories mean they don't need things like aluminum and copper. Also, people who stay home to avoid the virus cut back on\u00a0purchases like airline tickets, movies and restaurant meals.\nIf the effects were short term, the money not spent now would merely be spent later. But for central bank economists one of the concerns will be that a synchronized decline in supply and demand will mean the economy operates far below capacity. The value that should have been produced by that unused labour and capital is gone for good.\nIt is not a sure thing rate cuts will fix that problem. If someone does not\u00a0want\u00a0to borrow at all, it is not clear lower rates will convince them. Others have worried cuts at this stage, especially by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, will mean it will be almost impossible to lift rates\u00a0again during this\u00a0U.S.\u00a0election year.\nBut there may be worse things to worry about. As Boone described it, there were three scenarios in the OECD analysis, each gloomier than the next. Essentially the 0.5 per cent decline in global growth, which Boone described as \"the base case,\" would occur if the impacts of the disease were largely limited to China.\nBut if COVID-19 and its resulting containment measures were to spread to most of Asia, to Europe and to North America, the decline in global growth would be closer to 1.5 per cent, cutting world growth in half. But that is still not the\u00a0worst of it.\n\"I think what I should stress at this stage is that this is not a worst-case scenario,\" warned Boone.\nThere could be a much bleaker result if the wider coronavirus impact led to dangers such as damage to the financial system\u00a0and a liquidity crisis, where corporate borrowers desperately search for cash and simply cannot find it.\nTo try to avoid the bleakest\u00a0case, the OECD proposes that governments must be prepared to take co-ordinated action including such measures\u00a0as helping\u00a0ordinary people with health-care spending and cash, delaying tax demands on companies and supporting the broader financial system with increased bank liquidity, public investment and cuts in interest rates.\nBoone\u00a0called for a joint statement by governments on those actions that would reassure all the participants in the global economy, leading to a medium-term recovery.\n\"I think that would help, with two years, the recovery of nearly all the losses from the downside scenario,\" she said.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world Wednesday", "description": "B.C. announces plan to ease COVID-19 restrictions, allowing small gatherings", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-covid19-may6-canada-world-1.5557336", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["May 06, 2020 8:34 AM ET", "2020-05-07T00:49:05.262Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The latest:\nOfficials in British Columbia on Wednesday announced plans for the province to reopen, as Premier John Horgan outlined what he called the province's \"restart plan.\"\nAs of next weekend, gatherings with two to six guests will be allowed.

The house has\u00a0insulated concrete walls, triple glazed windows, 44 solar panels\u00a0and a backup rechargeable battery system.\nOn a sub-zero February afternoon it's sending excess electricity back onto the provincial grid in exchange for NB Power credits to be used on the coldest days, or at night when the solar system is asleep.\nBut the three-bedroom, two-bath home stubbornly refuses to sell.\u00a0It has been on and off the real estate market since 2017.\n\"It hasn't moved,\" he said. \"We had a lot of people through it.\"\nStarting out, McLaughlin's asking price was $695,000.\nBy May, 2019 he\u00a0lowered it to $570,000.\nThis week he put the two-storey Quispamsis house back on the market at $495,000.\nMcLaughlin points to mortgage \"stress tests\"\u00a0and indifference from bank-hired appraisers as obstacles pushing buyers away from these higher than average priced homes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHe said\u00a0appraisers hired by lenders to determine the value of homes are at a loss when it comes to this sort of construction.\n\"Around here they just don't know how to value it.\u00a0\u2026They just say, 'Well there's a similar house down the street,'\" he said. \"Well, sure it might look the same but it's a lot different.\"\u00a0\nMcLaughlin\u00a0feels\u00a0the federal government can also be doing a lot more to kick start\u00a0construction of these particular\u00a0homes.\u00a0\nHis first suggestion would be to revamp the mortgage stress test introduced to cool red hot housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto.

homeowners and landlords for energy saving retrofits.\nThe program has yet to be introduced.\nOther efficiency programs are already available to builders and\u00a0buyers in New Brunswick.\nNB Power

recovery\u00a0\u2014 \u00a0a sharp rise back to normal after a sharp decline\u00a0\u2014 are fading fast\u00a0as evidence increases that the global effects of the virus on consumers and businesses are widening.\nBut just as the Bank of Canada is chewing over\u00a0whether to\u00a0cut interest rates tomorrow, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development,\u00a0sometimes described as the rich countries' economic think-tank, insisted yesterday that co-ordinated government action is essential to\u00a0prevent a \"worst-case scenario.\" And its prescription included\u00a0lower rates.\nExpect to see more co-ordinated planning today following a meeting of G7 finance ministers. In keeping with recommendations to\u00a0avoid spreading the virus, the meeting is expected to be by conference call.\nAnd while a V-shaped recovery seems\u00a0off the table, the OECD\u00a0says\u00a0acting to prevent serious financial damage will mean the economy has every chance of bouncing back to very close to expected levels within two\u00a0years. It's a sign of the times that this counts as optimism.\nAs of yesterday, markets were predicting that the Bank of Canada would cut rates by at least one-quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, with a smaller chance of a half-percentage-point cut.\nA rate cut would be unusual but not unprecedented, since the bank is scheduled to make its policy statement with\u00a0a written release only. In the normal course of events the bank tends to make rate changes on the occasions when the governor, Stephen Poloz, holds a media\u00a0conference to explain his actions.\nBut this may well be a time when even the most staid central banker will err on the side of haste.\nAs well as plenty of pressure from\u00a0investors for rate\u00a0cuts as a measure to stop\u00a0stock market declines, OECD\u00a0chief economist Laurence Boone yesterday called on governments, including central banks, to act quickly to prevent damage to the wider economy.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> presents the \ud83c\udf0d economy with its greatest danger since the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FinancialCrisis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FinancialCrisis</a>, raising the risk of:<br><br>\ud83d\udd39 Restrictions on movement (people, goods &amp; services)<br>\ud83d\udd39 Lower business &amp; consumer confidence<br>\ud83d\udd39 Slowing production<br><br>\ud83c\udd95 Interim <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EconomicOutlook?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EconomicOutlook</a> \u27a1\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/Ur8AjvAzzy\">https://t.co/Ur8AjvAzzy</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kD2dWTXQUz\">pic.twitter.com/kD2dWTXQUz</a>\nIn the past, markets have responded to rate cuts with a pop up in share prices, something traders would relish after seven long days of declines. But according to Boone, there is much more at stake.\nIn a new report titled\u00a0Coronavirus: The world economy at risk the Paris-based think-tank laid out some worrying scenarios.\n\"The main question for the economic outlook is how long and how widely the virus will spread, and with it the containment measures,\" said Boone.\nAs others have said, the illness caused by the coronavirus\u00a0is only the indirect cause of economic damage. Instead,\u00a0it is the methods governments have used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 that have led to simultaneous\u00a0supply\u00a0and demand shocks to the economy.\nOn the supply side, a quarantined workforce means factories stop production, an effect that can spread around the world as unique parts become unavailable, leading to a shortage of some goods.\nOn the demand side, inactive factories mean they don't need things like aluminum and copper. Also, people who stay home to avoid the virus cut back on\u00a0purchases like airline tickets, movies and restaurant meals.\nIf the effects were short term, the money not spent now would merely be spent later. But for central bank economists one of the concerns will be that a synchronized decline in supply and demand will mean the economy operates far below capacity. The value that should have been produced by that unused labour and capital is gone for good.\nIt is not a sure thing rate cuts will fix that problem. If someone does not\u00a0want\u00a0to borrow at all, it is not clear lower rates will convince them. Others have worried cuts at this stage, especially by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, will mean it will be almost impossible to lift rates\u00a0again during this\u00a0U.S.\u00a0election year.\nBut there may be worse things to worry about. As Boone described it, there were three scenarios in the OECD analysis, each gloomier than the next. Essentially the 0.5 per cent decline in global growth, which Boone described as \"the base case,\" would occur if the impacts of the disease were largely limited to China.\nBut if COVID-19 and its resulting containment measures were to spread to most of Asia, to Europe and to North America, the decline in global growth would be closer to 1.5 per cent, cutting world growth in half. But that is still not the\u00a0worst of it.\n\"I think what I should stress at this stage is that this is not a worst-case scenario,\" warned Boone.\nThere could be a much bleaker result if the wider coronavirus impact led to dangers such as damage to the financial system\u00a0and a liquidity crisis, where corporate borrowers desperately search for cash and simply cannot find it.\nTo try to avoid the bleakest\u00a0case, the OECD proposes that governments must be prepared to take co-ordinated action including such measures\u00a0as helping\u00a0ordinary people with health-care spending and cash, delaying tax demands on companies and supporting the broader financial system with increased bank liquidity, public investment and cuts in interest rates.\nBoone\u00a0called for a joint statement by governments on those actions that would reassure all the participants in the global economy, leading to a medium-term recovery.\n\"I think that would help, with two years, the recovery of nearly all the losses from the downside scenario,\" she said.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Antoni Nerestant", "title": "Surging rent costs push families to choose between housing and food, says advocate", "description": "The Benedict Labre House says there has been a surge in demand for food baskets in the last year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/surging-rent-costs-driving-demand-for-food-assistance-1.5440795", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5440807.1580071876!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/12.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 27, 2020 5:00 AM ET", "2020-01-27T10:00:00.260Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Benedict Labre House is used to distributing food to people in need, but not like this.\nSince the nearly 70-year-old day centre\u00a0moved from Griffintown to Saint-Henri in 2018, organizers say the demand for its food bank has quadrupled.\u00a0\nThey've gone from handing out 50 food baskets a month to more than 200.\nThe community organization\u00a0even had to set a monthly limit of one basket for each client to make sure everyone would be able to get food.\n\"We would like to be able to give them food every single week, but we just don't have enough,\" said clinical coordinator Francine Nadler.\nNadler says demand isn't just driven by homeless clients.

But the overall inflation rate fell to two per cent in June from 2.4 per cent the previous month, mainly because of a precipitous drop in energy prices compared with this time last year.\nAcross Canada, gasoline prices have fallen by 9.1 per cent over\u00a0the past 12 months, but the price of fuel oil and other fuels has also fallen, by 4.1 per cent over that same period. Natural gas and electricity prices rose a little, but they were offset by much cheaper prices for every other type of energy.\nPart of the reason for cheaper energy is rising inventories in the U.S. are driving down prices, but also, Alberta's scrapping of its carbon tax at the end of May helped cause a one-time drop in energy prices on a year-to-year basis.\nGasoline prices are always a \"swing factor\" in the inflation numbers, Bank of Montreal economist Doug Porter said, which is why most gauges of the actual cost of living tend to strip them out. But with an overall inflation rate of two per cent, \"inflation can't really be described as 'tame' when one drives away from the gas station,\" he said.\nEnergy prices have fallen in every province, from a big drop of 12.7 per cent in Alberta\u00a0to 3.6 per cent in Ontario, over the past 12 months.\nA few other small categories saw prices decline in the past year, including internet services, digital equipment and traveller accommodation.\nBut big jumps in the price of most other things more than offset those modest declines. A huge\u00a017.3 per cent increase in the cost of fresh vegetables was among the biggest factors to the upside. Fresh vegetables saw their biggest price acceleration since January 2016, and the data agency said bad weather in farming regions was a big factor in that jump.\nThe inflation rate is one of the biggest\u00a0data points\u00a0that the Bank of Canada looks at in setting its interest rate policy. The central bank adjusts its interest rate to nudge inflation into a\u00a0range of between one and three per cent.\nAll things being equal, if it\u00a0deems inflation is too high, the central bank will raise its rate to cool the economy.

On the other end, some Fed officials argued for no rate cut at all, believing that the economy was beginning to improve after a soft patch in the spring.\nThe minutes did not indicate any consensus on the pace of future cuts.\nFinancial markets have been turbulent since the July 31 rate cut, diving 800 points one day last week on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as bad news has piled up in terms of the slowing global economy and the latest developments in President Donald Trump's trade war with China.\nBecause of these developments, investors have become convinced the central bank will follow up the July rate cut with further cuts at coming meetings. But private economists are not so sure, believing the Fed may want to save some of its rate cut ammunition should the economy take a serious turn for the worse with the possibility of a recession.\nThe minutes provided little clarity on what the future course for rates will be, but markets are hoping that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may send a stronger signal about future rate hikes when he delivers the keynote address at the Fed's annual policy conference at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday.\n\"There is little sign that the Fed is willing to push back on the markets,\" said Michael Pearce, senior economist at Capital Economics. \"As such, another (quarter-point) cut in September still looks like a good bet, if only because the Fed will not want to disappoint lofty market expectations.\"\nThe two Fed officials who argued for a bigger rate cut \"favoured a stronger action to better address the stubbornly low inflation rates of the past several years,\" the minutes said.\nThe July action was approved on an 8-2 vote with Esther George, president of the Fed's Kansas City regional bank, and Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, dissenting and arguing that they favoured no rate cut at all.\nThe minutes said the majority view supported a quarter-point cut, viewing it as a \"mid-cycle adjustment,\" a phrase Powell used in his press conference that caused an adverse market reaction by investors hoping the July cut will be the first in a series of rate reductions.\nThe minutes highlighted three main reasons for the cut, including recent signs of deceleration of the economy and concerns about persistently low inflation. Officials also believed a rate cut would be a \"prudent step from a risk-management perspective.\"\nThe minutes said the Fed was worried about a slowdown in business investment and the global headwinds that are affecting Europe, Japan and other regions.\n\"Participants were mindful that trade tensions were far from settled and that trade uncertainties could intensify again,\" the minutes said.\nOn Aug. 1, the day after the Fed's rate cut, Trump announced that he would impose 10 per cent tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese imports in an effort to force the Chinese to make more trade concessions at the bargaining table. Since that announcement, Trump has said he would postpone about half of those tariffs until Dec. 15 to avoid hurting American consumers during the holiday shopping season.\nBut economists are warning that the tariffs already imposed will likely slow U.S. growth in coming quarters.\n"}, {"author": "Samanda Brace", "title": "Vacancy rate on the rise in Regina, so why isn't the cost of rent going down?", "description": "Some residents struggle to afford rent in Regina despite oversupply", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/vacancy-rate-up-but-so-is-rent-1.5304215", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5146801.1569956660!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-rent-sign-regina-sask-stock-rental-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 08, 2019 5:00 AM CT", "2019-10-08T11:00:00.972Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Jayleen Missens waits\u00a0outside a downtown Regina apartment building with her son and a YWCA employee on a Thursday afternoon.\nThis is the third apartment she has viewed in her search for a place to live.

Newly constructed units have outpaced demand for rent, nudging Regina's vacancy rate from 7 per cent to 7.7 per cent.\nThis elevated vacancy rate has pushed landlords and property managers of older units to lower their rents as they try to compete with new rentals.\nThe CMHC report breaks down what happens if\u00a0you remove newly constructed buildings from the equation.

When a property owner tells him they need a $1,000 to cover their bottom line, he urges them to come down to $900 in order to stay competitive.\u00a0\n\"It's just one of those things that you have to do. It's better to lose $100\u00a0than it is to lose the whole $1,000,\" said Schlechter.\nHe says he and other landlords are in the red for their properties right now.

Their contempt for amateurs \u2014 columnists with broad audiences, for example \u2014 would sear the lungs if inhaled.\nSo, because criticism just makes me feel so terrible, let me phrase a whole set of nagging worries as questions. Can we agree there are no stupid questions? Probably not. But let's try anyway.\nQuestion No. 1: How in heaven's name did we arrive in a world where you must pay someone to borrow your money, and what does that mean to the punters? Like, um, me?\nAt the moment, there is more than $14 trillion US in negative-yielding debt extant in the world, meaning money is not just cheap, it's on sale at a loss.\u00a0\nLet's put that sum in perspective: Canada's GDP in 2018 \u2013 the entire economic output of a G7 country \u2013 was about $1.7 trillion US. Fourteen trill is a huge chunk of global wealth.\nGovernments, many of them European, are actually offering \u2014 and investors are buying \u2014 bonds that are worth less at the end of five or 10 or even 30 years than their purchase price.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd a bank in Denmark\u00a0is now offering\u00a0a negative-yield mortgage. Jyske Bank will lend customers a ten-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of -0.5%, which means those borrowers will actually pay back less than they borrowed.\nAs for the punters, some have pensions, private and public, which, if this trend continues, will be forced to severely reduce their payouts. Some have RRSPs and other savings, which are subject to the same market forces. The expectation my generation was raised on was that prudence and parsimony would result in a nest egg later in life, which someone would pay to borrow, which would help fund your retirement. Now, apparently, we will have to pay someone to \"hold\" our money for us.\nBloomberg, the financial news agency, moved an explainer piece on all this last week, which suggested that this is all perfectly normal.\u00a0\nRelatively flat economic growth in the developed world, explained the explainer, combined with ever-increasing concentration of wealth, has left rich people and companies sitting on vast piles of cash for which there is weak demand.\u00a0\nThe rules of economics being what they are, theorized the author, it only makes sense that financial institutions would begin charging to store this surplus money. After all, if you own something really expensive, don't you have to pay to store it safely? A safety deposit box costs money, doesn't it?\nWhat the explainer avoided was where a lot of this money came from in the first place. Which brings us to Question No. 2: Governments have printed unimaginable amounts of money, inflating the money supply, since 2008. That must have consequences for the punters, right?\nIn early 2008, before the criminal greed of America's mortgage and investment bank industry nearly destroyed the world's economy, the balance sheet of the U.S. Federal Reserve stood at about $870 billion.\n(Speaking of 2008, there is no better example of economists being wrong. Larry Summers and Alan Greenspan, two economists who rose to manage much of the American economy, not only didn't see the subprime crisis coming, they both fought successfully against regulation of derivatives, which are essentially bets on the rise and fall of asset values. Wall Street's creation of ever more insane derivatives basically caused the meltdown while regulators looked the other way.)\nBen Bernanke launches blog defending actions as Fed chief\nLessons from the 2008 recession\nThen-Fed chair Ben Bernanke and his fellow governors, desperate to avert complete disaster, plugged in the money-printing machine (actually, money printing is done electronically, with a few computer keystrokes).\u00a0\nThe Fed balance sheet is now at nearly $4 trillion.\nThe European Central Bank began printing money in 2015: $2.6 trillion Euros over four years, or about 7,600 Euros for every person in the currency bloc. Japan, the UK and Switzerland have all done the same in differing amounts. The technical term for it is \"quantitative easing.\"\nThe central banks have used the oceans of new money to buy bonds from their own debt-addicted governments, with the intended result of lowering the cost of borrowing and encouraging risk-taking, which is at least one explanation for the nosebleed stock market levels nowadays, and the staggering levels of household debt here and in the U.S.\nBut there is serious pressure to do even more. Which brings us to Question Number Three: Winter is coming, and so is another recession. It is inevitable; 10 years have passed since the last one. What will we do this time? And\u2026the punters.\nOne thing central banks won't be able to do this time is lower interest rates significantly. As negative rates are already here. U.S. President Donald Trump, judging by his weekly rants about the incompetence of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump appointed, seems to think monetary policy should be in the hands of politicians like him. (Now that would be a confidence-inspiring move, wouldn't it?). Trump thinks cutting U.S. interest rates even further is just the ticket.\n....proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much (and that I was right!). They must Cut Rates bigger and faster, and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening NOW. Yield curve is at too wide a margin, and no inflation! Incompetence is a.....\nOther politicians, on the left, are promoting Modern Monetary Theory, which posits that governments can print unlimited amounts of money without inflationary consequences. Some even want central banks to just start sending cheques to every household.\n(Actually, Trump is right over there with the leftists, if you think about it: pro-spending, pro-debt, and pushing for even looser monetary policy).\nAnd of course the central banks are increasingly shackled by the fact that citizens and governments owe so very much; at this point, having helped create this mess to save us all from the earlier mess, they haven't much choice but to leave interest rates where they are for many years to come.\nThis much is absolutely true: we are in unknown territory, out past the \"here be monsters\" sign. None of us has any idea how this will turn out, economists included. As we saw in 2008, the collateral damage when things start to go badly can be devastating.

She says that it's been hard, as most places prefer tenants without children, and her budget is tight.\nShe relies on social assistance and has only $711 she can spend on rent.\n\"I can't find a place outside of North Central, where I don't want to go back to because I'm a recovering meth addict, and I don't want to go back to where I would use a lot, and it's just hard for me right now,\" said Missens.\nShe says she would like to find a place downtown where she would have access to services like those offered at the YWCA.\n5 new emergency homes available for Regina families\n'Long time coming': YWCA propose $35M building in Cathedral\nSoaring rents and house prices in Canadian cities make housing a key election issue\nLiving on your own can make finding an affordable rental unit in the city a struggle.\nMatthew Gagon finds Regina's rental market expensive. He says he needs a roommate to help split the cost of rent.\n\"That's pretty much the only way you can really get by,\" he said.\nAccording to the latest statistics from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Regina was $1,130 in October 2018, compared to $1,116 in October 2017.\u00a0\nThis is mainly due to an abundance of newly constructed rental units that tend to charge more than older units. Newly constructed units have outpaced demand for rent, nudging Regina's vacancy rate from 7 per cent to 7.7 per cent.\nThis elevated vacancy rate has pushed landlords and property managers of older units to lower their rents as they try to compete with new rentals.\nThe CMHC report breaks down what happens if\u00a0you remove newly constructed buildings from the equation. If you compare the same units from 2017 to 2018 \u2014 without new\u00a0buildings\u00a0\u2014 rent for a two-bedroom apartment declined by 0.5 per cent, according to the report.\nShawn Schlechter, owner of Shawn's Property Management, says he has never seen a vacancy rate this high in his 20 years in the business.\nHe says his main goal is to get tenants in the door. When a property owner tells him they need a $1,000 to cover their bottom line, he urges them to come down to $900 in order to stay competitive.\u00a0\n\"It's just one of those things that you have to do. It's better to lose $100\u00a0than it is to lose the whole $1,000,\" said Schlechter.\nHe says he and other landlords are in the red for their properties right now. Some of his homes have been sitting vacant for six months.\nSchlechter predicts it will only get worse in the colder months as fewer\u00a0people are looking to move.\nWhen looking to price properties, Trina Maguire, property manager with Charan Property Management, says it can be hard to convince an owner to take a loss on their property.\nShe says landlords are hesitant to lower rent to match the market, so instead\u00a0she offers incentives to attract tenants.\u00a0\nIncentives range from a free month's rent to free internet for four months.\n\"I mean we're kind of hand-in-hand with like Calgary and Edmonton, and those are a lot bigger cities and I feel that [the Regina market] is a little bit top-heavy,\" she said.\nMayor Michael Fougere \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bsaid the City of Regina offers tax exemption programs and capital grants to encourage affordable housing and prevent homelessness.\nWhen it comes to\u00a0market rents, though, Fougere agrees prices are\u00a0high in Regina.\n\"We have one of the fastest growing cities in Canada for international immigration and yet we still have an oversupply and rents are not going down,\" he said.\nAt the same time, it's not the role of the city to intervene, he said.\n\"You would think that rates would go down to try to drive people to take those units up, so there's got to be a market correction at some point.\"\nThe next CMHC report will be released later this fall.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Federal Reserve still thinks rate hikes are possible, minutes show", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fed-interest-rates-1.5145262", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5016300.1550007068!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/federal-reserve-powell.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 22, 2019 2:32 PM ET", "2019-05-23T13:26:32.199Z"], "source": null, "content": "Federal Reserve officials at their recent meeting believed the central bank could remain \"patient\" in deciding when to adjust interest rates, though some officials thought future rate hikes might still be needed.\nIn minutes of the April 30-May 1 discussions released Wednesday, Fed officials noted that prospects for the U.S. and global economy had been improving, while inflation had fallen farther below the Fed's two per cent\u00a0target.\nFinancial markets and President Donald Trump are hoping that the central bank will start cutting rates soon to bolster growth further. The Fed minutes, however, indicated little sentiment for rate cuts.\nInstead, the minutes revealed \"a few\" participants say they thought more rate increases might be needed to keep low unemployment from triggering unwanted inflation.\n\"While some investors are betting that the Federal Reserve will be cutting rates by the end of this year, there's not a lot in the minutes ... to support that case,\" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com. \"Borrowers and savers should largely expect the status quo for rates at least in the near-term.\"\nAt its last meeting, the Fed kept its key policy rate unchanged in a range of 2.25 per cent\u00a0to 2.5 per cent, where it has been since the Fed hiked rates for a fourth time last year.\nThat December rate boost contributed to a nosedive in financial markets as investors began to worry that the central bank was in danger of over-doing its credit tightening and could send the country into a recession.\nLeading the criticism was Trump, who labeled the Fed his \"biggest threat\" and attacked Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials for not understanding financial markets.\nIn January, the Fed did an about-face in response to a worsening global outlook and other risks to growth and began signalling they would be \"patient\" in changing interest rates. While they had projected in December two more rate hikes this year, they now expect to hold steady for the year.\nHowever, Trump has complained that the Fed needs to go further to support the economy by cutting rates and restarting a program to buy bonds to put downward pressure on long-term rates. In contrast, the Fed has been trimming its bond holdings although it has announced these reductions will come to an end later this year.\nThe minutes did not reveal support for the type of dramatic credit easing suggested by Trump. But there was discussion among Fed officials about the fact that inflation this year has moved further below the Fed's two per cent\u00a0target.\n\"In light of recent, softer inflation readings, some (Fed officials) viewed the downside risks to inflation as having increased,\" the minutes said.\nBut the minutes said that Fed officials still believed a return of inflation to the Fed's two per cent\u00a0target was \"the most likely outcome.\"\nAt his May 1 press conference, Powell said Fed officials believed the recent slowdown in inflation was likely due to transitory issues, with inflation in coming months resuming its climb toward the Fed's target.\nThe minutes, which were released with the customary three-week delay, cover the discussions among Fed board members and the Fed's 12 regional bank presidents who make up the central bank panel that sets interest rates.\nThere are currently two vacancies on the seven-member board. The White House has resumed the search for candidates for those two spots, after former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain and conservative commentator Stephen Moore withdrew from consideration.\nOne person who has been approached is conservative economist Judy Shelton, a long-time critic of the Fed who in the past had advocated the country return to the gold standard.\nInterviewed Wednesday by CNBC, Shelton said she felt \"this is a pivotal moment for the Federal Reserve.\"\nShe said she believed the central bank needed to change its approach for setting its key benchmark rate back to past practices and get away from the current process of setting the rate by paying banks to hold excess reserves. She said the current method discourages banks from making more loans when they can earn a risk-free return on their reserves.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian inflation 1.9% in September as lower gas prices keep rate steady", "description": "Rate held at 1.9% for second straight month, close to Bank of Canada's ideal target of 2%", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-september-inflation-rate-1.5322468", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322474.1571232923!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancovuer-gas-20190717.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 16, 2019 9:41 AM ET", "2019-10-16T13:41:16.543Z"], "source": null, "content": "The annual inflation rate was 1.9 per cent in September for a second-straight month, keeping the indicator close to the Bank of Canada's ideal two per cent target.\nThe new numbers released Wednesday in Statistics Canada's latest consumer price index report show that price growth was once again held back by lower gas prices.\nInflation has now stayed at 1.9 per cent or higher for seven consecutive months.\nEconomists on average had expected a reading of 2.1 per cent for September, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\nThe country's price picture, on its own, is not applying pressure on the inflation-targeting Bank of Canada to adjust interest rates.

Their rooms and meals are paid for by\u00a0B.C. Emergency Support Services.\u00a0\nIn situations like this, provincial emergency support normally lasts 72 hours \u2014 enough time for those impacted to find friends or family to stay with or for their insurance to kick in. But few of the building's tenants had renters insurance or a place to go after the fire.\nThe province extended the emergency coverage by two weeks to April 22\u00a0in recognition that allowing 90 people to become homeless in the middle of the COVID-19 health crisis would run counter to their public health objectives. But after that Johnson and his neighbours would be on their own and likely out in the street.\n\"We are scared as heck,\" said Johnson on the morning of April 20. \"There are elderly people, women and single mothers, people who have weakened immune systems.\"\nThat evening,\u00a0the province extended their emergency support again, this time to April 25,\u00a0and the City of Campbell River agreed to pay to keep the residents housed until April 30. What will happen after that is unclear.\nFinding a home in Campbell River is no easy task at the best of times.\nAccording to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the vacancy rate was just 0.4 per cent in 2019 \u2014 the lowest on Vancouver Island. Adding to the challenges, Johnson says tenants like him who lived at 645 9th Avenue are stigmatized.\n\"I'm not going to sugar coat nothing. Everybody thinks everyone in this building is nothing but drug addicts, alcoholics, and bums,\" he said.\nJohnson, who works seasonally as a fisherman, is adamant that characterization is unfair and untrue, adding that it is the same stereotype First Nations people are often saddled with. Johnson along with roughly 75 per cent of the building's inhabitants are Indigenous.\nThe building's reputation is something Donna Brautigam has struggled with as well.

That means Cerka has to overcome some significant barriers.\u00a0\nThe clock starts ticking the moment refugees land at the airport. Cerka has 14 calendar days to find them a place. That's how long people can stay in transitional housing at Welcome Place, run by MIIC.\u00a0\n\u00a0\"The most difficult part is the budget issue,\" said Cerka. \"The money they get,\u00a0it's not enough.\"\nCanadian Immigration and Citizenship provides funding for government sponsored refugees with money for rent. How much they get is determined by the size of the family and the age of the children.\u00a0\nThe family of seven, with two adults and five kids under 18, will receive $1,060 a month for rent and utilities. According to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the average price of a three bedroom apartment in Winnipeg was $1,446 in 2018.\n\"I know those are the rates that are set, but they don't match reality,\" said Cerka.\u00a0\nCerka has learned to be a good negotiator. She is constantly asking landlords to lower the rent, to accommodate large families, and to rent to people who have no guarantor, no credit or rental history in Canada.\nShe knows that some landlords have strict regulations around siblings of different genders and different age groups sharing bedrooms. She doesn't call them if she is working with a large family, so Winnipeg's 2.9 per cent\u00a0vacancy rate shrinks even lower.\u00a0\nThen there are the bugs.\nCockroaches, bed bugs, mice infestations, Cerka sees them all in her search for affordable housing. She works with landlords to deal with these problems before she lets families sign leases.\n\"I ask myself,\u00a0'Can I live there with my son?'\" said Cerka. \"If my family can't live there, why can they?\"\u00a0\nCerka identifies with her clients because she arrived in Canada as a refugee herself. She fled Albania for Yugoslavia, where she lived in a refugee camp and gave birth to her son. Then war broke out and she fled again, this time arriving in Winnipeg in 1993 with her seven-month-old baby.\n\"I didn't have to suffer that much because the rental rates were not this high,\" said Cerka. She took the first apartment settlement workers showed her. They moved to a cheaper place the following year while she went to school and worked.\u00a0\nAfter becoming a single mother in 1997, Cerka worked four jobs in order to buy a small house. She remembers carrying her sleeping child to the car at 3 a.m. so she could deliver newspapers before starting her day job at Welcome Place. Evenings and weekends were spent working as a waitress.\nCerka cries every time she tells her story. She feels guilty for not spending more time with her son when he was young. It's something they've talked about.\n\"I said, 'I hope you don't hate me, and I hope you realize that what I did, I did it for you because [the] home we have, it's going to be yours.'\" said Cerka. Her son reassured her that he is grateful for all of her sacrifices.\nBack in her office,\u00a0Cerka congratulates two clients, brothers, who are moving into a two bedroom unit on the upper floor of a duplex. If they pool their rent money, $695 each, they can afford the $900 rent and utilities.\u00a0\n\"They're happy! They like it,\" said Cerka. \"They're moving before the 14 days, so that's perfect.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nCerka and her staff have found housing for 180 people so far this year, including 59 families. Cerka celebrates each success.\n\"Looking at these people it's like I'm looking at myself, what I was when I came here,\" said Cerka. \"l needed this help, and these people need this help, so I have to do it. It's a responsibility.\"\nThen she picks up the phone again, still on the search for a place for the family of seven\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the ones who will arrive after them.\n"}, {"author": "Nick Boisvert", "title": "Toronto must be 'brave' and enact bold new zoning laws to confront housing crisis, advocates say", "description": "Detached houses are all the city allows on more than a third of residential land", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-missing-middle-housing-plan-1.5495690", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5495737.1584043426!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/1351.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 15, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-15T08:00:00.424Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "People in the urban planning and real estate industries say Toronto must introduce significant changes to zoning regulations if it wants to combat the ongoing housing crisis.\nThe calls come while Toronto's\u00a0planning department works on a new report that could pave the way for a wider variety of homes and increased density in neighbourhoods across the city.\nThe study, which was requested by city council in 2019, was to look at\u00a0\"expanding housing options\" in parts of the city officially designated as neighbourhoods.\u00a0The report\u00a0is scheduled to be released and sent to city councillors in the spring.\nHowever, some skeptics are concerned the changes may fall short of seriously confronting Toronto's housing woes.\n\"We actually need to be brave,\" said Naama Blonder, an architect at the firm Smart Density.\n\"This whole notion of protecting neighbourhoods is something that belongs to the past. This is a conversation that they should have stopped having in the 70s,\" she said.\nNeighbourhood zones account for more than 35 per cent of Toronto's land, but only detached homes are permitted in them. Buildings such as townhouses and low-rise walk-ups are currently only allowed in areas designated as apartment or mixed-use areas.\nThose housing types are often referred to as the \"missing middle,\" which can refer to any type of home that falls somewhere between large detached houses and small high-rise condos.\nBlonder says the construction and zoning rules in areas designated as neighbourhoods must be loosened if Toronto wants to improve access to housing and prepare itself for an expected population boom.\nAt the moment, she says those restrictions are preventing the city from creating densely populated areas, especially in neighbourhoods with close access to public transit. In those areas, the \"missing middle\" may need to include apartment buildings up to six storeys, she added.\n\"It will actually open up more possibilities,\" said real estate broker Kevin Yu on the prospect of updated zoning rules.\n\"Instead of going for a condo in a big building, this might be the next step up, that middle ground.\"\nToronto's chief planner Gregg Lintern says the city is already working on new strategies to increase density, though he also notes\u00a0the city's desire to preserve the characteristics of its neighbourhoods.\n\"That's a lot of land and we're looking at ways to see how we can gently increase the housing choice and options in those parts of the city, without changing fundamentally the way those neighbourhoods look and feel,\" Lintern said in\u00a0his office at Toronto city hall.\nLast weekend, Lintern and his staff at the city planning department went door-knocking in Toronto's east end, where they asked residents how they felt about increased density in their neighbourhoods.\nPlanners on the porch Saturday as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CityPlanTO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CityPlanTO</a> will be out knocking on doors in the east end asking about what people are feeling about housing choice in low rise neighbourhoods <a href=\"https://t.co/fAcymq6vbl\">pic.twitter.com/fAcymq6vbl</a>\nHe says\u00a0the response was generally positive, and that most residents appreciate the city's concerns around affordability and access to housing.\nBut he acknowledges\u00a0that bringing on major change may be a difficult sell to some. \"I think you're going to get people concerned about the character of their neighbourhood,\" he said.\nLintern also pointed to recent policy changes such as the permission of more secondary basement suites and laneway housing as evidence that Toronto is already working to improve housing options and affordability in the city.\nToronto has approved the construction of 60 laneway suites, he says.\u00a0Zoning updates have also allowed homeowners to add around 2,500 secondary suites in neighbourhood zones within the past six years.\n\"I think you gradually grow the acceptance for neighbourhoods being a place where we can introduce new housing options without changing the way that people fundamentally feel about their neighbourhood,\" Lintern added.\nYu, who has recently found a niche selling homes with secondary basement suites, says\u00a0prospective homeowners would benefit greatly from a larger menu of housing options.\nThe introduction of more density could also drive down costs and improve vacancy rates in the city's rental market, Yu\u00a0says.\n\"I'd probably have a bunch of clients that would be 100 per cent interested because this will actually help them get into homes.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jamie Malbeuf", "title": "Soaring condo insurance rates help push Fort McMurray homeowner into bankruptcy", "description": "'There's not anything we can do anymore,' Kaleena Carriere says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/fort-mcmurray-bankruptcy-condo-insurance-1.5393448", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5393453.1576115316!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/kaleena-carriere.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 15, 2019 6:00 AM MT", "2019-12-16T03:27:34.127Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A woman says she walked away from her Fort McMurray condo after skyrocketing insurance costs became \"the final straw\" in her battle to keep the home.\nKaleena Carriere, 31, bought her townhouse-style condo in April 2014.

In a Facebook post, Carriere said she stopped making payments on her home and \"accepted that the bank was going to take it from me.\"\n\"I didn't believe it,\" Carriere told CBC. \"I cried when I came to the realization that this was happening.\"\nCarriere said she considered selling the condo, but figures she would have ended up deep in debt.\nShe had paid $350,000 for the home but believes it is now worth less than $200,000 because of declining property values in Fort McMurray.\nIn a statement of claim, her bank alleges she still owed $278,000 on her mortgage when she stopped making payments.\nIn Alberta, condominium boards must carry insurance on all units and common property against loss resulting from destruction or damage caused by fire, lightning, windstorms, hail, explosions, water damage and other perils. The coverage must be for replacement cost value. Owners pay the insurance costs through their condo fees.\u00a0\nThe Cedarwoods condo board was offered $10 million of coverage, even though the appraised value of the 156-townhome complex was $65 million. That's despite the insurance premium of $925,000.\nIn 2018, the board had been able to get\u00a0insurance coverage for the full property appraisal at a cost of $142,000.\nDan Edwards, vice-chair of the Cedarwoods condo board, said the board got only one insurance offer and had to take it, in an effort to comply with the Alberta Condominium Property Act.\n\"You have to accept it whether you like it or not,\" said Edwards, who owns a condo in the complex. \"I can't make an insurance company offer me insurance.\n\"No one wanted to pay this.\"\nEdwards said if there's a disaster that destroys everyone's property, the board doesn't have enough coverage to rebuild and everyone \"will likely be out on the street.\"\n\"We don't understand what's going on. We're all hurt by this,\" he said.\nHe's not sure what the legal ramifications of not having enough coverage are because this is \"uncharted territory,\" he said.\nEdwards said the board is still working with a lawyer and trying to come up with a solution to get full coverage at a reasonable price.\nEdmonton lawyer Robert Noce said owners of Cedarwoods condos should be worried.\nThe condo board's decision to accept insurance coverage that only accounts for one sixth of the appraised value is so uncommon that he's never heard of it happening before, Noce said.\n\"It's impossible to think that an insurer would only insure a portion of that, knowing full well that the value of the property is significantly higher,\" Noce said. \"I can't think of any board, individual board members, that would be so negligent and expose themselves to personal liability by making such a decision.\"\nOwners and the condo board should immediately seek legal advice, he said.\n\"I would truly hope that that particular condominium corporation has sought legal advice to protect them from what will inevitably be exposure at a personal level of the board members if they can't get this issue resolved.\"\nIn October, Wood Buffalo councillors voted to lobby the provincial and federal governments in an attempt to ensure that condo boards are able to secure complete, affordable insurance coverage.\nAdam Hardiman, spokesperson for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, confirmed the municipality sent letters to members of Parliament, local MLAs and the prime minister's office, among others.\u00a0\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Mayor Don Scott said the lack of affordable condo insurance options is quickly becoming a crisis\u00a0that will affect other parts of Canada, \"particularly those that have experienced flooding or wildfire.\"\nRob de Pruis, director of consumer and industry relations with the Insurance Bureau of Canada, said in an email that IBC is still talking to insurance companies and government about solutions for condo insurance.\n\"We understand the seriousness of this issue and we are doing everything we can to address individual circumstances,\" de Pruis said.\nThe government says it's still working with insurance providers about the issue, and Finance Minister Travis Toews has \"asked industry to work to find solutions for condominium owners in the region,\" Service Alberta representative Tricia Velthuizen said in an emailed statement.\nCarriere said it's unlikely she'll be able to buy a house again for years. She received an outpouring of support after posting about her bankruptcy on Facebook. She said dozens of people told her they were going through the same thing.\n\"There needs to be some sort of cap on insurance for housing,\" Carriere said. \"There needs to be some regulation or something from the government that stops this from happening, because it's not just me.\n\"There's tons of my friends \u2026 tons of my neighbours. It saddens me that it's not as public as it should be.\"\n"}, {"author": "Elias Abboud", "title": "Montreal to publish names of delinquent landlords in bid to improve rental availability", "description": "With rental vacancy rate at lowest in 15 years, city says release of data will prod landlords to make repairs", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/rental-inspection-reports-public-1.5213259", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5451719.1580846820!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/maxime-roy-allard.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 06, 2020 6:27 PM ET", "2020-02-06T23:27:33.131Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The City of Montreal is making public the names of delinquent landlords and other housing data in the hope that landlords will repair shoddy housing and improve the city's shrinking rental stock.\nThe city is releasing information on its housing office's health inspections of rental units and publishing the list of landlords who have been found guilty of an infraction and fined.\n\"It is, of course, reasonable to believe that the publication of those lists of those people in violation of the bylaw will have \u2026 a deterrent effect on any tempted to disregard those rules in the future,\" said Craig Sauv\u00e9, Montreal's associate councillor responsible for housing.\nMontreal's vacancy rate is the lowest it's been in 15 years, pegged by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation at 1.5 per cent in 2019, compared to 1.9 per cent in 2018.\nThursday's release of housing data is the fourth such release by the Projet Montr\u00e9al administration \u2014 all aimed at encouraging certain building owners to repair their rental units and putting more apartments on the market.\nPrevious releases of data included reports of bed bug complaints to exterminators, notices of deterioration and the results of high-priority inspection indicators, which provide a portrait of the health of Montreal's rental stock.\n\"In the short term, [the data release] is not something that's going to help a renter looking for a home,\" said Coun. Robert Beaudry, the executive committee member responsible for housing.\u00a0\nHowever, Beaudry says, in order to act, you need information, so taken with other measures, making this data public will help.\n\"The city \u2026 can share it with all of its partners, such as housing committees, and with our community partners, who can work to interpret the information and propose new initiatives,\" he said.\nHousing advocate Maxime Roy-Allard likes what the Projet Montr\u00e9al administration is doing, but he's not sure the measures will make a huge difference for now. He says hiring more housing inspectors will speed things up.\n\"It will reduce the waits for files to be done so that tenants can put forward their files at the rental board and to fight back against their landlord to get them to fix their apartment and actually to get money back if the landlord didn't respect his obligation,\" said Roy-Allard.\nSauv\u00e9 said the city is actually increasing the number of housing inspections it does.\nHe said the city and boroughs have carried out more than 15,000 inspections in the first two years of Montreal's action plan on housing, almost halfway to the administration's stated\u00a0 goal 31,200 inspections during its mandate.\nIn a tight rental market, Sauv\u00e9 advises people looking for a new place to make sure they sign a new lease before giving up the lease of the place they're living in now.

At the end of August, Statistics Canada reported that Canada's economy expanded for the fourth month in a row in June, with 17 of the 20 industries that the\u00a0data agency tracks growing.\nWhat's more, from April to June, Canada's economy grew at a 3.7 per cent annual pace. That's better than what economists were expecting, and the fastest pace in more than two years.\nThe majority of Canadians say they have to think about money, but they're getting by. Just over one in 10 say they are not getting by.\nCanada's jobless rate remained at 5.7 per cent for a second month in September, as the economy added 81,100 net new positions, the bulk of which were part time, in the services sector and picked up by young people.\n\"Stepping back from the monthly swings, the trend remains healthy \u2014 a 30,000 average pace of hiring over the last six months is healthy by any measure,\" Brian DePratto, a senior economist with TD Economics, told CBC News.\nWages in Canada are also on the rise after a long period of stagnation. In\u00a0 August, Statistics Canada reported that wages increased by 4.5 per cent in the past 12 months, the fastest annual pace in a decade.\nDefinitely. For every dollar Canadians earn, they owe about $1.77.\nThere is some good news. In the first quarter of 2019, Canadians took on less credit\u00a0debt.\nBut their total debt levels \u2014 including mortgages, credit card debt, and all other forms of personal debt \u2014 continue to grow.\nThe Bank of Canada left its central rate unchanged in September for the seventh cycle in a row. It sits at 1.75 per cent.\n\"Canada's economy is operating close to potential and inflation is on target,\" the bank said. \"However, escalating trade conflicts and related uncertainty are taking a toll on the global and Canadian economies.\"\nIn short, the bank\u00a0will adjust if necessary,\u00a0cutting its rate if it feels it needs to to stimulate the economy\u00a0and\u00a0raising it in order to tame inflation.\nEconomists and other market watchers are split on whether a rate cut is coming this fall.\nThe last time there was a rate change was in October 2018, when it was increased by 0.25 per cent.\nAccording to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the housing market is actually doing a little better today than it had been for the past two years or so.\nThe CMHC says there's little evidence of widespread overheating, price acceleration\u00a0or overbuilding. But there's enough overvaluation to warrant a yellow flag, indicating a \"moderate\" level of vulnerability.\nAs usual, there are a few regions that raise some concern. Regina was given a red warning for overbuilding, while Victoria, Hamilton and Toronto's markets were given a\u00a0red \u2014\u00a0or \"high\"\u00a0\u2014 overall.\nAccording to a study released in July,\u00a0the answer is overwhelmingly no. The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) used data from Statistics Canada and the CMHC\u00a0to evaluate\u00a0almost 800 neighbourhoods across Canada's three dozen largest cities.\nIt concluded that a minimum wage earner could afford a one- or two-bedroom apartment in just 24 neighbourhoods across the country, out of 795 analyzed.\nIt will come as no surprise to hear that it is most expensive to rent in the biggest cities:\u00a0Toronto and Vancouver.\u00a0\nThe CCPA study found only three cities where the local minimum wage would be enough to comfortably afford a one- or two-bedroom apartment and have enough left over for other expenses (about two-thirds of earnings), if working 40 hours a week.\nAll are in Quebec: Sherbrooke, Saguenay and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.\nThis recent episode from Marketplace looks into the vast discrepancy in food prices in Iqaluit versus in Winnipeg to try to discern why it costs so much more to buy groceries in the North.\nBut it's just not only Canadians living in the North who are feeling the pinch.\nAfter the release of the new Canada Food Guide earlier this year, Angus Reid polled Canadians about whether they would be able to eat the way the guide recommended.

The reports\u00a0show quickly rising rental prices that demand a greater percentage of people's incomes and how\u00a0evictions for reasons other than non-payment further the problem.\u00a0\nSara Mayo, social planner of geographic information service with SPRC, explained\u00a0that the group was influenced by industries lauding price increases in the housing market as a good thing,\u00a0and wanted to shed light on the downsides.\n\"The housing market is causing a lot of stress and negative situations for lots of people in Hamilton,\" she said. \"Not enough attention is paid to the rental market...there's not enough discussion of\u00a0the negative impacts.\"\u00a0\nPart of the problem, she said,\u00a0is that rental prices are surpassing inflation rates. While rental prices\u00a0were increasing at a rate close to inflation from 2001 to 2015,\u00a0the SPRC says the costs are now growing\u00a0exponentially.\u00a0\nBased on data from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the non-profit says that from 2015 to 2018, inflation rose by six per cent, while\u00a0rental prices\u00a0for private units increased by 21 per cent.\nIf prices were to increase by inflation, the SPRC says average market rent for a private rental unit would be $884 \u2014 instead, it's $1,009.\u00a0\nAnd if this cost seems low compared to what you see advertised online, the group says there's a reason for that.\u00a0\nThe average price\u00a0provided by the\u00a0CMHC, it says,\u00a0takes into account rent being asked by landlords and rents being\u00a0paid by current renters \u2014 the latter group brings this\u00a0average down.\u00a0Information\u00a0on rental websites, which only includes\u00a0prices\u00a0of when the units turn over, are higher because it shows the prices of places available.\u00a0\nHamilton is among the cities with the fastest growing prices when compared to neighbouring communities. The report says that between 2017 and 2018, Hamilton's average rents spiked 6.9 per cent \u2014\u00a0a rate higher than the provincial average.\u00a0\nThe non-profit says that the numbers are skyrocketing as\u00a0rents increase for\u00a0existing units and higher quality units\u00a0that cost more are built around the city.\u00a0\nAccording to the SPRC, eviction notices for reasons other than non-payment of rent,\u00a0such as\u00a0renovations that create these higher quality units, have more than doubled.\nThere were\u00a060 incidents recorded by the Landlord Tenant Board in 2010 and 150 recorded in 2018.\u00a0The non-profit said that the board does not track \"informal evictions,\" such as when amenities\u00a0like laundry rooms\u00a0close in a building, influencing its residents to live elsewhere.\u00a0\nThe number of these eviction notices, called L2 notices,\u00a0are highest in some of the most affordable rental neighbourhoods. The highest is in the Corktown and Stinson areas. Mayo said that when people move out, it allows these affordable prices to continually increase.\u00a0\nWhen it comes to rising costs, one-bedroom rentals in\u00a0the downtown core and mountain have seen the greatest increases in average rent, with a\u00a0whopping 40 per cent rise\u00a0from 2010 to 2018. The downtown core is also home to the most\u00a0rental units, while the mountain\u00a0comes second.\nThe mountain, however,\u00a0has\u00a0the largest number of family size units.\u00a0\nAreas with the greatest increase in average rent for two-bedroom rentals are the mountain and Hamilton's east and west ends.\u00a0\nWhen wages don't rise as quickly as rental prices, families need to pay a bigger part of their income for shelter. The SPRC's report says that 45.4 per cent of renter households are living in unaffordable housing, meaning they spend around 30 per cent of their income on housing costs.\nSome are spending even more \u2014 20\u00a0per cent of renters are spending 50 per cent or more of their income on housing.\nMayo said the\u00a0unaffordability rate shows the lack of affordable housing in Hamilton despite being\u00a0talked about as less expensive\u00a0than other places. When the housing market is discussed, she said, the problem is it often comes from a Toronto lens. And when the rates to live in Toronto are so high, it can paint a distorted picture of the rates in Hamilton.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0percentage of people using a high amount of their income is in line with\u00a0the provincial average \u2014\u00a045 per cent of people use 30 per cent of their income on rent, where 20.9 per cent use half of their income on average.\u00a0\u00a0\nMayo said\u00a0this highlights how people are struggling.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Because Hamilton has 'low rent,' it's seen as 'oh, it's not as much of an issue,'\" she said. \"Rents are cheaper here, but incomes are lower in Hamilton, so we still have affordability challenges despite lower rents.\"\u00a0\nShe added that people might feel pressured to stay in an area despite difficulties\u00a0because of the intimidating and unaffordable prices out there.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"People really feel trapped,\" she said. \"If they need to move because their job is in a different part of the city, well they can't move because if they leave their apartment, they'll leave affordable rent.\"\nThe non-profit\u00a0references a report from the think-tank Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, which shows that someone earning minimum wage would have to work 54 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Hamilton.\u00a0\nFuture bulletins from the non-profit will focus on impacts to renters and the difficulties they face, as well as the buildings they live in.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U.S. reports on GDP, consumer spending remain positive", "description": "Improvement in economic data seemingly reduces the risks of a recession in the near term", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/us-economy-reports-1.5375050", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5375062.1574868732!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/economy-gdp.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 27, 2019 10:49 AM ET", "2019-11-27T15:49:58.494Z"], "source": null, "content": "U.S. economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter, rather than slowing as initially reported, and there are signs the downturn in business investment could be drawing to a close.\nThe economy's prospects were further brightened by other data on Wednesday showing the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week after being stuck at a five-month high for two straight weeks, and that consumer spending rose steadily in October.\nThe reports were released in the wake of data showing an acceleration in housing market activity early in the fourth quarter and a sharp decline in the goods trade deficit, as well as a solid pace of inventory accumulation by retailers.\nThe improvement in the economic data further diminished the risks of recession in the near term. The Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.\nGross domestic product increased at a 2.1 per cent annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of third-quarter GDP. That was up from the 1.9 per cent pace estimated last month. The economy grew at a 2.0 per cent pace in the April-June period.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast third-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at 1.9 per cent.\nThe upward revision to GDP reflected more inventory accumulation than initially thought, as well as a less steep pace of contraction in business investment. Inventories increased at a $79.8 billion US pace instead of the $69.0 billion rate reported last month.\nWhen measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.4 per cent rate in the last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a rate of 0.9 per cent in the second quarter. The income side of the growth ledger accelerated despite a drop in profits.\nSecond-quarter GDI growth was revised down by 0.9 percentage point, with growth in wages and sales during that period slashed by $46.7 billion to $62.1 billion.\nAfter-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, decreased $11.3 billion, or at a rate of 0.6 per cent, as they were held down by legal settlements with Facebook and Google. Profits increased at a 3.3 per cent rate in the second quarter.\nThe average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.3 per cent rate in the July-September period, quickening from a 1.4 per cent growth pace in the second quarter.\nU.S. stock index futures briefly extended gains and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose after the release of the data. The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies.\nGrowth has slowed from the 3.1 per cent rate notched in the first three months of the year. The slowdown is largely blamed on the Trump administration's trade war with China, which has eroded business confidence, contributing to the second straight quarterly decline in business investment.\nThe fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also sapping momentum from the expansion, now in its 11th year. But there are some hopeful signs for business investment.\nThe Commerce Department said on Wednesday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3 per cent last month as households spent more on electricity and gas, offsetting a drop in new motor vehicle purchases.\nWith consumer spending rising moderately, inflation remained benign in October. Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% last month, lifted by food, energy goods and services prices. The PCE price index was unchanged in August and September.\nWages increased 0.4 per cent in October after climbing 0.1 per cent in September. Wages were boosted by a $7.2 billion adjustment to account for General Motors strike pay and payments associated with a new contract for members of the United Automobile Workers union.\nWith spending outpacing income growth, savings fell to $1.29 trillion from $1.34 trillion in September.\nOrders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 1.2 per cent last month, the largest gain since January, after falling 0.5 per cent in September. These so-called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery, computers and electronic products and fabricated metals.\nEconomists had forecast core capital goods orders would drop 0.3 per cent in October. Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.8 per cent last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.\nCore capital goods shipments fell 0.8 per cent in September.\nBusiness investment dropped at a 2.7 per cent rate in the third quarter, rather than contracting at a 3.0 per cent pace as previously reported.

But beyond those headline numbers the latest jobs report was far from gloomy.\nAlberta and Saskatchewan saw significant job increases in June. The slight decline in jobs in the month comes after a year when the economy churned out more than 400,000 new positions.\u00a0\nAlso this past\u00a0month, permanent jobs replaced lost\u00a0part-time work, a sign employers may be anxious to lock in their own stable of\u00a0employees\u00a0instead of depending on the gig economy. People who have\u00a0those full-time jobs saw wage gains well above inflation.\nMost important,\u00a0the trend in the unemployment rate seems\u00a0clear, with Friday's small rise possibly just\u00a0a zig in a zigzag downward slope.\nBut perhaps an even more significant economic indicator for Poloz\u00a0and Wilkins on Wednesday will be last Friday's\u00a0U.S. jobs data that put\u00a0Canada's in the shade. There, a slight uptick in recent record low unemployment rates was overwhelmed by a tornado of job creation exceeding forecasts that had already been considered optimistic.\nWith the economy generating more than 200,000 jobs in the month, all of a sudden the idea that the Fed's Jerome Powell would slash interest rates by as much as half a percentage point next time around seems to have evaporated. If so, expect a frosty reaction from U.S. President Donald Trump.\nAs often happens, markets, soaring on the prospect of rate cuts to boost a sagging economy, suddenly declined from their stratospheric\u00a0heights\u00a0when it looked as if the economy was doing well.\nThat was not because Bank of Canada watchers thought Poloz would alter his predicted no-change interest rate policy, but merely because those\u00a0jobs numbers showed no sign that either the U.S. economy or the greenback was about to fall\u00a0behind.\nA confluence of\u00a0economic good news is having positive effects on business, according to Francis Fong, chief economist at the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada.\nFong says a recent survey of high-ranking Canadian corporate accountants shows renewed optimism.\n\"It's actually the first increase in optimism we have seen in our survey since 2017,\" said Fong.\nThat considered, it seems unkind to rain on their parade, but in Wednesday's meet the press, Poloz may be asked to look past the latest clear patch to signs of worsening conditions ahead.\nFong points out his survey's optimism is tempered by continued fears about trade. And while Canada and Mexico seem\u00a0out of Trump's tariff spotlight, worries continue about the repercussions of his battle with Beijing.

She said the review would \"take its time but not too much time,\" starting January and finishing by the end of 2020.\nThe ECB left unchanged the stimulus package that was decided under former bank president Mario Draghi on Sept. 12. That put the focus on Lagarde and her plans on how to steer the powerful central bank whose decisions affect 342 million people in the 19 countries that use the euro as their currency.\nShe is well known on the world stage from her previous jobs as French finance minister and then head of the International Monetary Fund, where she was deeply involved in efforts to rescue Greece and other indebted countries during the eurozone debt crisis.\nThose jobs, however, did not require her to give detailed views on the highly technical subject of monetary policy, where a misplaced word can jolt financial markets. She declined to fill in that blank extensively on Thursday, saying \"\"I'm neither a dove, nor a hawk\" \u2014 financial jargon for stimulus supporters and opponents \u2014 and that \"my ambition is to be an owl,\" implying the wisdom associated with that particular bird.\nShe told journalists that she would have \"my own style\" in communicating with the financial community and not to compare her too much to her predecessors. She is the first woman to head the ECB and the fourth president since it was founded in 1998, following Wim Duisenberg, Jean-Claude Trichet and Draghi.\nAmong the topics for the review could be how the bank defines its mission to keep prices stable, given by the European Union. The ECB currently expresses that as keeping annual inflation below, but close to 2 per cent. The 2 per cent\u00a0goal is aimed at giving the economy a margin of safety to ward off deflation, a crippling downward price spiral that hit Japan in the 1990s. Some inflation encourages spending and investment. It also makes it easier for indebted members of the eurozone to pay down debt and lower business costs.\nInflation has remained stubbornly below the goal for years following the Great Recession and eurozone financial crisis of 2010-2012. Lagarde said a review was overdue since the last one occurred in 2003.\nThe review would also look at what role the ECB could play in supporting financing for projects aimed at fighting climate change. The ECB has already bought some so-called green bonds, which finance projects aimed at reducing pollution and fighting global warming. It did not, however, buy them for environmental reasons but as part of its broad plan to purchase government and corporate bonds with the ultimate aim of easing credit conditions generally.\nThe European Commission has announced a \"green deal\" aimed at lowering the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. The ECB's mandate says it must pursue price stability first but once that is taken care of it can look at supporting the general economic policies of the European Union.\nLagarde said that recent economic indicators are weak overall but \"point to some stabilizing in the slowdown of of economic growth.\" The decision to keep interest rates low and unchanged followed a similar move this week by the U.S. Federal Reserve, where officials indicated they expect no change to rates through 2020.\nDoubts have grown among some economists about how much good more central bank stimulus can do to support developed economies. At the Fed, officials think the neutral interest rate, at which the bank's policies neither stimulate nor restrain economic activity, may be lower than in the past.\nAt the ECB, officials enacted a stimulus package as recently as September, when they cut a key rate and launched a bond-buying program that pumps newly created money into the economy. Lagarde said that package would continue to support the economy with easier borrowing terms for companies. Draghi pushed the package through over objections from some members of the rate-setting council. That has given Lagarde a respite period that she can use to conduct the review.\nThe economy in the eurozone is a mixed bag at the moment. The U.S.-China trade dispute has held back its manufacturing sector. Consumer demand and service companies have done better and that has helped lower unemployment. The ECB sees the eurozone growing 1.2 per cent\u00a0next year.\nIn September, the bank cut the deposit rate to minus 0.5 per cent\u00a0from minus 0.4 per cent. The rate is charged on excess cash left at the central bank overnight by commercial banks, so the negative rate is in effect a penalty that aims to push banks to lend the money to companies. The bank also started 20 billion euros ($29\u00a0billion Cdn) in monthly purchases of government and corporate bonds.\n"}, {"author": "Soheil Karkhanechi", "title": "The Liberals' first-time homebuyers incentive is a bad deal", "description": "The program asks too much in exchange for savings of a couple of hundred dollars a month", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/homebuyers-incentive-1.5281833", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4612021.1523315988!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trudeau-victoria-20180405.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 13, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-13T08:00:00.840Z"], "source": null, "content": "The First Time Home Buyers Incentive (FTHBI) is a bad deal.\nI support the Liberal's National Housing Strategy. I have also publicly\u00a0advocated\u00a0for changes to the housing finance ecosystem and cheered some of the recent interventions in the mortgage market.\u00a0The\u00a0extension\u00a0of the stress tests to low-ratio mortgages was a good idea and it helped\u00a0curb\u00a0some of the excesses in the housing industry.\u00a0But I also know a bad deal when I see one, and the FTHBI is a bad deal.\nUnder the\u00a0program, which was touted as a way for young Canadians get into the housing market, first-time home buyers can receive between five to 10\u00a0per cent toward the value of their home in the form of a \"shared equity mortgage.\"\u00a0\nThere are no interest payments required on the incentive amount but when the home is sold, the government will take back the same percentage of the value of the sale as it contributed to the purchase. In order to qualify, in addition to meeting all the standard requirements for insured mortgages, applicants' income must not exceed $120,000 and total borrowing must not be more than four times income.\nLet's say you have income of $100,000 and have saved $25,000 for a down payment.\u00a0Under the program, you can purchase a home valued at $425,000.\u00a0The government will contribute up to $42,500 toward your down payment, and at market rates, that would save you approximately $230 on your monthly mortgage payments.\nMuch of the criticism of the program to date has focused on the fact that was limited to homes below $560,000 in value and therefore wouldn't do much for prospective homebuyers in expensive cities such as Vancouver, Victoria or Toronto.\u00a0Liberal leader Justin Trudeau attempted to address that issue Thursday by announcing a future expansion of the program to include homes up to $789,000 in value.\u00a0\nBut the program is flawed in a more fundamental way: it asks too much in exchange for that savings of a couple of hundred dollars a month.\u00a0In fact, it asks for up to ten per cent of the value of your home.\u00a0In economic lingo, the government's stake in your home has the upside of equity, but the downside protection associated with debt.\nWhen it is time to sell, you owe the government the same percentage on the new (hopefully higher) value of your home that the government contributed at the outset. In the interim, you carried the mortgage and paid for the renovations and upgrades. The government, on the other hand, did nothing.\nIf, like most people, you bought the home with a view that it will go up in value, by taking the incentive, you give up a sizeable portion of the tax-free upside associated with the appreciation in the value of your home.\nYou might say:\u00a0well, at least I do not have to pay interest on the incentive amount.\u00a0\nActually, by the government's own\u00a0calculation, the interest equivalent\u00a0to sharing the upside, even assuming relatively modest increases in the value of the home, will likely be well above the rate on your mortgage.\u00a0In one example shown, where the value of the home goes up by 20 per cent over five years, the equivalent interest rate would be 3.71 per cent.\u00a0In another example, where the value of the house goes up by 30 percent over two years, the equivalent rate would be 14 per cent!\u00a0\nIt gets worse.\u00a0What if the value of the home goes down when you sell? In that case, you still owe the government the same percentage on the revised value of the home.\u00a0I use the word \"owe\" purposely, because while you participate equally with the government on the upside, on the way down, the government's money comes before yours.\u00a0\nThat means your down payment can easily be wiped out if there is a decline in the value of your home when you sell, but you would still owe the government their percentage of the home's value. This is not just a theoretical possibility \u2014 in the earlier example of the $425,000 home, just a six per cent drop in the value of your home would wipe out your equity.\u00a0\nLiberals promise to expand program for first-time homebuyers\nHow does the program address this downside scenario where your equity is zero but you still owe money to the government? Very meekly and only in the fine\u00a0print: \"The Program Administrator will work with borrowers who are experiencing financial hardship, which may include an extension or modification of the repayment requirements.\"\u00a0\nAt this point, you may think I am out of touch with the lives of many young Canadians for whom $230 a month is a meaningful amount. Wouldn't the dream of home ownership justify giving up some of the upside for those people? Actually, the qualification criteria for the FTHBI is such that most homebuyers who are eligible for the program would have qualified for a larger mortgage by opting not to use it.\u00a0\nThat person with the $25,000 down payment and $100,000 income?\u00a0She could have purchased a $500,000 by not using the program instead of being limited to a $425,000 home.\u00a0So, while the incentive might mean saving a couple of hundred dollars a month on your mortgage payments, if you qualified for the incentive in the first place, you are likely the type of person who could have afforded the extra monthly payments anyhow.\nHousing policy is an important issue that goes well beyond simple economics, and the National Housing Strategy's\u00a0goal\u00a0of \"giving more Canadians a place to call home\" is a worthwhile pursuit. Unfortunately, at best, the FTHBI does nothing to advance that goal, and at worst, it will harm the very people it claims to help.\u00a0\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

That put the focus on Lagarde and her plans on how to steer the powerful central bank whose decisions affect 342 million people in the 19 countries that use the euro as their currency.\nShe is well known on the world stage from her previous jobs as French finance minister and then head of the International Monetary Fund, where she was deeply involved in efforts to rescue Greece and other indebted countries during the eurozone debt crisis.\nThose jobs, however, did not require her to give detailed views on the highly technical subject of monetary policy, where a misplaced word can jolt financial markets. She declined to fill in that blank extensively on Thursday, saying \"\"I'm neither a dove, nor a hawk\" \u2014 financial jargon for stimulus supporters and opponents \u2014 and that \"my ambition is to be an owl,\" implying the wisdom associated with that particular bird.\nShe told journalists that she would have \"my own style\" in communicating with the financial community and not to compare her too much to her predecessors. She is the first woman to head the ECB and the fourth president since it was founded in 1998, following Wim Duisenberg, Jean-Claude Trichet and Draghi.\nAmong the topics for the review could be how the bank defines its mission to keep prices stable, given by the European Union. The ECB currently expresses that as keeping annual inflation below, but close to 2 per cent. The 2 per cent\u00a0goal is aimed at giving the economy a margin of safety to ward off deflation, a crippling downward price spiral that hit Japan in the 1990s. Some inflation encourages spending and investment. It also makes it easier for indebted members of the eurozone to pay down debt and lower business costs.\nInflation has remained stubbornly below the goal for years following the Great Recession and eurozone financial crisis of 2010-2012. Lagarde said a review was overdue since the last one occurred in 2003.\nThe review would also look at what role the ECB could play in supporting financing for projects aimed at fighting climate change. The ECB has already bought some so-called green bonds, which finance projects aimed at reducing pollution and fighting global warming. It did not, however, buy them for environmental reasons but as part of its broad plan to purchase government and corporate bonds with the ultimate aim of easing credit conditions generally.\nThe European Commission has announced a \"green deal\" aimed at lowering the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. The ECB's mandate says it must pursue price stability first but once that is taken care of it can look at supporting the general economic policies of the European Union.\nLagarde said that recent economic indicators are weak overall but \"point to some stabilizing in the slowdown of of economic growth.\" The decision to keep interest rates low and unchanged followed a similar move this week by the U.S. Federal Reserve, where officials indicated they expect no change to rates through 2020.\nDoubts have grown among some economists about how much good more central bank stimulus can do to support developed economies. At the Fed, officials think the neutral interest rate, at which the bank's policies neither stimulate nor restrain economic activity, may be lower than in the past.\nAt the ECB, officials enacted a stimulus package as recently as September, when they cut a key rate and launched a bond-buying program that pumps newly created money into the economy. Lagarde said that package would continue to support the economy with easier borrowing terms for companies. Draghi pushed the package through over objections from some members of the rate-setting council. That has given Lagarde a respite period that she can use to conduct the review.\nThe economy in the eurozone is a mixed bag at the moment. The U.S.-China trade dispute has held back its manufacturing sector. Consumer demand and service companies have done better and that has helped lower unemployment. The ECB sees the eurozone growing 1.2 per cent\u00a0next year.\nIn September, the bank cut the deposit rate to minus 0.5 per cent\u00a0from minus 0.4 per cent. The rate is charged on excess cash left at the central bank overnight by commercial banks, so the negative rate is in effect a penalty that aims to push banks to lend the money to companies. The bank also started 20 billion euros ($29\u00a0billion Cdn) in monthly purchases of government and corporate bonds.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian and U.S. economies are converging but danger lurks: Don Pittis", "description": "Poloz and Wilkins warn that markets overestimate the power of a rate-cut quick fix", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/poloz-powell-rates-economy-1.5204132", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5207418.1562794054!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bank-of-canada-20190710.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 11, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-07-11T16:01:07.313Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "On the face of it, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz and his deputy Carolyn Wilkins had some excellent news about the Canadian economy in yesterday's Monetary Policy Report.\nThe happy story included falling mortgage\u00a0rates, continued employment strength and growing business investment that have pushed Canadian economic growth rates higher in the first half of the year than almost anyone expected.\nBut as global trade threats linger, Canada's top central bankers warn that many people who should know better, including stock market investors, seem to think cuts to interest rates can solve all problems.\nIn a complex world riven by trade disputes, they say, there are simply limits to the power of central bankers to patch things up. The warnings, including hints of the possibility of a new bout of stagflation, were effectively a message that rate cuts are no easy answer for the damaging effect of\u00a0a global trade war.\n\"The underlying shock would be very bad for economic growth, it would be bad for the level\u00a0of productivity, it would be quite harmful to profitability,\" said Poloz\u00a0of a potential growing trade spat.\u00a0\"It would be a pretty significantly negative scenario.\"\nMore on that later, but first a look at why the Canadian central bank foresaw Canada's interest rates remaining steady while on the\u00a0same day U.S. central banker Jerome Powell implied in congressional testimony that U.S. interest rates were about to fall.\nWhile that sounds like\u00a0the U.S. and Canada diverging, the senior deputy governor of Canada's central bank\u00a0said at yesterday's news conference, instead it was a sign that the two economies\u00a0were growing together.\n\"In fact, it's a sign of convergence, and this is because the two countries are at different points in our economic cycles,\" said Wilkins. \"The U.S. is slowing to a more sustainable pace while Canada is moving back up to its trend growth.\"\nAt the end of last year there were signs businesses were shying away from new Canadian investments due to fears a new NAFTA would not be resolved. Even as that fear faded, the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and U.S. President Donald\u00a0Trump's threats against Mexico over immigration left a lingering feeling of caution.\nWilkins\u00a0said\u00a0resolving all those difficulties\u00a0plus renewed strength in the Canadian oil and gas sector have helped to stimulate business investment confidence.\nSigns of a return to confidence in the Canadian housing market, including five-year mortgage rates returning to levels of five years ago, mean real estate will once again be a growth stimulant rather than a drag.\nOf course, as Poloz remarked, Canadian business still has an interest rate advantage.\u00a0U.S. interest rates\u00a0at 2.5 per cent are well above Canada's 1.75 per cent.\nFutures markets foresee Canada holding interest rates steady this year while the Fed makes three quarter-point cuts. Barring other potential shocks, that would put the two rates back into sync.\nWhile business confidence and a partial return to strength in oil and\u00a0housing markets are clear drivers, the central bankers say\u00a0continued strength in new hiring is slightly more mysterious.\nWilkins says economists have had trouble working out a clear relationship between the timing of GDP growth and waves of new hiring, just one of the complexities that make looking into the economy's future a far-from-exact science.\nDespite resolution of many of the trade worries the bank has described in the past, Poloz and Wilkins say they and their advisers still believe the biggest risk for Canada's economic future remains trade. The bank's strategy for trying to address something it cannot control is to draw up two divergent scenarios.\nFor those interested, the two extreme outlooks are described in Box 2 on Page 21 of the Monetary Policy Report. And of course the gloomier\u00a0one, an all-out trade war, is the more\u00a0interesting.\nIn describing this bleaker scenario Poloz\u00a0foresees that central banks, with their single superpower of making money cheap, simply may not be equipped to deal with the repercussions. And he says it is here that stock market investors, blithely assuming lower rates will always make stocks go higher, may be mistaken.\n\"The markets are not really onto the complexity of it,\" said Poloz, describing an event where trade barriers raised the cost of imports while a falling loonie added to the effect.\u00a0\n\"In that moment you have a trade-off between a slowing economy and rising unemployment and rising inflation at the same time,\" said Poloz. \"And obviously monetary policy would not be able to buffer both of those.\"\nAll the more reason for Canadians to hope the Bank of Canada's good news scenario where \"the global economy broadly returns to pre-2017 trade arrangements, and uncertainty about future trade policy dissipates\" is the one that comes true.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Nick Boisvert", "title": "Toronto to explore tax targeting vacant storefronts on city's main streets", "description": "A busy 2.3-kilometre section of Queen Street East is home to 44 vacant stores", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vacant-storefront-tax-proposal-1.5485846", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5485920.1583355888!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vacant-storefront.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 05, 2020 5:00 AM ET", "2020-03-05T10:00:00.511Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "After spending a year in search of a home for his brew pub, Carl Pratt discovered a troubling real estate dynamic: plenty of available spaces, but few landlords who seemed interested in actually renting them out.\n\"There are lots of empty buildings, but typically the rents landlords were asking for are above what would be reasonable,\" said Pratt, a co-owner of Beaches Brewing Company.\n\"You need to make a ton of money in order to put that kind of investment into a property.\"\nPratt suspects that some of the property owners were simply holding out for a tenant willing to cough up rent well above market value.\u00a0\nOthers, he believes, were playing a speculation game; sitting on vacant properties until they can assemble a parcel large enough for condo development.\nWhile Pratt eventually found a suitable and reasonably priced unit and opened for business in 2019, a stroll through The Beach neighbourhood suggests the proliferation of vacant storefronts is widespread and showing no signs of slowing down.\nAccording to the office of Coun.\u00a0Brad Bradford, who represents Ward 19, Beaches-East York, a busy 2.3-kilometre stretch of Queen Street East in the heart of The Beach is home to 44 vacant storefronts.\nSome are dilapidated and unsuitable for occupancy. Others have \"for lease\" signs in their windows, yet have sat empty for upwards of six years. In 2018, city council repealed a property tax rebate for landlords with empty storefronts. But that move seems to have had little impact on the problem.\n\"You can see storefront after storefront papered over, shuttered up, and that doesn't contribute to the sort of vibrant main streets that so many of us want to see,\" Bradford told CBC Toronto.\nThe first-term councillor is now spearheading a proposal to introduce a vacant-storefront tax that would charge landlords for sitting on empty units for extended periods of time.\nThe tax, Bradford argues, will \"incentivize landlords to work in partnership with small businesses to try and populate these streets.\"\nBradford's motion asking Toronto city staff to investigate a possible vacant storefront tax was adopted by city council last week, despite resistance from five councillors who opposed the motion.\nThe motion does not recommend any tax rates or other specifics, such as how long a property must be empty before it is taxed.\nStill, there are concerns the tax would be too difficult to enforce, or that it might harm landlords who want to rent their properties but can't find a tenant.\nThe tax would also require tweaks to legislation, including the City of Toronto Act, provincial legislation that\u00a0governs aspects of the city's taxing authorities.\n\"My view at this point is that it would be difficult to design the tax, to implement it,\" said city solicitor Wendy Walberg.\nToronto does not track vacant storefronts, though city statistics show that independent businesses account for 74 per cent of Toronto's retail stores.\nProponents of a vacant storefront tax say those businesses are particularly vulnerable to speculators who have little incentive to rent out their properties when they could potentially make more money by holding out and selling to developers.\nProperty record searches reveal that many of the vacant storefronts on Queen Street East are owned by numbered companies. Bradford's office found that 13 of the 44 empty units appear suitable for occupation but have no signage and are not listed online.\n\"It's numbered companies that are assembling property and letting it sit vacant, a blight on our streets, for years and years and years,\" Bradford said.\nThe motion to examine the tax also calls for the city to analyze other jurisdictions with similar taxes, though there are few examples to follow.\nOn Tuesday, residents of San Francisco voted on a vacant storefront tax supported by the city's mayor, though results of the vote have not yet been confirmed.\nThe proposed tax would apply to properties that sit vacant for more than 182 days per year, and levy $250 per foot of sidewalk frontage in year one, escalating to $1,000 per foot if the property remained vacant for three years.\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle, the tax is among the first proposals in the United States to explicitly target empty storefronts.\nBradford's motion calls for the report to be ready in time for 2021 budget discussions, making next year the earliest it could be implemented.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "More Fed cuts expected to push Canadian interest rates lower: Don Pittis", "description": "Watch for effects of shrinking global economy to hit Canada as well", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/federal-reserve-rates-canada-1.5279888", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5289096.1568844233!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-fed.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 19, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-19T18:45:17.887Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A weakening global economy and continued trade fears \u2014 and\u00a0emphatically, he said, not angry words from U.S. President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2014\u00a0convinced U.S.\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0for the second time this summer.\nAnd for Canadians waiting for lower rates, those same global forces are on their way, and will likely\u00a0force\u00a0Bank of Canada Governor\u00a0Stephen Poloz to follow suit.\nDespite the fact that the quarter point cut was widely expected, the move had an immediate effect on the Canadian dollar which fell promptly\u00a0after Powell's announcement.\u00a0\nWhile Powell said shrinking industrial activity justified the cut, he insisted that he and his advisers expect the economy to continue to grow, and predicted there would likely be no more interest rate cuts this year.\nMarkets \u2014\u00a0which have been predicting a series of cuts and, until recently, expected a larger half point cut \u2014\u00a0tumbled on the news.\nAfter repeated attacks on Powell and the central bank, whom Trump recently described as \"boneheads,\" it was hardly surprising that the president\u00a0expressed his unhappiness with the Fed chair's mild rate cut.\n\"Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again.

And that means lower rates are coming to Canada too, he said.\n\"It won't act immediately because these kinds of things take a little while to trickle through the economy and to play out, but this does indicate \u2026 that the long-term trajectory for the Bank of Canada is\u00a0a rate cut not a rate increase.\"\nAt Wednesday's\u00a0news conference Powell was asked about this week's credit crunch in short-term money, in what is called the repo market, when a shortage of lenders in the market for overnight money pushed rates far above the central bank's interest rate range,\u00a0indicating the Fed had been caught short.\u00a0\nBecause something similar happened before the 2007-08 credit crunch that led to the Great Recession,\u00a0online chatter worried\u00a0this week's market jolt was a symptom of something worse. That was a view Powell was anxious to dispel.\u00a0\n\"We don't see this as having any implication for the broader economy or for the economic outlook,\" Powell told reporters.\nBut when the central bank began its emergency lending this week, banks came cap in hand for $53 billion US on Tuesday\u00a0and another $80 billion on Wednesday.\n\"That's $130-plus billion the banks have asked the Federal Reserve for, so that's not insignificant, and in many respects it's starting to feel like a mini, kind-of crisis within short-term funding markets,\" said Aquanno.\nThe Fed is expected to release another $75 billion today in an attempt to steady the\u00a0market, and Aquanno says it is crucial that they do for not just the U.S. but the Canadian and the global market.\n\"Once the Fed loses the capacity, or is perceived to have lost capacity to manage short-term rates, then that introduces tremendous volatility into the system because the Fed remains the global central bank, even more so that it did 15 years ago.\"\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The latest on the coronavirus outbreak for March 30", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/the-latest-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak-for-march-30-1.5515179", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 30, 2020 6:16 PM ET", "2020-03-30T22:50:26.727Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "\u00a0\nCanadian military assembles 'rapid reaction' teams to help with pandemic response\nThe Canadian military has mobilized 24,000 full-time and part-time members to respond to calls from provinces and northern Indigenous communities for help with pandemic measures, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said Monday.\nThe military's \"rapid reaction\" teams will be available for a range of missions, such as delivering medical supplies and supporting remote communities that may be vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks.\nAt least 10 regular force units on bases across the country have troops and equipment set aside to take action.

Well, this is about changing that attitude, and doing it very quickly,\" he said.\nPublic health experts are sounding the alarm about the possible connections between lung damage caused by smoking or vaping and increased vulnerability to the novel coronavirus.\n\"While COVID-19 is less likely to cause serious symptoms in younger people, in combination with substance use like vaping or smoking cigarettes or cannabis, it could pose a serious health threat,\" said a March 24 commentary written by Dr. Nicholas Chadi and Dr. Richard B\u00e9langer of the Canadian Pediatric Society.\nKeeping young children entertained during the COVID-19 pandemic\nEntertainer Robbie Doherty usually slips into his kid-friendly persona Silly Robbie for stage shows across Prince Edward Island, but the COVID-19 pandemic has put a hold on those performances.

At home, inflation has been running below target and central banks can drop interest rates as a way to lift consumer prices.\nCraig Alexander, chief economist for Deloitte, said the expected rate cut should be viewed as \"taking out insurance on the economic expansion\" and not a sign Powell sees a larger downturn on the way.\n\"I don't think the economic indicators, at this point, are flashing that a recession is upon us,\" Alexander said.\nHe doesn't see any urgency for the Bank of Canada to follow the Fed's lead.\n\"The two central banks didn't move in lockstep with rates going up, so they don't need to move in lockstep with rates coming down,\" Alexander said.\n\"One could argue that the Fed went farther faster and now it's going reverse some of that, so there isn't the pressure on the Bank of Canada to respond.\"\nThe Bank of Canada should also be careful about \"expending ammunition\" that could be used later to deal with a downturn, he said.\nAlexander added that a rate cut by the Fed could bring benefits to trade-dependent Canada by bolstering U.S. and foreign demand. It could also put additional upward pressure on the Canadian dollar.\nEarlier this month, the Bank of Canada kept its interest rate at 1.75 per cent for a sixth-straight policy meeting. Canadian economic growth has shown signs of re-emerging after it nearly stalled in late 2018 and early 2019.\nThe bank, however, showed no urgency at the July meeting to make a policy change even though the Fed had already signalled its intention to lower the U.S. rate.\nCarolyn Wilkins, the Bank of Canada's senior deputy governor, explained at the time that the U.S. and Canada were at different points in the economic cycle.\n\"The fact that Canada is picking up while the U.S. economy is slowing sounds like a divergence. In fact, it's a process of convergence,\" said Wilkins, noting Canada's interest rate was already lower than the Fed's.\n\"The United States is slowing to a more sustainable pace, while Canada is moving back up to its trend growth... By the second half of this year, growth should be similar in both economies as they converge on their respective potential level of activity.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The latest on the coronavirus outbreak for March 30", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/the-latest-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak-for-march-30-1.5515179", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 30, 2020 6:16 PM ET", "2020-03-30T22:50:26.727Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "\u00a0\nCanadian military assembles 'rapid reaction' teams to help with pandemic response\nThe Canadian military has mobilized 24,000 full-time and part-time members to respond to calls from provinces and northern Indigenous communities for help with pandemic measures, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said Monday.\nThe military's \"rapid reaction\" teams will be available for a range of missions, such as delivering medical supplies and supporting remote communities that may be vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks.\nAt least 10 regular force units on bases across the country have troops and equipment set aside to take action. At the moment, no formal requests for what's known as \"aid to the civil power\" have been submitted to the federal government, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said today.\nWhile the Canadian military has transport capacity, it does not have an oversupply of medical equipment and personal protective equipment, the chief of the defence staff said last week.\nRead more about the military's \"rapid reaction\" teams \nSuspected, confirmed COVID-19 patients filling roughly 1 in 4 ICU beds in Ontario\nMore than 430 patients in Ontario hospital intensive care beds have either tested positive for COVID-19 or are suspected to have the coronavirus \u2014 a far higher number than officials have revealed.\nCBC News has obtained copies of COVID-19 reports issued daily by Critical Care Services Ontario, a branch of the Ministry of Health. The reports feature more detail than has previously been made public about the impact the virus is having on hospital ICUs. The latest report, from Saturday, shows 92 patients in critical care wards have been confirmed positive for COVID-19, while another 342 ICU patients are considered \"suspected\" cases.\nThis means confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases now account for roughly one out of every four patients currently in Ontario's intensive care units \u2014 the first crucial medical resource to be overwhelmed by the spread of the virus in Italy, Spain and New York City.\nDespite the hundreds of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases, Ontario's ICUs are not full. On average, hospital critical care wards are running at an average occupancy rate of 76 per cent, leaving some 500 beds available.\nRead more about the demand for ICU beds in Ontario \nAnswering your daily COVID-19 questions\nCBC News has received countless emails from readers, viewers and listeners about the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 if you have one, reach out at covid@cbc.ca \u2014 and we are working to address as many as we can. There will be an online story posted every weekday responding to some of the more frequently asked questions, including:\nDo I need to wipe down surfaces on delivered items and groceries?\nAccording to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, there are no reported cases of food or food packaging being associated with the transmission of COVID-19.\nA recent study suggests the virus can persist on surfaces, such as cardboard, but found the amount of virus that is found on the surfaces might not be enough to get infected and further research is needed.\nAs for packaged items from the grocery store, epidemiologist Dr. Rama Nair suggests rinsing them with soap and water if possible, or at least a disinfectant wipe approved for use against coronavirus. Nair adds that fresh fruits and vegetables should be rinsed as soon as they are brought into your home.\nIf you choose to disinfect your deliveries, use soap and water, and wash your hands after unpacking your items.\nRead more answers to COVID-19 questions \nCOVID-19's potential lingering effects on the economy\nIf you have kept a close eye on forecasts for the impact of COVID-19 on the global and Canadian economy, it is instructive to watch how much the outlook keeps changing.\nUncertainty remains extraordinarily high and predictions for the economy range from moderately gloomy to what may be wishful thinking, so CBC's Don Pittis came up with a few considerations to help you think about what the future may hold.\nDebt accumulation could be an issue \u2014 especially once the outbreak has passed \u2014 despite a new round of emergency rate cuts, income support and mortgage deferment plans that should help heavily indebted Canadians from hitting rock bottom.\nBusiness survival and recovery will also be important to watch, as some economic theory says that capitalism actually needs periodic downturns to refresh itself through creative destruction. The adjustment process is far from instant, however, and can be painful for displaced workers.\nEmployment rates are likely to dip from pre-COVID levels during the recovery period, with many observers noting that low-wage workers will suffer the most, while the pandemic's impact on energy is evident in plummeting oil prices.\nYoung people have no 'bulletproof' protection from COVID-19 \u2014 particularly smokers and vapers\nSome young people who say they have been smoking and vaping for years don't seem concerned about the potential damage to their lungs and whether that puts them more at risk for COVID-19, calling it more of an issue for older people.\nThat attitude is common, and is precisely the problem, said David Hammond, a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Waterloo. \"It's part of this idea that young people have that they're bulletproof, that these things are for older people. Well, this is about changing that attitude, and doing it very quickly,\" he said.\nPublic health experts are sounding the alarm about the possible connections between lung damage caused by smoking or vaping and increased vulnerability to the novel coronavirus.\n\"While COVID-19 is less likely to cause serious symptoms in younger people, in combination with substance use like vaping or smoking cigarettes or cannabis, it could pose a serious health threat,\" said a March 24 commentary written by Dr. Nicholas Chadi and Dr. Richard B\u00e9langer of the Canadian Pediatric Society.\nKeeping young children entertained during the COVID-19 pandemic\nEntertainer Robbie Doherty usually slips into his kid-friendly persona Silly Robbie for stage shows across Prince Edward Island, but the COVID-19 pandemic has put a hold on those performances. Now, Silly Robbie is entertaining children with his own show on YouTube called Silly Robbie's World.\nHis original plan was to post 10 episodes, but when COVID-19 started to spread, that plan changed. \"There are a lot of children that are going to be at home, they're going to be looking to do things \u2014 maybe getting a little bit bored,\" Doherty said.\nLuckily, Doherty said, he and producer Jesse Wachter already filmed quite a bit of the series \u2014 which is aimed at children aged two to seven years old \u2014 so they didn't have to worry about physical distancing. He took what they'd filmed and edited it down to five episodes, all about using your imagination, learning how to do activities and taking them to the \"next level,\" he said.\n\"A lot of it is just trying to help kids say, 'Hey, it's too bad, we all would like to go outside, but there is a lot of fun things we can do at home if we just use our imagination.'\"\nRead the full story about Silly Robbie's World\nSend us your questions\nStill looking for more information on the outbreak?

That\u00a0number suggests\u00a0people new to the country are contributing \"significantly\" to real estate demand, he said.\n\"We know that Canada is a country of immigrants and we know that newcomers to Canada are an important part of our economic growth. What surprises us in the data is just how important they are to Canada's real estate market,\" Soper said on Tuesday.\nIf current international migration levels are maintained, Royal LePage\u00a0estimates that\u00a0newcomers are expected to buy 680,000 homes in Canada over the next five years.\nThe projected home sales was calculated using historic migration levels from Statistics Canada, the survey's home ownership rate of newcomers and\u00a0Canadian Real Estate Association and Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation unit sales data.\nRoyal LePage defined newcomers as people who have lived in Canada for 10 years or less. They include immigrants, students, refugees and citizens from other countries\u00a0in Canada to work. According to the company, 31 per cent of newcomers are part of a family, 25 per cent are students, while 20 per cent are on their own. The vast majority of newcomers are immigrants, Soper said.\nSoper said newcomers to Canada represent between two to three million people, while the total Canadian population is roughly 37 million. He noted about 300,000 people come to Canada as immigrants every year.\u00a0\n\"What was surprising to us is just how many newcomers coming to Canada are focused on owning a home.

In Nov. 2019, home prices rose 10.7 per cent over last year to $416,116, putting the year in real estate on course to break records in terms of price.\u00a0\nAccording to data from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), while 2019 sales in the London area didn't reach the record-breaking volume of 2017 where 11,247 homes traded hands, Nov. 2019\u00a0sales numbers were on par to meet or beat 2018 figures\u00a0with about 9,700 homes bought and sold.\nFor 2020, the CMHC predicts market activity in terms of existing home sales will be steady, with about 9,200 home sales on the low end and 10,200 on the high end.\u00a0\nIt's for that reason home prices are\u00a0expected to again reach new heights in 2020, according to Anthony Passarelli, a senior market analyst with the CMHC.\u00a0\n\"On the high end $450,000 and on the low end\u00a0$430,000,\" he said. \"The average price in the City of London, the range for that\u00a0you would bump it up a little bit higher.\"\u00a0\nWith average prices in the city already hovering around $430,000 as of November 2019, it could mean home prices in London could easily close in on the $450,000 threshold\u00a0in 2020.\u00a0\n\"That ties in to why you're seeing some extra demand going to areas like St. Thomas and Strathroy because some people are going out a little bit further from the city centre to afford the home they want.\"\u00a0\nHigh real estate prices are also having an effect on London's tight rental market, according to Passarelli, who said the area's double-digit price gains have kept the overall vacancy rate hovering at around two per cent since 2016, which is about half of the city's historical vacancy rate of about four per cent.\u00a0\n\"Our research shows a lot of first-time buyers come from the rental market,\" he said. \"The rental market is affected because some of those renters that would normally have left the rental market to buy may stay an extra year and that causes the vacancy rate to be low.\"\nThe average rental price for a two-bedroom unit\u00a0in London is expected to climb to about $1,160 a month, up from $1,130 the year before, according to CMHC data.\u00a0\nThe reason behind that, according to Passarelli, is London's strong economy, which includes good job numbers, steady wage growth and plenty of immigrants settling in the city.\u00a0\n\"Immigration has been high in recent years, a lot of immigrants tend to rent when they first come to the country, especially the first year,\" he said. \"Census data consistently shows that.\"\u00a0\nPassarelli notes that while a number of new highrises in the city have just come online or are being built, Passarelli said it's not enough to offset an average rent increase\u00a0in 2020.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Calgary housing market among the most affordable in Canada, report says", "description": "'If you are the median income earner, there are options for you'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/affordability-report-homes-calgary-zoocasa-mortgage-median-income-1.5298385", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Sep 26, 2019 12:16 PM MT", "2019-09-26T18:16:51.552Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A new national housing report shows that average income earners are more likely to be able to afford a home in Calgary than in most other Canadian urban centres.\nThe report by at Zoocasa, a Toronto-based real estate brokerage firm, looked at whether people earning the median income in 15 markets would qualify for a mortgage for an average-priced home.\nIn eight of those cities, including Calgary, it was considered to be affordable.

This will not have an impact on deliveries of paper to our customers.\"\nFedora said\u00a0deliveries are generally reduced during this time of year due to soft ground conditions and spring weight restrictions\u00a0throughout the industry.\nThe move will have an immediate effect on sawmills in the province, most notably Ledwidge Lumber and Scotsburn Lumber, which had been sending wood and chips to Port Hawkesbury\u00a0Paper since\u00a0the closure of Northern Pulp at the end of January.\nIn an email, Ledwidge Lumber said the company laid off 40 per cent of its sawmill staff \u2014 33 full-time employees \u2014 as of Friday with \"more to follow in the coming days.\" It also said all roundwood deliveries are shut off for an indefinite period of time.\n\"Unfortunately, actions in the marketplace are further devaluing woodlots and therefore our home-grown businesses in rural Nova Scotia are suffering,\" said\u00a0company president Douglas Ledwidge in the email.\nThe email said Northern Pulp's closure had left the forestry scrambling to find a home for sawmill leftovers.\n\"Losing another big customer of these products \u2013 even temporarily \u2014\u00a0in the province is disastrous for the industry as a whole,\" the email said.\nAlthough there have been various slowdowns in the past at Port Hawkesbury Paper, members of the forestry industry said Thursday they've always been able to weather that because they had Northern Pulp to fall back on. That changed when the Pictou County pulp mill was forced to shut after it failed to secure approval to build a new effluent treatment site.\nStephen Cole, a forester and partner with woodlot management company H.C. Haynes, said their operation will lose yet another market for chips with the change at\u00a0Port Hawkesbury\u00a0Paper.\nWhen Northern Pulp went down, Port Hawkesbury Paper started taking chips and pulpwood from the mainland to try to help people continue to operate. But company officials have always said it could only be a temporary arrangement because they could never buy as much wood as Northern Pulp, which had larger capacity.\n\"They're not using more wood, they're just buying more wood, meaning at some point their yard is going to get full and they're going to have to stop,\" said Cole.\n\"It bought us some time and I'm glad they did do that for us. They didn't have to.\"\nWith contractors unable to send wood to Port Hawkesbury, Cole said there would be more limitations on\u00a0what woodlots can be worked, something that will trickle down to woodlot owners, who have already experienced big drops in the value of their investments. Nobody goes into the woods to just cut pulp, said Cole, but having that pulp to cut makes a harvest on a block of land more economical.\n\"It's about 20 to 30 per cent of the wood on an acre,\" he said. \"There's pulp in almost every woodlot in Nova Scotia, if not every woodlot.\"\nRobin Wilber, president of Elmsdale Lumber Company, said the lumber industry is cyclical and, in the past, they've been able to survive low prices because they got good prices from Northern Pulp for byproducts.\nWhen rectangular pieces of wood are made from round pieces of wood, what's left over is the \"absolute best quality wood fibre in the world,\" said Wilber.\n\"That sold for a good price to make good, high-quality paper products.\"\nThe provincial government has been trying to help the industry transition to a future beyond Northern Pulp. However, much of that work entails consultation and meetings, many of which will likely have to change as COVID-19 turns almost everything upside down.\nAs most Nova Scotians have their eyes fixed on what's happening at home with the spread of the virus, Wilber said he's watching what's happening in the United States, and in particular what the pandemic will do to that country's economy and housing market.\n\"If lumber markets fall, I'm not sure how the industry survives because we don't have our backup that we used to have,\" he said.\nThe market right now is reasonable, certainly benefiting from a favourable exchange rate, \"but we're afraid of what's coming,\" said Wilber.\nCole isn't feeling much more optimistic.\n\"I've heard this a hundred times: 'Well, we should diversify, we shouldn't have all our eggs in one basket.' We didn't. Northern [Pulp] was a big one, but it wasn't our only basket. Now we have our eggs in one basket and you can see what's happening.\"\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Pace of housing starts slowed in September, CMHC reports", "description": "Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. says seasonally adjusted annual rate fell 2.5% compared with August", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/housing-starts-down-september-1.5313243", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5277359.1582646722!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cmhc-housing-starts-20190809.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 08, 2019 11:16 AM ET", "2019-10-08T15:39:10.558Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. says the pace of housing starts in September slowed compared with August.\nThe agency says the seasonally adjusted annual rate fell 2.5 per cent to 221,202 units in September compared with 226,871 in August.\nEconomists on average had expected an annual pace of 214,500 for September, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.\n\"This continues to reflect strong demographic demand, both from international inflows and new households created within Canada,\" said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at Bank of Montreal.\n\"There's a lot of homebuilding activity going on across the vast majority of Canada.\"\nThe decrease came as the pace of urban starts fell 2.4 per cent to 208,503 units.

They fork over millions for condos and houses, and the units sit\u00a0empty until they can resell them at a profit.\nThat makes it harder on people looking for affordable units, Nann said. She pushed Monday for the city look at establishing a similar program to\u00a0Vancouver's empty homes tax. Councillors unanimously supported it.\n\"I've received anecdotal information from residents that they cannot find housing accommodations in our city,\" she said. \"At the same time, there's also anecdotal information I've received from other neighbours that they know there's buildings that are sitting vacant. Not just buildings, but homes. Homes that could be rented out.\"\nHamilton has seen a rapid increase in housing and rental prices. A recent Social Planning and Research Council of Hamilton report shows around 20 per cent of renters spend more than half their income on shelter. The cost of rent is also outpacing inflation.\nBetween 2017 and 2018, the report says, Hamilton's average rents spiked 6.9 per cent \u2014 a rate higher than the provincial average. It also references a report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives showing someone earning minimum wage would have to work 54 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment here.\u00a0\nHousing prices have also been on an upward trend for years, even when sales are down.\nSeveral other councillors echoed her belief on\u00a0the impact of speculation. There's no local data around how much vacant property has driven up real estate prices. But after Vancouver implemented an empty homes tax,\u00a0vacant property fell by 15 per cent from 2017 to 2018. The program has also helped return just over half of previously empty homes to the rental market.\nThe vacancy rate there is less than one per cent. That city started taxing empty homes an extra one per cent in 2016, and recently increased it to 1.25 per cent. In the last three years, the tax has generated $39.7 million in net revenue, which the city puts toward affordable housing initiatives.\u00a0\nIt could\u00a0be challenging to identify what units are vacant, said Jason Thorne, Hamilton's general manager of planning and economic development.

On the other hand, as the Wall Street Journal reminded us, Canada's 5.9 per cent unemployment rate would have been 4.7 per cent if calculated using U.S. methods.\nThe Canadian job decline did not come completely out of the blue. After strong job creation in August and September, October's data also showed a slight drop in jobs.\nThe question\u00a0raised by government critics and\u00a0commentators in the days after the report was whether the new\u00a0data was somehow a statistical misreading in a data collection system that is notoriously volatile\u00a0from month to month.\u00a0Or, alternatively, if something important had changed.\nWas it a blip?\u00a0Or is it a trend?\nA partial answer, at least, will come this week when\u00a0Statistics Canada releases its final data for 2019\u00a0to include\u00a0the month of December.\nAs an economic indicator, the Labour Force Survey has some important advantages.\nOne way of looking at it is that rather than being the proverbial canary in the coal mine, employment data is the actual coal mine.\u00a0Because what better measure of the economy is there than whether people are working and earning?\nEmployment data is about the\u00a0closest we have to a reading of now. Gathered through public interviews of households in days\u00a0before its release, the Labour Force Survey takes the current pulse of the economy in a way other data cannot.\nBut that immediacy comes with some flaws.\n\"While we are confident in our methodology, there is variability in the Labour Force Survey estimates, reflecting the nature of the survey,\" explained Statistics Canada labour market economist Bertrand Ouellet-L\u00e9veill\u00e9.\nStatisticians understand this in a way that most of us do not.\u00a0But even with a big\u00a0sample size, there remains large room for error.\nTo a statistician, there are about two chances out of\u00a0three that jobs losses were in a wide range around the minus 71,000 figure,\u00a0Ouellet-L\u00e9veill\u00e9 said.\u00a0But there is a one-third chance it is wrong altogether.\nThat's why data for a single month should never be read alone, he said,\u00a0and why it should be used with other sources of information, such as job vacancy\u00a0and wage\u00a0data.\nCertainly, business leaders have consistently complained that they have hundreds of thousands of jobs still vacant. And wages, rising at 4.5 per cent, or double the rate of inflation, seem to indicate workers remain in demand.\nSome blamed the size of November's\u00a0job slump on public-sector workers who were no longer needed after the fall federal election. A\u00a0sharp drop in manufacturing jobs is more ominous, but with demand high, both groups\u00a0may soon be drawn back into the workforce.\nAnd then there's inflation. Shortly after that last\u00a0jobs release, rising prices told a completely different story for the Bank of Canada and the Canadian dollar.\nWhen those jobs numbers were released\u00a0a month ago today, many analysts took it as a warning that the economy was in trouble. \"Biggest jobs loss since 2009 test Canadian resolve on rates,\" blared\u00a0a headline from the business news service Bloomberg.\nThe Canadian dollar fell.\nMany saw the plunge in employment as a sign that the Bank of Canada would have to cut rates to boost the economy. But now\u00a0a month later, almost no one thinks Canada's chief central banker\u00a0Stephen Poloz, or his replacement, taking over in June, will cut interest rates in 2020.\nNot only did the dollar begin to rise after the recent inflation numbers, most Canadians would probably be surprised to learn that the loonie was one of the\u00a0developed world's powerhouse currencies in 2019, beating out the U.S. greenback by\u00a0five per cent.\nMany other indicators tell us that Canada\u00a0remains strong. Just last week, the World Economic League Table\u00a0showed that not only has the Canadian economy knocked out South Korea to once again make it into the global Top 10, but in the coming decade, Canada is expected to climb over the backs of Italy and Brazil to reach No. 8.\n\"Despite the fact that the economy is doing reasonably well, with some regional exceptions, [and] despite the fact that the Canadian middle-class income has been better and more stable\u00a0than most middle classes around the world at the moment\u00a0\u2026 there is a kind of anxiety out there,\" Keith Banting, a public policy specialist at Queen's University, said in an\u00a0interview last September.\nLast month, Conservative warnings of a made-in-Canada recession helped keep that anxiety alive. And while most domestic and international analysts say the Canadian economy will continue to grow in 2020, a November slump in employment that expands from a blip into a downward spiral would be dangerous signal.\nSo was it a blip?\u00a0Or is it a trend? This week's employment statistics will help settle that debate.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Powell hints Federal Reserve will cut rates if needed over trade wars", "description": "Expectations are rising that the Fed will cut rates at least once and possibly twice before year's end", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/powell-fed-trump-trade-conflicts-1.5161417", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5161424.1559657489!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/federal-reserve-powell.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 04, 2019 10:14 AM ET", "2019-06-04T16:17:29.287Z"], "source": null, "content": "Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the Federal Reserve is prepared to respond to the Trump administration's trade conflicts to protect the U.S. economy, signalling that the Fed will cut interest rates if necessary.\nPowell's comments gave a lift to stock markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average up over 400 points at mid-day.\nSpeaking at a Fed conference in Chicago, Powell said, \"We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\"\nPowell didn't explicitly say what the Fed would do if it concluded that the administration's trade conflicts were damaging the economy. But expectations are rising that the Fed will cut rates at least once and possibly twice before year's end, in part because of the consequences of the trade war. There is also concern that the U.S. economy faces a growing risk of a recession.\nTrump has imposed far-reaching tariffs on imports on China, which has retaliated with tariffs of its own on U.S. exports. He has also threatened to impose an escalating series of tariffs against Mexico unless Mexico stops a flow of migrants from Central America into the U.S. At a news conference in London, President Donald Trump reiterated that his import taxes on goods from Mexico will start taking effect next week at a level of five per cent, rising to a peak of 25 per cent\u00a0until Mexico complies with his demand to cut off Central America migration.\nPowell noted that the Fed is conducting its first-ever public review of its operations and will focus on ways to improve its rate strategies, the tools it uses to achieve its objectives and the way it communicates its actions to the public.\nHe called persistently low inflation the \"pre-eminent monetary policy challenge of our time,\" because it limits the Fed's ability to support the economy by cutting rates.\nThe current expansion next month will become the longest period of uninterrupted growth in U.S. history, surpassing the 10-year expansion of the 1990s.\nThe Fed manages interest rates to achieve two goals, maximum employment and low inflation. While unemployment has fallen to a 50-year low of 3.6 per cent, inflation has failed to rise to the Fed's target of two\u00a0per cent. The Fed sees that target as the optimal level for annual price increases and worries if the price gains go too far above two\u00a0per cent or fall below that level.\nBut the Fed's efforts to achieve the two\u00a0per cent target have so far failed despite the fact that it kept its key policy rate at a record low near zero for seven years. It began gradually increasing its policy rate in December 2015.\nAfter raising rates nine times, including four hikes last year, it declared in January that it would be \"patient\" in raising rates further. Most analysts believe that it will keep rates unchanged for the rest of the year. Some investors are even beginning to bet that the next move will be a rate cut later this year.\nThe policy rate at the moment is in a range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent, meaning that the Fed has less room to cut rates to stimulate growth.\nWhat the central bank can do to manage the economy when inflation is so low and interest rates have little manoeuvring room will be a key discussion topic at the two-day conference, which features the presentation of a number of academic papers.\n\"Our obligation to the public we serve is to take those measures now that will put us in the best position to deal with our next encounter with the ELB,\" Powell said, referring to the effective lower bound for interest rates.\n\"With the economy growing, unemployment low and inflation low and stable, this is the right time to engage the public broadly on these topics,\" Powell said.\nIn addition to the Chicago conference, the Fed is holding a number of listening sessions around the country to get input from the public.\nPowell said that after this outreach, Fed officials will begin using their regular meetings to discuss possible changes. Private economists believe that the yearlong review is likely result in only modest changes to current Fed policies.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Business sentiment improves after downturn early in year", "description": "Global trade tensions, weakness in oilpatch still hang over Canadian outlook", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/business-sentiment-improves-after-downturn-early-in-year-1.5193924", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2691796.1551385733!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/oil-worker-job.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jun 28, 2019 11:26 AM ET", "2019-06-28T17:04:41.289Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Business sentiment in Canada is improving for the summer of 2019 with companies reporting they expect an increase in sales growth in the coming year with intentions to increase both spending and hiring.\nThe results from the Bank of Canada Business Outlook Survey, taken quarterly,\u00a0reflect the opinions of business leaders across the country.\nA note of caution was the prospect of global trade tensions, with some businesses worried the U.S. will grow more slowly than it could because of Trump's trade war with China.\nStill, the low Canadian dollar is helping companies and they say they expect sustained foreign demand for their products.\nThe central bank's measure for corporate confidence dropped into negative territory earlier this year after economic growth slowed in the wake of a drop in oil prices, but now has returned to its historic average.\nThere was weakness tied to the Western Canadian oil industry with some businesses referring to the uncertainty around future pipeline capacity and production curtailments.\nBusinesses continue to report labour shortages,\u00a0with shortages of skilled or specialized labour such as skilled trades, management positions and engineers.

He says the violence is linked with an increase in property crime, including break-ins and car prowlings.\n\"If you have an addiction, you're using drugs and you have to find a mechanism for supporting that addiction, and that quite often is property-related crime,\" Davidson says.\n\"The violence, quite often, [involves]\u00a0thefts or arguments, so it tends to be, for people who live and sleep rough, very dangerous and very violent.\"\nThe DOAP Team deploys several groups of outreach workers to respond to people with addictions, a service that's meant to relieve pressure on paramedics and police, who would otherwise take the calls.\nThe recent budget cuts will eliminate funding for four of its teams, which typically transport 20,000 people a year from the street to shelters or other places to stay, according to Kathy Christensen, executive director of Alpha House, which runs the DOAP Team.\n\"What that means is that there will be no response outside of the Beltline or downtown at all,\" she says.\n\"There's no other team that is doing this work in the city, so it will get offloaded somewhere, though, and I think it will get offloaded onto an already stretched public service system.

The bank last hiked in October of 2018 but has stood pat for the seven meetings since then. That's a time frame that has seen central banks around the world cut their rates in an attempt to offset the damage from an ongoing trade war.\nSo far, the Bank of Canada has been able to stay on the sidelines. But that may not last.\nBroadly speaking, the bank will cut its rate to stimulate the economy, and it will raise the rate in order to tame inflation. The bank's rate filters down to the broader economy by impacting the rates that Canadian borrowers and savers get for things like mortgage and rate-sensitive investments.\nTD Bank economist Brian DePratto is among those who think the bank is on track for a rate cut sooner rather than later.\n\"Reading between the lines, nearly every positive note in today's statement was balanced by a qualifier,\" he noted.\u00a0\"Even if\u00a0the Bank of Canada has not telegraphed an October rate, we believe the backdrop makes it the most likely outcome.\"\nPrior to the decision, traders thought there was a slight chance of a rate cut. Now that the bank has said it will stand pat for now, however, investors are pricing in about a 50/50 chance of a rate cut next month.\nNot everyone is convinced that will happen.\nJames Laird, president of mortgage brokerage Canwise Financial, said Wednesday he saw nothing in the bank's statement to suggest the bank would be in a rush to lower rates.\n\"This announcement should throw some cold water on the prediction that we could see a rate cut as soon as next month,\" Laird said.\nCurrency investors are similarly skeptical. All things being equal, a rate cut is bad for a country's currency, because it reduces the value of investments in that currency. So if a rate cut is coming, a currency should decline.\nBut that's not what happened on Wednesday. The Canadian dollar jumped up a third of a cent after the Bank of Canada's decision came out. That's a sign that currency investors don't think a cut is imminent.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U.S. Federal Reserve cuts interest rates for 3rd time this year", "description": "The target range for the federal funds is now 1.5\u00a0to 1.75%", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/u-s-federal-reserve-interest-rates-1.5341282", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5341289.1572457524!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/federal-reserve.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 30, 2019 1:48 PM ET", "2019-10-30T19:21:04.765Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for the third time this year to try to sustain the economic expansion in the face of global threats. But it hinted that it won't likely cut again this year.\nThe Fed's move reduces the short-term rate it controls \u2014 which influences many consumer and business loans \u2014 to a range between 1.5 per cent and 1.75 per cent.\nA statement the Fed released after its latest policy meeting removed a key phrase that it has used since June to indicate a future rate cut is likely. This could mean that Fed officials will prefer to leave rates alone while they assess how the economy fares in the months ahead.\nThe economy is in its 11th year of expansion, fuelled by consumer spending and a solid if slightly weakened job market. By cutting rates, the Fed has tried to counter uncertainties heightened by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade conflicts, a weaker global economy and a decline in U.S. manufacturing.\nThe third rate cut of the year has partly reversed the four hikes that the Fed made last year in response to a strengthening economy. That was before rising global risks led the Fed to change course and begin easing credit. Lower rates are intended to encourage more borrowing and spending.\nChairman Jerome Powell has said that the central bank's rate reductions are intended as a kind of insurance against threats to the economy. Powell has pointed to similar rate cuts in 1995 and 1998 as precedents; in both those cases, the Fed cut rates three times. He and most other Fed officials credit their rate cuts with lowering mortgage rates, boosting home sales and generally keeping the economy on track.\nThe Fed is also weighing the consequences of a decline in expectations for inflation. Lower inflation expectations can be self-fulfilling. This can pose a problem for the Fed because its preferred inflation gauge has been stuck below its two\u00a0per cent target for most of the past seven years.\nIn the meantime, Trump, via Twitter, has renewed his attacks on the Fed for not lowering its benchmark rate closer to zero. The president has contrasted the Fed's actions unfavourably with central banks in Europe and Japan, which have slashed their rates into negative territory. Though Trump has argued that this puts the United States at a competitive disadvantage, most economists regard negative rates as a sign of weakness.\nSome international tensions have eased since the Fed previously met in mid-September, which might suggest to some that further rate cuts are less necessary. The U.S. and China reached a temporary trade truce earlier this month and are working on a preliminary agreement that could be signed soon by Trump and President Xi Jinping. It's not clear, though, how meaningful such an agreement might be, and Trump hasn't dropped his threat to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods on Dec. 15.\nAnother source of global tension has been Brexit, which has also eased. The European Union has agreed to delay the deadline for Britain's exit from the trade bloc from Oct. 31 to Jan. 31. That postpones what could have been a hugely disruptive exit, right after the Fed meeting ended, that would likely have damaged the U.K. and European economies.\nThe U.S. economy is still growing, and hiring remains steady, though there have been signs of a slowdown in recent data. Americans cut back on spending at retailers and restaurants last month, a worrisome sign because consumer spending is the leading engine of economic growth. Still, consumer confidence remains high, and shoppers could easily rebound in the coming months.\nAnd businesses have reduced their spending on industrial machinery and other equipment, mostly because the U.S.-China trade war has made them reluctant to commit to big purchases. The tariffs and retaliatory tariffs between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies, have also reduced U.S. exports.\nEarlier Wednesday, the government estimated that the economy grew at a tepid but steady 1.9 per cent annual rate during the July-September quarter.\nThe job market remains sturdy, with the unemployment rate at just 3.5 per cent, the lowest in 50 years. On Friday, the government will report on employment growth for October. Steady hiring and decent wage gains should help underpin consumer spending in coming months, keeping the economy expanding. That could keep the Fed on the sidelines.\nThe housing market has also improved, after slumping in 2018, thanks in part to the Fed's rate cuts. Mortgage rates have fallen more than a full percentage point from a year ago, on average, for a 30-year fixed rate loan.\nThat's helped boost sales of existing homes while sales of new homes have soared. Auto purchases, another interest rate-sensitive industry, have also picked up.\n"}, {"author": "Drew Anderson", "title": "Bank of Canada flags Alberta economic challenges in latest update", "description": "Crown corporation anticipates province will stablilize next year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bank-of-canada-rate-alberta-economy-1.5341199", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5206396.1562761904!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/boc-economy-20190709.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 30, 2019 12:24 PM MT", "2019-10-30T19:51:12.161Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Bank of Canada opted to maintain interest rates on Wednesday, peering out at global uncertainty from a relatively healthy Canadian economy, but it warned Alberta is still adjusting to its new reality.\u00a0\nThe province\u00a0still hasn't fully recovered from the steep drop in the price of oil and is losing ground to the rest of the country, where most markers show strength, according to the bank.\u00a0\n\"Even as the savings rate has been edging higher, high energy producing regions continue to struggle as the full adjustment to the decline in oil prices back in 2015 is not yet complete and transportation constraints are making the situation worse,\" Bank of Canada\u00a0governor Stephen Poloz\u00a0said.\u00a0\n\"The strong labour market points to sources of growth such as information technology and other professional services, tourism, education, health care, financial services.\"\nPoloz did say Alberta is expected to rebound next year as the adjustments to the price crash take hold.\u00a0\nThe bank warned that the recent Alberta budget could weigh on national economic growth due to the \"lower spending profile.\"\nStill, despite continued rates of high unemployment in energy dependent regions and a housing market in Alberta that's still adjusting to the new reality, there is hope from the central bank.\u00a0\n\"At the same time, there's also signs of stabilizing,\" said Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the bank.\u00a0\n\"It's a pretty difficult adjustment, but we're happy to see that at least on the wage side that wage growth picked up overall in Canada and wage growth in those particular regions has has also picked up to kind of meet the Canadian average.\"\nWilkins said with new capacity coming online, including from Enbridge's Line 3 pipeline, energy investment is expected to stabilize after plummeting from 30 per cent of Canadian GDP to 15 per cent.\u00a0\nThe bank maintained its interest rate at 1.75 per cent.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Powell hints Federal Reserve will cut rates if needed over trade wars", "description": "Expectations are rising that the Fed will cut rates at least once and possibly twice before year's end", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/powell-fed-trump-trade-conflicts-1.5161417", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5161424.1559657489!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/federal-reserve-powell.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 04, 2019 10:14 AM ET", "2019-06-04T16:17:29.287Z"], "source": null, "content": "Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the Federal Reserve is prepared to respond to the Trump administration's trade conflicts to protect the U.S. economy, signalling that the Fed will cut interest rates if necessary.\nPowell's comments gave a lift to stock markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average up over 400 points at mid-day.\nSpeaking at a Fed conference in Chicago, Powell said, \"We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\"\nPowell didn't explicitly say what the Fed would do if it concluded that the administration's trade conflicts were damaging the economy. But expectations are rising that the Fed will cut rates at least once and possibly twice before year's end, in part because of the consequences of the trade war. There is also concern that the U.S. economy faces a growing risk of a recession.\nTrump has imposed far-reaching tariffs on imports on China, which has retaliated with tariffs of its own on U.S. exports. He has also threatened to impose an escalating series of tariffs against Mexico unless Mexico stops a flow of migrants from Central America into the U.S. At a news conference in London, President Donald Trump reiterated that his import taxes on goods from Mexico will start taking effect next week at a level of five per cent, rising to a peak of 25 per cent\u00a0until Mexico complies with his demand to cut off Central America migration.\nPowell noted that the Fed is conducting its first-ever public review of its operations and will focus on ways to improve its rate strategies, the tools it uses to achieve its objectives and the way it communicates its actions to the public.\nHe called persistently low inflation the \"pre-eminent monetary policy challenge of our time,\" because it limits the Fed's ability to support the economy by cutting rates.\nThe current expansion next month will become the longest period of uninterrupted growth in U.S. history, surpassing the 10-year expansion of the 1990s.\nThe Fed manages interest rates to achieve two goals, maximum employment and low inflation. While unemployment has fallen to a 50-year low of 3.6 per cent, inflation has failed to rise to the Fed's target of two\u00a0per cent. The Fed sees that target as the optimal level for annual price increases and worries if the price gains go too far above two\u00a0per cent or fall below that level.\nBut the Fed's efforts to achieve the two\u00a0per cent target have so far failed despite the fact that it kept its key policy rate at a record low near zero for seven years. It began gradually increasing its policy rate in December 2015.\nAfter raising rates nine times, including four hikes last year, it declared in January that it would be \"patient\" in raising rates further. Most analysts believe that it will keep rates unchanged for the rest of the year. Some investors are even beginning to bet that the next move will be a rate cut later this year.\nThe policy rate at the moment is in a range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent, meaning that the Fed has less room to cut rates to stimulate growth.\nWhat the central bank can do to manage the economy when inflation is so low and interest rates have little manoeuvring room will be a key discussion topic at the two-day conference, which features the presentation of a number of academic papers.\n\"Our obligation to the public we serve is to take those measures now that will put us in the best position to deal with our next encounter with the ELB,\" Powell said, referring to the effective lower bound for interest rates.\n\"With the economy growing, unemployment low and inflation low and stable, this is the right time to engage the public broadly on these topics,\" Powell said.\nIn addition to the Chicago conference, the Fed is holding a number of listening sessions around the country to get input from the public.\nPowell said that after this outreach, Fed officials will begin using their regular meetings to discuss possible changes.

Rob Davidson says.\nThe cuts are part of a temporary provincial budget that's in place until the Kenney government passes its first formal budget this fall.

He says the violence is linked with an increase in property crime, including break-ins and car prowlings.\n\"If you have an addiction, you're using drugs and you have to find a mechanism for supporting that addiction, and that quite often is property-related crime,\" Davidson says.\n\"The violence, quite often, [involves]\u00a0thefts or arguments, so it tends to be, for people who live and sleep rough, very dangerous and very violent.\"\nThe DOAP Team deploys several groups of outreach workers to respond to people with addictions, a service that's meant to relieve pressure on paramedics and police, who would otherwise take the calls.\nThe recent budget cuts will eliminate funding for four of its teams, which typically transport 20,000 people a year from the street to shelters or other places to stay, according to Kathy Christensen, executive director of Alpha House, which runs the DOAP Team.\n\"What that means is that there will be no response outside of the Beltline or downtown at all,\" she says.\n\"There's no other team that is doing this work in the city, so it will get offloaded somewhere, though, and I think it will get offloaded onto an already stretched public service system. And that would be Calgary [Police] Service and Emergency Medical Services.\"\nChristensen says the cuts are expected to come in two waves, starting with a relatively small blow in September. She hopes her group can find funding elsewhere allowing all DOAP teams to remain active through the winter. But bigger cuts are expected this spring, which will lead to the reduced patrols and response.\nDiana Krecsy, chief executive of the Calgary Homeless Foundation, has said local agencies will continue to house current clients, but the cuts will hamper efforts to prevent others from becoming homeless.\nKrecsy says she hopes the province's upcoming budget will restore the cuts and even increase funding for her foundation.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "As the U.S. economy tilts toward concern, Canada's is on the upswing: Don Pittis", "description": "Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell holds interest rates steady, but opens the door to future cuts", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fed-canada-poloz-1.5178457", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5182082.1560977327!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-fed.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 20, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-06-20T08:00:00.423Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Every time Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell meets the media for a monetary policy announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump is the ghost at the feast.\nWhile\u00a0the world's most powerful central banker did not actually cut rates Wednesday, as Trump has repeatedly ordered him to do, Powell\u00a0saw it as a real possibility this time around \u2014\u00a0but only if the economy gets worse.\nFor Canadians, the strange new thing\u00a0is that while the Fed chair talked to reporters about a U.S. economy going off the boil, Canada's is showing renewed strength.

That's up nine per cent from 2017.\nHowever, the city saw considerably fewer homicides than in the previous years.\nThe number of homicides in Calgary dropped from 29 in 2017 to\u00a018 in 2018\u00a0\u2014 the lowest in at least five years.\u00a0\nThat mirrored a broader decline provincewide. \nThere were 32 per cent fewer homicides reported in Alberta, dropping from 119 in 2017 to 81 in 2018. \nProvincewide, both the crime severity index and the overall crime rate were unchanged year over year to 2018 as other categories of crime saw steep declines.\nAlberta's uptick in shoplifting, along with similar spikes in Manitoba and Ontario, also combined to push up the national crime severity index, Statistics Canada said.\nNationally, compared with\u00a02008, the rate of shoplifting in\u00a02018\u00a0was up\u00a042 per cent, while other types of theft of property worth $5,000\u00a0or under decreased\u00a023 per cent.\nThe agency said the overall crime rate was up two per cent over last year, with over two million incidents reported by police in 2018. That works out to a rate of 5,488 incidents per 100,000 people.\nThe severity of crime also rose by two per cent, according to Statistics Canada.\nHowever, Statistics Canada noted both the rate and severity of crime were still substantially lower than they were a decade ago, both down 17 per cent since 2008.\nThe crime rate in Canada peaked in 1991 and has been in dramatic decline since then, falling by more than 50 per cent until 2014. Since 2014, however, the rate is up just over eight per cent. Most of the movement in the crime rate is the result of changes in non-violent crime.\nThe increase in the severity of crime from 2017 to 2018 was driven largely by higher rates of fraud, shoplifting and other thefts, the agency said.\nBut while violent crime overall increased, the homicide rate reversed an upward trend over the last few years by declining by four per cent in 2018.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Retailers foresee holiday joy \u2014 even as Poloz looks to hold line on rates: Don Pittis", "description": "While the world cuts interest rates, the Bank of Canada likely won't if we keep shopping", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-poloz-retail-1.5381037", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5381165.1575312823!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winter-toronto-real-estate.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 03, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-03T09:00:00.543Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "South of the border, there was much hand-wringing that a shortened holiday spending season this year just wouldn't give our American cousins enough time to shop till they drop.\nAccording to some retail analysts, a late Thanksgiving meant a late Black Friday, viewed as the starting gun for the U.S. Christmas spending frenzy.\nOf course, Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving a month earlier and don't quite have that same special Friday to shop, shop,\u00a0shop.\u00a0But there is reason to think the season of retail therapy\u00a0that is also a phenomenon here will give Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz one less reason to cut interest rates.\nMost analysts expect Poloz to hold rates steady at 1.75 per cent tomorrow, and sturdy consumer spending is part of the rationale.\nFigures released last week\u00a0show\u00a0that despite an overall decline to 1.3 per cent in Canadian GDP,\u00a0housing, consumer activity, construction and business investment were all\u00a0holding up well.\nExports were down, but that could be partly blamed\u00a0on a leaky\u00a0pipeline that interrupted oil shipments and a General Motors\u00a0strike that reduced the need for Canadian parts.\nFinal holiday retail figures don't\u00a0come out till the new year, but there are several signs Canadians remain in a spending mood. And that's despite Retail\u00a0Council of Canada research that shows 18 per cent of Canadians plan to spend less\u00a0than they have in the past.\nClearly, what you say to someone taking a survey doesn't always pan out.\nFigures from last year show\u00a0more than one-quarter (27%) of those surveyed\u00a0ended up spending more in 2018\u00a0than they had planned. Only six per cent spent less.\nOverall spending is expected to rise substantially in 2019, says the council's Michael LeBlanc.\nAccording to\u00a0Statistics Canada, consumer spending picked up in the three-month period ending in October. We can't be certain that consumer optimism will continue, but a long run of job creation and growing wages seem to point in that direction.\nCertainly, analysis from Adobe Analytics\u00a0shows that fears of a short U.S. shopping season seems to have\u00a0only increased\u00a0appetite for a consumption binge, as shoppers spent record amounts online.\nIn the U.S.\u00a0too\u00a0consumer spending has been one of the mainstays of the economy, even as trade and business investment weakened.\nWhile frigid weather and storms\u00a0can drive people away from the shops, a layer of snow\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like what landed on parts of the country\u00a0this week\u00a0\u2014\u00a0seems to stimulate the holiday shopping impulse.\nA spendy holiday season is\u00a0important to retailers, those who invest in them, and to people who worry whether consumers can keep the economy afloat for a few more months as we wait for what some foresee as an economic revival. A\u00a0rule of thumb says that one-quarter of overall retail sales during\u00a0the entire year come in the days before Christmas as people splurge on themselves and others.\nThere are signs that so long as housing remains\u00a0on the rise and consumers keep spending,\u00a0Poloz will be in no mood to cut Canada's interest rates. As he and his deputy, Carolyn Wilkins, have warned in the past, lower rates\u00a0that make borrowing cheaper may not be good for Canadians,\u00a0who, as a group,\u00a0have already borrowed too much.\nIf the next round of stimulus must come from fiscal spending, as the OECD has suggested, Poloz may decide to delay rate cuts well into the new year to see what impact government spending will have. (Thursday's speech from the throne may give a better idea of fiscal spending to come.)\nSome economists have said that if Friday's unemployment numbers show us that the recent trend toward more jobs and fewer jobless is interrupted, it\u00a0may be the first sign that the Canadian economy really does need\u00a0a rate cut. So far, retail bank economists have offered wildly different predictions on whether the economy will gain or lose employment this time around.\u00a0\nAnd in the\u00a0way that economies are recognized as self-reinforcing, expectations of a bumper holiday retail season will help contribute to economic strength\u00a0\u2014\u00a0particularly as retailers shake the branches for extra staff in an economy where workers are, so far, still in short supply.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "If COVID-19 creates an economic crisis, many see stimulus as a chance for change: Don Pittis", "description": "Morneau and others must decide whether to use bailouts to perpetuate what some see as an ailing status quo", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-oil-coronavirus-1.5492214", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5492728.1583866930!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/saudi-aramco-stocks.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Mar 11, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-11T18:12:32.106Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As usual, the worst possible time to understand\u00a0what's happening in an economic shakeup\u00a0is when you are smack dab in the middle of it.\nAs in previous financial disruptions, the sudden transition from \"everything's fine\" to \"hold onto your hat\" comes\u00a0as a rude surprise not just to ordinary folks at home, but to sophisticated market participants with reams of data and research at their fingertips\u00a0\u2014 those who you would think should have known better.\nOnly weeks\u00a0ago, we were being reassured by U.S.\u00a0President Donald Trump that the North American economy would be little affected by the coronavirus.\u00a0\"The market's in great shape,\" he then said last Tuesday after the first stock declines.\nAll at once, even before COVID-19 had\u00a0made major inroads into the U.S. (or Canada), markets were in turmoil with businesses\u00a0demanding bailouts.\nEven for those who prefer\u00a0Trump's predictions,\u00a0it is hard to know who to believe.\u00a0\nCredible voices are telling investors to sit tight, because everything will bounce back once\u00a0this novel\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0fades away.

It's leading some economists to call on the government to prioritize some tools over others, and to consider at least one unprecedented economic strategy.\nThe unredacted portions of the memo don't cite any specific recession warning signs\u00a0\u2014 but the document does note that, since the 1970s, Canada has experienced four significant recessions, one per decade. Canada's last recession happened in 2008-09, triggered by the U.S. housing bubble.\n\"Of note, Canada has never experienced a significant recession that was not also suffered by the United States,\" the briefing note says.\n\"On average, since the 1970s, recessions in Canada resulted in the equivalent of 550,000 job losses and a 4 per cent decline in real GDP.\"\nNow, the fallout from the United Kingdom's protracted political brawl over leaving the European Union, trade disputes between the U.S and other countries and the ongoing protests in Hong Kong have some business analysts\u00a0predicting economic turmoil.\nThe\u00a0latest GDP figures\u00a0show Canada's economic growth in the third quarter slowed due to a drop in exports. Statistics Canada reported last week that Canada's real gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 1.3 per cent in the last three months, compared with 3.7\u00a0per cent in the previous quarter.\nThe briefing note gives Morneau an overview of\u00a0the tools he and Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz could use in the event of an economic downturn. They include\u00a0reducing interest rates below zero\u00a0\u2014 so-called \"negative\" interest rates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0increasing government spending, offering more grants to businesses and households and increasing the money supply through quantitative and credit easing.\nThe memo outlines the \"proposed sequencing of policy tools should Canada experience a recession.\" The details are blanked out in the document obtained by CBC News because, since they contain advice by or for\u00a0a government institution or cabinet minister, they are exempted from access laws.\nEconomists who spoke with\u00a0CBC News said the Department of Finance and the Bank of Canada can't expect the playbook they used the 2008-09 recession to work next time.\nConference Board of Canada Chief Economist Pedro Antunes said strategies such as lowering interest rates (already at record lows) and quantitative easing weren't as effective as expected during the last downturn \u2014 and won't help pull Canada out of the next economic downturn, either.\n'Quantitative easing' involves\u00a0central banks buying assets\u00a0such as government and corporate bonds from commercial banks and financial institutions, increasing the supply of money in the system. The goal is to lower interest rates and leave financial institutions flush\u00a0with cash, which (in theory)\u00a0should allow them to lend more to stimulate economic activity.\n\"We really didn't see that having a big impact globally or in Canada, in terms of driving investment,\" Antunes said. \"It was more of a consumer-led kind of recovery.\"\nAntunes and other economists said stimulus backfired in the last recession: instead of expanding their businesses and hiring more people, businesses seemed to hoard the injection of new money created through the monetary policy of central banks.\nAlthough the briefing note touches on this point, Antunes\u00a0said he would have liked to see infrastructure investment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which spurs private sector\u00a0spending and job creation\u00a0\u2014 play a more prominent role in the government's recession toolkit.\nThe Fraser Institute, however, argues that since it takes years for infrastructure projects to get built, they're not that useful\u00a0in fighting recessions. The centre-right think tank points out that, before workers are hired and the first shovel hits the ground, such projects have to go through feasibility studies, design changes, legislative funding allocations\u00a0and consultations with Indigenous communities, provinces, territories and municipalities before they even make it to tender.\n\"I think the evidence is overwhelmingly clear that it's almost impossible to do that in a short period of time,\" said Jason Clemens, the Fraser Institute's executive vice president. \"And so, by the time those projects get shovels in the ground, the recession is over.\"\nThe Liberal government isn't helping matters by racking up back-to-back deficits, which could tie its hands when the next recession hits, Clemens said.\nThe sections of the briefing note that are not blacked out say nothing about how\u00a0the Liberals would manage deficits and debt during a recession.\nClemens said the government should rely on automatic stabilizers like Employment Insurance \u2014 which ramps up spending when the number of jobless Canadians increases\u00a0\u2014 to keep the economy on an even keel.\nBut David Macdonald, an economist with the\u00a0Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives,\u00a0said EI doesn't always help the people who need it most because some Canadians \u2014 the self-employed and workers who don't receive enough hours \u2014 don't qualify for benefits.\nThat's why he and at least one European economic think tank are calling for an \"unprecedented\" response to the next recession: central banks, working with finance ministers, giving money directly to businesses or citizens. Governments typically deliver such benefits to citizens, not the Bank of Canada.\n\"Everyone gets $100 or $200 a month, or lower-income families get more and upper-income families get less,\" Macdonald said.\nEconomists acknowledge this \"helicopter money\" concept is an extreme form of economic stimulus.

Many of those are located near the airport, including the\u00a0247-room Westin\u00a0and 127-room Hyatt Place.\n\"It's true, we've built a lot of new hotels,\" said Peggy Athans, the association's executive director.\nSince late 2014, she said the hospitality industry has seen a decline in the number of business travellers and that's prompted a renewed push for conferences and all the delegates that come with them.\nThe hotel association collected $10 million\u00a0last year through a marketing fee that is charged by Calgary hotel operators. The money is used to promote Calgary as a destination.\n\"In 2018 alone, we secured 53 conferences that will be held here in future years,\" Athans said.\u00a0\n\"We have a lot of supply but we also have, I think, what's in place to move us forward when the economy turns around.\"\nIn addition to all of the new hotel rooms the industry has to fill, Athans\u00a0said it's also competing with a rapidly growing number of home rentals through popular sites such as Airbnb.\n\"We have probably, with the growing short-term rental market, 4,000 units in short-term rentals,\" she said. \"So\u00a0yeah, there is a lot of supply.\"\nThe association says there are currently 101 hotels in Calgary with a total of 15,470 rooms. Two new hotels under construction near the airport will add another 217\u00a0rooms next year.\nAthans doesn't expect to see as much new hotel construction over the next little while.\n\"I think we are going to see it slow down in the short term.\"\nAt least one major hotel project is being delayed in downtown Calgary.\nThe Dorian, originally set to open late next year, has had its planned opening date put off until early 2022, according to PBA Land and Development, the company behind the project.\nIt says the economic downturn was longer and deeper than previous ones and it wanted to make sure the recovery is sustainable and not merely a \"blip.\"\n\"We are taking a long-term view for our product, and also using projections that contemplate a longer, slower recovery to the hospitality market,\" said Andrew Boblin, a senior vice president with the company.\nConstruction on the $100-million, 308-room hotel at 525 Fifth\u00a0Avenue S.W. is now set to start this fall.\u00a0\nAs for Kwong's request for the industry to stop building, he says he'd like to see the city's occupancy rate remain at\u00a070 per cent for at least a year before he would suggest more rooms could be added.\nBryan Labby is an enterprise reporter with CBC Calgary.

There were renewed warnings about the inverted yield curve, which, almost bizarrely, has moved from economic arcana to bar chatter. Banks in Denmark offered to pay interest to mortgage seekers to encourage them to\u00a0borrow money. The world seemed to have turned upside down.\nAnd whether we are whistling past the graveyard, or somehow strangely sheltered from the global economic turmoil, there are plenty of\u00a0indications Canada is not following a path insinuated by the past week's gnashing of teeth. At least not yet.\n\"We are currently at a time of a lot of uncertainty,\" said economist Farah\u00a0Omran\u00a0last week. \"Domestically the Canadian economy is doing fine. Housing seems to be rebounding while employment is good.\"\nOmran, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute, a Canadian economic think-tank, was co-author of a report last month examining why Canadian inflation was out of sync with the wider economy.\nOne factor, the research concluded, was\u00a0that economic improvements for those with lower income\u00a0tended to spur higher inflation, because people strapped for cash\u00a0are more likely to spend everything. That spending helps to bid up prices.\nWhen the economy instead is rewarding\u00a0people at the high end, they are more likely to invest than spend, and inflation stays lower.\nAnd while the latest employment\u00a0numbers showed Canada lost jobs, employers are still crying out for workers to fill some 400,000\u00a0empty\u00a0positions\u00a0if only they could find the right people.\n\"Employment is still strong and wage growth actually went up really well,\" said Omran. \"It was the strongest increase in wages since 2009.\"\nBut as Omran\u00a0said, in a complicated world, no single cause shapes the inflation figure.\nIn general, higher inflation is a sign of a strong economy, showing that consumers and businesses are using up spare capacity, including labour.\nBut when food prices fall because the Canadian harvest comes in, that makes people better off while recirculating money in the domestic economy. Energy costs, which have been falling in spite of fear mongering over carbon pricing, have a dual effect, making consumers better off but starving the oil-producing regions\u00a0of income and jobs.\nOn Friday a poll of bank economists by the business wire service Bloomberg\u00a0showed a consensus that inflation would fall from two\u00a0per cent\u00a0to 1.6 per cent, with\u00a0retail sales declining by 0.3\u00a0per cent, as falling auto sales weighed on dealers.\nHowever, gloomy prognostications south of the border did not pan out. Last week U.S. core inflation, a figure that leaves out volatile food and energy prices, rose sharply for the second month running. On Thursday, sharply higher retail sales surprised U.S. markets, seemingly indicating that consumers have not been put off by global signs of distress.\nAs to the wider machinations of the global economy, Omran says they will have an effect in Canada. New economic stimulus abroad in the form of low or negative interest rates will make Canadian imports cheaper, pushing inflation lower. But by pumping up the economy they may also stimulate foreign demand, including for Canadian products.\nA general\u00a0weakening in global\u00a0manufacturing, notably in Germany and China,\u00a0damaged\u00a0by the U.S.-China trade battle, may hit Canadian exports of raw materials, though there will still likely be demand for products such as food and gold.\u00a0\nA general fall in demand for oil is likely to hit expensive producers first, one possible reason why the Koch brothers sold out of Canadian\u00a0oilsands investments earlier this month.\nSo far the Canadian and the North American economy, based on services and on trade within the NAFTA area and most of all dependent on consumer spending,\u00a0has\u00a0been relatively\u00a0isolated from oddities such as\u00a0negative mortgage\u00a0rates.\nBut with consumers so crucial to the economy, negative headlines and global gloom may already be having an effect.\nNew data from the U.S. released on Friday showed that consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in seven months, partly motivated by interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, said Richard Curtin, the economist in charge of the survey conducted by the University of Michigan.\u00a0\n\"Consumers concluded, following the Fed's lead, that they may need to reduce spending in anticipation of a potential recession,\" said Curtin.\nIronically, the rate cuts that U.S. President Donald Trump championed as a means of stimulating\u00a0the economy may actually be having the opposite effect.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "David Thurton ", "title": "'Secret' memo outlines tools the finance department and Bank of Canada could use in a recession", "description": "Economists say Ottawa needs a new playbook to tackle the next global recession", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/finance-briefing-note-recession-economists-1.5368356", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4848866.1538585219!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/markets-japan-stocks.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 06, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-06T13:48:42.948Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "An internal memo addressed to federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau in August outlined a range of fiscal and monetary policies the Liberals and the Bank of Canada could employ in the event of \"economic shocks\" \u2014 a range that includes\u00a0lowering interest rates even further and relying on Employment Insurance.\nThe August memo, marked \"secret,\" was released to CBC last month through the federal Access to Information Act. It's leading some economists to call on the government to prioritize some tools over others, and to consider at least one unprecedented economic strategy.\nThe unredacted portions of the memo don't cite any specific recession warning signs\u00a0\u2014 but the document does note that, since the 1970s, Canada has experienced four significant recessions, one per decade. Canada's last recession happened in 2008-09, triggered by the U.S. housing bubble.\n\"Of note, Canada has never experienced a significant recession that was not also suffered by the United States,\" the briefing note says.\n\"On average, since the 1970s, recessions in Canada resulted in the equivalent of 550,000 job losses and a 4 per cent decline in real GDP.\"\nNow, the fallout from the United Kingdom's protracted political brawl over leaving the European Union, trade disputes between the U.S and other countries and the ongoing protests in Hong Kong have some business analysts\u00a0predicting economic turmoil.\nThe\u00a0latest GDP figures\u00a0show Canada's economic growth in the third quarter slowed due to a drop in exports. Statistics Canada reported last week that Canada's real gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 1.3 per cent in the last three months, compared with 3.7\u00a0per cent in the previous quarter.\nThe briefing note gives Morneau an overview of\u00a0the tools he and Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz could use in the event of an economic downturn. They include\u00a0reducing interest rates below zero\u00a0\u2014 so-called \"negative\" interest rates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0increasing government spending, offering more grants to businesses and households and increasing the money supply through quantitative and credit easing.\nThe memo outlines the \"proposed sequencing of policy tools should Canada experience a recession.\" The details are blanked out in the document obtained by CBC News because, since they contain advice by or for\u00a0a government institution or cabinet minister, they are exempted from access laws.\nEconomists who spoke with\u00a0CBC News said the Department of Finance and the Bank of Canada can't expect the playbook they used the 2008-09 recession to work next time.\nConference Board of Canada Chief Economist Pedro Antunes said strategies such as lowering interest rates (already at record lows) and quantitative easing weren't as effective as expected during the last downturn \u2014 and won't help pull Canada out of the next economic downturn, either.\n'Quantitative easing' involves\u00a0central banks buying assets\u00a0such as government and corporate bonds from commercial banks and financial institutions, increasing the supply of money in the system. The goal is to lower interest rates and leave financial institutions flush\u00a0with cash, which (in theory)\u00a0should allow them to lend more to stimulate economic activity.\n\"We really didn't see that having a big impact globally or in Canada, in terms of driving investment,\" Antunes said. \"It was more of a consumer-led kind of recovery.\"\nAntunes and other economists said stimulus backfired in the last recession: instead of expanding their businesses and hiring more people, businesses seemed to hoard the injection of new money created through the monetary policy of central banks.\nAlthough the briefing note touches on this point, Antunes\u00a0said he would have liked to see infrastructure investment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which spurs private sector\u00a0spending and job creation\u00a0\u2014 play a more prominent role in the government's recession toolkit.\nThe Fraser Institute, however, argues that since it takes years for infrastructure projects to get built, they're not that useful\u00a0in fighting recessions. The centre-right think tank points out that, before workers are hired and the first shovel hits the ground, such projects have to go through feasibility studies, design changes, legislative funding allocations\u00a0and consultations with Indigenous communities, provinces, territories and municipalities before they even make it to tender.\n\"I think the evidence is overwhelmingly clear that it's almost impossible to do that in a short period of time,\" said Jason Clemens, the Fraser Institute's executive vice president. \"And so, by the time those projects get shovels in the ground, the recession is over.\"\nThe Liberal government isn't helping matters by racking up back-to-back deficits, which could tie its hands when the next recession hits, Clemens said.\nThe sections of the briefing note that are not blacked out say nothing about how\u00a0the Liberals would manage deficits and debt during a recession.\nClemens said the government should rely on automatic stabilizers like Employment Insurance \u2014 which ramps up spending when the number of jobless Canadians increases\u00a0\u2014 to keep the economy on an even keel.\nBut David Macdonald, an economist with the\u00a0Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives,\u00a0said EI doesn't always help the people who need it most because some Canadians \u2014 the self-employed and workers who don't receive enough hours \u2014 don't qualify for benefits.\nThat's why he and at least one European economic think tank are calling for an \"unprecedented\" response to the next recession: central banks, working with finance ministers, giving money directly to businesses or citizens. Governments typically deliver such benefits to citizens, not the Bank of Canada.\n\"Everyone gets $100 or $200 a month, or lower-income families get more and upper-income families get less,\" Macdonald said.\nEconomists acknowledge this \"helicopter money\" concept is an extreme form of economic stimulus. Still, it's been suggested by former U.S. Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke as a strategy to fight deflation.\n\"This is something that's starting to be discussed but hasn't been implemented,\" Macdonald said. \"But I think these are the types of things that the Bank of Canada is certainly thinking about going into the next recession.\"\nEconomist and columnist Erica Ifill\u00a0notes the toolkit doesn't seem to have anything to say about the sorts of\u00a0targeted regional strategies the government or the Bank of Canada could undertake to stimulate regional economies.\n\"I don't see in the briefing note the economic position of the West and any analysis around that,\" Ifill said. \"I'm really concerned with the West suffering, as they are right now, that the federal government is not looking at them as a specific case.\"\nIfill is calling on both the federal government and the Bank of Canada to consider economic stimulus packages tailored for Canada's regions.\nA Department of Finance spokesperson downplayed the significance of the memo, saying that economic growth in Canada remains stable\u00a0and unemployment is low.\n\"This note provides an update on the department's work on the general mechanics of the federal government toolkit to respond to potential slowdowns in the economy,\" said ministerial spokesperson Pierre-Olivier Herbert.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Houses in New Brunswick selling at unusually fast rate", "description": "Increase in home sales backed by record-setting month in May", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-real-estate-housing-market-sales-growth-1.5201871", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5165054.1559841646!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/open-house-housing-realtor-real-estate-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 05, 2019 4:41 PM AT", "2019-07-05T19:41:33.666Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "New Brunswick homes are selling at the fastest rate in 10 years, creating a demand for supply that has agents hitting the streets in search of new listings, according to the New Brunswick Real Estate Association.\nThe rise in sales is backed by the best month the association has ever recorded. In May, 1,124 units were sold, an all-time record and 24.6 per cent higher than May 2018.\nThe numbers for June are still being crunched, but association president Sheila Henry said sales should remain high for much of 2019.\u00a0\n\"What we're seeing essentially is a great situation for sellers in New Brunswick,\" Henry told Information Morning Fredericton on Friday.\n\"Basically what's going on if you've got a home in good condition in a good location, and you've priced it well, it's going to sell fast and, as such, demand is still there.\"\nShe said housing supply is low, make situations ripe for multiple offers.\nThe year-to-date figures, gathered by the Canadian Real Estate Association, are also strong. A total of 3,622 units were sold across New Brunswick in the first five months of the year \u2014 a 20.3 per cent increase from the same period in 2018.\nThe trend has been felt acutely in the capital city. Home sales in Fredericton have outpaced the first five months of 2018 by 58 per cent. In Moncton, the increase was 23.7 per cent and 11.6 per cent in Saint John.\nThe association's other district \u2014 Northern Region and Valley \u2014 was the only one to see a decline in year-over-year sales, which dipped 6.7 per cent.\u00a0\nHenry said there are several factors at play, including more people coming, or returning, to New Brunswick.\u00a0\nThe \"mixed bag\" of buyers include U.S. making the most of the exchange rate or escaping the current political climate, people coming home to retire, and Canadian workers heading east for \"very good jobs here.\"\nNew Brunswick also has the lowest average home price in the country.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date average sale price rose to $180,385, a 4.8 per cent jump from the first five months of 2018.\nAccording the national association, the average price for sales in May 2019 jumped to $192,848, from $177,272 in May 2018.\nThe closest average price in another Canadian jurisdiction in May 2019 was $233,456 in Newfoundland and Labrador. The average price in Prince Edward Island was $242,318 and $252,442 in Nova Scotia.\n\"People who are coming back, let's say, to retire and they've been out in Calgary for a while or whatever,\" said Henry. \"What you've sold your home for in Calgary buys you a lovely property here with money to spare.\"\nThe average price of a home in Alberta is roughly $200,000 higher than in New Brunswick. That gap jumps to more than $400,000 in Ontario and more than $500,000 in British Columbia.\nHenry said the housing sector was also under the impression interest rates would jump this year.\n\"But that really hasn't happened,\" she said. \"So that makes it even better for the home buyer because your dollar buys a little more.\"\u00a0\nHenry said if the listing is \"reasonably priced\" it will sell fast. Sellers who hear of the high demand may be tempted to raise the asking price, she said, but they could face a much longer time on the market.\n\"If you've got a realtor who can come into your home and give you an analysis based on what's been selling, because that's always really the bottom line when it comes to it,\" Henry said, \"what we've been seeing is if those homes are properly priced, they've been selling quicker and they've been getting approximately 97 per cent of their asking price.\"\nThe high demand is supported by a decrease in housing stock. The Canadian Real Estate Association reported a total of 5,648 active MLS listings at the end of May \u2014 a 17.5 per cent drop from this point last year and an 11-year low.\nA decrease in listings balances the market, Henry said, but it has also forced agents to rethink how they operate.\n\"You get somewhat more back to basics, if I can call it that,\" Henry said.\u00a0\n\"You go door knocking.

Brad Bradford secured the budget committee's backing for his call\u00a0for more information on potential revenue the city could gain by adding\u00a0a new Municipal Land Transfer Tax (MLTT) rate tier for high-valued\u00a0homes.\nBack in 2019, a coalition of councillors\u00a0\u2014 Bradford, Ana Bailao, and Joe Cressy\u00a0\u2014 first pitched the concept as a way to offer more housing allowances to vulnerable residents.\nThe councillors called for a new top tier of three\u00a0per cent for homes valued at more than $3 million, going beyond the current top tier of a 2.5 per cent tax for homes valued at more than $2 million, with buyers footing the bill.\nFor every $1 million generated in revenue, the plan could add 200 households to the allowance program, the trio said at the time.\n\"MLTT, and the idea of pairing that with supportive housing, is the notion of housing paying for housing,\" Bradford said on Friday.\nHe also expects calls for a vacancy tax on properties sitting empty\u00a0\u2014 a move Bailao and Cressy also support, and which Mayor John Tory has talked about\u00a0exploring since 2017\u00a0\u2014 will be\u00a0\"introduced in subsequent budget meetings.\"\nThe increased pressure to explore the options also comes amid debate over which\u00a0could be a better fit for Toronto.\nBradford said while the city should consider both revenue tools, MLTT\u00a0is an \"imperfect mechanism\" to fund Toronto's operating budget since there's variability year over year, given the swings in the housing market.\nSome real estate watchers also warn it could have unintended consequences. \"It starts making it harder for people to upsize from one home to another, which tightens up the supply a little bit in the more affordable segment,\" said Realosophy president John Pasalis.\nIt would, however, be \"very easy for the city to implement\" since the system for it already exists, noted Michal Hay, executive director of advocacy group Progress Toronto.\nAs for a vacant home tax, Hay is among those stepping up external pressure on city hall, with her organization launching a campaign and petition backing the move on Friday.\u00a0\n\"If you can afford a home that's more than $3 million, you can afford to invest more into making the city more livable,\" she said.\nThe City of Vancouver raised an estimated $38\u00a0million in the first year of its Empty Homes Tax that was first\u00a0imposed\u00a0in 2016, Bailao previously told CBC Toronto.\n\"You have the added benefit from a policy perspective of reducing vacant homes in the city,\" Bradford said. \"You reintroduce those properties back into the supply.\"\nSo where does Toronto's mayor\u00a0stand?\n\"I do not believe it is appropriate to rush into any new or modified taxes without proper information on the implications from our professional City staff,\" Tory said in a statement to CBC Toronto on Friday.\nStaff were already studying the possibility of changes to the MLTT, he noted, while Tory himself worked to secure changes from the province to open the door for the introduction of a vacant home tax.\n\"From the beginning there have been a number of concerns and then complexities involved with the implementation of this initiative,\" he said, \"and again I will await the advice of our staff on how this could be done.\"\nHay said, given the financial pressures on Toronto and the need for more housing options for residents, the city doesn't really have a choice beyond exploring diverse sources of cash.\n\"The city is starved for revenue right now, especially\u00a0with cuts coming down from the province,\" she said. \"It needs any revenue it can get.\"\nBudget discussions and public consultations are set to continue in the weeks ahead, with a final vote from council in February.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Home sales surged in Vancouver area in October", "description": "Real estate board says lower prices helped boost sales by 45.4% over 2018", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-october-home-sales-numbers-1.5347882", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5321016.1571148126!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cda-home-sales-20191015.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 04, 2019 6:26 PM PT", "2019-11-05T02:26:23.375Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver says home sales surged 45.4 per cent in October from a year earlier as lower prices helped boost sales.\nThe board says there were 2,858 sales for the month, up from 1,966 sales a year ago, to come in 9.8 per cent above the 10-year sales average for October.\nThe board says homebuyers have more confidence than in the first half of the year as prices edge down and interest rates remain low.\nThe composite benchmark price was down by 6.4 per cent from a year ago to $992,900, and down 1.7 per cent over the past six months.\nDetached home sales were up 47.3 per cent, where the benchmark price was $1.41 million.

Otherwise, the office said, the tenant is considered to be agreeing to the eviction.\nTenants can call 902-892-3501 or email rentalinquiries@irac.pe.ca to get help to register that they are contesting the eviction notice. The office told CBC its staff will help tenants with this process.\nLast week, Minister of Social Development and Housing\u00a0Ernie Hudson said\u00a0the province\u00a0was suspending evictions by the P.E.I. Housing Corporation for six weeks, including eviction notices that have already been served.\nOn Monday, he added that the province would be extending that moratorium to the end of\u00a0June.\nHudson also announced a $1 million Temporary Rental Assistance Benefit to help Islanders who can't come up with their rent payment because of COVID-19. For more information, call the government's toll-free number\u00a0at 1-877-368-5770.\nWade Beaton, a landlord with three\u00a0properties in Alexandra, P.E.I., said he thinks the province's move to halt evictions is a good step.\n\"We have a really low occupancy rate here, but everybody is in the same boat,\" he said.\n\"Nobody is going to move out of their current place, into another place willingly, knowing they don't have any security doing so.\"\nBeaton waived his tenants' rent for the month of April, but said it's unlikely he'll be able to do the same for May.\n\"I'm at the beginning of a 20-year mortgage. My entire mortgage is interest,\" he said.\n\"The big banks offered a deferment, but only on principal\u00a0so I still have to make 98 per cent of my payment.\"\nBeaton said he's going to work with his tenants to come up with a solution, but said if more supports were in place for renters, landlords wouldn't be caught in this situation.\n\"I have a little bit of a cushion. My tenants don't,\" he said.\n\"We're at the beginning of this so as a community we need to work together.\"\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\nCommon symptoms include:\nBut more serious symptoms can develop, including difficulty breathing and pneumonia, which can lead to death.\nHealth Canada has built a\u00a0self-assessment tool.\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\nIsolate yourself and call 811. Do not visit an emergency room or urgent care centre to get tested. A health professional at 811 will give you advice and instructions.\nHow can I protect myself?\nWash your hands frequently and thoroughly.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.\nClean regularly touched surfaces regularly.\nPractise\u00a0physical distancing.\nMore detailed information on the outbreak is available on the\u00a0federal government's website.\n"}, {"author": "Gabrielle Fahmy", "title": "Who is Daniel Bard, the elusive man at centre of missing money scandal?", "description": "Moncton man, formerly employed by government-funded agency, being investigated by RCMP for breach of trust", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/who-is-daniel-bard-moncton-1.5368162", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5363393.1574359734!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/daniel-bard.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 22, 2019 6:30 AM AT", "2019-11-22T10:30:00.914Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "More information is coming to light about Daniel Bard, the Moncton man at the centre of a missing money scandal.\nBard is being accused by several business owners and individuals of receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in administrative and brokerage fees but failing to deliver on promises and then vanishing.\u00a0\nThe RCMP are investigating him for breach of trust.\nBard owes money to businesses that have sued him in civil court and won their cases but is nowhere to be found. People who dealt with him believe Bard, who worked for the government-funded 3+ economic development agency until January 2018 may have fled the country.\nCharlo's HIL Group went to Bard in 2017\u00a0to get help with a loan for a\u00a0project to transform organic waste into biofuel pellets.\nOwners Luc Bernard and Herv\u00e9\u00a0Auclair had known Bard for 25 years and considered him a friend. Bernard's 19-year-old son died in a work accident in 2012, and this project was to be a legacy of sorts \u2014\u00a0he was investing the money from his son's life insurance.\n\"It was really personal,\" Bernard said.\n\"He knew that. For me, that's someone who doesn't have any morals.\"\nBernard and Auclair sued and won their case, worth $130,000, in August. Bard never showed up in\u00a0court, or even filed a statement of defence.\nHe's been impossible to locate, in fact, and Bernard and Auclair filed a lien against his property.\nBard's last known address is a house in a new development on Dieppe's Rouse Street\u00a0\u2014 Bernard and Auclair were hoping to recover their money through its sale. It was put on the market last summer, and a buyer was found, but\u00a0Bernard and Auclair\u00a0learned they weren't the only ones in line. The bank had foreclosed on the property, putting itself in front of the HIL Group founders\u00a0as creditors.\nIt turns out, Bard hadn't been paying the bank either.\nProperty records show he bought the house for $280,000 in February 2018, one month after he stopped working at 3+.\nHe got a first mortgage for $140,000, from Alternative Mortgage Solutions, a private lender that bills itself as a loan company for people who have been turned down by banks.\nA few months later, that September, he got a second mortgage from the Royal Bank against the property for $295,000\u00a0\u2014\u00a0105 per cent of what he paid, at a rather high interest rate \u2014\u00a0seven per cent.\nIt's not clear when Bard last lived there \u2014\u00a0the house is now empty, waiting for the foreclosure sale to go through.\nAnd there's no sign of Bard at any of his registered business addresses either.\nHis company, VM Venture Management, still active online and on the provincial corporate registry, is listed as having offices in a building on Moncton's Main Street.\nBut adjacent tenants said Bard hasn't been there for a few months, and a new business is now leasing the place \u2014\u00a0the signs having already been replaced.\nBard has had several businesses\u00a0and several addresses through the years.\nBefore his venture management company, he ran a mortgage business between 2011 and 2015 called First Approved Mortgages Inc., according to records.\nAnd that company has had its share of legal troubles too.\nBathurst resident Jason Vienneau was looking to remortgage his four apartment buildings in the city\u00a0in 2013.\u00a0\nHe couldn't get a loan from the bank, so he went looking on Kijiji, when he came across an ad that appeared to be from a bank.\nHe called the number on the ad and was referred to First Approved Mortgages Inc. That's when he started talking with Bard.\n\"He said he could get me a mortgage for sure, no problem, but I had to send him a $5,000 retainer fee to get the papers going,\" said Vienneau.\nVienneau sent the money but by the next month, Bard had vanished.\n\"He kept saying he was getting the papers ready, and then he just stopped answering me,\" he said.\n\"I kept calling and calling but he wasn't in town, he wasn't anywhere.\"\nIn 2014, Vienneau sued in small claims court. He paid to have the sheriff's office serve papers.\nBut Bard was once again nowhere in sight.\n\"They just told me they couldn't find Daniel Bard,\" said Vienneau.\nThe case was never heard, and\u00a0Vienneau declared bankruptcy shortly after.\nHe's tried to put the ordeal behind him, but it hasn't always been easy.\n\"I know $5,000, maybe for some people, it's not a lot of money, but for me back then I was only 23 years old. I was just getting started . \u2026 It was pretty much hell.\"\u00a0\nBard was later hired by 3+ Corporation.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Hadani Ditmars", "title": "Social distancing is important.

In a high-density city like Vancouver, this feels like too little, too late.\u00a0\nHow do residents of the 58 per cent of dwellings in Vancouver that are apartments \"self-isolate\" when they have shared spaces such as\u00a0laundry rooms, elevators, stairwells and lobbies to contend with?\nFor those living in detached houses, self-isolation is much easier than for those in towers, and yet according to the\u00a02016 census, 33.5 per cent of Canadians live in multi-family dwellings. In Toronto's census metropolitan area,\u00a0nearly three\u00a0in\u00a010\u00a0dwellings are in highrise apartment buildings, and\u00a0in Vancouver towers make up 16.7 percent of housing.\nIn my own rental apartment tower in Kitsilano, a neighbour in her 60s informed me by email that she was returning from two months\u00a0in California and would self-isolate across the hall from me.\nWhile I was grateful for my neighbour's disclosure, I was alarmed at the lack of protocols on multi-family residences from my landlord, the Residential Tenancy Board\u00a0or Vancouver Coastal Health. I live in an old building with shared facilities, such as heating and ventilation, and\u00a0many aging and vulnerable tenants.\nThe only reason I know my neighbour is returning from the U.S. is because she informed me, but I have no idea how many other tenants in my building are also returning from abroad and if they are voluntarily self-isolating. I have no idea if anyone in my building has tested positive or what the protocol would be if they did.\nOur landlord has only very recently put up posters in common areas with some basic advice, suggesting social distancing and \"limited time spent in the laundry room.\"\nNo additional cleaning protocols are in evidence and visitors \u2014 overnight and otherwise \u2014 are allowed, as are visits by maintenance staff who work in dozens of other buildings, and couriers and postal workers who deliver to individual suites.\nIn many places battling COVID-19, apartment towers can become potential breeding grounds for community spread if proper protocols are not followed.\nIn Hong Kong last month, for instance,\u00a0officials quarantined dozens of residents living in an apartment tower where a woman who lived 10 floors below a resident with the virus also tested positive and was found to have an unsealed ventilation pipe in her apartment.\u00a0\u00a0\nWant to write an opinion for CBC British Columbia? Please email bcvoices@cbc.ca.\nI'm 22, chronically ill \u2014 and feel dismissed in the COVID-19 dialogue\nJoseph G. Allen, director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, wrote in the New York Times that\u00a0buildings of all kinds \"are highly efficient at spreading disease,\"\u00a0but proper ventilation, filtration, diligent cleaning of common areas and adequate levels of humidity can help mitigate community spread.\u00a0\nIn New York City,\u00a0the health department is developing more extensive guidance for property owners and managers, and advising them to clean more often and use disinfectant products.\nIn Canada, this doesn't seem to be a priority.\nWhen I rang my landlord for more information after the province's announcement, he said they were waiting on a directive from the Residential Tenancy Branch, but told me that they could not reveal if there were any tenants in buildings who had COVID-19 or who had recently returned from abroad or\u00a0whether they were\u00a0self-quarantining, because of privacy concerns.\u00a0\nMoreover, in cities like Vancouver and Toronto with sky-high real estate prices and low vacancy rates, many people are forced into \"co-housing\" situations that make self-isolation virtually impossible.\nOn a popular Facebook group called COVID-19 Coming Together (Vancouver), a young woman sharing a condo with eight others\u00a0asked\u00a0whether it was still OK\u00a0to have friends and lovers stay overnight\u00a0during the pandemic.\nAnother plea came from a\u00a0woman whose roommate was returning from a band tour in the U.S. and refused to practise basic self-isolation protocol. The two share a bathroom and kitchen in a small basement apartment in a complex.\nThe issue also affects condo owners who rub elbows, as it were, in lobbies, elevators and even gyms (an alarming number remain open, even as public ones close.)\nCurrent public health guidelines around COVID-19 would seem out of step with Canada's new urban, high-density reality.\u00a0\nIf all levels of government continue to make protocols to mitigate community spread in multi-family residences a low priority, leave it in the hands of landlords\u00a0or simply pass the buck, they do so at our increasing peril.\nWant to write an opinion or point of view piece for CBC British Columbia?

But it also underlined for the public the seriousness of the situation and put the prime minister in a position to practise what he's preached\u00a0by taking personal responsibility and isolating himself for 14 days.\n\"Of course it's an inconvenience and somewhat frustrating,\" Trudeau said. \"We're all social beings, after all, but we have to do this because we have to protect our neighbours and our friends, especially our more vulnerable seniors and people with pre-existing conditions.\"\nIt might also provide some small measure of reassurance to a skittish public if/when the prime minister and his family emerge after two weeks with clean bills of health.\nBut this will not all be over in a couple of weeks.\nThis historic global and national crisis \u2014 a crisis that can't be easily compared to any recent disruption \u2014\u00a0will not pass quickly or quietly. What has challenged Trudeau and other leaders over this frantic past week \u2014 the monumental task of effectively and responsibly responding to a global pandemic and all of the social and economic side effects that come with it \u2014 will continue to challenge them for weeks and months to come.\nOn that score, the last few days might offer just a hint of how difficult this will be, and how much will be demanded of political and health authorities.\nThat a crisis of some kind was taking shape has been apparent for some time \u2014 since mid-January\u00a0at least, when China began taking extraordinary measures to deal with an outbreak. But what might have seemed like a distant rumble for several weeks became a deafening roar over the last five days.\nFirst, the stock markets became jittery. Then came Donald Trump's calamitous address to the American people. Then everything seemed to start happening at once \u2014 sports leagues suspended their seasons, major events were cancelled, celebrities announced their diagnoses, the prime minister's wife reported experiencing flu-like symptoms.\nOn Wednesday morning, the Trudeau government announced a series of measures to deal with some of the effects of COVID-19's spread. Twenty-four hours later, it seemed like that announcement had happened in a different era.\nIt is a feature, not a bug, of federalism that the responsibility for public health care is shared across governments. But\u00a0in situations such as this, that can lead to varied responses. At times on Thursday there were different decisions being made in different provinces on school closures and public gatherings. British Columbia announced a rule for non-essential travel on Thursday, then a federal guideline on travelling abroad was made official on Friday.\nIn the current crisis, it's also easy to make comparisons between countries \u2014 to see which nations have moved further and faster.\nCombined with the\u00a0clamour\u00a0of social media, the\u00a0COVID-19 outbreak\u00a0has the potential to be\u00a0treated as something like an arms race\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with the nations\u00a0moving fastest and most aggressively being seen as the ones taking the\u00a0\"best\"\u00a0approach, however oversimplified such conclusions tend to be.\nThe Trudeau government might get credit for not jumping at dramatic\u00a0but inefficient\u00a0responses. If the finer points of public policy are going to be watched closer than ever, however, government officials have to fully explain both what they're doing and why they're not doing something else. Platitudes won't work.  But explaining things has rarely been a strength of the Trudeau government,\u00a0which tends to prefer gauzy expressions of\u00a0vision and values to details and descriptions.\nIn that respect, one of the government's best assets right now might be Health Minister Patty Hajdu, the plain-spoken former director of a homeless shelter in Thunder Bay. On Wednesday, it was Hajdu who framed the potential infection rate.\nOn Friday, she stepped forward to explain the arguments against banning travellers from entering the country, pointing out that such measures don't seem to have helped the situation in Italy. (It was also Hajdu who broke the tension somewhat with a crack about how she didn't need Chrystia Freeland's step-stool to see over the podium.)\nThe backbone of the public response in Canada has been the presence of senior health officials at the federal and provincial levels \u2014 the steady, serious and knowledgeable doctors\u00a0who\u00a0have been put front and centre for regular public updates.\u00a0Speaking outside his official residence on Friday (with reporters positioned a safe distance away), Trudeau stressed the central role of expertise in the official effort.\n\"We will continue to make decisions based on recommendations of medical experts, public health authorities and top scientists,\" he said. \"We're not closing the door to any further steps but we will make those decisions based on what science tells us.\"\nThat's reassuring\u00a0in its own way\u00a0\u2014 even if science can't magically make this problem go away, and even if relying on science won't absolve elected politicians of responsibility for any mistakes that are made.\nThursday was discombobulating. The government's statements in question period were lacking in detail and the prime minister was in isolation. Friday was full of official activity.\nGovernment House Leader Pablo Rodr\u00edguez, flanked by his opposition counterparts, announced from the foyer of the House of Commons that Parliament would be suspended until April. A half dozen ministers and the chief medical officer then appeared at the National Press Theatre to outline new measures to respond to the medical emergency. The prime minister emerged from Rideau Cottage around noon with promises of significant new government assistance. Then Finance Minister Bill Morneau and the governor of the Bank of Canada appeared at the National Press Theatre to explain further steps to support the economy.\n\"Addressing COVID-19 must be a Team Canada effort,\" Trudeau said.\nThat national effort would no doubt benefit from the prime minister keeping all governments aligned, and including the opposition parties as much as possible.\nBut the potential points of stress and friction are many. What's happening now might be compared to the experience of wartime \u2014\u00a0the sort of war that includes a massive domestic effort. In a matter of days, huge portions of Canadian society have shut down, if only temporarily.\nBut this is not a war. The foe is far less tangible\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the threat is much closer to home.\nPublic anxiety could turn to frustration. Systems and institutions have yet to be truly tested. Many Indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable.\nResources will need to keep flowing. Communication will need to be regular and nimble. Governments may have to be creative. There will be ample opportunities to second-guess. Some will be quick to assign blame. And ultimately, Canadian officials and citizens can only control what occurs within our own borders.\nIf the stock markets are a useful barometer, the Trudeau government did reasonably well on Friday: after falling throughout the morning, the Toronto Stock Exchange picked up after noon and finished more than 1,200 points up for the day.\nBut that is just one afternoon. Trudeau might need to prepare Canadians for a long and difficult haul.\n\"Every order of government is working to stop the spread of the virus. Businesses and citizens are taking precautions. We have outstanding public health authorities who are doing an outstanding job,\" Trudeau said at the conclusion of his prepared remarks on Friday. \"We will get through this together.\"\nThat's likely the message that Canadians need to hear right now. It could be\u00a0the spirit that carries the day.\nBut there are many such days to come. And many of those days are likely to be difficult.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Slump in U.S. manufacturing knocks stock market to lowest point in 5 weeks", "description": "Manufacturing weakened in September for the 2nd straight month as U.S.-China trade war dragged on confidence", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/u-s-manufacturing-slump-knocks-stock-market-lower-1.5304970", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5305022.1569964799!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/financial-markets-wall-street.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 01, 2019 5:26 PM ET", "2019-10-01T21:30:18.634Z"], "source": null, "content": "U.S. stocks sank to their worst loss in five weeks on Tuesday after a surprisingly limp report on the nation's manufacturing stirred worries about the economy's strength.\nThe report showed that manufacturing weakened in September for the second straight month as U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China dragged on confidence and factory activity. It dashed economists' expectations that August's contraction had been an aberration, and markets reversed course immediately after its release. Both stocks and bond yields erased early-morning gains to drop sharply lower.\nThe S&P 500 slumped to its first loss of more than one\u00a0per cent since August, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 1.63 per cent from 1.74 per cent shortly before the report's release, which is a big move. Three stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, and gold climbed as investors sought safer ground.\nInvestors also ratcheted up expectations for the Federal Reserve to come to the economy's aid. They increasingly believe the Fed will cut interest rates by half a percentage point at its meeting later this month, rather than the quarter point they were forecasting a day earlier.\nThe Fed already cut rates twice this summer as it tries to shield the U.S. economy from the effects of the trade war and slowing global economic growth. They were the first cuts since the financial crisis was toppling economies around the world in 2008.\nThe S&P 500 was down 1.2\u00a0per cent by closing,\u00a0or 36 points, its worst loss since Aug. 23.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 343 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 26,573, and the Nasdaq composite fell 90 points of 1.1\u00a0per cent.\nThe S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 211 points or 1.27 per cent.\nThe Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index was at 47.8 last month, and any reading below 50 indicates a contraction. Economists had been expecting growth to resume in September, and they had forecast a reading of 50.4, according to FactSet.\nManufacturers say global trade remains the most significant issue, and all the uncertainty caused by the trade war is hurting exporters in particular. Businesses are unsure what the rules of international trade will be a few months from now, let alone a few years, and it's causing CEOs to pull back on their spending plans.\n\"The disappointing data is only fanning long-standing fears of slowing global growth,\" said Alec Young, managing director of Global Markets Research at FTSE Russell.\nManufacturing is a relatively small part of the economy, but investors worry about whether it will spill into other areas. That puts an even bigger spotlight on Friday's jobs report, which economists expect to show an acceleration in hiring.\nHousehold spending has been the bulwark holding up the economy, particularly when manufacturing and business spending are under threat, and a strong job market helps households keep spending. But uncertainty is looming even there.\nA report last week showed that consumer spending rose less than economists expected in August. Two reports on consumer confidence last week also gave a mixed picture, with one falling below expectations and the other rising above.\nLast month's jobs report was also surprisingly weak, but that may have been a one-off, some analysts say.\n\"The month of August over the last 10 years has been the wonkiest jobs report of the year,\" said Philip Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. It often falls below expectations, only for the numbers to be revised higher in subsequent months.\nAlso coming later this week is a Thursday report from the Institute for Supply Management on activity in services industries.\nAfter the weak manufacturing report, investors say the most likely move for the Federal Reserve is to cut short-term rates by half a percentage point from their current level of 1.75 per cent to 2.25 per cent.\nThe Fed and other central banks around the world have been aggressive in keeping rates low to help sustain the global economy.\nCharles Schwab upended the brokerage industry when it said it will eliminate mobile and web trading commissions for stocks, exchange-traded funds and options listed in the United States and Canada. It's the latest move in an industrywide pricing war that's dramatically cut the cost of investing for customers.\nSchwab fell 11.4 per cent after the announcement, but rivals sank even more. TD Ameritrade lost 26 per cent, and ETrade Financial dropped 17.8 per cent.\nStocks in Europe moved broadly lower and Asian stocks were mixed, though Chinese markets were closed for the National Day holiday marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.\nInflation in the 19 countries that use the euro weakened in September, slipping farther from the European Central Bank's goal.

It's the first cut since late 2008, when central banks around the world slashed rates to effectively zero to deal with the credit crisis.\nWhile the move was widely expected, it is still significant because it indicates that the central bank sees economic clouds on the horizon that warrant the move to stimulate the world's largest\u00a0economy.\nCompared with when the Fed previously cut rates more than a decade ago, the U.S. economy is doing much better, as consumers are spending, the economy is expanding and the job market is booming.\nBut the Fed has singled out a number of economic headwinds, notably a trade war being instigated from the White House. Indeed, U.S. President Donald Trump has been the loudest voice calling for a rate cut in order to supercharge the economy.\nWhile many indicators seem to imply strength, the most important one from the Fed's perspective is inflation, which is still stubbornly below the two per cent target.\nToronto-Dominion Bank economist\u00a0Sri Thanabalasingam\u00a0said that the move on Wednesday suggests the central bank is leaning toward another cut, but possibly no more.\n\"The Fed left the door open for further monetary stimulus, and we believe this will come in the form of one more insurance\u00a0cut in September,\"\u00a0Thanabalasingam\u00a0said.\nStock markets reacted to the move by selling off. Investors\u00a0had anticipated the rate\u00a0cut, but the tone of the statement and press conference suggested that the central bank may not be planning any more.\nAll things being equal, rate cuts send stocks higher, as there's an incentive to borrow and invest. But the the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been nearly flat before the announcement, was off more than 300 points as Fed chair Jerome Powell started talking.\nPowell tried to leave the door open to more cuts in his comments at a press conference on Wednesday, telling reporters, \"It's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts, [but] I didn't say it's just one or anything like that.\"\nThe Fed's move brings its rate to within 50 points of the Bank of Canada's rate, which is currently 1.75 per cent.\nThe central bank's rate filters down into the economy by affecting the rates that retail banks offer to savers and borrowers on things like savings accounts and mortgages. Broadly speaking, the central bank hikes its rate when it wants to slow down inflation. It cuts when it wants to encourage people to borrow and spend to stimulate the economy.\nNotably, the decision to cut rates wasn't unanimous within the Fed. Of the 10 board members with a say in the decision, two dissented: Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who argued for leaving rates unchanged.\nBoth have raised doubts about a rate cut in the face of the current expansion, an unemployment rate that is near a 50-year-low, and robust household spending.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Gatineau mayor wants more help from province for affordable housing", "description": "Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin says $6M in new money not enough to fix crisis", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/gatineau-affordable-housing-quebec-1.5147848", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4980552.1558700741!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/maxime-pedneaud-jobin.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 24, 2019 8:27 AM ET", "2019-05-24T12:27:55.188Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Gatineau residents looking for affordable housing will be able to count on new buildings in\u00a0Aylmer next year \u2014 but the mayor said it's not enough.\nMayor Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin met with Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest\u00a0Thursday to propose ways the province could help out.\u00a0\n\"We have a crisis within a crisis,\" Pedneaud-Jobin said.\nThe mayor said the city was already short before the floods of 2017 and 2019 and the 2018 tornadoes, the latter wiping out\u00a01,600 housing\u00a0units alone.\nPedneaud-Jobin said it's harder than ever\u00a0for people to find proper affordable housing.\nThe latest numbers from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation show a rental vacancy rate of only 1.2 percent in Gatineau as of\u00a0November, down from 3.8 per cent the previous year.\nIt's below the provincial average of 2.3 per cent for communities larger than 10,000 people.\nThe province announced Thursday it's investing more than $6 million for the construction of 75 housing units, many\u00a0for families in\u00a0Aylmer.\nThe first\u00a0will provide 30 new housing units in six buildings on rue Desch\u00eanes\u00a0for families only, particularly those with several children, and should be completed in the fall of 2020.\nThe second project adds 45 housing units in the western part of the Plateau.\u00a0Work has already begun and the first tenants are expected to move in early 2020.\nGatineau is contributing more than $1.8 million.\nThe mayor says this\u00a0investment will help, but it won't solve the problem on its own.\n\"We're far from a solution, we would need hundreds more units,\" he said.\nHe said he's asked the government to adapt the provincial program to help build units that make sense for Gatineau's local reality.\n\"The program recognizes construction costs that are the same all over Quebec, but it's way more expensive in Gatineau to build,\" he said.\nFor him, the key to helping solve the affordable housing is in the long term.\n\"That would be a huge step for [developers] to move faster to give us more units because that's basically the real solution,\" he said.\nHe also said the government must invest in rental subsidies in places where people can't find affordable housing, with the government footing the difference in cost for up to five years until people can find available units.\nMunicipal Affairs and Housing Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest said she is satisfied with the working meeting she had Thursday abut how to tackle Gatineau's housing crisis.\n\"Our government is listening to the needs of our citizens.\" Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest said.\n\"We're working together to find the best possible solutions quickly and efficiently.\"\n"}, {"author": "Adam van der Zwan", "title": "Government says new Victoria micro-apartments will help with middle-income housing crisis", "description": "Housing advocates say the project still doesn't address the growing need for middle-income family housing", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/government-says-new-victoria-micro-apartments-will-help-with-middle-income-housing-crisis-1.5254183", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5254188.1566355315!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/microlofts-victoria.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 20, 2019 7:47 PM PT", "2019-08-21T02:47:38.358Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The federal government says a new micro-unit apartment in downtown Victoria will be a step closer to relieving the ever-growing middle-income housing crisis.\u00a0\n\"The 60-unit project will receive $13.25 million [in] support from the federal government,\" said Adam Vaughan, parliamentary secretary to the federal minister of families, children and social development.\nLike other Canadian cities, Victoria's affordable housing options are shrinking as wages stagnate and rental prices increase.

It dashed economists' expectations that August's contraction had been an aberration, and markets reversed course immediately after its release. Both stocks and bond yields erased early-morning gains to drop sharply lower.\nThe S&P 500 slumped to its first loss of more than one\u00a0per cent since August, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 1.63 per cent from 1.74 per cent shortly before the report's release, which is a big move. Three stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, and gold climbed as investors sought safer ground.\nInvestors also ratcheted up expectations for the Federal Reserve to come to the economy's aid. They increasingly believe the Fed will cut interest rates by half a percentage point at its meeting later this month, rather than the quarter point they were forecasting a day earlier.\nThe Fed already cut rates twice this summer as it tries to shield the U.S. economy from the effects of the trade war and slowing global economic growth. They were the first cuts since the financial crisis was toppling economies around the world in 2008.\nThe S&P 500 was down 1.2\u00a0per cent by closing,\u00a0or 36 points, its worst loss since Aug. 23.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 343 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 26,573, and the Nasdaq composite fell 90 points of 1.1\u00a0per cent.\nThe S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 211 points or 1.27 per cent.\nThe Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index was at 47.8 last month, and any reading below 50 indicates a contraction. Economists had been expecting growth to resume in September, and they had forecast a reading of 50.4, according to FactSet.\nManufacturers say global trade remains the most significant issue, and all the uncertainty caused by the trade war is hurting exporters in particular. Businesses are unsure what the rules of international trade will be a few months from now, let alone a few years, and it's causing CEOs to pull back on their spending plans.\n\"The disappointing data is only fanning long-standing fears of slowing global growth,\" said Alec Young, managing director of Global Markets Research at FTSE Russell.\nManufacturing is a relatively small part of the economy, but investors worry about whether it will spill into other areas. That puts an even bigger spotlight on Friday's jobs report, which economists expect to show an acceleration in hiring.\nHousehold spending has been the bulwark holding up the economy, particularly when manufacturing and business spending are under threat, and a strong job market helps households keep spending. But uncertainty is looming even there.\nA report last week showed that consumer spending rose less than economists expected in August. Two reports on consumer confidence last week also gave a mixed picture, with one falling below expectations and the other rising above.\nLast month's jobs report was also surprisingly weak, but that may have been a one-off, some analysts say.\n\"The month of August over the last 10 years has been the wonkiest jobs report of the year,\" said Philip Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. It often falls below expectations, only for the numbers to be revised higher in subsequent months.\nAlso coming later this week is a Thursday report from the Institute for Supply Management on activity in services industries.\nAfter the weak manufacturing report, investors say the most likely move for the Federal Reserve is to cut short-term rates by half a percentage point from their current level of 1.75 per cent to 2.25 per cent.\nThe Fed and other central banks around the world have been aggressive in keeping rates low to help sustain the global economy.\nCharles Schwab upended the brokerage industry when it said it will eliminate mobile and web trading commissions for stocks, exchange-traded funds and options listed in the United States and Canada. It's the latest move in an industrywide pricing war that's dramatically cut the cost of investing for customers.\nSchwab fell 11.4 per cent after the announcement, but rivals sank even more. TD Ameritrade lost 26 per cent, and ETrade Financial dropped 17.8 per cent.\nStocks in Europe moved broadly lower and Asian stocks were mixed, though Chinese markets were closed for the National Day holiday marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.\nInflation in the 19 countries that use the euro weakened in September, slipping farther from the European Central Bank's goal. Also, The World Trade Organization cut sharply its forecasts for trade growth this year and next. It expects global trade to weaken this year to the slowest pace since the Great Recession due to the U.S.-China trade war.\n"}, {"author": "Sally Pitt, Isabella Zavarise", "title": "P.E.I. government seeks ban on enforcement of evictions amid COVID-19 emergency", "description": "Government says it's necessary to protect health and safety of tenants and sheriffs", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-covid-19-rental-eviction-ban-application-1.5514761", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4029461.1588246762!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/toronto-rental-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 30, 2020 1:57 PM AT", "2020-03-30T22:29:28.485Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "P.E.I.'s Justice and Public Safety Department has asked the courts to ban enforcement of all rental evictions in the province, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn an application filed in P.E.I.

This must be done as early as within 10 days if it's for non-payment of rent. Otherwise, the office said, the tenant is considered to be agreeing to the eviction.\nTenants can call 902-892-3501 or email rentalinquiries@irac.pe.ca to get help to register that they are contesting the eviction notice. The office told CBC its staff will help tenants with this process.\nLast week, Minister of Social Development and Housing\u00a0Ernie Hudson said\u00a0the province\u00a0was suspending evictions by the P.E.I. Housing Corporation for six weeks, including eviction notices that have already been served.\nOn Monday, he added that the province would be extending that moratorium to the end of\u00a0June.\nHudson also announced a $1 million Temporary Rental Assistance Benefit to help Islanders who can't come up with their rent payment because of COVID-19. For more information, call the government's toll-free number\u00a0at 1-877-368-5770.\nWade Beaton, a landlord with three\u00a0properties in Alexandra, P.E.I., said he thinks the province's move to halt evictions is a good step.\n\"We have a really low occupancy rate here, but everybody is in the same boat,\" he said.\n\"Nobody is going to move out of their current place, into another place willingly, knowing they don't have any security doing so.\"\nBeaton waived his tenants' rent for the month of April, but said it's unlikely he'll be able to do the same for May.\n\"I'm at the beginning of a 20-year mortgage. My entire mortgage is interest,\" he said.\n\"The big banks offered a deferment, but only on principal\u00a0so I still have to make 98 per cent of my payment.\"\nBeaton said he's going to work with his tenants to come up with a solution, but said if more supports were in place for renters, landlords wouldn't be caught in this situation.\n\"I have a little bit of a cushion.

Among those tenants already confirmed are law firm MLT Aitkins, tax firm Ernst and Young, Royal Bank of Canada, Over Easy Breakfast and two of the companies involved in River Landing development: Victory Majors and Triovest.\nA sister tower at the corner of 19th Street and Second Avenue \u2014 the future home of Nutrien, now located in the Scotia Centre tower \u2014 is at the early stage of construction.\nThe current 16.7 per cent vacancy rate does not account for 120,000 square feet of yet-to-be-leased,\u00a0non-Nutrien space in what's being dubbed North Tower.\n\"It's a little higher than I guess we'd like to see,\" Brent Penner, the executive director of DTN YXE, the downtown business improvement district, \u00a0said of the current vacancy rate \"There are reports out there that I've seen nationally talk about a national office vacancy rate of around 12 per cent.\"\nIt may get worse in Saskatoon, according to Stuart.\n\"Once that additional vacancy [at North Tower] is accounted for, we will be reporting core area vacancy in excess of 20 per cent,\" Stuart wrote.\nThere aren't enough new tenants on the scene, according to Stuart.\n\"The demand for new Class A inventory is coming from users already present,\" Stuart wrote.\nErnst and Young, for example, will move from its current home in Saskatoon Square on 22nd Street East to new digs in East Tower.\n\"There are not enough new tenants entering the market and the flight to quality is projected to continue,\" Stuart wrote.\nThe move to new buildings may put pressure on owners of older buildings to alter their lease rates, renovate their spaces or redevelop their properties, said Penner.\nThe situation will also benefit tenants, he added.\n\"Being a glass half full kind of guy, it's going to present opportunities for new businesses to find a home or [for existing businesses] to maybe look to expand downtown. Perhaps before they didn't have that opportunity.\"\nStuart is advocating for an alternate solution to lowering rates: redeveloping old spaces into hotels, rentals or condos.\n\"They typically have the lowest cost base, possess the most inherent functional obsolescence, and will therefore be affected the most by this transition,\" Stuart wrote of older spaces.\n"}, {"author": "Hadani Ditmars", "title": "Social distancing is important.

In a high-density city like Vancouver, this feels like too little, too late.\u00a0\nHow do residents of the 58 per cent of dwellings in Vancouver that are apartments \"self-isolate\" when they have shared spaces such as\u00a0laundry rooms, elevators, stairwells and lobbies to contend with?\nFor those living in detached houses, self-isolation is much easier than for those in towers, and yet according to the\u00a02016 census, 33.5 per cent of Canadians live in multi-family dwellings. In Toronto's census metropolitan area,\u00a0nearly three\u00a0in\u00a010\u00a0dwellings are in highrise apartment buildings, and\u00a0in Vancouver towers make up 16.7 percent of housing.\nIn my own rental apartment tower in Kitsilano, a neighbour in her 60s informed me by email that she was returning from two months\u00a0in California and would self-isolate across the hall from me.\nWhile I was grateful for my neighbour's disclosure, I was alarmed at the lack of protocols on multi-family residences from my landlord, the Residential Tenancy Board\u00a0or Vancouver Coastal Health. I live in an old building with shared facilities, such as heating and ventilation, and\u00a0many aging and vulnerable tenants.\nThe only reason I know my neighbour is returning from the U.S. is because she informed me, but I have no idea how many other tenants in my building are also returning from abroad and if they are voluntarily self-isolating. I have no idea if anyone in my building has tested positive or what the protocol would be if they did.\nOur landlord has only very recently put up posters in common areas with some basic advice, suggesting social distancing and \"limited time spent in the laundry room.\"\nNo additional cleaning protocols are in evidence and visitors \u2014 overnight and otherwise \u2014 are allowed, as are visits by maintenance staff who work in dozens of other buildings, and couriers and postal workers who deliver to individual suites.\nIn many places battling COVID-19, apartment towers can become potential breeding grounds for community spread if proper protocols are not followed.\nIn Hong Kong last month, for instance,\u00a0officials quarantined dozens of residents living in an apartment tower where a woman who lived 10 floors below a resident with the virus also tested positive and was found to have an unsealed ventilation pipe in her apartment.\u00a0\u00a0\nWant to write an opinion for CBC British Columbia?

Chan School of Public Health, wrote in the New York Times that\u00a0buildings of all kinds \"are highly efficient at spreading disease,\"\u00a0but proper ventilation, filtration, diligent cleaning of common areas and adequate levels of humidity can help mitigate community spread.\u00a0\nIn New York City,\u00a0the health department is developing more extensive guidance for property owners and managers, and advising them to clean more often and use disinfectant products.\nIn Canada, this doesn't seem to be a priority.\nWhen I rang my landlord for more information after the province's announcement, he said they were waiting on a directive from the Residential Tenancy Branch, but told me that they could not reveal if there were any tenants in buildings who had COVID-19 or who had recently returned from abroad or\u00a0whether they were\u00a0self-quarantining, because of privacy concerns.\u00a0\nMoreover, in cities like Vancouver and Toronto with sky-high real estate prices and low vacancy rates, many people are forced into \"co-housing\" situations that make self-isolation virtually impossible.\nOn a popular Facebook group called COVID-19 Coming Together (Vancouver), a young woman sharing a condo with eight others\u00a0asked\u00a0whether it was still OK\u00a0to have friends and lovers stay overnight\u00a0during the pandemic.\nAnother plea came from a\u00a0woman whose roommate was returning from a band tour in the U.S. and refused to practise basic self-isolation protocol. The two share a bathroom and kitchen in a small basement apartment in a complex.\nThe issue also affects condo owners who rub elbows, as it were, in lobbies, elevators and even gyms (an alarming number remain open, even as public ones close.)\nCurrent public health guidelines around COVID-19 would seem out of step with Canada's new urban, high-density reality.\u00a0\nIf all levels of government continue to make protocols to mitigate community spread in multi-family residences a low priority, leave it in the hands of landlords\u00a0or simply pass the buck, they do so at our increasing peril.\nWant to write an opinion or point of view piece for CBC British Columbia?

It's the first cut since late 2008, when central banks around the world slashed rates to effectively zero to deal with the credit crisis.\nWhile the move was widely expected, it is still significant because it indicates that the central bank sees economic clouds on the horizon that warrant the move to stimulate the world's largest\u00a0economy.\nCompared with when the Fed previously cut rates more than a decade ago, the U.S. economy is doing much better, as consumers are spending, the economy is expanding and the job market is booming.\nBut the Fed has singled out a number of economic headwinds, notably a trade war being instigated from the White House. Indeed, U.S. President Donald Trump has been the loudest voice calling for a rate cut in order to supercharge the economy.\nWhile many indicators seem to imply strength, the most important one from the Fed's perspective is inflation, which is still stubbornly below the two per cent target.\nToronto-Dominion Bank economist\u00a0Sri Thanabalasingam\u00a0said that the move on Wednesday suggests the central bank is leaning toward another cut, but possibly no more.\n\"The Fed left the door open for further monetary stimulus, and we believe this will come in the form of one more insurance\u00a0cut in September,\"\u00a0Thanabalasingam\u00a0said.\nStock markets reacted to the move by selling off. Investors\u00a0had anticipated the rate\u00a0cut, but the tone of the statement and press conference suggested that the central bank may not be planning any more.\nAll things being equal, rate cuts send stocks higher, as there's an incentive to borrow and invest. But the the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been nearly flat before the announcement, was off more than 300 points as Fed chair Jerome Powell started talking.\nPowell tried to leave the door open to more cuts in his comments at a press conference on Wednesday, telling reporters, \"It's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts, [but] I didn't say it's just one or anything like that.\"\nThe Fed's move brings its rate to within 50 points of the Bank of Canada's rate, which is currently 1.75 per cent.\nThe central bank's rate filters down into the economy by affecting the rates that retail banks offer to savers and borrowers on things like savings accounts and mortgages. Broadly speaking, the central bank hikes its rate when it wants to slow down inflation. It cuts when it wants to encourage people to borrow and spend to stimulate the economy.\nNotably, the decision to cut rates wasn't unanimous within the Fed. Of the 10 board members with a say in the decision, two dissented: Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who argued for leaving rates unchanged.\nBoth have raised doubts about a rate cut in the face of the current expansion, an unemployment rate that is near a 50-year-low, and robust household spending.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Coronavirus could be the global shock that economists have feared: Don Pittis", "description": "But avoiding panic over the disease's economic impact will prevent a worse result", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-economy-canada-1.5458155", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5458662.1581367576!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/switzerland-china-outbreak.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 11, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-02-26T15:56:21.813Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "For those\u00a0who worry about the world's wealth and wellbeing, the term \"economic shock\" has a special meaning.\nAs defined by people like the Bank of Canada's governor Stephen Poloz, while economies are always in a state of flux, occasionally an outside force, usually\u00a0unforeseeable, or at least unexpected, will sweep in and put everything awry.\nIt seems increasingly certain that the outbreak of coronavirus\u00a0spreading from Wuhan, China, is such an unanticipated disturbance to the global, the North American and Canadian economies. And yesterday Canada's finance minister Bill Morneau\u00a0said Canada would inevitably be affected.\nAs the death toll\u00a0\u2014 mostly in China\u00a0\u2014 passes 1,000, the business press has begun to tally the effects on the country's gross domestic product and estimate what impact that will have on the wider global economy.\nThere is so much unknown about the virus and its potential that the numbers can only be educated guesses, but experts interviewed by credible sources such as the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal offer estimates that China's GDP growth will fall by two or more percentage points. That would\u00a0represent a decline in growth of more than one-third.\nMany of those calculations are based on extrapolating from the economic impact of SARS, which killed nearly 800 people during its eight-month run 17 years ago. The fact that the new, related\u00a0virus has killed more people in only three months is only one of the many differences.\nFor one thing, the Chinese economy is much bigger than it was in 2002 when the SARS outbreak began. The\u00a0\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0estimates that in 2020 that economy\u00a0represents nearly 17 percent of global activity compared to around four\u00a0per cent in the era of SARS. Thus the global\u00a0coronavirus effect will be much larger.\nIn an integrated global economy operating on the strategy of just-in-time\u00a0delivery, shortages of key parts caused by the shutdown of Chinese factories\u00a0have already stopped industrial production in the automotive and technology manufacturing sectors.\nAs the world discovered during the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, finding replacement parts when specialized factories go down can be impossible in the short term.\nTourism has already taken a hit as big-spending Chinese tourists stay home\u00a0and, as Morneau said yesterday in Calgary,\u00a0the outbreak\u00a0has already hit the Canadian oil business. And such spreading effects are insidious.\u00a0From Nova Scotia there are reports that lobster prices are down 20 per cent due to the collapse of the crucial Chinese market.\nThe U.S. economy that Canada depends upon is also feeling the effects in its currency as its dollar surges, making its products more expensive in overseas markets. The virus has pushed down the price of coffee and mortgages.\nIn the past the Bank of Canada governor has warned that economies can be like a cracked tree waiting for a shock to blow it down.\n\"Macroeconomic shocks happen all the time and economies adjust to them,\" Poloz once said in a briefing describing the hazards of an uncertain world. But a shock that is big enough or sudden enough\u00a0can reveal hidden cracks in an economy.\n\"If significant vulnerabilities are present, the effects of those shocks on the economy and the financial system can be magnified,\" said Poloz.\nAnd that is the danger here. The Canadian oil business, already suffering, may be shocked into a new perilous state as cheaper producers hog a bigger share of shrinking world demand.\nA global economy already close to recession\u00a0may be pushed over the line.\nPlaces like Europe, already glutted with monetary stimulus, may demand more with uncertain results. Already China has delayed\u00a0attempts to get borrowing under control, cutting rates to boost the sickened economy.\nAnd the shock may not be over. As we learn more about the new coronavirus, we are learning how much we don't know.\u00a0\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, warned that cases in France and the United Kingdom with no known contact history with\u00a0existing outbreaks may show our understanding of transmission is flawed.\n\"The detection of this small number of cases may be the spark that begins a bigger fire,\" he said.\nThere are worries about what will happen if that bigger fire begins to break out in places that do not have Canadian-style medical facilities such as North Korea that shares a large border with China, or places in Africa where Chinese business travellers continued to visit after the outbreak but before China threw up its cordon sanitaire.\nCertainly the fact that Wuhan authorities tried to suppress\u00a0Li Wenliang, the doctor who tried to warn authorities of the dangers before dying himself of the virus, does not reassure us that China has been as forthright as it claims.

That would\u00a0represent a decline in growth of more than one-third.\nMany of those calculations are based on extrapolating from the economic impact of SARS, which killed nearly 800 people during its eight-month run 17 years ago. The fact that the new, related\u00a0virus has killed more people in only three months is only one of the many differences.\nFor one thing, the Chinese economy is much bigger than it was in 2002 when the SARS outbreak began. The\u00a0\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0estimates that in 2020 that economy\u00a0represents nearly 17 percent of global activity compared to around four\u00a0per cent in the era of SARS. Thus the global\u00a0coronavirus effect will be much larger.\nIn an integrated global economy operating on the strategy of just-in-time\u00a0delivery, shortages of key parts caused by the shutdown of Chinese factories\u00a0have already stopped industrial production in the automotive and technology manufacturing sectors.\nAs the world discovered during the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, finding replacement parts when specialized factories go down can be impossible in the short term.\nTourism has already taken a hit as big-spending Chinese tourists stay home\u00a0and, as Morneau said yesterday in Calgary,\u00a0the outbreak\u00a0has already hit the Canadian oil business. And such spreading effects are insidious.\u00a0From Nova Scotia there are reports that lobster prices are down 20 per cent due to the collapse of the crucial Chinese market.\nThe U.S. economy that Canada depends upon is also feeling the effects in its currency as its dollar surges, making its products more expensive in overseas markets. The virus has pushed down the price of coffee and mortgages.\nIn the past the Bank of Canada governor has warned that economies can be like a cracked tree waiting for a shock to blow it down.\n\"Macroeconomic shocks happen all the time and economies adjust to them,\" Poloz once said in a briefing describing the hazards of an uncertain world. But a shock that is big enough or sudden enough\u00a0can reveal hidden cracks in an economy.\n\"If significant vulnerabilities are present, the effects of those shocks on the economy and the financial system can be magnified,\" said Poloz.\nAnd that is the danger here. The Canadian oil business, already suffering, may be shocked into a new perilous state as cheaper producers hog a bigger share of shrinking world demand.\nA global economy already close to recession\u00a0may be pushed over the line.\nPlaces like Europe, already glutted with monetary stimulus, may demand more with uncertain results. Already China has delayed\u00a0attempts to get borrowing under control, cutting rates to boost the sickened economy.\nAnd the shock may not be over. As we learn more about the new coronavirus, we are learning how much we don't know.\u00a0\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, warned that cases in France and the United Kingdom with no known contact history with\u00a0existing outbreaks may show our understanding of transmission is flawed.\n\"The detection of this small number of cases may be the spark that begins a bigger fire,\" he said.\nThere are worries about what will happen if that bigger fire begins to break out in places that do not have Canadian-style medical facilities such as North Korea that shares a large border with China, or places in Africa where Chinese business travellers continued to visit after the outbreak but before China threw up its cordon sanitaire.\nCertainly the fact that Wuhan authorities tried to suppress\u00a0Li Wenliang, the doctor who tried to warn authorities of the dangers before dying himself of the virus, does not reassure us that China has been as forthright as it claims. The age of some high-profile victims, including Li who was 35, does not support what we have been told so far.\nAs well as warning of the coronavirus\u00a0impact on Canada's economy yesterday, Morneau hinted that there may be more news to come and that we must be \"prepared for any eventualities.\"\nPart of those preparations must be to keep money flowing to\u00a0Canada's medical system that learned so much during the SARS\u00a0outbreak, including funding Canadian research, which will be money well spent whether or not this virus spreads in Canada.\u00a0\n\"Globally, volatility remains a key risk and obviously that has been illustrated vividly over the last couple of months,\" Morneau told the Calgary gathering of the Economic Club of Canada.\nAnd whether he was referring to the coronavirus, its impact on the global economy or the Alberta oil industry, the finance minister said that Canada must have the economic resiliency to face the unexpected.\n\"Challenges,\" he said, \"that we many not be able to see right now.\"\nFollow Don\u00a0on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Hadani Ditmars", "title": "Social distancing is important.

In a high-density city like Vancouver, this feels like too little, too late.\u00a0\nHow do residents of the 58 per cent of dwellings in Vancouver that are apartments \"self-isolate\" when they have shared spaces such as\u00a0laundry rooms, elevators, stairwells and lobbies to contend with?\nFor those living in detached houses, self-isolation is much easier than for those in towers, and yet according to the\u00a02016 census, 33.5 per cent of Canadians live in multi-family dwellings. In Toronto's census metropolitan area,\u00a0nearly three\u00a0in\u00a010\u00a0dwellings are in highrise apartment buildings, and\u00a0in Vancouver towers make up 16.7 percent of housing.\nIn my own rental apartment tower in Kitsilano, a neighbour in her 60s informed me by email that she was returning from two months\u00a0in California and would self-isolate across the hall from me.\nWhile I was grateful for my neighbour's disclosure, I was alarmed at the lack of protocols on multi-family residences from my landlord, the Residential Tenancy Board\u00a0or Vancouver Coastal Health. I live in an old building with shared facilities, such as heating and ventilation, and\u00a0many aging and vulnerable tenants.\nThe only reason I know my neighbour is returning from the U.S. is because she informed me, but I have no idea how many other tenants in my building are also returning from abroad and if they are voluntarily self-isolating. I have no idea if anyone in my building has tested positive or what the protocol would be if they did.\nOur landlord has only very recently put up posters in common areas with some basic advice, suggesting social distancing and \"limited time spent in the laundry room.\"\nNo additional cleaning protocols are in evidence and visitors \u2014 overnight and otherwise \u2014 are allowed, as are visits by maintenance staff who work in dozens of other buildings, and couriers and postal workers who deliver to individual suites.\nIn many places battling COVID-19, apartment towers can become potential breeding grounds for community spread if proper protocols are not followed.\nIn Hong Kong last month, for instance,\u00a0officials quarantined dozens of residents living in an apartment tower where a woman who lived 10 floors below a resident with the virus also tested positive and was found to have an unsealed ventilation pipe in her apartment.\u00a0\u00a0\nWant to write an opinion for CBC British Columbia? Please email bcvoices@cbc.ca.\nI'm 22, chronically ill \u2014 and feel dismissed in the COVID-19 dialogue\nJoseph G. Allen, director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, wrote in the New York Times that\u00a0buildings of all kinds \"are highly efficient at spreading disease,\"\u00a0but proper ventilation, filtration, diligent cleaning of common areas and adequate levels of humidity can help mitigate community spread.\u00a0\nIn New York City,\u00a0the health department is developing more extensive guidance for property owners and managers, and advising them to clean more often and use disinfectant products.\nIn Canada, this doesn't seem to be a priority.\nWhen I rang my landlord for more information after the province's announcement, he said they were waiting on a directive from the Residential Tenancy Branch, but told me that they could not reveal if there were any tenants in buildings who had COVID-19 or who had recently returned from abroad or\u00a0whether they were\u00a0self-quarantining, because of privacy concerns.\u00a0\nMoreover, in cities like Vancouver and Toronto with sky-high real estate prices and low vacancy rates, many people are forced into \"co-housing\" situations that make self-isolation virtually impossible.\nOn a popular Facebook group called COVID-19 Coming Together (Vancouver), a young woman sharing a condo with eight others\u00a0asked\u00a0whether it was still OK\u00a0to have friends and lovers stay overnight\u00a0during the pandemic.\nAnother plea came from a\u00a0woman whose roommate was returning from a band tour in the U.S. and refused to practise basic self-isolation protocol. The two share a bathroom and kitchen in a small basement apartment in a complex.\nThe issue also affects condo owners who rub elbows, as it were, in lobbies, elevators and even gyms (an alarming number remain open, even as public ones close.)\nCurrent public health guidelines around COVID-19 would seem out of step with Canada's new urban, high-density reality.\u00a0\nIf all levels of government continue to make protocols to mitigate community spread in multi-family residences a low priority, leave it in the hands of landlords\u00a0or simply pass the buck, they do so at our increasing peril.\nWant to write an opinion or point of view piece for CBC British Columbia?

It's the first cut since late 2008, when central banks around the world slashed rates to effectively zero to deal with the credit crisis.\nWhile the move was widely expected, it is still significant because it indicates that the central bank sees economic clouds on the horizon that warrant the move to stimulate the world's largest\u00a0economy.\nCompared with when the Fed previously cut rates more than a decade ago, the U.S. economy is doing much better, as consumers are spending, the economy is expanding and the job market is booming.\nBut the Fed has singled out a number of economic headwinds, notably a trade war being instigated from the White House. Indeed, U.S. President Donald Trump has been the loudest voice calling for a rate cut in order to supercharge the economy.\nWhile many indicators seem to imply strength, the most important one from the Fed's perspective is inflation, which is still stubbornly below the two per cent target.\nToronto-Dominion Bank economist\u00a0Sri Thanabalasingam\u00a0said that the move on Wednesday suggests the central bank is leaning toward another cut, but possibly no more.\n\"The Fed left the door open for further monetary stimulus, and we believe this will come in the form of one more insurance\u00a0cut in September,\"\u00a0Thanabalasingam\u00a0said.\nStock markets reacted to the move by selling off. Investors\u00a0had anticipated the rate\u00a0cut, but the tone of the statement and press conference suggested that the central bank may not be planning any more.\nAll things being equal, rate cuts send stocks higher, as there's an incentive to borrow and invest. But the the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been nearly flat before the announcement, was off more than 300 points as Fed chair Jerome Powell started talking.\nPowell tried to leave the door open to more cuts in his comments at a press conference on Wednesday, telling reporters, \"It's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts, [but] I didn't say it's just one or anything like that.\"\nThe Fed's move brings its rate to within 50 points of the Bank of Canada's rate, which is currently 1.75 per cent.\nThe central bank's rate filters down into the economy by affecting the rates that retail banks offer to savers and borrowers on things like savings accounts and mortgages. Broadly speaking, the central bank hikes its rate when it wants to slow down inflation. It cuts when it wants to encourage people to borrow and spend to stimulate the economy.\nNotably, the decision to cut rates wasn't unanimous within the Fed. Of the 10 board members with a say in the decision, two dissented: Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who argued for leaving rates unchanged.\nBoth have raised doubts about a rate cut in the face of the current expansion, an unemployment rate that is near a 50-year-low, and robust household spending.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Counterfeit crackdown; cannabis costs: CBC's Marketplace consumer cheat sheet", "description": "Newsletter: Consumer and health news you need from the week", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/marketplace-cheat-sheet-1.5471964", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5470871.1582249880!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/marketplace-counterfeit-fashion-show.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 23, 2020 9:00 AM ET", "2020-02-23T14:00:00.178Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Miss something this week?

The debenture is a normal security component of any financing.\"\nThe debenture was signed on Christmas Day\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Dec. 25, 2019 \u2014 and lists four land titles as security. Three of the properties are in Winnipeg, on Inkster Boulevard, Notre Dame Avenue\u00a0and Broadway. The fourth is in Toronto on Niagara Street.\nIn a subsequent email,\u00a0Frydman explained that\u00a0\"Nygard International was simply replacing a line of credit with a new one\" that happened to\u00a0have been signed on Christmas. \"There is no significance to the date,\" he said.\nThe existing line of credit had not been used up, Frydman added, and the new loan needed to be in place by Jan. 3.\n\"This is a normal business practice. There was nothing out of the ordinary with respect to this debenture.\"\nFrydman did not give particulars about the prior loan, but a Manitoba property registry search\u00a0shows in September 2019,\u00a0Nygard Properties Ltd. got a $20 million Cdn\u00a0mortgage and used the same three Winnipeg land titles as collateral.\nThat mortgage was discharged Jan.\u00a03, 2020.\n\"Lines of credit are often used by small and large companies for cash flow management. The early part of the year is usually a time when a fashion house is gearing up for the spring and a line of credit may be used,\" Frydman said.\nWhile the debenture document says the interest rate is 25 per cent,\u00a0Frydman said that's not the case.\n\"This was not the interest rate, but rather a placeholder,\" he said,\u00a0explaining\u00a0the rate fluctuates.\n\"It looks like they're needing a lot more financing than they did in prior years,\" said Ken Froese, a Toronto-based forensic accountant who\u00a0owns an independent financial investigative firm that has done work for courts, tribunals\u00a0and government agencies in Canada and elsewhere.\nIt's not unusual for companies to increase their loans, Froese says, but\u00a0the increase\u00a0from $20 million Cdn in September 2019, to a $50-million US debenture in December 2019 is significant.\n\"The timing of it and the amount of the increase and the explanation they have given, it's not entirely consistent with the increased amount. Still raises questions for me,\" said Froese.\n\"It's pretty reasonable to conclude they wanted an extra cushion to deal with whatever the contingencies might be.\"\nLast month, 10 women filed a class-action lawsuit in New York against\u00a0Nygard, accusing him of raping them\u00a0at his seaside mansion in the Bahamas\u00a0and operating what they described as a \"sex trafficking ring.\"\nThe alleged rapes took place between 2008 and 2015;\u00a0some of the alleged victims\u00a0were as young as 14.\nThe allegations have not been proven in court and no criminal charges have been laid against Nygard.\nLast week, it was announced that\u00a0Nygard\u00a0was\u00a0stepping\u00a0down from his company and starting\u00a0to divest his ownership stake. The news came in a statement just hours after FBI investigators raided Nygard's\u00a0offices in New York.\nCBC News has also learned that Nygard owes $1.6 million US to Sitrick and Company,\u00a0an American public relations firm that has worked with hundreds of clients, including BlackBerry, MGM Studios, Exxon, the Church of Scientology and Harvey Weinstein.\nThe strategic communications firm is best known for its crisis work cleaning up celebrity scandals\u00a0and managing reputations.\nMike Sitrick, the firm's founder, chairman and CEO, says his company was hired in the fall of 2014 and\u00a0resigned in 2017.

That money has not yet been paid, according to the court documents.\nThe case was in Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench in Winnipeg Tuesday.\nA lawyer for Sitrick, Brett Steidl, asked the court to set firm deadlines for Nygard to file affidavit evidence because all the deadlines so far had been missed.\nThe court also set a timeline for both parties to file documents in the case. The next hearing date was not set but will happen after June 19.\nNygard's lawyer, Richard Good, said Nygard would be changing lawyers but didn't say why.\nFrydman\u00a0said he would not discuss any ongoing litigation.\nWATCH | Caroline Barghout's report:\n\u00a0\nGot a tip for CBC Manitoba's I-Team to investigate?\u00a0Email\u00a0or call the confidential tip line at\u00a0204-788-3744.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Counterfeit crackdown; cannabis costs: CBC's Marketplace consumer cheat sheet", "description": "Newsletter: Consumer and health news you need from the week", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/marketplace-cheat-sheet-1.5471964", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5470871.1582249880!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/marketplace-counterfeit-fashion-show.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 23, 2020 9:00 AM ET", "2020-02-23T14:00:00.178Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Miss something this week?

Association of Realtors, the average sale price for a home in the province so far this year is just under $242,000, a drop of more than $8,500 from a year ago.\nAnd that seems to have injected some life into the market, with more than 300 more real estate transactions as of the end of October this year (3,872), in comparison with a 2018 that many realtors would rather forget, when there were 3,550 sales by the same point.\n\"Last year was the worst year we've had in 20 years,\" said Bill Stirling, the association's chief executive officer.\n\"For the first time in several years we're starting to see some optimism in the market.\"\nBut that uptick is not universal, with the bump in sales driven by activity in St. John's, Conception Bay South, Gander\u00a0and Labrador West.\u00a0\nThe number of real estate transactions continued to slide in places like Mount Pearl, the Clarenville-Bonavista region, Grand Falls-Windsor and Corner Brook.\n\"The last two or three years have been pretty rough years in our business,\" Stirling added, noting that membership in the association has dropped by roughly 100 Realtors in the past few years.\nAnd the uptick in sales this year is driven by one category: homes selling between $200,000 and $350,000, or the first-time buyer's market.\n\"If you've got a product priced in that area, those are the ones that are selling the quickest,\" Stirling said.\nThe drop in prices is also a consequence of the glut of homes on the market, with more than 6,000 listings provincewide, which is well above the 10-year average.\nOne of the benchmarks for determining the health of a market is the duration it would take to sell the existing inventory. For Newfoundland and Labrador, if no listings were added, it would take nearly a year and a half to clear the deck, which suggests a sluggish market.\n\"That's strongly in the buyers' market category,\" said Stirling.\nThe glut is a consequence of a weak economy, the cooling-off of a major project construction boom that made this province the envy of the country, and what people like Stirling admit is a fear of how Muskrat Falls will impact electricity rates.\nUnless the province can come up with hundreds of millions of dollars to address the problem, the cost of paying for the controversial hydroelectric project could double electricity bills by 2021.\nIt all adds up to fragile consumer confidence.\nAs such, much of the renovation market is now being driven by energy-efficiency projects, including the installation of heat pumps, which reduce electricity use.\nTougher mortgage stress-testing rules, which require prospective buyers to make larger down payments and prove they can still make payments if interest rates rise,\u00a0is also preventing some prospective home buyers from entering the market.\nHowever, recent tweaks to the rules, including repayable loans for those struggling with a down payment, have helped, industry leaders say.\nDespite these ominous trends, Stirling said there's cautious optimism that a rebound is around the corner. The province wants to double oil production within the next decade, for example, which would help restore confidence to the marketplace.\nMeanwhile, the picture is especially bleak right now for those who specialize in new home construction. With so many existing homes on the market, and prices dropping, buyers are seeing the upside of investing in a mature property.\nOver the past decade, there was an average of 2,400 housing starts annually\u00a0in the province. But that average will fall dramatically after 2019 numbers are factored in, with new builds expected to fall well below 1,000.\n\"We've been sliding for a few years now and in fact we're probably hitting a low of about 50 years for new home construction in this province,\" said Victoria Belbin, CEO of the provincial chapter of the Canadian Home Builders' Association.\nThat's forced companies that specialize in new builds to either make big adjustments, including turning their attention to the renovation market, or get\u00a0out of the business altogether, said Dieter Staubitzer of New Victorian Homes in St. John's.\nStaubitzer has been building homes for nearly three decades, and enjoyed a record decade of activity that came crashing down in 2013-14.\n\"We've had to change our structure dramatically in the last couple of years.\u00a0And we've had to scale back and adapt. And it's a hard thing to do when you have good people around you and so on,\" he said.\nStaubitzer is now specializing in smaller, more affordable and energy-efficient homes, because that's where the market has shifted.\n\"We're going to try to build the right product and help out the folks that need affordable homes,\" he said.\nAnd some home builders are back in the trenches, trying to stay afloat, said Belbin.\n\"We do have members that have put the belts back on. And they're back on site, whereas before they might have just been managing the projects,\" Belbin explained.\nBut Staubitzer is an optimistic person, and sees better days ahead.\n\"Things are improving and I know our sales board is looking pretty good for this year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 800 points to close at 25,478\u00a0or almost three per cent on Wednesday,\u00a0as recession fears settled in for stock investors. The Toronto Stock Exchange fared slightly better, down 300 points or almost two per cent to 16,335\u00a0on the same fears.\n\"With the yield curve inverting it certainly raises that [recession] prospect,\" Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist for R.W. Baird & Co., told CBC News. \"I\u00a0don't think there's any kind of mystery as to why we're seeing this kind of weakness.\"\nPart of the fear that investors have is that central banks may be running out of ammunition to stimulate growth as countries offset each other's attempts to boost growth with looser fiscal policy.\nWorsening economic data, weak inflationary pressures, the escalating U.S.-China trade war and intensifying tensions between protesters in Hong Kong and the Chinese government have boosted demand for safe-haven debt, sending many European government bond yields deeper into negative territory while the longest-dated U.S. Treasury yields have fallen to record lows.\nThe inversion of key parts of the Treasury yield curve, in which investors in short-term holdings get paid more than those in long-term ones, has historically been a reliable indicator of a coming recession. Typically longer term debt pays out more than short term debt, so when the outlook for the short term looks better than the long term one, it's taken as a sign of trouble ahead.\nOn Wednesday, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note tipped 2.1 basis points below two-year Treasury yields, the first time this spread has been negative since 2007, according to Refinitiv data.\nThe inversion rattled investors already worried that a U.S.-China trade war might trigger a global recession and kill off a decade-long bull market on Wall Street. Major U.S. stock indexes were down about two per cent as a result.\n\"People are becoming more convinced that global growth is weakening and people are starting to see some signs of transmission into U.S. sentiment,\" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate\u00a0strategist at TD Securities in New York.\n\"That longer-end rates are rallying does suggest some lack of confidence that the central banks will actually be able to do anything about the slowing global growth momentum,\" he added.\nAt the start of the year, markets and central banks were more optimistic on the global economic outlook. The European Central Bank had just ended its stimulative bond purchase program while the Fed was seen as likely to continue hiking rates after raising borrowing costs four times in 2018.\nThat shifted in March, however, when the Fed abruptly brought an end to its hiking cycle.\nIn conjunction with disappointing U.S. manufacturing data, the move sparked broad repositioning that led the three-month/10-year yield curve to invert for the first time since 2007. That was followed in July by the Fed's first rate cut since 2008.\nThe U.S. central bank looks better placed to ease conditions than many of its counterparts as it still has room to cut rates. Bond markets are priced for two additional U.S. rate cuts this year and a third in the first half of next year.\nThe ECB, meanwhile, is evaluating cutting rates further into negative territory and undertaking another bond purchase program.\nThe Bank of Japan is similarly looking at lowering its negative interest rates and expanding asset purchases.\nThe Bank of Canada, meanwhile, isn't immune from the sudden movement toward rate cuts, with investors pricing in about a one in four chance of a rate cut next month, and odds that jump to better than 90 per cent by next year.\nBy easing financial conditions, a central bank can stimulate an economy by making business and consumer loans cheaper, while the depreciation of the local currency that results from lower interest rates can boost exports.\nAs central banks compete for more dovish policies, however, they threaten to cancel each other out, making each move less effective.\n\"The reality is that central banks around the world are responding to a diminished outlook, looking to cut rates and ease financial conditions, so basically it means the Fed's not cutting rates in a vacuum,\" said Jon Hill, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.\nLast week, the New Zealand central bank sent investors scurrying to safe-haven currencies by cutting rates more than expected and indicating that it may take rates below zero if needed.\nA chorus of other central banks including those in India, Thailand and the Philippines also cut rates during the week.\n\"Overburdening of monetary policy in recent years has made it almost ineffective, or even harmful in some cases, as central banks are trying to address problems beyond their control, with limited and often experimental policy tools,\" Bank of America Merrill Lynch FX strategist Athanasios Vamvakidis said in a recent report.\n\"We see signs that this is not a sustainable situation and may not end up well,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Markets up as retailers rise with holiday shopping", "description": "Amazon, other retailers had last-minute surge in online holiday shopping", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/markets-up-boxing-day-1.5408772", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5408781.1577380652!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-financial-markets.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 26, 2019 12:29 PM ET", "2019-12-26T22:04:05.601Z"], "source": null, "content": "Retailers and technology companies drove modest gains for stocks on Wall Street Thursday, extending the market's record-setting run.\nTechnology stocks accounted for a big slice of the gains, which helped to briefly push the Nasdaq composite above the 9,000 mark for the first time.\nFinancial stocks rose along with bond yields, while Amazon and other retailers climbed after data showed a last-minute surge in online shopping helped holiday sales.\nEnergy stocks rose as crude oil prices headed higher.

About $1 million, with nearly $13 million each from the provincial and federal governments.\nIt's all part of a plan to lower the province's carbon footprint in an\u00a0era when climate change is top-of-mind, and is one element in a broader effort to prevent electricity rates from doubling once the long-delayed and over-budget Muskrat Falls project begins delivering up to 824 megawatts of power to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in a year from now.\nThe provincial government wants to move quickly because federal funding for such conversions could dry up by 2022.\n\"As we've said to the people of the province, we don't want them burdened with the impact of Muskrat Falls,\" Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady told CBC News during a recent\u00a0interview.\nThe Muskrat mortgage will cost more than $700 million in 2021, and is expected to grow in future years. Since the financing structure requires that Newfoundland ratepayers pick up this cost, power rates could surge above 23 cents per kilowatt-hour, up from its current 12.2 cents\u00a0if left unchecked.\nThe Liberal\u00a0government has pledged to prevent that from happening, and one strategy is to broaden the customer base in order to cover some of those fixed costs. So-called \"electrification\" has been identified by experts as a preferred option, since it would generate more revenue than export sales.\nThe greater the demand for power, the lower the price per kilowatt-hour. It's called \"price elasticity,\" and by gobbling up a lot of that power by heating public buildings, the provincial government hopes to reduce the burden on families and business owners.\nBut will it cost less to heat public buildings with electricity than with oil-based products? Or\u00a0is this strategy simply shifting the burden from ratepayers to taxpayers, which are essentially the same people? \u00a0\n\"We're not anticipating it to (cost) more,\" Coady said. \"But again the feasibility study will make sure we're doing the correct things.\n\"We're hoping we'll actually save some money.\"\nConversion\u00a0projects are underway at five government buildings: the\u00a0College of the North Atlantic campus in Placentia, Donald C.

The most recent jobs tally for the province is 519,000 jobs.\nPallister appears to be well aware it won't be easy to match this growth in less than\u00a0half the timeframe.\n\"They're ambitious goals, granted, but I think we're an ambitious people and I think we live in an ambitious province,\" Pallister\u00a0told reporters on Friday, outlining a number of ways he could accomplish this task in very broad strokes.\nFor starters, the Tory leader pledged to follow through on a previous promise to standardize the way permits are approved in Manitoba and to wrest away the power to approve development proposals from the City of Winnipeg and other municipalities.\nManitoba may create new board that could override Winnipeg land-use decisions\nThe premier claimed the elimination of red tape to this extent\u00a0would allow\u00a0$5.1 billion worth of new investments to proceed in Manitoba every year.\u00a0\nThis too is ambitious, as a number of Winnipeg mayors\u00a0\u2014 Sam Katz and Brian Bowman among them\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have tried to speed up the rate at which permits are approved and to eliminate other forms of red tape. The PCs appear to be banking on the notion they will succeed where Winnipeg and smaller municipalities have failed.\nThey also assume a new appeals process for land-use proposals\u00a0\u2014 which\u00a0may or may not include a new provincial-appointed appeals body \u2014 will increase certainty for developers, rather than create even more confusion.\nGenerally, developers have no problem with rules and regulations. They just want them to be applied consistently, so they can cost out their projects accurately and make sound decisions about whether to pursue them.\nLess red tape is just one component of Pallister's job-creation plan. He also pledged unspecified support for tourism, the film industry and mineral exploration in northern Manitoba. He pledged to create strategies for growing the food-processing, aerospace and manufacturing sectors and also made a broad pledge to create more green-technology jobs.\nHe promised a\u00a0modest increase\u00a0in infrastructure spending, which is one of the few demonstrable\u00a0ways a government can create jobs. He also pledged to enhance economic development,\u00a0after the province eliminated funding for a number of economic-development agencies and handed over some\u00a0international-trade responsibilities to the non-governmental World Trade Centre Winnipeg.\nFinally, he pledged to reduce red tape for the craft beer and spirits sector. This, presumably, is not just a move aimed at appeasing hipsters: Manitoba distilleries face higher retail markups for their booze than manufacturers of gin, whiskey and vodka do in other provinces.\nAll of the details for all these pledges are supposed to come later, which is par for the course for the PC re-election campaign, to date.\u00a0\nThe problem is no provincial government can credibly promise to create a specific number of jobs. The economic fortunes of a province as small as Manitoba rise and fall at the whims of worldwide geopolitical forces.\nEven brilliant economic innovation on the part of a forward-seeking government can not mitigate the effects of a growing U.S.-China trade rift, never mind a worldwide recession. The conventional wisdom Manitoba's economy is too diverse to\u00a0suffer in a recession could prove to be a myth\u00a0if the insurance, mining and manufacturing sectors continue to decline.\nSo far, the PCs do not appear to have a plan to diversify Manitoba's economy\u00a0even though the job-creation numbers under their watch exceed\u00a0the job-creation numbers during the final years of the Selinger NDP government.\nAccording to Statistics Canada, Manitoba generated 16,000 new jobs during the first 39 months of PC government\u00a0\u2014 all the months for which data are available. During the final 39 months of the NDP\u00a0government, Manitoba created 1,700 new jobs.\u00a0\nThere are only a handful of proven means of creating jobs in the short term. Some of them are not available to provincial governments.\nFor example, the feds could try to stimulate economic growth by lowering interest rates, at least in theory.\u00a0In reality, interest rates have been so low in Canada for so long, consumers can be forgiven if\u00a0they start expecting\u00a0to be paid to buy new cars or other big-ticket items.\nIn countries with high unemployment rates, governments can boost unemployment benefits in an attempt to stimulate consumer spending. But unemployment, which has ping-ponged between 4.5 and 6.5 per cent in Manitoba over the past decade,\u00a0isn't a big enough problem\u00a0in Canada overall\u00a0to require this particular sort of intervention.\u00a0\nThe province still has a few options at its disposal, including infrastructure spending. The problem, as the PCs have stated repeatedly over the past three years, is big-time spending on roads and\u00a0bridges is not sustainable in the long term.\nThis leaves one\u00a0job-creation\u00a0measure that businesses may want\u00a0to see in Manitoba: The reduction or outright elimination of the provincial payroll tax, formally known as the health and post-secondary education tax levy.\nReducing the payroll tax could allow businesses to hire more workers. Eliminating it altogether for new workers would provide an even greater incentive to do so.\nThere's no evidence this is on the table, but Pallister has made tax cuts a major part of his re-election campaign.\nIt's not a stretch to assert business owners in Manitoba are more interested in learning about specific tax-relief measures than they are in hearing broad pledges to create specific numbers of new jobs.\nSign up for\u00a0CBC Manitoba's newsletter\u00a0for insight into the latest election news.

And despite a list of problems awaiting attention, including most immediately a rail strike that if left unresolved will soon begin to do long-term damage in numerous\u00a0sectors, the country continues to have many, if\u00a0poorly distributed,\u00a0advantages.\nBut however Canada deals with its internal problems it must do so in the context of a global economy that continues to struggle.\nOf course when\u00a0scrying the economic future, everyone has a different crystal ball.\u00a0Among those who sounded a less optimistic note at the end of last week was Laurence Boone, chief economist at the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, often seen as the rich countries' economic think-tank.\n\"The outlook for the global economy is worrying and policy-makers should be worried,\" Boone, ominously, began her video presentation on the OECD's latest outlook with the less-than-stirring title\u00a0Weak trade and investment threaten long-term growth.\nLike the Bank of Canada's Stephen Poloz, Boone believes the disruption in global trade, caused at least partly by U.S. President Donald Trump's attempt to get what he saw as a better deal, has done long-term damage. Repeated\u00a0and continuing\u00a0trade scares\u00a0have meant businesses that would otherwise have borrowed at current bargain rates to invest\u00a0have put off those decisions due to uncertainty.\nBoone's solution is a new round of fiscal spending by governments\u00a0on things like \"21st-century\u00a0infrastucture,\" partly to replace that private sector investment but intended\u00a0also to reduce uncertainty enough so that businesses once again feel they can borrow to expand with confidence.\n\"We can escape long-term stagnation by combining social reforms with targeted spending and tax policies, at lower interest rates, and raise investment confidence,\" said Boone in a call for concerted action by global governments. \"But everyone must recognize that the time to turn the tide is now.\"\nA more optimistic outlook came in market analysis from the London Financial Times\u00a0in an attempt to explain the recent surge in stocks, that included record highs for Canada's main index,\u00a0and an increase in short-term bond earnings quite different from the inverted yields so recently considered a recession warning flag.\nThings are looking up says FT. <a href=\"https://t.co/5zB29PyCIw\">https://t.co/5zB29PyCIw</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2VZXIkLCpw\">pic.twitter.com/2VZXIkLCpw</a>\nThe idea is that unlike concerns from people like Boone, and similar gloom from the IMF and World Bank, which are based on data that has already been collected, markets act as an\u00a0indicator of future expectations as traders load up in anticipation of better returns ahead.\nBut even after assembling a collection of data, including a chart that shows a gentle upturn in the economic outlook for major world economies including Canada, their conclusions are\u00a0less than enthusiastic.\n\"So far\u00a0the evidence suggests the slide in the global economy is coming to an end, but the pace of recovery is still expected to be weak,\" said the FT analysis.\nThe feeling is echoed in the deliberations released last week of the U.S. central bank in the run-up to its latest interest rate move where Fed chair Jerome Powell assured us this was his last cut for a while. Unless of course the economy weakens again, possibly due to a stalemate in the trade talks between the U.S. and China.\nSuch conditional parsing is always the way of economic forecasts. The ability of\u00a0markets, or any forecaster,\u00a0to tell us with reliability what is around the corner is far from certain.\nIn the meantime, the new cabinet is getting plenty of advice over how to squeeze the most out of an uncertain economy.\nFrom\u00a0Margaret McCuaig-Johnston at the Macdonald-Laurier\u00a0Institute comes the advice that Canada must make it a priority to reset its own trade and political relationship with China, including making a concerted effort to diversify Canada's Asian trade.\u00a0From David Parkinson at the Globe and Mail, that reappointed finance minister Bill Morneau must overhaul the tax code.\nAt a speech to the Ontario Securities Commission billed as a \"fireside chat,\" the Bank of Canada's Poloz\u00a0hinted at\u00a0two aspirations for his political masters\u00a0that may end up in conflict. One was a liberalization\u00a0in Canadian interprovincial trade, and the other a new awareness of how climate change represents a risk to the financial system.\nBut while the government will have its work cut out for it in synthesizing its perceived election mandate to reduce carbon with the oil-producing regions'\u00a0insistence on increasing the export of carbon fuels, it will do so with a few ace cards in its hand.\nOne is the strong consumer economy both in the U.S. and here at home prompted by job and wage growth that has helped allow North Americans to live in a bubble of relative prosperity.\nLast week the Canadian Federation of Independent Business revealed that despite a steady drip of immigration, more than 430,000 jobs have gone unfilled in the Canadian private sector. Statistics Canada provides its own\u00a0jobs update Dec. 6.\nA second is core inflation\u00a0\u2014 the measure of price rises with volatile sectors removed\u00a0\u2014 of more than two per cent that remains the envy of rich countries around the world, including the United States, meaning that Canada can reserve interest rate cuts for when the economy really needs them.\nAnd finally, despite the social complications it creates, Canada has the advantage of\u00a0a seemingly insatiable demand for housing that has led to a resurgent building boom that, so long as the economy continues to\u00a0inch\u00a0ahead, shows no sign of ending.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Terry Roberts", "title": "From fossil fuels to Muskrat: How MUN could lead the charge to electrify public buildings", "description": "Shift to electricity at Memorial University could displace 11 million litres of diesel annually", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/electrification-muskrat-rate-1.5403872", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5428124.1579115518!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mun-utility-annex.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 28, 2020 7:28 AM NT", "2020-01-28T10:58:21.654Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The provincial government is aggressively moving ahead with plans to wean public buildings off oil-fuelled heating systems as Muskrat Falls power inches closer to reality, and Memorial University could lead this conversion strategy.\nA study is underway to determine whether it's feasible, from both financial and environmental standpoints,\u00a0to displace the 11 million litres of No. 2 diesel burned annually to heat some 60 buildings on the St. John's campus, with electricity from a provincial grid that will soon be energized almost exclusively by renewable hydro power.\nDocuments obtained from government detail a list of 27 buildings \u2014 from college campuses and schools to arts and culture centres and transportation depots \u2014 in which work is either underway or planned to rip out or mothball oil furnaces and install electric boilers or more traditional baseboard heating systems.\nThe average cost? About $1 million, with nearly $13 million each from the provincial and federal governments.\nIt's all part of a plan to lower the province's carbon footprint in an\u00a0era when climate change is top-of-mind, and is one element in a broader effort to prevent electricity rates from doubling once the long-delayed and over-budget Muskrat Falls project begins delivering up to 824 megawatts of power to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in a year from now.\nThe provincial government wants to move quickly because federal funding for such conversions could dry up by 2022.\n\"As we've said to the people of the province, we don't want them burdened with the impact of Muskrat Falls,\" Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady told CBC News during a recent\u00a0interview.\nThe Muskrat mortgage will cost more than $700 million in 2021, and is expected to grow in future years. Since the financing structure requires that Newfoundland ratepayers pick up this cost, power rates could surge above 23 cents per kilowatt-hour, up from its current 12.2 cents\u00a0if left unchecked.\nThe Liberal\u00a0government has pledged to prevent that from happening, and one strategy is to broaden the customer base in order to cover some of those fixed costs. So-called \"electrification\" has been identified by experts as a preferred option, since it would generate more revenue than export sales.\nThe greater the demand for power, the lower the price per kilowatt-hour. It's called \"price elasticity,\" and by gobbling up a lot of that power by heating public buildings, the provincial government hopes to reduce the burden on families and business owners.\nBut will it cost less to heat public buildings with electricity than with oil-based products? Or\u00a0is this strategy simply shifting the burden from ratepayers to taxpayers, which are essentially the same people? \u00a0\n\"We're not anticipating it to (cost) more,\" Coady said. \"But again the feasibility study will make sure we're doing the correct things.\n\"We're hoping we'll actually save some money.\"\nConversion\u00a0projects are underway at five government buildings: the\u00a0College of the North Atlantic campus in Placentia, Donald C.

In\u00a0Calgary, Edmonton, Regina and Saskatoon, house prices fell.\nThe average house price\u00a0in Charlottetown rose from $200,000\u00a0to $277,000. Of the areas commonly tracked by CREA, only the Niagara Region and Vancouver Island saw higher percentage price increases.\nGreg Lipton, president of the P.E.I. Real Estate Association, said the seeds of the hot housing market were sown with the arrival of immigrants through the provincial nominee program.\n\"They came with a lot of money and they wanted something new, and we didn't really have a lot of new stuff at that time,\" said Lipton.\n\"New construction is very expensive. We're up to close to $200 per square foot nowadays to get anything built.\"\nP.E.I. has been one of the fastest-growing provinces population wise, and immigration has been a big part of that .\nFrom 2010 to 2018 more than 12,000 immigrants came to the Island. But at the same time, P.E.I. has the worst five-year immigrant retention rate of any of the provinces.\nWhen those immigrants leave, said Lipton, they are looking to get a return on their housing investment, so the price of that house goes up a little more.\n\"There's not enough housing here right now, affordable or any other kind of housing, so once again people will pay the price.\"\nBut immigration is not the only driver of house prices.\nVacation rental services, such as Airbnb\u00a0and VRBO, have also been a factor, as property owners have figured out they can get $200 a night for a unit\u00a0instead of $1,000 a month on a one-year lease.\n\"Airbnb\u00a0is something that we were very unprepared for,\" said Lipton.\nThe possibility of higher return has led to an interest in purchasing more properties to convert to vacation rentals.\n\"The duplex all of a sudden turns into, well, it's going to be a triplex. And the triplex is all single bedrooms with a shared kitchen and a shared bathroom,\" said Lipton.\nThat activity is driving up demand and, consequently, prices.\nAnd\u00a0it has led to a shortage in the rental market.\nIn 2018,\u00a0the apartment vacancy rate was 0.2 per cent.

It was the most Fed dissents in three years.\nThe divisions on the policy committee underscored the challenges confronting chairman Jerome Powell in guiding the Fed at time of high uncertainty in the U.S. economy.\nStock prices tumbled after the Fed issued its statement, reflecting disappointment\u00a0it had declined to indicate that more rate cuts are likely this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 150 points an hour later.\nThe economic expansion appears durable in its 11th year of growth, with a still-solid job market and steady consumer spending. But the Fed is trying to combat threats including uncertainties caused by President Donald Trump's trade war with China, slower global growth and a slump in American manufacturing. The Fed notes in a policy statement that \"business fixed investment and exports have weakened.\"\nThe Fed's modest rate cut irritated Trump, who has attacked the central bank and insisted it slash rates more aggressively. The president immediately signalled his discontent on Twitter\nJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No \u201cguts,\u201d no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\nUpdated economic and interest rate forecasts issued Wednesday by the Fed show that only seven of 17 officials foresee at least one additional rate cut this year. And at least two Fed officials expect a rate hike next year.\nNone of the policymakers foresee rates falling below 1.5 per cent\u00a0in 2020 \u2014 a sign the turbulence from a global slowdown and Trump's escalation of the trade war is viewed as manageable.\nThe median forecasts show the economy is expected to grow a modest 2.2 per cent\u00a0this year, 2 per cent\u00a0next year and 1.9 per cent\u00a0in 2021. Those forecasts are well below the Trump administration's projection that the president's policies will accelerate growth to 3 per cent\u00a0annually or better. But they also suggest policymakers do not envision a recession.\nUnemployment is projected to be 3.7 per cent\u00a0and inflation 1.5 per cent, below the Fed's target level of 2 per cent.\nA resumption of trade talks between the Trump administration and Beijing and a less antagonistic tone between the two sides have supported the view that additional rate cuts might not be necessary. So has a belief that oil prices will remain elevated, that inflation might finally be reaching the Fed's target level and that there are increasing signs that the U.S. economy remains sturdy.\nThe job market looks solid, wages are rising, consumers are still spending, and even sluggish sectors such as manufacturing and construction have shown signs of rebounding.\nYet no one, perhaps not even the Fed, is sure of how interest rate policy will unfold in coming months. Too many uncertainties exist, notably the outcome of Trump's trade war.\nTrump has in the meantime kept up a stream of public attacks on the central bank's policymaking, including referring to Powell as an \"enemy\" and the Fed's policymakers as \"boneheads.\" Even though the economy looks resilient, the president has insisted\u00a0the Fed slash its benchmark rate more deeply \u2014 even to below zero, as the European Central Bank has done \u2014 part to weaken the U.S. dollar and make American exports more competitive.\nPowell has said policymakers remain focused on sustaining the expansion and keeping prices stable without regard to any outside pressures.\nThe Fed is monitoring the global slowdown, especially in Europe, and the U.K.'s effort to leave the European Union. A disruptive Brexit could destabilize not just Europe but the U.S. economy, too.\nU.S. inflation, which has long been dormant, has begun to show signs it is reaching the Fed's two\u00a0per cent target and might remain there. If the Fed's policymakers conclude that inflation will sustain a faster pace, it might give them pause about cutting rates much further.\nThe most serious threat to the expansion is widely seen as Trump's trade war. The increased import taxes he has imposed on goods from China and Europe \u2014 and the counter-tariffs other nations have applied to U.S. exports \u2014 have hurt many American companies and paralyzed their plans for investment and expansion.\nIn recent days, the Trump administration and Beijing have acted to de-escalate tensions before a new round of trade talks planned for October in Washington. Yet most analysts foresee no significant agreement emerging this fall in the conflict, which is fundamentally over Beijing's aggressive drive to supplant America's technological dominance.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney to serve as UN special envoy on climate", "description": "Carney drew international acclaim during his 5 years as Canada's top central banker", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/un-climate-change-envoy-mark-carney-1.5380092", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5380248.1575226292!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/britain-economy.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 01, 2019 10:12 AM ET", "2019-12-01T19:14:02.193Z"], "source": null, "content": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who previously served as Canada's top central banker, will be taking on a new role as the United Nations' special envoy on climate action and climate finance.\nUN\u00a0Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made the announcement while speaking to reporters in Madrid on Sunday, adding the move will take effect next year.\nCarney was due to step down as bank governor early next year, having already extended what was meant to be a five-year term.\nDuring his tenure, the former investment banker played a key role in trying to manage the British economy as the country prepares to leave the European Union.\nCarney drew international recognition during his five years at the helm of the Bank of Canada, and at one point was named on Time magazine's \"most influential\" list.\nHe took over the job at the beginning of 2008 amid the first signs of the financial crisis, and has been widely credited for helping Canada weather the recession by keeping interest rates low.\nSpeaking at a news conference ahead of a climate summit that opens in Madrid on Monday,\u00a0Guterres described Carney as \"a remarkable pioneer in pushing the financial sector to work on climate.\"\nCarney, who is due to step down as head of the Bank of England in January, has urged the financial sector to transform its management of climate risk, and led various international initiatives to improve supervision and disclosure.\nThe Bank of England said Carney would seek to make the impact of climate change central to financial reporting, risk management and the calculation of returns ahead of a global summit in Glasgow in November 2020.\n\"The disclosures of climate risk must become comprehensive, climate risk management must be transformed, and investing for a net-zero world must go mainstream,\" Carney said in a statement.\nHe has spoken of \"stranded assets\" \u2014\u00a0deposits of coal, oil and gas that might lose their value if the world shifts away from carbon \u2014 and decried a lack of transparency about the effect on global warming of trillions of dollars of potential investments.\n"}, {"author": "Shaina Luck", "title": "Interest in off-grid homes growing, but mortgages haven't kept pace", "description": "People who work in the solar power industry report growing interest in self-sufficient homes", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/off-grid-homes-mortages-challenges-1.5389416", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5389473.1575914863!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/doctor-solar.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 10, 2019 6:00 AM AT", "2019-12-10T10:00:00.657Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A growing number of Nova Scotians are considering an off-grid home, driven by factors like electricity outages and storms, as well as a desire to be environmentally friendly.\u00a0\nBut in many cases finding the money to buy or build can be tricky, as most lenders still consider off-grid homes to be too risky to finance.\u00a0\nDave Angot, the owner of solar installation company Doctor Solar, estimates about 30 to 40 out of every 250 customers are interested in going off-grid.\u00a0\n\"Now we find that more than 10 per cent of our customers will ask the question and want a power supply and a battery backup just simply for grid outages. It used to be very seldom that someone would request that, and now it's starting to become a material percentage,\" he said.\nHe said in past years the few requests for off-grid installations he did get were usually for homes being built in secluded areas such as oceanfront properties far from the electricity grid. That's changing now.\u00a0\n\"There's off-grid because of distance from grid, but there's also people who want more robust self-provided energy when the grid goes down,\" he said. \"That's been the biggest spike in interest \u2014 battery storage and being able to operate off-grid even though the grid is there.\"\nHowever, converting to solar or building a house that runs on solar energy can be a significant expense. Cost can be a challenge for potential buyers or builders, as banks are often hesitant to finance off-grid homes.\u00a0\n\"I think certainly in the last few years we've definitely come across requests for this type of financing more and more,\" said Don MacMillan, the interim vice-president\u00a0of the Canadian Mortgage Brokers Association Atlantic.\nHowever, the requests are still relatively rare and mortgage brokers aren't able to place mortgages for off-grid homes as often as they're requested.\n\"Many lenders just will not do them, period,\" he said. Some lenders have a policy of only financing properties with electricity and water service.\u00a0\n\"Typically, off-grid housing, the only ones that I've personally been aware of actually going through has been through a local bank or a local branch where they have done it not as a mortgage loan but as a personal loan,\" he said.\u00a0\nA personal loan is typically charged at higher rates than a mortgage loan, he adds. Banks and other lenders are often unwilling to take on a traditional mortgage for an off-grid home because they regard it as higher risk.\n\"The biggest risk with it is the marketability,\" he said. \"Because the insurers and the lenders look at it as, in the event \u2014 which obviously we hope never happens \u2014 but if they had to take a property back through a foreclosure action, the fear is that an off-grid house or property is very much more difficult to market and sell than a house on the grid.\"\u00a0\nMacMillan said the situation might change in the future as demand goes up.\nJennifer Corson, an architect at Solterre Design, a Halifax company that specializes in green buildings, has also seen the growing interest in off-grid living. She's experienced it first hand through an off-grid \"concept house\" her family uses on Second Peninsula in Lunenburg County.\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of people are wanting to be a bit more independent or self-sufficient when we're being faced with power outages that we've been having in the last few years,\" she said.\u00a0\nPeople on Second Peninsula were without power for between six and eight days following Hurricane Dorian in September, and the concept house became a place where Corson's neighbours came to charge phones and boil water.\u00a0\nThe concept house has a commercial mortgage held by Corson's company, which was possible thanks in part to the performance standards Solterre used in the construction. The house will never freeze even if all the backup systems fail, she said.\nThere is some funding available to homeowners in Nova Scotia. The most recent version of the provincial SolarHomes program kicked in Nov. 1. It is administered by Efficiency Nova Scotia and allows a maximum rebate of $6,000 on new home construction or conversion.\nAngot said the customers he's serving often have no interest in dealing with the hassle of a generator to provide emergency power and are turning to solar to see them through possible power outages.\u00a0\n\"That's what we're seeing a lot, especially demographically, people that are retired and nearing retirement. They tend to want a simple solution. Some people are operating medical equipment that you have to have access to some power. That's starting to become really important,\" he said.\nCorson hopes with good building techniques and more information for lenders, more off-grid homes will be possible.\u00a0\n\"I think there's some educating along the way,\" she said. \"The appraiser that we worked with, with our company, could see that there's a potential negative in terms of marketability of it being off-grid, but there's also a positive in its independence and self-sufficiency.\"\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": "Kevin Yarr", "title": "How Charlottetown has become one of the hottest housing markets in Canada", "description": "New stock, new uses driving prices", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-house-prices-1.5230305", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4685768.1527797443!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/house-construction.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 31, 2019 6:00 AM AT", "2019-07-31T11:58:02.141Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "House prices in Charlottetown rose 38.5 per cent over the last three years, one of the fastest rates in the country, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.\nThat's faster than Victoria (33.3 per cent), Vancouver (10.93 per cent), Toronto (25.3 per cent) and Montreal (17.7 per cent).

Green means there's little evidence of a problem, yellow means there's some reason for concern, and red means there is a high risk.\nNationally, the CMHC\u00a0gives the housing market a yellow. It's the second quarter in a row for that rating, after assessments for the previous two and a half years\u00a0found there to be a high level of concern overall. Across the country, the CMHC says there's little evidence of widespread overheating, price acceleration, or overbuilding. But there's enough overvaluation to warrant a yellow flag.\n\"Moderate evidence of overvaluation continues to be the only sign of vulnerability for Canada as a whole,\" CMHC's chief economist Bob Dugan said. \"Imbalances between house prices and housing market fundamentals have narrowed with declining home prices in the resale market and a growing pool of potential first-time home buyers.\"\nWhile the national picture is looking OK, there are regional pockets of major worry in various places across the country.\nRegina was given a red warning flag for overbuilding, while Victoria, Hamilton and Toronto's markets were also given a red overall because they all scored solid yellows in every category except that one. \"However, conditions for these factors are showing signs of easing in all three centres,\" the CMHC said.\nVancouver used to be on the red flag list, but came off it in the past quarter, mainly because prices have come down a little even as fundamentals have improved \u2014 in the CMHC's estimation. While the city's real estate is still moderately overvalued, there's little evidence of the other three categories, which is why it was a yellow flag overall.\nMoving east from B.C., Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, Regina and Winnipeg all scored yellows overall, mainly because of overbuilding. Otherwise, it's almost all green except for some modest overvaluation in Winnipeg.\nAcross central and eastern Canada,\u00a0Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, Moncton, Halifax and St. John's were all deemed low risks overall, although\u00a0Montreal\u00a0and\u00a0Moncton\u00a0were singled out for overheating, while St John's is showing signs of\u00a0overbuilding.\nOverall, the agency says the real estate market is looking a little better mainly because average prices are ticking down, even as incomes and population levels keep rising.\n\"Combined with declining home prices in the resale market, these dynamics contribute to maintaining the average estimate of overvaluation near zero,\" the CMHC said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U.S. central bank cuts interest rate again \u2014 but split on what to do next", "description": "Federal Reserve moving to stimulate economy as trade fears mount", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/federal-reserve-rate-cut-1.5288390", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5288418.1568826039!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jerome-powell.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 18, 2019 1:34 PM ET", "2019-09-18T19:35:35.120Z"], "source": null, "content": "A sharply divided Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for a second time this year, but indicated it may not cut rates any further this year.\nThe Fed's move will reduce its benchmark rate \u2014 which influences many consumer and business loans \u2014 by an additional quarter point to a range of 1.75 per cent\u00a0to 2 per cent.\nThe action was approved 7-3, with two officials preferring to keep rates unchanged and one arguing for a bigger half-point cut. It was the most Fed dissents in three years.\nThe divisions on the policy committee underscored the challenges confronting chairman Jerome Powell in guiding the Fed at time of high uncertainty in the U.S. economy.\nStock prices tumbled after the Fed issued its statement, reflecting disappointment\u00a0it had declined to indicate that more rate cuts are likely this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 150 points an hour later.\nThe economic expansion appears durable in its 11th year of growth, with a still-solid job market and steady consumer spending. But the Fed is trying to combat threats including uncertainties caused by President Donald Trump's trade war with China, slower global growth and a slump in American manufacturing. The Fed notes in a policy statement that \"business fixed investment and exports have weakened.\"\nThe Fed's modest rate cut irritated Trump, who has attacked the central bank and insisted it slash rates more aggressively. The president immediately signalled his discontent on Twitter\nJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No \u201cguts,\u201d no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\nUpdated economic and interest rate forecasts issued Wednesday by the Fed show that only seven of 17 officials foresee at least one additional rate cut this year. And at least two Fed officials expect a rate hike next year.\nNone of the policymakers foresee rates falling below 1.5 per cent\u00a0in 2020 \u2014 a sign the turbulence from a global slowdown and Trump's escalation of the trade war is viewed as manageable.\nThe median forecasts show the economy is expected to grow a modest 2.2 per cent\u00a0this year, 2 per cent\u00a0next year and 1.9 per cent\u00a0in 2021. Those forecasts are well below the Trump administration's projection that the president's policies will accelerate growth to 3 per cent\u00a0annually or better. But they also suggest policymakers do not envision a recession.\nUnemployment is projected to be 3.7 per cent\u00a0and inflation 1.5 per cent, below the Fed's target level of 2 per cent.\nA resumption of trade talks between the Trump administration and Beijing and a less antagonistic tone between the two sides have supported the view that additional rate cuts might not be necessary. So has a belief that oil prices will remain elevated, that inflation might finally be reaching the Fed's target level and that there are increasing signs that the U.S. economy remains sturdy.\nThe job market looks solid, wages are rising, consumers are still spending, and even sluggish sectors such as manufacturing and construction have shown signs of rebounding.\nYet no one, perhaps not even the Fed, is sure of how interest rate policy will unfold in coming months. Too many uncertainties exist, notably the outcome of Trump's trade war.\nTrump has in the meantime kept up a stream of public attacks on the central bank's policymaking, including referring to Powell as an \"enemy\" and the Fed's policymakers as \"boneheads.\" Even though the economy looks resilient, the president has insisted\u00a0the Fed slash its benchmark rate more deeply \u2014 even to below zero, as the European Central Bank has done \u2014 part to weaken the U.S. dollar and make American exports more competitive.\nPowell has said policymakers remain focused on sustaining the expansion and keeping prices stable without regard to any outside pressures.\nThe Fed is monitoring the global slowdown, especially in Europe, and the U.K.'s effort to leave the European Union. A disruptive Brexit could destabilize not just Europe but the U.S. economy, too.\nU.S. inflation, which has long been dormant, has begun to show signs it is reaching the Fed's two\u00a0per cent target and might remain there. If the Fed's policymakers conclude that inflation will sustain a faster pace, it might give them pause about cutting rates much further.\nThe most serious threat to the expansion is widely seen as Trump's trade war. The increased import taxes he has imposed on goods from China and Europe \u2014 and the counter-tariffs other nations have applied to U.S. exports \u2014 have hurt many American companies and paralyzed their plans for investment and expansion.\nIn recent days, the Trump administration and Beijing have acted to de-escalate tensions before a new round of trade talks planned for October in Washington. Yet most analysts foresee no significant agreement emerging this fall in the conflict, which is fundamentally over Beijing's aggressive drive to supplant America's technological dominance.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Paul Volcker, U.S. Federal Reserve's former chief, dead at 92", "description": "Volcker tamed inflation in the 80s and later inspired tough Wall Street reforms", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/former-u-s-federal-reserve-chief-paul-volcker-dies-92-1.5389107", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5389138.1575903329!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/470438232.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 09, 2019 10:37 AM ET", "2019-12-09T16:12:52.811Z"], "source": null, "content": "Paul Volcker, the towering former U.S. Federal Reserve chair who tamed inflation in the 1980s and decades later inspired tough Wall Street reforms in the wake of the global financial crisis, died Monday at age 92, his daughter Janice Zima said.\nVolcker, who Zima said had been suffering from prostate cancer, was the first to bring celebrity status to the job of U.S. central banker, serving as chairman of the Fed from 1979 to 1987.

Part of his aura of power was due to the Fed's unusual nature \u2014\u00a0the central bank's governors, although appointed by the president and overseen by Congress, are effectively answerable to no one.\nIn 2018,\u00a0when President Trump regularly attacked the Fed as \"crazy\" for raising interest rates, Volcker advised chairman Jerome Powell to simply ignore the criticism.\nVolcker, who slammed the economy's brakes like no other Fed chair, also absorbed his share of barbs from lawmakers in the 1980s. But he faced down both that criticism and, ultimately, inflation that had spiked higher than any point since the 1940s.\n\"Without Paul Volcker's toughness and guts, we may never have broken the grip of rising inflation and declining productivity that plagued the United States during the 1970s,\" former SEC chair\u00a0Arthur Levitt wrote in the foreword of a Joseph Treaster's 2004 biography Paul Volcker: The Making of a Financial Legend.\nMany have credited that effort for setting the stage for steady economic growth and a long bull market that since the early 1990s brought prosperity to millions of Americans. Yet critics say he also pushed the United States into an unnecessarily severe recession in 1981-82.\nVolcker was appointed Fed chairman by a Democratic president, Jimmy Carter, and then reappointed by a Republican, Ronald Reagan. He was only a few months into the job when on Oct. 6, 1979, he announced a one-point rise in the discount interest rate to an all-time high of 12 per cent.\nOther borrowing costs followed and the prime rate climbed to a record 20.5 per cent by May 1981. Unemployment rose to 11 per cent and the country was steeped in economic malaise. Yet between 1980 and 1983, inflation fell from nearly 15 per cent to less than three per cent.\nVolcker's inflation-slaying action spurred massive protests, with farmers blockading the Fed's headquarters with tractors, and builders famously mailing him a wooden 2-by-4 to show their lumber was no longer needed. One U.S. senator demanded he take his \"boot off the neck of the economy.\"\nVolcker, however, later conceded he had made a mistake by ordering such a major squeeze on credit, telling Reuters in 1987 that if he could, \"I would have played it different.\"\nAfter leaving the Fed, Volcker led a series of blue-ribbon panels, including one that investigated the UN\u00a0oil-for-food program that had been designed to provide humanitarian relief to Saddam Hussein's Iraq while it was under international sanctions.\nHe found some 2,200 companies in 66 countries diverted $1.8 billion US to Saddam's government, and\u00a0Saddam earned another $8 billion selling oil outside the program.\nIn 1999, he led a committee of Jewish groups and Swiss banks to resolve questions over unclaimed bank accounts of Holocaust victims, eventually brokering a $1.25-billion agreement.\nIn 2002, Volcker headed an independent oversight committee looking into the Arthur Anderson accounting firm following its role in the Enron scandal. Enron had filed for what was then the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history under questions about its finances and accounting practices, and Anderson had signed off on its books.\nAlthough the panel's work was upstaged by criminal indictments, some of Volcker's recommendations were incorporated into the Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed by Congress in 2002.\nYears later, under Obama, Volcker headed the Economic Recovery Advisory Board from 2009-2011\u00a0where he was a sharp critic of modern banking, musing the only useful recent banking innovation was the automated teller machine.\nHe gained new notoriety after Obama asked Congress in 2010 to tuck the Volcker rule into the landmark Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which was meant to avoid a repetition of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.\nIn September 2012, he told Reuters the Volcker rule's \"surgical swipe\" at speculative proprietary trading is a better approach to reining in huge financial institutions than the more extreme calls to break them up.\nBeginning in his years at the Fed, when he railed against the huge U.S. trade and budget deficits, and battled inflation at every opportunity, investors idolized the man. Since publishing his book in 2018, Volcker has even criticized the Fed's overly precise devotion to a two\u00a0per cent inflation target.\n\"Paul Volcker is an immovable force when it comes to his beliefs and his principles,\" friend and former U.S. Commerce secretary Peter Peterson said in May 2013, when the Economic Club of New York presented Volcker a leadership award.\nBorn Sept. 5, 1927, in Cape May, N.J., Volcker was educated at Princeton, Harvard and the London School of Economics. He was an undersecretary at the U.S.\u00a0Treasury Department during the Nixon administration and president of the Federal Reserve of New York before taking over the Fed chairmanship.\nHis wife of 44 years, Barbara, died in 1998 after years of having rheumatoid arthritis. They had two children.\n"}, {"author": "Bryan Labby", "title": "The search for jobs and a recovery in Red Deer: 'There's absolutely nothing out there'", "description": "People, business owners, social agencies 'continue to struggle' in central Alberta city", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/economy-red-deer-business-confidence-social-agencies-unemployment-1.5438059", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5442366.1580164005!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/downtown-red-deer.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 27, 2020 5:00 AM MT", "2020-01-28T01:47:18.320Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Sean\u00a0might consider himself lucky since he's been out of work only since\u00a0December. The 46-year-old is pretty succinct when asked to describe the economic climate in this city of 100,000.\n\"It sucks,\" he says, after picking up a few crates of food from the Red Deer Food Bank. He didn't want to give CBC\u00a0News his last name.\nBy his count, he's applied for 40 to 50 jobs since he was laid off seven weeks ago.\u00a0\n\"There's nothing out there. There's absolutely nothing out there for my kind of line of work.\"\u00a0\nIn Red Deer, more storefronts, industrial bays and offices are being emptied out as the province's economic slump enters its sixth year. Economic diversification and resuscitating the downtown are some of the priorities in this blue collar town known for its ties to oil and gas and agriculture.\nAt McLevin Industries, the family-run business has been around for almost as long as Red Deer itself. The metal and steel manufacturing shop opened in 1917, when Conservative\u00a0Robert Borden was prime minister.\n\"I like to joke, I know I don't look a day over 90,\" said Linda McLevin, who co-owns the business with her husband, Alan, whose grandfather opened the shop and was one of Red Deer's first blacksmiths.\u00a0\nMcLevin and her husband are the third generation to run the shop. They've seen plenty of ups and downs, including the recession in the early 1980s \u2014\u00a0and their sons' decision in 2014 to step away from the business, possibly threatening the family legacy.\nShe says she is generally a positive person, but she just can't see an end to this current slump.\n\"Our own personal feeling is we don't see light at the end of the tunnel.\"\nSince 2014, she says, revenues at the company have plunged 40 per cent and they've shed 19 jobs\u00a0\u2014 including Linda's two sons, who dabbled for a bit at the shop\u00a0but decided to move on.\n\"They kind of saw the writing on the wall and pursued other interests,\" she said.\nToday, the company has just six employees. Before the recession, the McLevins planned to move to a new facility they were going to build on 44 acres of land they purchased and converted into an industrial park. Those plans have long been scrapped and most of the parcel sold.\nSuch is the state of Red Deer's real estate market. There are vast spaces of industrial parks that have been hollowed out, in many cases prices and lease rates have been cut.\u00a0\nEven though 2019 saw more industrial space occupied than vacated for the first time since 2014, the overall feeling is gloomy.\n\"There's not a lot of factors that play into the optimism that things are going to get better. When you look at the market sentiment out there, what people's perception of the\u00a0economy is, it's overall negative,\" said Brett Salomons of Salomons Commercial realty.\u00a0\nThe company's name is all over town, advertising office, retail and industrial space that is desperate for a new owner or tenant.\u00a0\nThe downtown office vacancy rate is hovering around 15 per cent, while the industrial vacancy rate dipped below 10 per cent for the first time in years. However, Edgar Industrial Park, the city's largest with 3.2-million square feet\u00a0of space, also has a vacancy rate of 15 per cent.\nSalomons says several oil and gas service companies have either closed or moved away to other parts of Alberta, B.C. or the United States.\n\"The overall confidence is at an all-time low,\" he said.\nHe cites the lack of pipeline capacity, climate change\u00a0and what he calls Ottawa's anti-Alberta policies for putting the squeeze on\u00a0the province's main industry.\u00a0\nAfter peaking at $334,000 in August\u00a02017, the median house price in Red Deer last month settled in at $290,000\u00a0\u2014 a 13\u00a0per cent drop.\u00a0\nThe mayor of Red Deer says if the city is serious about an economic revival, it needs to diversify its economy and soon.\u00a0Tara Veer says her community has been making some strides, but it's going to be a marathon, not a sprint.\nShe says Red Deer College's multi-year transition to a university is a significant step forward, along with the community's recent success at attracting major events, including the Canadian Finals Rodeo, the Canada Winter Games and this year's world junior hockey championship, with games in both Red Deer and Edmonton.\n\"But we do continue to struggle,\" said Veer.\n\"We've had significant closures, particularly in our industrial parks, and obviously that has a reverberating effect throughout our local economy and it's deeply concerning,\" she said.\nThe fallout includes growing concerns about social disorder in the downtown related to homelessness and issues connected to a supervised drug consumption site.\n\"It's exacerbated the challenges that we face as a community,\" said Veer.\nThe Red Deer Food Bank says it's now helping as many as 50 people and families every day. Not only are people hungry, but some are stressed out and some have lashed out at staff and volunteers.\u00a0\nIt's prompted a warning,\u00a0taped to the front door, against abusive and belligerent behaviour.\u00a0\n\"Not being able to feed your family has got to be the highest level of stress for anybody,\" said Alice Kolisnyk, deputy director of the food bank.\u00a0\n\"So\u00a0yeah, they're very distressed, and to come into a food bank to ask for help, it\u00a0escalates. We do our very best to reassure them we're here to help them,\" she said.\nAnother agency is putting families on wait lists for some programs, including counselling, which has seen increased demand from families trying to cope with myriad issues tied to the economic downturn.\n\"I think we all know when money's tight \u2026 you get stressed. So when when parents are stressed, they don't manage children's behaviours as well,\" said Judy Scott, the executive director of Family Services of Central Alberta.\u00a0\nWhile pressure builds to help more people, the agency is being asked to reapply for provincial funding for two of its main programs, home visitation and parenting skills. Scott has already been warned to expect less funding. As a result, she's had to notify as many as 20 of her employees that their jobs could be eliminated by the end of March.\n\"The reality is there will be change in services, there will be some of our services that we will no longer have,\" she said.\nWhile she supports some of the proposed funding changes that are, in part, aimed at eliminating the duplication of some services,\u00a0she says now is not the time to cut when more families are seeking help.\n\"Somebody's losing out and unfortunately that's going to be families.\"\u00a0\nCity council recently approved a fund to help kick start residential development in the downtown to lure more people to not only live in the core, but to at least spend an afternoon or evening at different events such as live music or other family friendly events.\n\"We are we're very cognizant of what's going on in our downtown, which is why we're trying to incentivize it, and it doesn't seem like there's going to be a quick turnaround,\" said John\u00a0Sennema, with the city's land and economic development department.\nHe says one of Red Deer's best features is its location, almost smack dab in the middle between Calgary and Edmonton. It also has less expensive industrial land and the untapped potential of the Red Deer Regional Airport, which is trying to lure logistics companies among others.\u00a0\nIt's not all doom and gloom. DataCan is a Red Deer based company that manufactures monitoring equipment for the oil and gas industry. The company has hired two dozen people since 2018 and now employs 39 people. It recently opened an office in Houston, Texas. A big part of its success is that its customers are all over the world\u00a0\u2014 a strategy that's protected it from the slump in Alberta.\n\"Alberta's not really where the market is right now,\" said James Wright, one of the company's co-founders who started manufacturing the equipment in his basement years ago.\n\"So, we have started a shop in the United States in Texas and it's booming down in Texas. It's booming in various other parts the United States and pretty much the entire world right now. Oil's worth\u00a0enough right now that people are spending money; in Canada they are not,\" said Wright.\nWright says for Red Deer to emerge from this long slump, more people need to believe in the province's oil and gas industry.\n\"Because if they don't, it could get worse here. It's easy to take this money that\u00a0could be spent in Alberta and take it to Texas, North Dakota, Colorado,\" he said.\u00a0\nBack at McLevins, while they've sold most of the land that was going to be used for their new shop, there's one piece left that they just can't unload.\n\"We've had our 9.26 acres for sale for three or four years and not even an offer, not even a low-ball offer,\" she said.\nAs for the future of their business, McLevin says they have no plans to close or layoff more people. It's a decision that's led to some tough choices. She says she and her husband have been working for free for a few years.\n\"We haven't taken a regular paycheque for some years,\" said McLevin.\n\"Since 2014, we have basically gone to Plan B, which is we will stick here and ride it out and see what happens.\"\nBryan Labby is an enterprise reporter with CBC Calgary.

Cyr said as more businesses have opened up, the neighbourhood has become more attractive to people of all ages, from young professionals to families.\nA stronger housing market has also allowed more people to sell their homes and move into rental units, further driving up demand.\nCyr said the east side, central peninsula and Millidgeville can also expect residential growth.\nIt's a big change from just over five years ago when the vacancy rate\u00a0in Saint John was\u00a0at a high of 12 per cent. Now, it's\u00a0down to three\u00a0per cent in 2019.\n\"Anything that's been built in the last 20 years is at less than one\u00a0per cent vacancy,\" Cyr said.\nCyr said the study\u00a0looked at both demographic and psychographic data, which deals with peoples attitudes, interests and values.\n\"Psychographic data is is not just looking at someone's age and and income status, but it's looking at, you know, what percentage of people in the baby boomer market tend to want to live in urban areas and shop local.\"\nDevelopment projects like the Telegraph building on Canterbury Street and\u00a0the East Point Shopping residential revamp are\u00a0already underway, but construction likely won't begin until next year, Cyr said.\nAs demand rises, so do rents, but Cyr said those might take a dip as new units are filled.\n\"What we need to do is we need to accommodate and we need to absorb as much of that demand in new construction so it eases the pressure,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Anis Heydari", "title": "How fast is your cost of living going up?

Major\u00a0parties have introduced ad campaigns touching on the issue, with both the Liberals and Conservatives pushing the message that they can keep everyday life affordable and keep household costs\u00a0from rising.\n A big part of looking at the cost of living is watching the price of stuff \u2014\u00a0or the inflation rate. It's something the Bank of Canada is tasked with: keeping inflation \"low and stable.\"\nBut while we talk about it all the time, do we understand what's actually happening?\nThe term generally refers to how much the price of, well, anything and everything goes up year over year. The higher the inflation rate, the less purchasing power for consumers over time.\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI)\u00a0is how Statistics Canada measures inflation in this country. Over time, the agency compares the prices of a set basket of goods and services.\nThe central bank then tracks how those prices compare from year to year or month to month. The basket includes things as basic as groceries, such as meat and beer, but also include services like internet access and\u00a0travel tours.\nThe Bank of Canada tries to keep inflation at around two per cent, right in the middle of its target inflation range of one to three per cent annually. Why two\u00a0per cent? That's low enough that prices are stable, but high enough to avoid the risk of deflation \u2014\u00a0when prices go down. Deflation may seem attractive \u2014\u00a0we all like low prices \u2014\u00a0but widespread deflation is bad for the economy, in part because it causes wages to go down.\nThe Bank of Canada uses the CPI to determine whether it's been successful at controlling the inflation rate. The central bank's main tool to do this is by setting its target interest rate, which influences what banks charge each other to borrow money amongst themselves. This in turn affects what financial institutions charge you to borrow money from them.\nIt's been fairly successful at keeping inflation steady over the past couple of decades.\nBut as evidenced by our politics \u2014 and by a CBC poll earlier this summer \u2014 people aren't feeling that's the case.\u00a0\nThe cost of eating is something Canadians notice every day. However, different items within the category can balance each other out \u2014\u00a0for example, vegetables versus meat. Vegetable prices went up more than 15 per cent in the past year.\u00a0\n\"It's the era of vegetables since the beginning of 2019,\" said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor of food distribution at Dalhousie University.\n\"However, if you go to the meat counter or if you go to the fish [counter], the rate [of price increases] is not that high,\" explained Charlebois.\nDespite the jump in veggie costs, meat prices only went up 1.85 per cent in the past year.\nEssentially, different items can make you feel like you're spending a lot more at the grocery store \u2014 remember the cauliflower crisis of 2015?\nBut with so many items in your grocery cart, your overall food bill may not be skyrocketing quite as much as you think\u00a0\u2014\u00a0unless you are a celery fan in 2019.\nThe average price of child care across the country has gone up at a higher rate than overall inflation for about the last 10\u00a0years.\u00a0However, different programs and policies in each province mean that increase hasn't been uniform across the country.\n\"In Alberta \u2026 the wage cost of child care has increased faster than the rate of inflation,\" said Pierre Fortin, an economist at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\nThat likely has something to do with wages \u2014\u00a0which are higher in Alberta than elsewhere in the country.\nAs well, in provinces where child-care prices are more regulated, such as Quebec, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island, actual prices for daycare have remained lower than the rest of Canada.\u00a0\nThe price of a brand new vehicle\u00a0has remained steady over the past 20 years.\u00a0\nAnd that in itself means \u2014 despite costing tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 they've actually been getting cheaper year over year when inflation is taken into account.\n\"You can actually find a number of vehicles that have a deflated price today\u00a0versus five years ago, 10\u00a0years ago, 15\u00a0years ago,\" said auto industry analyst Dennis DesRosiers.\nAccording to DesRosiers, that's got a lot to do with innovation and efficiency in the auto sector dating back to Japanese companies entering the North American market as far back as the 1980s.\n\"You have more competition in the market today than ever,\" said DesRosiers, who pointed out there's not a lot of room to increase prices when so many cars are competing for your dollar. \u00a0\n\"There's just under 30 brands competing. We're no longer in a [world of] GM, Ford and Chrysler controlling 90 per cent of the market.\"\nYour clothes are getting cheaper, too.\nFor most of the past 20\u00a0years, the overall price of clothing has either remained steady or been dropping. This can be tied, at least in part, to imports from countries, such as Bangladesh or China, where manufacturing costs are drastically lower.\nAs global trade was liberalized and opened to other countries, the price of clothes dropped. According to Statistics Canada, as late as 1998 the United States was the main supplier of clothes to Canada.\nBut in the following years, that changed.\u00a0For example, clothing imported from Bangladesh tripled between 2002 and 2005, and that pattern has continued.\nAccording to the World Bank, clothing imports from China made up more than 34 per cent of Canadian clothing and textile imports in 2017.\nThe price of tuition in Canada has skyrocketed, relative to the price of inflation, over the past 20\u00a0years.\u00a0\nHowever, much like child care, it is a different situation from province to province and is closely tied to politics.\u00a0\nIn Alberta, tuition remained largely stable,\u00a0relative to inflation, for the last few years. Part of that is because that\u00a0province's former NDP government put in a tuition cap\u00a0tied to the CPI.\nHowever, the national average has been driven up by other provinces, such as Ontario,\u00a0where tuition is thousands of dollars more than Alberta or Manitoba.\nA report from the Royal Bank last year showed\u00a0that university tuition has been going up faster than inflation since the early 1980s. The gap between the rate of inflation and the rate that tuition goes up has only widened since the era of big hair and shoulder pads.\nThat same report indicated that government dollars going toward university has dropped by half since 1990.\nHow did your guesses compare to the real rates of inflation in the interactive game?

That's about $400 million less than they borrowed during the previous quarter. Within that, the value of new mortgage debt increased by $700 million during the period, but that was offset by a reduction of more than $1 billion in other types of debt.\nIt's the growth of that second form of debt that has some observers concerned.\nNon-profit consumer advocacy group the Credit Counselling Society said in a release after the data came out that they \"continue to hear from Canadians\u00a0who are concerned [about]\u00a0how to make ends meet as their debt continues to grow.\"\nThe average debt load of an individual seeking the help of the CCS is\u00a0about $30,000 on top of any mortgage at the moment.\n\"This is alarming, as two decades ago, the average was $12,000 of non-mortgage debt,\" CCS\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Stacy Yanchuk Oleksy said.\u00a0\nBushmeneva said that the uptick in mortgage borrowing could be a sign that borrowers think the slowdown in the housing market may be over and that they are once again more willing to jump in.\n\"That being said, we do not expect the market to go back to its frothy\u00a0days, with gains in prices and home sales remaining relatively modest,\" she said.\nTotal debt loads are still inching\u00a0higher, but the good news is that so are\u00a0income levels.

He didn't want to give CBC\u00a0News his last name.\nBy his count, he's applied for 40 to 50 jobs since he was laid off seven weeks ago.\u00a0\n\"There's nothing out there. There's absolutely nothing out there for my kind of line of work.\"\u00a0\nIn Red Deer, more storefronts, industrial bays and offices are being emptied out as the province's economic slump enters its sixth year. Economic diversification and resuscitating the downtown are some of the priorities in this blue collar town known for its ties to oil and gas and agriculture.\nAt McLevin Industries, the family-run business has been around for almost as long as Red Deer itself. The metal and steel manufacturing shop opened in 1917, when Conservative\u00a0Robert Borden was prime minister.\n\"I like to joke, I know I don't look a day over 90,\" said Linda McLevin, who co-owns the business with her husband, Alan, whose grandfather opened the shop and was one of Red Deer's first blacksmiths.\u00a0\nMcLevin and her husband are the third generation to run the shop. They've seen plenty of ups and downs, including the recession in the early 1980s \u2014\u00a0and their sons' decision in 2014 to step away from the business, possibly threatening the family legacy.\nShe says she is generally a positive person, but she just can't see an end to this current slump.\n\"Our own personal feeling is we don't see light at the end of the tunnel.\"\nSince 2014, she says, revenues at the company have plunged 40 per cent and they've shed 19 jobs\u00a0\u2014 including Linda's two sons, who dabbled for a bit at the shop\u00a0but decided to move on.\n\"They kind of saw the writing on the wall and pursued other interests,\" she said.\nToday, the company has just six employees. Before the recession, the McLevins planned to move to a new facility they were going to build on 44 acres of land they purchased and converted into an industrial park. Those plans have long been scrapped and most of the parcel sold.\nSuch is the state of Red Deer's real estate market. There are vast spaces of industrial parks that have been hollowed out, in many cases prices and lease rates have been cut.\u00a0\nEven though 2019 saw more industrial space occupied than vacated for the first time since 2014, the overall feeling is gloomy.\n\"There's not a lot of factors that play into the optimism that things are going to get better. When you look at the market sentiment out there, what people's perception of the\u00a0economy is, it's overall negative,\" said Brett Salomons of Salomons Commercial realty.\u00a0\nThe company's name is all over town, advertising office, retail and industrial space that is desperate for a new owner or tenant.\u00a0\nThe downtown office vacancy rate is hovering around 15 per cent, while the industrial vacancy rate dipped below 10 per cent for the first time in years. However, Edgar Industrial Park, the city's largest with 3.2-million square feet\u00a0of space, also has a vacancy rate of 15 per cent.\nSalomons says several oil and gas service companies have either closed or moved away to other parts of Alberta, B.C. or the United States.\n\"The overall confidence is at an all-time low,\" he said.\nHe cites the lack of pipeline capacity, climate change\u00a0and what he calls Ottawa's anti-Alberta policies for putting the squeeze on\u00a0the province's main industry.\u00a0\nAfter peaking at $334,000 in August\u00a02017, the median house price in Red Deer last month settled in at $290,000\u00a0\u2014 a 13\u00a0per cent drop.\u00a0\nThe mayor of Red Deer says if the city is serious about an economic revival, it needs to diversify its economy and soon.\u00a0Tara Veer says her community has been making some strides, but it's going to be a marathon, not a sprint.\nShe says Red Deer College's multi-year transition to a university is a significant step forward, along with the community's recent success at attracting major events, including the Canadian Finals Rodeo, the Canada Winter Games and this year's world junior hockey championship, with games in both Red Deer and Edmonton.\n\"But we do continue to struggle,\" said Veer.\n\"We've had significant closures, particularly in our industrial parks, and obviously that has a reverberating effect throughout our local economy and it's deeply concerning,\" she said.\nThe fallout includes growing concerns about social disorder in the downtown related to homelessness and issues connected to a supervised drug consumption site.\n\"It's exacerbated the challenges that we face as a community,\" said Veer.\nThe Red Deer Food Bank says it's now helping as many as 50 people and families every day. Not only are people hungry, but some are stressed out and some have lashed out at staff and volunteers.\u00a0\nIt's prompted a warning,\u00a0taped to the front door, against abusive and belligerent behaviour.\u00a0\n\"Not being able to feed your family has got to be the highest level of stress for anybody,\" said Alice Kolisnyk, deputy director of the food bank.\u00a0\n\"So\u00a0yeah, they're very distressed, and to come into a food bank to ask for help, it\u00a0escalates. We do our very best to reassure them we're here to help them,\" she said.\nAnother agency is putting families on wait lists for some programs, including counselling, which has seen increased demand from families trying to cope with myriad issues tied to the economic downturn.\n\"I think we all know when money's tight \u2026 you get stressed. So when when parents are stressed, they don't manage children's behaviours as well,\" said Judy Scott, the executive director of Family Services of Central Alberta.\u00a0\nWhile pressure builds to help more people, the agency is being asked to reapply for provincial funding for two of its main programs, home visitation and parenting skills. Scott has already been warned to expect less funding. As a result, she's had to notify as many as 20 of her employees that their jobs could be eliminated by the end of March.\n\"The reality is there will be change in services, there will be some of our services that we will no longer have,\" she said.\nWhile she supports some of the proposed funding changes that are, in part, aimed at eliminating the duplication of some services,\u00a0she says now is not the time to cut when more families are seeking help.\n\"Somebody's losing out and unfortunately that's going to be families.\"\u00a0\nCity council recently approved a fund to help kick start residential development in the downtown to lure more people to not only live in the core, but to at least spend an afternoon or evening at different events such as live music or other family friendly events.\n\"We are we're very cognizant of what's going on in our downtown, which is why we're trying to incentivize it, and it doesn't seem like there's going to be a quick turnaround,\" said John\u00a0Sennema, with the city's land and economic development department.\nHe says one of Red Deer's best features is its location, almost smack dab in the middle between Calgary and Edmonton. It also has less expensive industrial land and the untapped potential of the Red Deer Regional Airport, which is trying to lure logistics companies among others.\u00a0\nIt's not all doom and gloom. DataCan is a Red Deer based company that manufactures monitoring equipment for the oil and gas industry. The company has hired two dozen people since 2018 and now employs 39 people. It recently opened an office in Houston, Texas. A big part of its success is that its customers are all over the world\u00a0\u2014 a strategy that's protected it from the slump in Alberta.\n\"Alberta's not really where the market is right now,\" said James Wright, one of the company's co-founders who started manufacturing the equipment in his basement years ago.\n\"So, we have started a shop in the United States in Texas and it's booming down in Texas. It's booming in various other parts the United States and pretty much the entire world right now. Oil's worth\u00a0enough right now that people are spending money; in Canada they are not,\" said Wright.\nWright says for Red Deer to emerge from this long slump, more people need to believe in the province's oil and gas industry.\n\"Because if they don't, it could get worse here. It's easy to take this money that\u00a0could be spent in Alberta and take it to Texas, North Dakota, Colorado,\" he said.\u00a0\nBack at McLevins, while they've sold most of the land that was going to be used for their new shop, there's one piece left that they just can't unload.\n\"We've had our 9.26 acres for sale for three or four years and not even an offer, not even a low-ball offer,\" she said.\nAs for the future of their business, McLevin says they have no plans to close or layoff more people. It's a decision that's led to some tough choices. She says she and her husband have been working for free for a few years.\n\"We haven't taken a regular paycheque for some years,\" said McLevin.\n\"Since 2014, we have basically gone to Plan B, which is we will stick here and ride it out and see what happens.\"\nBryan Labby is an enterprise reporter with CBC Calgary.

They were bought in part with the proceeds from his first novel, Lazaro.\nIn September, he\u00a0sold one of the houses\u00a0on the condition that the buyer continue to pursue heritage designation for the property.\nThe 15 newly designated homes, including Kendall's four, were built between 1885 and 1886.\n\"If you've survived 100\u00a0years, it's because you're something beautiful,\" Kendall told CBC Toronto recently. \"You've become rooted in the soil.\"\nAs for his ultra low rent, Kendall said he's grateful to past tenants\u00a0who helped him and his wife pay off the mortgages, and he wants to pay it forward.\nEach of his four houses is divided into two one-bedroom apartments. The upper units\u00a0rent for $800 per\u00a0month, the lower units for\u00a0$900.\nKendall bought the homes over a five-year period beginning in 1983. Since then, monthly rates for a unit\u00a0have only increased by $100, far less than increases in comparable accommodations in the west end. He says he recently heard of a similar house nearby renting for $4,800 a month.\n\"The years have gone by and I've been lucky,\" he said.\n\"Grecia and I believe in what [former U.S. president Barack] Obama called tethered capitalism \u2014 you have to make enough to live, and make something, but you don't have to go for maximum; don't go for the jugular.\"\nAnd his tenants seem to appreciate it.\nKendall recalled one long-time tenant who moved out about six years ago. She'd saved enough by then to\u00a0afford a house of her own, and now \u2014\u00a0she told Kendall in a recent email \u2014\u00a0she and her new husband are renting out the basement of their home at a very low rate.\n\"I thought to myself, 'That's the loveliest email I've ever received,'\" he said. \"I wept.\"\n\u00a0A current tenant, Robby Vrenozi, says she is also grateful.\n\"It's very kind, so kind,\" she said. \"It's fantastic to be able to live in the heart of downtown Toronto.\"\nFriends in similar apartments are paying up to three times more in rent, said Vrenozi, who's been in her apartment for\u00a0three years and has no intention of leaving any time soon.\nCouncillors at the community council meeting recommended that the properties be designated city heritage homes, a recommendation that was approved by council at its Dec. 17 meeting.\nBut Kendall said he is not done yet.\n\"What I'm really hoping is that they'll designate the whole street, make it into a heritage street,\" he said.\nKendall no longer lives in downtown Toronto. He and Grecia settled in rural southern Ontario, and he's keenly aware of the need to maintain the green belt. That means\u00a0the city needs to grow upward, rather than out.\n\"I'm happy they're building towers in downtown Toronto,\" he said recently.\n\"On the other hand, I want those people who are living in those towers [to]\u00a0look out of 10,000 windows, and their gazes will slide down these long lines of glass and metal and concrete, and all of a sudden they'll stop.

That's over a 10 per cent decline,\" said Carbacho-Burgos, adding that\u00a0has led prices in St. John's to be \"below trend.\"\nWhen asked if that decline over recent years\u00a0is simply a correction for a previously hot housing market,\u00a0Carbacho-Burgos said, \"probably not.\"\n\"The unemployment rate and the labour market in St. John's have improved significantly in recent months, and we expect it to remain that way for at least a couple of years,\" he said.\nThat's the second reason for the predicted rise in prices.\u00a0\nCarbacho-Burgos said the unemployment rate in the province's capital city averaged around nine\u00a0per cent from mid-2016 to late 2018, whereas it's now below eight per cent and expected to lower.\u00a0\n\"The fact that the unemployment rate was at a cyclical high in 2016 to 2018 makes me wonder whether or not there was truly a hot housing market in St. John's as opposed to, possibly, the housing stock being displaced by new homes.\"\nCarbacho-Burgos\u00a0told CBC Radio's\u00a0On The Go\u00a0that Moody's expects a reduction in new home construction to eventually affect those prices as well.\n\"When house prices are below what we calculate as trend, you get a couple of correction mechanisms,\" he said \u2014 mainly a slow in construction, which tightens the supply of houses.\nAt 12 to 14 months of sales, MLS listings indicate\u00a0the ratio of inventory to sales in St. John's is much higher than the Canadian average, he said.\n\"It's the reason why house prices in St. John's are way below trend.\"\u00a0\nAlong with\u00a0fewer new homes being built, he said homeowners tend to keep houses off the market when prices are low. That\u00a0should mean overall fewer homes for sale, tightening supply and helping prices go up.\u00a0\nBut what about the falling\u00a0prices of oil and gas\u00a0in all of this?\n\"We believe the effect will be limited, in part because Newfoundland and Labrador in general has already had a significant degree of outmigration over the past three to four years, so it's hard to see this getting worse until energy prices really, really fall below our forecast,\" said\u00a0Carbacho-Burgos.\nHe said we would need to hit the unlikely \"low oil price scenario,\" in which world oil prices are below $40 US a barrel, compared with a forecase of\u00a0over $50 US,\u00a0for outmigration from this province \"to really accelerate.\"\u00a0\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Tony Davis", "title": "Short-term rental owners speak out over proposed Charlottetown bylaw", "description": "'If all of my units were returned to the long-term market \u2014 none of them are affordable'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-short-term-rental-owners-group-dec-2019-1.5383051", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5383064.1585347517!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/terrie-williams.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 03, 2019 7:18 PM AT", "2019-12-03T23:18:54.591Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A group representing short-term rental owners in Charlottetown is speaking out, saying its members are\u00a0not to blame for the current housing crisis in Charlottetown.\nTerrie Williams is a spokesperson for the newly-formed Short-Term Rental Association, which has about 90 members. She said she\u00a0started renting out units a few years ago and now has seven properties on listed on Airbnb.\nWilliams said the group wants the City of Charlottetown to consider the views of short-term rental owners before creating a bylaw to regulate them.\n\"We want them to hear our side of the story, to understand what we have done as far as rejuvenating all these old homes in downtown Charlottetown.

Private homes, apartments \u2014\u00a0that is what the user and traveller wants today. So, I think by limiting [to] owner-occupied, it basically will destroy the short-term rental market in Charlottetown, no question,\" she said.\nWilliams said the group's members are not against regulation \u2014 in fact they want short-term rentals to be licensed and pay the tourism levy as well as commercial taxes, as\u00a0bed and breakfasts and hotels do.\nWilliams said the group is also open to capping the number of short-term units\u00a0in Charlottetown.\nThe vacancy rate in Charlottetown sits at 0.2 per cent, according to the latest assessment by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nA representative from the P.E.I.

The units are renovated and furnished and Williams said they have \"high-end finishings.\"\n\"They are not going to be a $700 or $800 apartment a month. So they're not going to impact affordable housing at all. That unfortunately is a reality, all that's going to do is put them on the market.

The higher the inflation rate, the less purchasing power for consumers over time.\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI)\u00a0is how Statistics Canada measures inflation in this country. Over time, the agency compares the prices of a set basket of goods and services.\nThe central bank then tracks how those prices compare from year to year or month to month. The basket includes things as basic as groceries, such as meat and beer, but also include services like internet access and\u00a0travel tours.\nThe Bank of Canada tries to keep inflation at around two per cent, right in the middle of its target inflation range of one to three per cent annually. Why two\u00a0per cent? That's low enough that prices are stable, but high enough to avoid the risk of deflation \u2014\u00a0when prices go down. Deflation may seem attractive \u2014\u00a0we all like low prices \u2014\u00a0but widespread deflation is bad for the economy, in part because it causes wages to go down.\nThe Bank of Canada uses the CPI to determine whether it's been successful at controlling the inflation rate. The central bank's main tool to do this is by setting its target interest rate, which influences what banks charge each other to borrow money amongst themselves. This in turn affects what financial institutions charge you to borrow money from them.\nIt's been fairly successful at keeping inflation steady over the past couple of decades.\nBut as evidenced by our politics \u2014 and by a CBC poll earlier this summer \u2014 people aren't feeling that's the case.\u00a0\nThe cost of eating is something Canadians notice every day. However, different items within the category can balance each other out \u2014\u00a0for example, vegetables versus meat. Vegetable prices went up more than 15 per cent in the past year.\u00a0\n\"It's the era of vegetables since the beginning of 2019,\" said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor of food distribution at Dalhousie University.\n\"However, if you go to the meat counter or if you go to the fish [counter], the rate [of price increases] is not that high,\" explained Charlebois.\nDespite the jump in veggie costs, meat prices only went up 1.85 per cent in the past year.\nEssentially, different items can make you feel like you're spending a lot more at the grocery store \u2014 remember the cauliflower crisis of 2015?\nBut with so many items in your grocery cart, your overall food bill may not be skyrocketing quite as much as you think\u00a0\u2014\u00a0unless you are a celery fan in 2019.\nThe average price of child care across the country has gone up at a higher rate than overall inflation for about the last 10\u00a0years.\u00a0However, different programs and policies in each province mean that increase hasn't been uniform across the country.\n\"In Alberta \u2026 the wage cost of child care has increased faster than the rate of inflation,\" said Pierre Fortin, an economist at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\nThat likely has something to do with wages \u2014\u00a0which are higher in Alberta than elsewhere in the country.\nAs well, in provinces where child-care prices are more regulated, such as Quebec, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island, actual prices for daycare have remained lower than the rest of Canada.\u00a0\nThe price of a brand new vehicle\u00a0has remained steady over the past 20 years.\u00a0\nAnd that in itself means \u2014 despite costing tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 they've actually been getting cheaper year over year when inflation is taken into account.\n\"You can actually find a number of vehicles that have a deflated price today\u00a0versus five years ago, 10\u00a0years ago, 15\u00a0years ago,\" said auto industry analyst Dennis DesRosiers.\nAccording to DesRosiers, that's got a lot to do with innovation and efficiency in the auto sector dating back to Japanese companies entering the North American market as far back as the 1980s.\n\"You have more competition in the market today than ever,\" said DesRosiers, who pointed out there's not a lot of room to increase prices when so many cars are competing for your dollar. \u00a0\n\"There's just under 30 brands competing. We're no longer in a [world of] GM, Ford and Chrysler controlling 90 per cent of the market.\"\nYour clothes are getting cheaper, too.\nFor most of the past 20\u00a0years, the overall price of clothing has either remained steady or been dropping. This can be tied, at least in part, to imports from countries, such as Bangladesh or China, where manufacturing costs are drastically lower.\nAs global trade was liberalized and opened to other countries, the price of clothes dropped. According to Statistics Canada, as late as 1998 the United States was the main supplier of clothes to Canada.\nBut in the following years, that changed.\u00a0For example, clothing imported from Bangladesh tripled between 2002 and 2005, and that pattern has continued.\nAccording to the World Bank, clothing imports from China made up more than 34 per cent of Canadian clothing and textile imports in 2017.\nThe price of tuition in Canada has skyrocketed, relative to the price of inflation, over the past 20\u00a0years.\u00a0\nHowever, much like child care, it is a different situation from province to province and is closely tied to politics.\u00a0\nIn Alberta, tuition remained largely stable,\u00a0relative to inflation, for the last few years. Part of that is because that\u00a0province's former NDP government put in a tuition cap\u00a0tied to the CPI.\nHowever, the national average has been driven up by other provinces, such as Ontario,\u00a0where tuition is thousands of dollars more than Alberta or Manitoba.\nA report from the Royal Bank last year showed\u00a0that university tuition has been going up faster than inflation since the early 1980s. The gap between the rate of inflation and the rate that tuition goes up has only widened since the era of big hair and shoulder pads.\nThat same report indicated that government dollars going toward university has dropped by half since 1990.\nHow did your guesses compare to the real rates of inflation in the interactive game?

Is that true?\nYeah, we've had the collywobbles a bit because we've been anxious.\u00a0\nThis process since the referendum ... not knowing one way or the other whether we would have a second referendum, whether the last parliament that we had would somehow reverse Brexit, we didn't know what was coming next.\u00a0\nNow we've got some results.\nBut there's still uncertainty because the terms of Brexit are yet to be negotiated. So the best case scenario for you, if Brexit happens, how much could that help your business?\nIf Brexit happens, say, in the next year, it would increase the amount of customs declarations we would expect to do by at least 500 per cent.\u00a0\nThe problem is that any business would find it very, very difficult to upscale to that degree in such a short period of time.\nYou have to train a workforce. You have to find people who could be experts in arcane regulations that have yet to be negotiated, let alone written. And you'd have to do that on a tight timeline. How do you feel about that?\nThat's going to be an extremely difficult thing to deal with. In a perfect world, three and a half years ago, when we knew that we were leaving the EU, we should have been employing people then.\u00a0\nBut if we had have done so, they'd have been sat there for three and a half years waiting for something to do after we trained them.\u00a0\nEven now, we don't know when the borders are actually going to go up and when these documents are going to need to be done, because the date that we're given, January 2021 ... we have this transitional negotiation period [beforehand].\u00a0\nA year isn't very much to start this process of employing the people, taking leases on premises that we would need, training them, putting all the IT things together. That's a big challenge.\n[It] must have been an enormous moment for you back in 1993 when the EU was created and the customs union was formed.\u00a0\nI would guess if your business is about to potentially grow by 500 percent, it must have collapsed by an equal amount back then.\u00a0\nWhat happened to you in 1993? How did you survive that?\nIt collapsed completely because I'd chosen to specialize in the business of customs clearing goods, and documentation for goods that was moving to and from the EU.\u00a0\nAnd in the '80s we were beginning to get computers and fax machines and began to use the new technology to put together quite a sophisticated system to handle these large amounts of documentation.\u00a0\nWe worked with the courts and with the government to put this whole system together and invested heavily. And then all of a sudden we weren't needed anymore.\u00a0\nI was left with the business development loans, and the money that I'd invested was lost. At that particular time, we had a recession, a property crash and interest rates ... at 14 per cent. So it was a pretty dreadful time.\u00a0\nAs a young man with a family of four children and a mortgage and everything else, it was a very, very worrying time. We survived because we went into other areas of [the] shipping business, transport and warehousing, etc.\nAnd now your business may boom again. The election is over. The country is where it is in terms of leaving the EU.\u00a0\nBut just looking at your family ... is there a part of you that wishes Britain would remain when you extend your family's future, when you look at what they're going to face in the next decades?\nYes, a part of me does. There was a very, very difficult decision to make which way to vote in the referendum.\u00a0\nTwo of my children work now in the business, and I feel sure \u2014 although we never discuss it \u2014 I feel sure that they would have voted remain because they've got children. For the sake of my grandchildren, I guess I would have done [the same].\u00a0\nBut even then, on the other hand, I have a responsibility for the many people who work within my company, who will be given in, another way, an opportunity and a business opportunity going forward to further their careers as suddenly we have all this extra work coming our way.\nThis Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.

So there is a lot of products available for detached in new as well as in resale,\" Lurie said.\n\"Because of that, that adds that additional pressure on the new home side and is likely causing them to start reducing some of their starts activity.\"\nLurie says there has been an increase in the sales of detached homes in the under $500,000 segment and of apartments, semi-detached homes and half-duplexes.\n\"It's because they are, by far, the most affordable,\" said Lurie.\n\"For many people who, you know, are interested in a specific community, maybe they can't get into a detached home, but attached, that provides an option for them.\"\nDespite it being a slow year, Sparrow says detached homes still make up the majority of sales on the MLS in Calgary, just at lower prices.\n\"Buyers are really hard to find these days for homes in pretty much any price range,\" said Sparrow.\n\"If you're selling your house, you have to take a deep, deep breath and you have to lower your price to probably well below what you thought your house was worth. And even then, you're in for a challenging time.\"\nIt's not all downward trends.\u00a0Recently, sales of detached homes have incrementally increased in the past few months, but not in a significant way, says Sparrow.\n\"That's insignificant in terms of the number of properties sold. It's a really slow market and it's impacting everybody that's involved,\" he said.\nSparrow points to the struggling oil and gas industry in the province as a reason for the\u00a0downward shifts in the housing market in Calgary.\n\"There's a lot of people that aren't impacted by the price of oil. But ultimately, I think they will be because Calgary\u00a0still runs on oil and gas,\" he said.\n\"When you take this many people out of the industry \u2026 they have no choice but to leave the province if they want to make a living.\n\"It starts to take something away from the city.\"\nLurie says that Calgary's population growth is fairly average but that newcomers to Calgary aren't necessarily heading straight into property ownership.\n\"Most of that migration growth into the city has been more in terms of international migrants. So they're not necessarily owners immediately,\" she said.\nShe says that lending rates and competing products on the housing market play their part in the decline.\n\"There's the detached product, but there's also available supply options for attached products \u2026 which gives an alternative for people who are looking for more affordable product to the market,\" said Lurie.\n\"I don't think we're going to have any dramatic change in demand next year unless there's a shift in economic conditions.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Global uncertainty prompts rethink of B.C. budget projections", "description": "Finance Minister Carole James delivered the 2019 first-quarter financial results Monday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/global-uncertainty-prompts-rethink-bc-budget-projections-1.5278180", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5278197.1568153155!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/carole-james-first-quarter-budget-2019.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 10, 2019 3:08 PM PT", "2019-09-10T22:08:46.797Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "British Columbia's finance minister is downgrading economic projections with a forecast of lower growth and a reduced budget surplus.\nCarole James presented the revised financial forecast in her first quarterly budget update in Victoria, B.C., Monday.

And there is a sense that a fundamental restructuring of financial relationships between levels of government may be required when the pandemic is over.\n\"These are unprecedented times,\" said Marc-Andre Pigeon, an assistant professor in the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy at the University of Saskatchewan.\nPigeon is co-author \u2014 with colleagues Murray Fulton and Michael Atkinson \u2014 of a policy brief calling on Ottawa to \"put the Bank of Canada to work\" to help out.\n\"The provinces are in big trouble,\" their paper begins.\nThey float a few options:\u00a0loans to the provinces, transferring funds to them at no net cost as part of a kind of COVID-19 grant, or issuing an explicit blanket guarantee for all provincial debt to drive yields down to federal levels.\nIn an interview with CBC News, Pigeon said he understands there is a policy reluctance to go there because it could provide incentives to the provinces to take more risks with their finances.\n\"It's kind of a moral hazard idea, that if you're backstopping the provinces, they might let go of their spending strings and kind of go a little crazy and we don't want that,\" Pigeon said.\n\"But at the same time, I think this is one of those cases where there's a reasonable argument to be made that we need to give them the power they need to address this crisis.\"\nThe problem is more acute for resource-dependent provinces.\n\"There are higher costs that the provinces are going to have to pay out of this, and for a province like Newfoundland and Labrador, those higher costs are not nothing,\" Pigeon said.\n\"They are something significant, because the province was already challenged going into this. So I think what you want to avoid is making that problem worse after this is over. And I think that's where something more like a stronger commitment from the federal government via the Bank of Canada could be useful.\"\nOn March 25, the Bank of Canada launched a program to help shore up short-term provincial borrowing.\nAs of Wednesday, the Bank of Canada had provided nearly $2 billion worth of support to provinces\u00a0by backstopping short-term provincial debt.\nBut experts say the bank may need to look at longer-term and broader help.\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued this week, the C.D. Howe Institute said it believes the Bank of Canada likely will\u00a0need to purchase longer-term provincial debt over the long haul.\nThe Toronto-based think-tank has assembled a crisis working group to look\u00a0at monetary and financial measures\u00a0which is co-chaired by David Dodge, a former governor of the Bank of Canada.\nThe group noted that provinces \u2014 especially resource-based ones \u2014 are in worse shape now than they were going into the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe scale of the fiscal challenges for provincial balance sheets was made clear when Alberta Premier Jason Kenney told his province to brace for 25 per cent unemployment and a tripling of the provincial deficit.\n\"We will face a great fiscal reckoning in the future,\" Kenney said in a televised speech on Tuesday.\nKenney\u00a0already had been leading the premiers in a unanimous call to reform the Fiscal Stabilization Program to help resource-dependent provinces that don't receive benefits from equalization deals.\nBut even at the high end,\u00a0the stabilization program reforms were expected only\u00a0to deliver a few billion dollars to needy provinces. That level of support is dwarfed by the flattening of their revenues due to the combination of COVID-19 and the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.\nAll provinces are piling up debt to deal with the pandemic, but the uncertain pace of economic and financial recovery in the oil-producing provinces is particularly worrisome.\nLast month, Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister floated the idea of the federal government creating an emergency credit agency to aid struggling provinces. Earlier this week, Pallister renewed that call, saying in a letter to the prime minister that\u00a0the concept has since been supported by all premiers.\nIn an op-ed published in the Financial Post on Thursday, Queen's University assistant professor Kyle Hanniman said it's an idea worth considering.\nBut he said a quicker and less controversial solution is available: the federal government could follow the lead of the Reserve Bank of Australia and the European Central Bank by expanding\u00a0a\u00a0quantitative easing program to buy\u00a0up subnational, or provincial, bonds.\n\"The central issue is that we need to find ways to ensure provinces can borrow long-term debt at low rates and with few disruptions,\" Hanniman told\u00a0CBC News.\nHe said quantitative easing is one way to do this, though it's\u00a0not necessarily the only one.\nThe Bank of Canada could jump in to buy longer-term provincial bonds, helping to smooth the choppy waters in volatile borrowing markets.\nHanniman said provinces play an important role in keeping credit and cash circulating.\n\"So if one of them goes down, and if they don't have the cash they need, then that's going to compromise our ability to fight the crisis, to get this out of the way, to get people healthy and get the economy back up and running again,\" he said.\n\"So I would argue that the stakes are very high.\"\nIn an emailed statement to CBC News earlier this month, the federal Department of Finance acknowledged the \"serious economic impacts on provincial economic growth, especially in provinces where the resource sector is an important part of the economy, such as Newfoundland and Labrador.\"\nThe department stressed that it is working with its partners, including the Bank of Canada, to support the economy, and pointed to a recently launched program helping provinces out with short-term borrowing.\n\"We are going to continue to use every tool necessary to make sure Canada's economy remains resilient in the face of extraordinary circumstances and will continue to work with provinces and territories to support them through this important, but temporary, crisis,\" finance spokesman Pierre-Olivier Herbert said.\nOn Thursday, the prime minister spoke with Newfoundland and Labrador's premier.\nAmong the topics of discussion: the province's fiscal and economic status, and actions taken to date by the federal government and the Bank of Canada to support Canadian financial markets.\u00a0\nIn a statement, the Prime Minister's Office said the federal government \"is working around the clock on the situation and will continue to support provinces and territories to ensure that all governments can respond to the COVID-19 crisis.\"\n"}, {"author": "John Lancaster", "title": "Toronto police union calls allegations it mishandled millions of dollars 'misinformation'", "description": "TPA sold its HQ for $7.4M.

They say some officers are even calling for a forensic audit of the union's finances.\n\"Over the past few days your Board of Directors has been fielding phone calls and inquiries regarding misinformation being communicated amongst the general membership,\" the message to TPA members reads.\n\"In particular the Board has been contacted about the financial state of the Toronto Police Association including the sale of the old building. There is no truth to this misinformation.\"\nHere's a short timeline of the sale and the fallout:\nCBC News has learned some TPA members, including union stewards, have been raising concerns\u00a0regarding the sale of the union's headquarters. Some, who spoke with CBC Toronto, say they've only recently been learning about key details of the sale.\u00a0\n\"They're even talking about it at parades,\" one officer told CBC News. Parades are\u00a0the meetings officers hold with their superiors before heading out\u00a0on patrol.\nThe headquarters\u00a0\u2014\u00a0located at 130 and 180 Yorkland Blvd, in the Highway 401 and Highway 404 area \u2014\u00a0had been owned by the association\u00a0since 1968.\u00a0\nThe properties were a popular meeting spot for police employees. Inside, there was a bar, a restaurant and banquet facility. They also housed offices for the TPA's leadership and support staff.\nProvincial land registry records reviewed by CBC News show the properties were sold on June 30, 2014 for $7.4 million.\u00a0The buyer was a Toronto developer.\u00a0\nThe records also show the TPA provided the developer a $4.8 million\u00a0mortgage with an interest rate of\u00a04.5 per cent.\nThe developer agreed to make monthly payments to the TPA of about $18,000.\nBut by early August 2015, the developer flipped the property \u2014 selling it to a\u00a0charity based in British Columbia for $11.5 million.\u00a0\nIt was a $4.1 million\u00a0\u2014 or 55 per cent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0profit in 13 months.\nCBC News reviewed City of Toronto building records. They suggest the developer made no significant improvements to the property and did not apply for any permits to repair or restore it before selling to the charity.\u00a0\nThe charity now uses it as a wellness and meditation centre.\nSince the initial sale, the TPA has been renting office space on the second floor of a building on Kennedy Road\u00a0in Scarborough.\n\"The sale of the real estate was fully transparent. While no one can predict what direction the real estate market will go the decision to sell the building has saved the membership millions of dollars in cost savings,\"\u00a0TPA president Mike McCormack wrote in an emailed response to questions from CBC News.\nMcCormack also called the TPA decision to offer the developer the $4.8-million\u00a0mortgage\u00a0a good one.\n\"This mortgage was fully secured by the property and posed no risk to the membership. In fact, this investment provided a strong rate of return to the membership. Again, this information was disclosed to the membership and provided in the audited financial statements,\" he added.\nThe sale closed in 2014, but some police officers\u00a0now\u00a0tell CBC News\u00a0they weren't aware of specific details surrounding the transaction\u00a0until recently, when some union stewards at local police divisions\u00a0began circulating information about it.\nThey claim they didn't know the property was sold for $4.1 million\u00a0more than the TPA received, and that the TPA helped finance the sale.\nIt appears some of that information was only contained in provincial land registry records.\nMcCormack says the TPA has been open with its members and suggests calls for a forensic audit are unnecessary.\n\"We have contacted our members and re-sent the information on the sale of the building to our membership as it was included in the audited financial statements from 2014 and 2015,\" he said in his email to CBC News.\u00a0\nThose statements suggest\u00a0operating the headquarters drained more than $230,000 from the TPA's budget in 2014.\nBy the end of 2015, the sale had boosted revenues by more than $6 million,\"\u00a0the statements suggest.\nAs the internal finger pointing within the police service continues, the TPA says it will respond to any concerns from its members at a board meeting later this month.\nAccording to information provided by McCormack\u00a0and other documentation obtained by CBC News, the idea to sell the headquarters first came up in 2011.\nBy 2012, the TPA board had hired a \"property consultant to provide expert advice and analysis on options available to the TPA,\" according to McCormack.\nIn 2013, the union decided to forge ahead with\u00a0the sale.\nCBC News obtained the minutes of a TPA board meeting held in May of that year where McCormack raised the issue.\nHe cited upgrades the properties required that the union could seemingly not afford.\n\"It was estimated that approximately five\u00a0million dollars would be required to bring the properties up to proper standards,\" McCormack said at the meeting.\n\"After all options were evaluated and a comprehensive due diligence process was followed, it was determined that selling both 180 and 130 Yorkland properties and leasing was the best option for financial sustainability and maintaining core functions.\"\nMcCormack also stated the proceeds of the sale would make it possible to temporarily reduce union dues by about 13 per cent.\nThe sale didn't appear to raise many concerns at the meeting, according to the minutes.\nOnly one officer present questioned the TPA board about it, suggesting the entire membership should be allowed to vote on the sale.\n\"Mike stated that this process was not taken lightly, and that it was a team of experts in the business community that assisted in determining the best option to maintain the sustainability of the organization and its services to the membership,\" the officer was told at the meeting.\nA month later, the TPA board sent out a four-page document essentially saying it had determined operating their headquarters was expensive and the properties would be sold.\n"}, {"author": "Shaina Luck", "title": "International buyers eye N.S. vacation properties \u2014 especially in Cape Breton", "description": "Recent numbers from Statistics Canada show N.S. has higher rate of non-resident owners than B.C., Ontario", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/foreign-property-statistics-canada-cape-breton-properties-1.5213540", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5214039.1563308104!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vacation-home.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 23, 2019 6:00 AM AT", "2019-07-23T09:00:00.071Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Nova Scotia has a higher rate of non-resident property ownership than British Columbia and Ontario \u2014 but unlike those provinces, most buyers aren't\u00a0looking for a shiny new condo in the city.\nBoth B.C. and Ontario have imposed a tax on \"foreign buyers\"\u00a0who purchase property in recent years, in an effort to cool housing markets and to avoid property speculation that some argue is pricing local residents out of affordable housing.\nJean-Philippe Deschamps-Laporte, the chief of the\u00a0Canadian Housing Statistics Program with\u00a0Statistics Canada, said that \"intense discussion\" prompted the federal agency\u00a0to gather and compare\u00a0the numbers.\nThe 2018 data shows non-residents own about 3.9 per cent of the 450,000 residential properties in Nova Scotia. That's slightly higher than the percentage of non-resident owners in Ontario (2.2 per cent) and British Columbia (3.8 per cent).\n\"The story [in Nova Scotia] is slightly different than what we have seen in Toronto and Vancouver, for instance, in the sense that we find municipalities that are easily accessible by ferries, locations that tend to be more recreational, have higher non-resident owner rates,\" he said.\nOntario and British Columbia both have far more total residential properties than Nova Scotia, with 4.8 million and 1.7 million, respectively.\nDeschamps-Laporte\u00a0noted Nova Scotia has proportionally more recreational properties than the other two provinces, and many non-resident owners seek out\u00a0vacation homes.\nStatistics Canada studied\u00a0housing information about non-resident owners, which means their primary home is outside Canada.\nThe area with most non-resident ownership in Nova Scotia is Cape Breton, and specifically the eastern side of Richmond County, where 14.3 per cent of the residential properties are owned by non-residents.\nThe non-resident owners mostly own single-detached homes and vacant land.\u00a0\nThe trend is something\u00a0former county warden Richie Cotton first noticed in the 1990s. At the time, it sparked a lot of discussion and research.\n\"It wasn't so much that people were against people from outside coming in, it was people or corporations or companies that were buying up the land and then not doing anything with it,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"That was a big controversy because people around here felt that the land, somebody else could use it and develop it and start a family or whatever.\"\nCotton said over the years that did happen to some properties, but not to all. In eastern Richmond County today, non-residents own about 22.7 per cent of vacant properties, while Canadian residents\u00a0own the rest.\n\"I don't think that's actually happened to a degree that caused the major concern,\" he said. \"Most people that are buying the land are actually moving here, and of course there's nothing wrong with that. That was welcome.\"\nCotton said most of the non-resident owners he meets are from Germany, the United States, Austria, and people from land-locked European countries looking to buy property near the ocean.\nHe said he sees a mixture of uses, from people who live at their properties in the summer to those who live there year-round.\nThe top areas of Nova Scotia attracting non-resident property owners include:\nOther popular areas with non-resident owners include the areas around Digby and Annapolis, and along the South Shore.\nThe Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation is working with Statistics Canada to analyze the data. Senior analyst Kelvin Ndoro said it was slightly surprising that Nova Scotia's rate of non-resident ownership was above British Columbia and Ontario.\u00a0\n\"Because, for the most part, it's always been B.C. that's in the news when it comes to non-resident ownership,\" he said.\u00a0\nHis team found non-resident owners in the other two provinces liked\u00a0properties in cities like Toronto and Vancouver, and particularly condos.\u00a0\n\"In Nova Scotia, it was the reverse,\" he said.\nThe rate of non-resident ownership was much higher outside Halifax than in the city.\u00a0\n\"I think that's one thing that we are trying to better understand when it comes to non-resident ownership, is to why non-residents would invest in the housing market in different places and the reason that they do,\" he said.\n\"I think it comes down to different issues: whether they are investing in it as an asset, a future asset for income purposes, or just for retirement.\"\nNdoro also pointed out that the term \"non-resident\" does not necessarily mean a non-Canadian citizen or an immigrant. It simply means the person does not list their primary dwelling within Canada.\u00a0\n\"We need to better understand between the two differences,\" he said. \"In cases like Nova Scotia, for example, it could just be a case of ex-pats who are planning to retire back home and are buying land.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "North Bay real estate investors share how to finalize the deal", "description": "Dave and Melanie Dupuis share tips on navigating the real estate investment world", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/real-estate-purchasing-tips-1.5224011", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5226147.1564150040!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/melanie-and-dave-dupuis.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jul 27, 2019 7:00 AM ET", "2019-07-27T11:00:00.481Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A North Bay couple, who are real estate investors, says if you plan carefully, you can successfully purchase income properties as a source of revenue.\nDave and Melanie Dupuis recently published a book called Real Estate Investing Secrets: A No-B.S.

The idea to write and publish a book on the topic came to them after they both survived a serious motor vehicle crash.\nWhen it comes to buying or purchasing real estate, Melanie says it's important for you to know what you want out of the deal.\n\"Most people think is it all comes down to money, but we've found out throughout the years that that's not always the case,\" she said.\n\"Sometimes, they don't really care as much about the listing price, but they really care which date they're going to close for capital gain purposes.\"\nShe says it's important to get to know the potential seller to figure out what's important to them, including when the deal should close and if requests will be made, such as allowing current tenants to stay for a specific amount of time.\nOnce those details are sorted, Melanie says the price is important to focus on. But she cautions getting stuck on a particular dollar amount. She recalls a time in the past when she and Dave couldn't close a deal over a $15,000 price gap between them and the seller.\n\"Looking back now, I wish we would have purchased it because that $15,000 is peanuts on a mortgage,\" she said.\n\"We would have remade that money within six to eight months and would have been cash-flowing over the last four or five years on it.

So low-balling is not always the best strategy.\"\nDave says at the end of the day, everybody has to be happy with the deal.\n\"If it's not going to be a win-win, we don't want to be a part of the negotiations,\" he said.\n\"If someone has to lose for you to win, we've walked away from those.\"\nOf course, with a real estate investment, the finances will be have to be finalized. Melanie says it's important to know the difference between good debt and bad debt.\nShe says bad debt is a purchase that doesn't make you money, such as a car, clothing or electronics. Good debt, she says, is a purchase that generates money, such as a rental property.\nAt the end of the day, she says people purchasing rental properties should not only make enough to pay the mortgage, but extra money for maintenance, taxes and to pay yourself.\nDave says to ensure you will have money left over, it comes down to income verses expenses.\n\"If the rent coming in is higher than the water, taxes, heat, hydro, mortgage, insurance, then you know you're in a cash-flow positive state,\" he said.\n\"If the in is greater than the out, then hey, you're in the green.\"\nMelanie says once that is figured out, the next step is to ensure you have tenants to help pay the bills. She says they promoted their apartments heavily on social media.\n\"We have zero per cent vacancy rate,\" she said. \"We can't keep up. We can't fill the need.\"\nDave says it didn't get to that point right away.

Guide to Creating Wealth and Freedom. The idea to write and publish a book on the topic came to them after they both survived a serious motor vehicle crash.\nWhen it comes to buying or purchasing real estate, Melanie says it's important for you to know what you want out of the deal.\n\"Most people think is it all comes down to money, but we've found out throughout the years that that's not always the case,\" she said.\n\"Sometimes, they don't really care as much about the listing price, but they really care which date they're going to close for capital gain purposes.\"\nShe says it's important to get to know the potential seller to figure out what's important to them, including when the deal should close and if requests will be made, such as allowing current tenants to stay for a specific amount of time.\nOnce those details are sorted, Melanie says the price is important to focus on. But she cautions getting stuck on a particular dollar amount. She recalls a time in the past when she and Dave couldn't close a deal over a $15,000 price gap between them and the seller.\n\"Looking back now, I wish we would have purchased it because that $15,000 is peanuts on a mortgage,\" she said.\n\"We would have remade that money within six to eight months and would have been cash-flowing over the last four or five years on it. And we walked away because we were so set on the price.\"\nWhile it may seem tempting to put in a low offer, Melanie suggests caution when taking that approach.\n\"If you low-ball too much, then the seller automatically has their guard up,\" she said.\n\"They're insulted. So low-balling is not always the best strategy.\"\nDave says at the end of the day, everybody has to be happy with the deal.\n\"If it's not going to be a win-win, we don't want to be a part of the negotiations,\" he said.\n\"If someone has to lose for you to win, we've walked away from those.\"\nOf course, with a real estate investment, the finances will be have to be finalized. Melanie says it's important to know the difference between good debt and bad debt.\nShe says bad debt is a purchase that doesn't make you money, such as a car, clothing or electronics. Good debt, she says, is a purchase that generates money, such as a rental property.\nAt the end of the day, she says people purchasing rental properties should not only make enough to pay the mortgage, but extra money for maintenance, taxes and to pay yourself.\nDave says to ensure you will have money left over, it comes down to income verses expenses.\n\"If the rent coming in is higher than the water, taxes, heat, hydro, mortgage, insurance, then you know you're in a cash-flow positive state,\" he said.\n\"If the in is greater than the out, then hey, you're in the green.\"\nMelanie says once that is figured out, the next step is to ensure you have tenants to help pay the bills. She says they promoted their apartments heavily on social media.\n\"We have zero per cent vacancy rate,\" she said. \"We can't keep up. We can't fill the need.\"\nDave says it didn't get to that point right away. He says it took time to build a good reputation as a great landlord to attract tenants.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Saint John housing programs more effective, but shelter use on the rise, report shows", "description": "More co-ordinated approach to homelessness needed, says Human Development Council ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/saint-john-homeless-report-emergency-shelters-1.5144811", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1550521.1379063088!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/li-homeless2-620-cbc.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 22, 2019 5:20 PM AT", "2019-05-22T20:22:31.945Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Saint John's housing programs are housing more people than ever before, but the city doesn't seem to be making any progress on its overall homelessness rate, according to the Human Development Council's new\u00a0Progress Report on Homelessness.\nEmergency shelters are operating either at or over capacity and people staying longer, the 2018 statistics show.\nMichael MacKenzie, the community development co-ordinator for the Human Development Council, who put together the report, says the numbers are \"disheartening.\"\nThe level of need has not diminished and despite best efforts, much of that need is not being met.\nMacKenzie contends a more co-ordinated\u00a0response is needed.\nOtherwise, the emergency shelters\u00a0and\u00a0housing programs may both\u00a0be doing great work, but if they aren't working together, there won't be any meaningful reduction in homelessness, he said.\n\"So I think we are now really turning our mind to bringing\u00a0together not just non-profits who work in the homeless serving sector, but also public systems, like Horizon [Health], justice, even things like the education system, which all touch homelessness in some way but don't necessarily work together, to prevent or reduce homelessness.\"\nThe city took an encouraging step in that direction during the \"homelessness crisis\" in November 2018, when 34 men were turned away from the emergency shelter because no cots were available, said MacKenzie.\nWhile Fredericton and Moncton, which saw similar spikes, responded by opening out-of-the-cold shelters, Saint John community partners got together and compiled a \"by-name list\" to prioritize people and connect them with rent supplements.\n\"So it was an example of the community working in a co-ordinated fashion to really support people in housing them rather than building another temporary shelter,\" he said.\nAlthough emergency shelters are a necessary component of the response to homelessness,\u00a0they are not a solution and Saint John stakeholders want to be\u00a0proactive, he stressed.\n\"I think the process that we've started with this by-name list will actually get us there because what we're doing now is tracking the inflow and the outflow of homelessness.\n\"So it's really a change in the mindset of how we address homelessness.

From leaders of the biggest companies in the U.S., it comes as\u00a0an epiphany.\nThe new\u00a0statement is merely a change in wording and\u00a0by no means binding,\u00a0but the world's business news organizations seemed flabbergasted by Monday's\u00a0announcement.\nThe powerful group, whose history goes back to 1972, has previously fought anti-trust legislation, fought to weaken labour laws, backed favourable tax cuts and successfully lobbied to dilute restrictions on executive compensation.\nThe language of its mission statement has been tweaked over the years.\nBut every version, since 1997, \"has endorsed principles of shareholder primacy \u2014\u00a0that corporations exist principally to serve shareholders,\" the group said in a statement.\nThe new one \"supersedes previous statements and outlines a modern standard for corporate responsibility,\" the group said.\u00a0\nThe new statement \u2014 especially the parts about good jobs and economic opportunity \u2014\u00a0seems to reflect the same kind of disenchantment that swept U.S. President Donald Trump to power. Even though interest rate cuts and lower taxes have sent stock prices\u00a0higher under Trump, there are still plenty of complaints that shareholder wealth is not trickling down to ordinary people and to the broader economy.\nIt suggests\u00a0even\u00a0those secure in their personal wealth and position realize that a failure\u00a0to share the wealth is having an impact on the wider state of the U.S. economy;\u00a0that corporate leaders have finally realized that the long-term success of business depends on the long-term success of society and that, in many ways, that society is in trouble.\n\"The American dream is alive, but fraying,\" said Dimon in a statement. \"These modernized principles reflect the business community's unwavering commitment to continue to push for an economy that serves all Americans.\"\nIn the past, some business thinkers worried that a growing economic divide would mean large portions of society won't be able to afford the products corporations produce, a reversal of the idea that Henry Ford made his Model T cars cheap enough for his own workers to buy them.\n\"What that gave us was an industrial middle class, and an economy that was driven by consumer demand,\" labour economist Harley Shaiken once told U.S. broadcaster\u00a0National Public Radio.\nThe new policy statement may show the business leaders are adopting the views of French economist Thomas Piketty who, in his 2014 book Capital in the Twenty-First Century\u00a0said the survival of capitalism depended on a certain amount of redistribution of wealth from the richest to ordinary people.\nRather than just handouts, Piketty\u00a0suggested one of the essential things countries must do is improve education for the poorest, something that would have a long-term impact on relative wealth. As others have said, a more widely educated population does not just create consumers, it\u00a0is\u00a0more likely to create wealth.\nReference to the environment may also show a split between corporate leaders and Trump, whose policies have pulled the teeth from environmental rules and withdrawn the U.S. from its Paris climate change commitments.\nMany credible international studies\u00a0have shown climate change and other kinds of environmental degradation are eroding the natural\u00a0wealth that corporations depend upon. The new statement may show business leaders have come to a similar realization.\nOf course critics are skeptical. Instead of actually wanting to change their ways, the statement may just be public posturing \u2014 saying \"Don't worry, we've got it covered,\" as legislators try to\u00a0force corporations into being better public citizens.\n\"I'm wary,\" Larry Summers, the economist who served in high-profile roles in Democratic administrations told the Financial Times. \"I worry the Roundtable's rhetorical embrace of stakeholders is in part a strategy for holding off necessary tax and regulatory reform.\"\nIt may also hint at their fear that previous periods of skewed wealth and power, such as the gilded age of the late 19th century, ended in marginal tax rates for the rich of more than 75 per cent. In North America's golden age of the\u00a01950s, the marginal tax rate on the richest was more than 90 per cent.\nBut as the world fears a painful recession \u2014 that would likely\u00a0lead to a decline in stocks and a public backlash against the business elites\u00a0responsible \u2014 maybe it's a good time to claim high share prices are not the be all and end all.\nFree market critics\u00a0point out the new plan\u00a0flies in the face of the view that, for the sake of efficiency, companies should be single-minded in maximizing\u00a0the bottom line, leaving governments to develop the set of rules corporations\u00a0operate under.\nBut taken at face value, the new statement of purpose may represent the first step in the realization that giant corporations can't go on eating their seed corn. Instead, long-term profits and long-term survival depend on nurturing the health of the\u00a0society they depend on to survive, even if that requires being open to new government restraints.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Evan Dyer", "title": "Extreme measures: European governments pull out the stops to slow COVID-19", "description": "Europe's measures could offer a glimpse of Canada's future", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-19-coronavirus-quarantine-europe-1.5492967", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5493029.1583875534!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/italy-virus-outbreak.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 5:33 PM ET", "2020-03-10T23:38:47.900Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Although Canada is still in the early stages of its COVID-19 response, a look around the world may provide a glimpse of measures that could come into force here as the epidemic progresses.\nSome fairly extreme measures have been planned\u00a0\u2014 and in some cases have been already implemented \u2014 in countries from Ireland to Japan.\nWhen China locked down Hubei province\u00a0and put millions of people in quarantine, many Western observers believed they were viewing the response of an authoritarian government obsessed with people control.\nThe World Health Organization, in a February 28 report, described China's measures as \"perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history.\"\nBut Italy has now shown that a democracy can take similar measures when the threat is deemed severe enough. Although Italy's travel ban allows for more exceptions than China's, it also extends to the whole country. And it is accompanied by a string of other stringent measures.\nToday, the Giuseppe Conte government in Rome said that all first-home mortgage payments in Italy are to be suspended. The government has suggested a freeze of 18 months. Italians will also get a tax holiday to avoid driving people \u2014 especially the self-employed \u2014into bankruptcy.\nThat in turn will almost certainly require more government action to protect Italian banks from going bust, because they depend on those mortgage payments to meet their obligations.\nAnd that help from the bank will have to come from a government that has stopped collecting taxes.\nIt all means a much-larger-than-expected deficit this year, in a country that already has trouble balancing its books (Italy's economy is still smaller than it was before the 2008 financial crisis).\nNot only are Italians free of fees and taxes until March 31, those who had court proceedings scheduled prior to March 22 will see their cases postponed. That goes for both civil and criminal proceedings.\nIt's the kind of suspension that can be expected in other countries as governments move to prevent all activities that bring people into contact with strangers. Britain's government has already hinted that it may order its police to focus only on the most serious crimes during the second phase\u00a0of its virus response plan.\nMeanwhile, six inmates died as prison riots swept Italy recently, while dozens more used the disturbances to escape.\nPrisoners' rights group Antigone said the riots were partly to protest restrictive measures imposed on prisoners to prevent the spread of the virus, but were more out of fear of how the virus itself could spread in unsanitary, overcrowded penitentiaries.\nFamily members of inmates have demonstrated outside several prisons, demanding early release and other measures to protect their family members.\nThe country's police, meanwhile,\u00a0are stretched to the limit enforcing quarantine rules, which require people to present proof they have valid reasons to travel.\nIt's a sign of how far the virus can reach into and disrupt a country's\u00a0vital functions in ways that few nations have seen\u00a0 in the modern era.\nYesterday in the U.S., presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren sent letters to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and three private prison firms demanding to know their plans for virus containment.\nIreland is nowhere near as far along as Italy on the\u00a0coronavirus curve, having seen about 50 cases so far.\nBut Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister) told the country that it should brace for an epidemic that\u00a0ultimately will affect about half the population.\nLeo Varadkar also announced the immediate creation of an emergency fund of 3 billion Euros to deal with the virus. (The equivalent amount for Canada's larger population would be about $37 billion.)\nVaradkar warned the nation that the government was bracing for a death toll as high as 85,000, in a country with fewer than 5 million people.\n\"Up to 50 or 60 per cent (of the population) could get the virus,\" he said.\u00a0\"There will be a significant proportion that will require critical care. And a percentage that we don't know, we honestly don't know it yet \u2014 it could be less than one per cent, it could be as much as three or 3.4 per cent mortality.\"\nThe Irish Association of Funeral Directors has instructed its members not to hold any kind of funeral for COVID-19 victims, but to place them in\u00a0body bags immediately and leave the bags sealed until the remains are cremated or buried. Family members are being warned to stay away from funeral homes.\nGerman\u00a0Chancellor\u00a0Angela Merkel echoed Varadkar's words about the eventual reach of the epidemic, although she chose a more private forum.\n\"Sixty to 70 per cent of people in Germany will become infected with the coronavirus,\" she told a meeting of her party's lawmakers, in remarks that were quickly leaked to the newspaper Bild.\nGermany has yet to introduce the kind of lockdown that has been implemented in Italy, but Merkel made it clear that the country expects to shut down sporting and cultural events \u2014 something that is happening across Europe.\nAround the world, governments were repeating that same message yesterday.\n\"The next two months will be crucial,\" said Greece's Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias today, announcing the total closure of all schools and public sporting events in the country, as well as a month-long ban on conferences.\n\"We will need to ask Victorians to do things we have never asked them to do before,\" warned Premier Daniel Andrews of the Australian state of Victoria today, describing the closure of schools in the state as \"inevitable\".\nGiven that sense of inevitability, several European countries are considering, or have already authorized, emergency payments for anyone who is sick or self-quarantined.\nItaly has led the way with financial measures, but Ireland has also increased its sick pay rates by 50 per cent and loosened eligibility rules.\nTax agencies in several countries have announced that they are ready to be flexible and work with businesses that are unable to pay their tax bills on time because of collapsing revenues.\nHarvard economist Jason Furman has recommended that the U.S. government act now to avoid a virus-fuelled recession by simply writing a cheque for $1000 to every adult and $500 for every child.\nSome countries, such as the U.K., have also considered suspending certain rules about hours and workplace safety.

She died in 1909 and her will contained a strange provision \u2014 should her husband, Thomas, ever remarry, he would be required to\u00a0donate $10,000 to the city for construction of a fountain.\nIn 1911, when Thomas was engaged to be married, he was\u00a0in debt due to some real estate investments that went belly up, according to local historian George Siamandas.\nIt took two years, but Thomas acquired the funds and met\u00a0his obligation. The fountain was designed by local architect John Manuel, who later relocated to Alberta to\u00a0direct construction of Canadian Pacific Railway hotels at Banff and Lake Louise.\nAfter many years of neglect, the fountain was in desperate need of rehabilitation and in\u00a02010, the city undertook a major restoration that\u00a0included\u00a0repairs, cleaning, and carving new pieces to replace missing and damaged ones.\nThe Central Park neighbourhood\u00a0has since gone through many changes, as much of the middle class population moved to suburban areas and the park's use fell into decline.\nThe number of people living in the area decreased through the 1970s on, and\u00a0the park's popularity fell.\u00a0Apartments replaced many of the houses in the area and crime rates spiked.\nThe Central Park area has since transitioned into a\u00a0community for many new Canadians\u00a0with diverse cultural backgrounds, and serves as a starting point for many immigrant and refugee families beginning new lives in the city.\nWhere it used to be a place for people to get away from city life for a country feel, it is now located in one of the most densely populated parts of the city, with 15,000 people per square kilometre, according to the City of Winnipeg.\nIn fact, according to a 2008 CBC report, 70 per cent of all refugees coming to Winnipeg at that point lived downtown, largely settling in and around the Central Park area.\nIn 1985, the city\u00a0hired a landscape architecture firm\u00a0to design an extension to Central Park. It used to end at Qu'Appelle Avenue but a section of that street was closed off, allowing the\u00a0park to be expanded to Ellice\u00a0Avenue.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0plan was\u00a0to link Central Park to the legislative\u00a0grounds but the development of north Portage, and the\u00a0construction of Portage Place mall, snuffed that out, according to the WAF booklet.\nIn 2008, the city launched a major revitalization of the park, completed in 2012 for $5.6 million.

It cannot happen all at once,\" he said. \"Control measures can only be lifted if the right public health measures are in place, including significant capacity for contact tracing.\"\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said his government must balance its response to the virus crisis that \"threatens to destroy lives and at the same time destroy the economic and social fabric of our country.\"\nSeeking to restart manufacturing, Spain's government is allowing workers to return to some factory and construction jobs. Retail stores and services remain closed and office workers are strongly encouraged to keep working from home. A prohibition on people leaving home for anything other than groceries and medicine will remain for at least two weeks under the state of emergency.\n\"[Spain's]\u00a0economy is more vulnerable to the crisis since it relies on services like tourism that are severely harmed by the pandemic. That means it will likely have a deeper recession,\" European Central Bank vice-president Luis de Guindos told Spain's La Vanguardia newspaper.\nYet some health experts and politicians argue it's premature to ease the lockdown in a nation that has suffered 17,489 deaths and reported 169,496 infections, second only to the United States's 557,590\u00a0infections. But Spain on Monday reported its lowest daily growth in infections in three weeks.\nItaly recorded its lowest daily virus death toll in three weeks at 431, putting its total deaths at over 19,800.\nIn Madrid, Jose Pardinas took a mask being handed out by police as he walked to work at a moving company that was restarting operations after a three-week halt.\n\"The company hasn't given us any protective equipment. I'm quite nervous about contracting the virus because my family can't afford more time without an income,\" Pardinas said.\nIn Pakistan,\u00a0Prime Minister Imran Khan\u00a0issued a global plea to the world's richer countries and international financial institutions to provide debt-relief for poor countries, where forced lockdowns are crippling already troubled economies and causing widespread hunger for the poor.\nHis government has launched an ambitious $8 billion US program to help the millions of people near the poverty level. Khan last week relaxed his country's lockdown to allow the construction industry, which employs the vast majority of Pakistan's daily wage earners, to reopen.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has urged a cautious approach to any loosening of restrictions, will hold a video conference with regional governors Wednesday, after the governor of the state with the most infections called for a \"road map\" to return to normality.\nArmin Laschet, governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, said \"the willingness for restrictions also needs the prospect of normalization.\" His government came up with a plan for gradually easing the restrictions imposed on March 22, when public gatherings were limited to only two people.\nIn South Korea, Prime Minster Chung Sye-kyun said officials were discussing new public guidelines that would allow for \"certain levels of economic and social activity\" while also maintaining distance to slow the virus's spread.\nSouth Korea's caseload has slowed from early March, when it was reporting around 500 new daily cases, but officials have warned of a broader \"quiet spread\" at locations such as bars, which are still open. President Moon Jae-in vowed Monday to focus on saving jobs and protecting the economy amid a sharp increase in the number of people seeking unemployment benefits.\nSouth Korea's vice health minister, Kim Gang-lip, said a quick return to normality was \"virtually impossible\" considering the threat of new infections.\n\"A premature easing [of physical distancing]\u00a0would come at an irrevocable cost, so we should approach the issue very carefully, and invest deep thought into when and how to transition,\" Kim said.\nWATCH | COVID-19 modelling suggests we're in it for the long haul:\nIn Sri Lanka, the government announced plans to reopen schools and universities in May.\nThe pandemic's new epicentre is now the United States, which has seen more than 22,000 deaths, the world's highest toll. About half have been in the New York metropolitan area, but hospitalizations are slowing in the state and other indicators suggest lockdowns and physical distancing are working.\nU.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said parts of the country could gradually reopen as early as next month.\nIn Britain, the death toll passed 10,600. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the first major world leader to test positive for the virus, paid an emotional tribute to the country's National Health Service after leaving the hospital on Sunday. Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care, especially thanked two nurses who stood by his bedside for 48 hours \"when things could have gone either way.\"\nJapan, the world's third-biggest economy, has seen new infections climb rapidly and now has 7,370\u00a0confirmed cases. Japanese companies have been slow to switch to working remotely and many people are still commuting, even after a state of emergency was declared for seven prefectures, including Tokyo.\nTo encourage people to stay home, the Japanese government released a video showing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cuddling his dog, reading a book and clicking a remote control at home but the message drew scathing criticism on social media.\nInfections also spiked in Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country, where President Joko Widodo pledged to be more transparent about the coronavirus. Last month, Widodo admitted he deliberately held back information about the virus's spread to prevent panic. On Monday, he asked his ministers and the COVID-19 task force to be transparent with the public.\nIndonesia has 4,557 confirmed infections and 399 deaths, Asia's highest recorded number of fatalities after China.\nMore than 1.8 million coronavirus infections have been reported and over 115,000 people have died worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. The figures understate the true size and toll of the pandemic, due to limited testing, uneven counting of the dead and deliberate under-counting by some governments.\n"}, {"author": "Evan Dyer", "title": "Extreme measures: European governments pull out the stops to slow COVID-19", "description": "Europe's measures could offer a glimpse of Canada's future", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-19-coronavirus-quarantine-europe-1.5492967", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5493029.1583875534!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/italy-virus-outbreak.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 5:33 PM ET", "2020-03-10T23:38:47.900Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Although Canada is still in the early stages of its COVID-19 response, a look around the world may provide a glimpse of measures that could come into force here as the epidemic progresses.\nSome fairly extreme measures have been planned\u00a0\u2014 and in some cases have been already implemented \u2014 in countries from Ireland to Japan.\nWhen China locked down Hubei province\u00a0and put millions of people in quarantine, many Western observers believed they were viewing the response of an authoritarian government obsessed with people control.\nThe World Health Organization, in a February 28 report, described China's measures as \"perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history.\"\nBut Italy has now shown that a democracy can take similar measures when the threat is deemed severe enough. Although Italy's travel ban allows for more exceptions than China's, it also extends to the whole country. And it is accompanied by a string of other stringent measures.\nToday, the Giuseppe Conte government in Rome said that all first-home mortgage payments in Italy are to be suspended. The government has suggested a freeze of 18 months. Italians will also get a tax holiday to avoid driving people \u2014 especially the self-employed \u2014into bankruptcy.\nThat in turn will almost certainly require more government action to protect Italian banks from going bust, because they depend on those mortgage payments to meet their obligations.\nAnd that help from the bank will have to come from a government that has stopped collecting taxes.\nIt all means a much-larger-than-expected deficit this year, in a country that already has trouble balancing its books (Italy's economy is still smaller than it was before the 2008 financial crisis).\nNot only are Italians free of fees and taxes until March 31, those who had court proceedings scheduled prior to March 22 will see their cases postponed. That goes for both civil and criminal proceedings.\nIt's the kind of suspension that can be expected in other countries as governments move to prevent all activities that bring people into contact with strangers. Britain's government has already hinted that it may order its police to focus only on the most serious crimes during the second phase\u00a0of its virus response plan.\nMeanwhile, six inmates died as prison riots swept Italy recently, while dozens more used the disturbances to escape.\nPrisoners' rights group Antigone said the riots were partly to protest restrictive measures imposed on prisoners to prevent the spread of the virus, but were more out of fear of how the virus itself could spread in unsanitary, overcrowded penitentiaries.\nFamily members of inmates have demonstrated outside several prisons, demanding early release and other measures to protect their family members.\nThe country's police, meanwhile,\u00a0are stretched to the limit enforcing quarantine rules, which require people to present proof they have valid reasons to travel.\nIt's a sign of how far the virus can reach into and disrupt a country's\u00a0vital functions in ways that few nations have seen\u00a0 in the modern era.\nYesterday in the U.S., presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren sent letters to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and three private prison firms demanding to know their plans for virus containment.\nIreland is nowhere near as far along as Italy on the\u00a0coronavirus curve, having seen about 50 cases so far.\nBut Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister) told the country that it should brace for an epidemic that\u00a0ultimately will affect about half the population.\nLeo Varadkar also announced the immediate creation of an emergency fund of 3 billion Euros to deal with the virus. (The equivalent amount for Canada's larger population would be about $37 billion.)\nVaradkar warned the nation that the government was bracing for a death toll as high as 85,000, in a country with fewer than 5 million people.\n\"Up to 50 or 60 per cent (of the population) could get the virus,\" he said.\u00a0\"There will be a significant proportion that will require critical care. And a percentage that we don't know, we honestly don't know it yet \u2014 it could be less than one per cent, it could be as much as three or 3.4 per cent mortality.\"\nThe Irish Association of Funeral Directors has instructed its members not to hold any kind of funeral for COVID-19 victims, but to place them in\u00a0body bags immediately and leave the bags sealed until the remains are cremated or buried. Family members are being warned to stay away from funeral homes.\nGerman\u00a0Chancellor\u00a0Angela Merkel echoed Varadkar's words about the eventual reach of the epidemic, although she chose a more private forum.\n\"Sixty to 70 per cent of people in Germany will become infected with the coronavirus,\" she told a meeting of her party's lawmakers, in remarks that were quickly leaked to the newspaper Bild.\nGermany has yet to introduce the kind of lockdown that has been implemented in Italy, but Merkel made it clear that the country expects to shut down sporting and cultural events \u2014 something that is happening across Europe.\nAround the world, governments were repeating that same message yesterday.\n\"The next two months will be crucial,\" said Greece's Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias today, announcing the total closure of all schools and public sporting events in the country, as well as a month-long ban on conferences.\n\"We will need to ask Victorians to do things we have never asked them to do before,\" warned Premier Daniel Andrews of the Australian state of Victoria today, describing the closure of schools in the state as \"inevitable\".\nGiven that sense of inevitability, several European countries are considering, or have already authorized, emergency payments for anyone who is sick or self-quarantined.\nItaly has led the way with financial measures, but Ireland has also increased its sick pay rates by 50 per cent and loosened eligibility rules.\nTax agencies in several countries have announced that they are ready to be flexible and work with businesses that are unable to pay their tax bills on time because of collapsing revenues.\nHarvard economist Jason Furman has recommended that the U.S. government act now to avoid a virus-fuelled recession by simply writing a cheque for $1000 to every adult and $500 for every child.\nSome countries, such as the U.K., have also considered suspending certain rules about hours and workplace safety. The British government is reportedly considering putting into abeyance its rules about the maximum number of hours a truck driver can spend at the wheel. The reason is to ensure that if large numbers of drivers become ill, those that remain will be able to keep food and other essentials moving on the country's roads.\nBritain's contingency plan says the country must prepare to have one-fifth of its entire workforce out of action at the same time. It's a reminder that, just as many people will be unable to work because of coronavirus, others will be asked to work more.\nBritain is also bringing in rules to protect employees who volunteer in hospitals and senior citizens' homes from being fired from their regular jobs over absences.\nSo far, Britain is only in phase one, the \"Containment Phase\", of a four-phase response plan.\nThe next phase \u2014 the \"Delay Phase\" \u2014 will bring more drastic measures, the government has warned.\nAmong those measures reportedly under consideration by the Boris Johnson government are bans on public events and the declaration of no-go zones around focal points of contagion.\n"}, {"author": "Darren Bernhardt", "title": "Winnipeg's 125-year-old Central Park has transformed from 'breathing centre' to diverse gem", "description": "New booklet showcases past and present of one of city's first green spaces", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/central-park-winnipeg-newcomers-community-history-1.5378278", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5378466.1575049947!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/central-park-and-waddell-fountain-winnipeg.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 30, 2019 6:00 AM CT", "2019-11-30T12:00:00.673Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "One of Winnipeg's oldest parks \u2014 dating back to\u00a0a time when public spaces were known as ornamental squares or \"breathing centres\" \u2014 is getting renewed recognition.\u00a0\nThe Winnipeg Architecture Foundation has launched a walking tour booklet that showcases the history of Central Park, a 125-year-old green space that was once a retreat from the bustle of the city life\u00a0but is now in the thick of it.\nIt highlights architectural features of the\u00a0park, like the 1914 Waddell Fountain and its quirky background story,\u00a0and the changing neighbourhood surrounding it.\nThe booklet contains old photos of the neighbourhood and park just north of the city's downtown \u2014 with some before-and-after images of the architecture that remains.\n\"There's just this wealth of information, and quite a wonderful collection of different buildings and landscapes that we wanted to highlight,\" said\u00a0Marieke Gruwel, an architectural researcher at the Winnipeg Architecture Foundation.\n\"It's also an important part of the city that's worth highlighting.\"\nThe idea for Central Park was planted in 1893 when the\u00a0newly formed Public Parks Board bought property to create Winnipeg's first four parks.\nIn its annual report from that year, the board stated it would establish\u00a0\"ornamental squares, or breathing places, throughout the city.\"\nTo develop several smaller public green spaces, rather than developing\u00a0one large suburban city\u00a0park, was\u00a0an unusual plan for a Canadian city back then,\u00a0according to Catherine Macdonald's book\u00a0A City at Leisure: An Illustrated History of Parks and Recreation Services in Winnipeg.\nIt wasn't until 1909 that Winnipeg opened its\u00a0first big\u00a0suburban park \u2014 City Park, later renamed Assiniboine Park \u2014 on what was then its far western fringe.\nThose first four parks, or breathing spaces,\u00a0were:\nThe land for\u00a0Central Park was purchased from the Hudson's Bay Company for\u00a0$20,000 and developed in short time, opening in 1894 to serve the booming city's middle class.\nIt quickly gained popularity\u00a0as a spot to get away from city life, with a tennis court, bandshell and large gardens in place by the early 1900s,\u00a0according to the WAF booklet.\nThe Waddell Fountain was installed in 1914 to commemorate Emily Margaret Waddell, who loved the park and often visited it.

In April, an analysis by CBC found that 1 in 50 private dwellings in Charlottetown was listed\u00a0for rent on Airbnb.\u00a0\nIn question period Thursday, Green MLA Hannah Bell brought up the issue of short-term rentals\u00a0\u2014 and called on the province to act.\u00a0\n\"While short-term rentals are not the sole cause of the current housing crisis, they are a contributing factor, especially in the turnover of existing long-term rental units, as tenants are 'reno-victed,'\" said Bell, who is also Opposition critic for social development and housing.\nShort-term rentals are required to be licensed, but Bell said those regulations protect tourists, not the housing supply or tenants. She asked the minister of social development and housing if his department would develop regulations to restrict the \"unregulated growth\"\u00a0of short-term rentals across province.\n\"Some municipalities seem reluctant to act\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and are looking to the province to provide solutions. Solutions that are required urgently,\" Bell said.\u00a0\nMinister Ernie Hudson acknowledged that there is a housing crisis\u00a0on the Island, but would not commit to introducing regulations.\n\"We have to have the discussion with the municipalities, but we have to collaborate,\" Hudson said.\n\"I would much prefer to collaborate as to dictate what should be taking place.\"\nBell said while she recognizes that Hudson is new to the housing portfolio, the housing crisis is not new, and needs quick action.\n\"The time for discussion and consultation is well-passed,\" Bell said.\u00a0\nBell would like to see a clear definition about what a short-term rental is, and wants those rentals to be restricted to properties that are the owner's primary residence.\nThe PCs said the issue is top of mind.\u00a0\nJames Aylward, the minister responsible for greater Charlottetown, said he and Premier Dennis King have a meeting planned for Monday with the mayors of Charlottetown, Stratford and Cornwall.\nAylward\u00a0said short-term rentals will be one of the top items on the agenda.\n"}, {"author": "Evan Dyer", "title": "Extreme measures: European governments pull out the stops to slow COVID-19", "description": "Europe's measures could offer a glimpse of Canada's future", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-19-coronavirus-quarantine-europe-1.5492967", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5493029.1583875534!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/italy-virus-outbreak.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 5:33 PM ET", "2020-03-10T23:38:47.900Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Although Canada is still in the early stages of its COVID-19 response, a look around the world may provide a glimpse of measures that could come into force here as the epidemic progresses.\nSome fairly extreme measures have been planned\u00a0\u2014 and in some cases have been already implemented \u2014 in countries from Ireland to Japan.\nWhen China locked down Hubei province\u00a0and put millions of people in quarantine, many Western observers believed they were viewing the response of an authoritarian government obsessed with people control.\nThe World Health Organization, in a February 28 report, described China's measures as \"perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history.\"\nBut Italy has now shown that a democracy can take similar measures when the threat is deemed severe enough. Although Italy's travel ban allows for more exceptions than China's, it also extends to the whole country. And it is accompanied by a string of other stringent measures.\nToday, the Giuseppe Conte government in Rome said that all first-home mortgage payments in Italy are to be suspended. The government has suggested a freeze of 18 months. Italians will also get a tax holiday to avoid driving people \u2014 especially the self-employed \u2014into bankruptcy.\nThat in turn will almost certainly require more government action to protect Italian banks from going bust, because they depend on those mortgage payments to meet their obligations.\nAnd that help from the bank will have to come from a government that has stopped collecting taxes.\nIt all means a much-larger-than-expected deficit this year, in a country that already has trouble balancing its books (Italy's economy is still smaller than it was before the 2008 financial crisis).\nNot only are Italians free of fees and taxes until March 31, those who had court proceedings scheduled prior to March 22 will see their cases postponed. That goes for both civil and criminal proceedings.\nIt's the kind of suspension that can be expected in other countries as governments move to prevent all activities that bring people into contact with strangers. Britain's government has already hinted that it may order its police to focus only on the most serious crimes during the second phase\u00a0of its virus response plan.\nMeanwhile, six inmates died as prison riots swept Italy recently, while dozens more used the disturbances to escape.\nPrisoners' rights group Antigone said the riots were partly to protest restrictive measures imposed on prisoners to prevent the spread of the virus, but were more out of fear of how the virus itself could spread in unsanitary, overcrowded penitentiaries.\nFamily members of inmates have demonstrated outside several prisons, demanding early release and other measures to protect their family members.\nThe country's police, meanwhile,\u00a0are stretched to the limit enforcing quarantine rules, which require people to present proof they have valid reasons to travel.\nIt's a sign of how far the virus can reach into and disrupt a country's\u00a0vital functions in ways that few nations have seen\u00a0 in the modern era.\nYesterday in the U.S., presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren sent letters to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and three private prison firms demanding to know their plans for virus containment.\nIreland is nowhere near as far along as Italy on the\u00a0coronavirus curve, having seen about 50 cases so far.\nBut Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister) told the country that it should brace for an epidemic that\u00a0ultimately will affect about half the population.\nLeo Varadkar also announced the immediate creation of an emergency fund of 3 billion Euros to deal with the virus. (The equivalent amount for Canada's larger population would be about $37 billion.)\nVaradkar warned the nation that the government was bracing for a death toll as high as 85,000, in a country with fewer than 5 million people.\n\"Up to 50 or 60 per cent (of the population) could get the virus,\" he said.\u00a0\"There will be a significant proportion that will require critical care. And a percentage that we don't know, we honestly don't know it yet \u2014 it could be less than one per cent, it could be as much as three or 3.4 per cent mortality.\"\nThe Irish Association of Funeral Directors has instructed its members not to hold any kind of funeral for COVID-19 victims, but to place them in\u00a0body bags immediately and leave the bags sealed until the remains are cremated or buried. Family members are being warned to stay away from funeral homes.\nGerman\u00a0Chancellor\u00a0Angela Merkel echoed Varadkar's words about the eventual reach of the epidemic, although she chose a more private forum.\n\"Sixty to 70 per cent of people in Germany will become infected with the coronavirus,\" she told a meeting of her party's lawmakers, in remarks that were quickly leaked to the newspaper Bild.\nGermany has yet to introduce the kind of lockdown that has been implemented in Italy, but Merkel made it clear that the country expects to shut down sporting and cultural events \u2014 something that is happening across Europe.\nAround the world, governments were repeating that same message yesterday.\n\"The next two months will be crucial,\" said Greece's Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias today, announcing the total closure of all schools and public sporting events in the country, as well as a month-long ban on conferences.\n\"We will need to ask Victorians to do things we have never asked them to do before,\" warned Premier Daniel Andrews of the Australian state of Victoria today, describing the closure of schools in the state as \"inevitable\".\nGiven that sense of inevitability, several European countries are considering, or have already authorized, emergency payments for anyone who is sick or self-quarantined.\nItaly has led the way with financial measures, but Ireland has also increased its sick pay rates by 50 per cent and loosened eligibility rules.\nTax agencies in several countries have announced that they are ready to be flexible and work with businesses that are unable to pay their tax bills on time because of collapsing revenues.\nHarvard economist Jason Furman has recommended that the U.S. government act now to avoid a virus-fuelled recession by simply writing a cheque for $1000 to every adult and $500 for every child.\nSome countries, such as the U.K., have also considered suspending certain rules about hours and workplace safety. The British government is reportedly considering putting into abeyance its rules about the maximum number of hours a truck driver can spend at the wheel. The reason is to ensure that if large numbers of drivers become ill, those that remain will be able to keep food and other essentials moving on the country's roads.\nBritain's contingency plan says the country must prepare to have one-fifth of its entire workforce out of action at the same time. It's a reminder that, just as many people will be unable to work because of coronavirus, others will be asked to work more.\nBritain is also bringing in rules to protect employees who volunteer in hospitals and senior citizens' homes from being fired from their regular jobs over absences.\nSo far, Britain is only in phase one, the \"Containment Phase\", of a four-phase response plan.\nThe next phase \u2014 the \"Delay Phase\" \u2014 will bring more drastic measures, the government has warned.\nAmong those measures reportedly under consideration by the Boris Johnson government are bans on public events and the declaration of no-go zones around focal points of contagion.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "'We should approach the issue very carefully': Nations pressured to loosen COVID-19-related rules", "description": "The decisions are complicated because each country is on its own coronavirus arc", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/nations-spain-work-1.5530664", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5530680.1586781818!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/virus-outbreak-spain.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 13, 2020 10:11 AM ET", "2020-04-13T16:35:19.759Z"], "source": null, "content": "As the coronavirus pandemic throws millions out of work and devastates economies worldwide, governments are struggling with the delicate balance between keeping people safe from a highly contagious virus and making sure they can still make a living or even have enough to eat.\nWorkers in some non-essential industries were returning to their jobs Monday in Spain, one of the hardest-hit countries in the pandemic, while in South Korea, officials were warning that hard-earned progress fighting the virus could be eroded by new infections as restrictions ease.\nThe decisions are complicated because each nation is on its own coronavirus arc, with places like Britain, Japan and parts of the United States still seeing increasing daily levels of deaths or infections; France and New York hoping they are stabilizing, albeit at a high plateau of deaths; and hard-hit nations such as\u00a0Italy and Spain seeing declines in the rates of increase.\nOn Monday, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addressed the fact that as some countries\u00a0weigh\u00a0whether to start easing restrictions, others are\u00a0considering whether to introduce them.\nHe said WHO\u00a0will publish updated guidance Tuesday on criteria to review when considering easing restrictions, including measures around testing and tracing, supporting the health system and educating the public.\n\"Control measures must be lifted slowly and with control. It cannot happen all at once,\" he said. \"Control measures can only be lifted if the right public health measures are in place, including significant capacity for contact tracing.\"\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said his government must balance its response to the virus crisis that \"threatens to destroy lives and at the same time destroy the economic and social fabric of our country.\"\nSeeking to restart manufacturing, Spain's government is allowing workers to return to some factory and construction jobs. Retail stores and services remain closed and office workers are strongly encouraged to keep working from home. A prohibition on people leaving home for anything other than groceries and medicine will remain for at least two weeks under the state of emergency.\n\"[Spain's]\u00a0economy is more vulnerable to the crisis since it relies on services like tourism that are severely harmed by the pandemic. That means it will likely have a deeper recession,\" European Central Bank vice-president Luis de Guindos told Spain's La Vanguardia newspaper.\nYet some health experts and politicians argue it's premature to ease the lockdown in a nation that has suffered 17,489 deaths and reported 169,496 infections, second only to the United States's 557,590\u00a0infections. But Spain on Monday reported its lowest daily growth in infections in three weeks.\nItaly recorded its lowest daily virus death toll in three weeks at 431, putting its total deaths at over 19,800.\nIn Madrid, Jose Pardinas took a mask being handed out by police as he walked to work at a moving company that was restarting operations after a three-week halt.\n\"The company hasn't given us any protective equipment. I'm quite nervous about contracting the virus because my family can't afford more time without an income,\" Pardinas said.\nIn Pakistan,\u00a0Prime Minister Imran Khan\u00a0issued a global plea to the world's richer countries and international financial institutions to provide debt-relief for poor countries, where forced lockdowns are crippling already troubled economies and causing widespread hunger for the poor.\nHis government has launched an ambitious $8 billion US program to help the millions of people near the poverty level. Khan last week relaxed his country's lockdown to allow the construction industry, which employs the vast majority of Pakistan's daily wage earners, to reopen.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has urged a cautious approach to any loosening of restrictions, will hold a video conference with regional governors Wednesday, after the governor of the state with the most infections called for a \"road map\" to return to normality.\nArmin Laschet, governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, said \"the willingness for restrictions also needs the prospect of normalization.\" His government came up with a plan for gradually easing the restrictions imposed on March 22, when public gatherings were limited to only two people.\nIn South Korea, Prime Minster Chung Sye-kyun said officials were discussing new public guidelines that would allow for \"certain levels of economic and social activity\" while also maintaining distance to slow the virus's spread.\nSouth Korea's caseload has slowed from early March, when it was reporting around 500 new daily cases, but officials have warned of a broader \"quiet spread\" at locations such as bars, which are still open. President Moon Jae-in vowed Monday to focus on saving jobs and protecting the economy amid a sharp increase in the number of people seeking unemployment benefits.\nSouth Korea's vice health minister, Kim Gang-lip, said a quick return to normality was \"virtually impossible\" considering the threat of new infections.\n\"A premature easing [of physical distancing]\u00a0would come at an irrevocable cost, so we should approach the issue very carefully, and invest deep thought into when and how to transition,\" Kim said.\nWATCH | COVID-19 modelling suggests we're in it for the long haul:\nIn Sri Lanka, the government announced plans to reopen schools and universities in May.\nThe pandemic's new epicentre is now the United States, which has seen more than 22,000 deaths, the world's highest toll. About half have been in the New York metropolitan area, but hospitalizations are slowing in the state and other indicators suggest lockdowns and physical distancing are working.\nU.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said parts of the country could gradually reopen as early as next month.\nIn Britain, the death toll passed 10,600. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the first major world leader to test positive for the virus, paid an emotional tribute to the country's National Health Service after leaving the hospital on Sunday. Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care, especially thanked two nurses who stood by his bedside for 48 hours \"when things could have gone either way.\"\nJapan, the world's third-biggest economy, has seen new infections climb rapidly and now has 7,370\u00a0confirmed cases. Japanese companies have been slow to switch to working remotely and many people are still commuting, even after a state of emergency was declared for seven prefectures, including Tokyo.\nTo encourage people to stay home, the Japanese government released a video showing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cuddling his dog, reading a book and clicking a remote control at home but the message drew scathing criticism on social media.\nInfections also spiked in Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country, where President Joko Widodo pledged to be more transparent about the coronavirus. Last month, Widodo admitted he deliberately held back information about the virus's spread to prevent panic. On Monday, he asked his ministers and the COVID-19 task force to be transparent with the public.\nIndonesia has 4,557 confirmed infections and 399 deaths, Asia's highest recorded number of fatalities after China.\nMore than 1.8 million coronavirus infections have been reported and over 115,000 people have died worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. The figures understate the true size and toll of the pandemic, due to limited testing, uneven counting of the dead and deliberate under-counting by some governments.\n"}, {"author": "Alex Brockman", "title": "Yellowknife's housing market slows as economic slump looms on the horizon: CMHC", "description": "CMHC's annual report on Northern housing shows mixed outlook across the 3 territories ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cmhc-housing-territories-nwt-1.5263453", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3781447.1475014118!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/rentals.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 29, 2019 4:00 AM CT", "2019-08-29T10:00:00.306Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Yellowknife's housing market is cooling as the Northwest Territories' diamond mines approach the end of their lifespan and the territory's economic future increasingly looks bleak.\nThat assessment comes from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) in its latest annual report on housing in Canada's North. It suggests slowdowns in the mining industry will trickle down throughout the economy, affecting the housing market going forward.\n\"The downturn in the mining sector is likely to impact the housing market, as these products provide some support for the housing market in Yellowknife,\" the report states.\nSigns of a slump were recorded in the data for last year, with fewer homes sold and fewer homes under construction.\nHome sales in the N.W.T. capital dropped in 2018, with 240 homes sold last year, compared to 454 in 2017. Construction began on fewer homes as well, with 53 starts in 2018, compared to 65 in 2017.\nDespite this, the average sale price of a home rose slightly\u00a0to $448,721 in 2018, up from $408,290 in 2017. That's likely because most of the homes sold last year were in the upper price bracket, the report says.\nThe report did not have up-to-date numbers on core housing need in Yellowknife, but it did note that in 2016, Statistics Canada found 15.5 per cent of families live in unsuitable, unaffordable or inadequate housing, compared to the national average of 10.7 per cent.\nData suggests the situation is similar in the other territorial capitals, with both Whitehorse and Iqaluit showing a higher core need than the national average.\nThe housing market in Iqaluit remains dominated by non-market housing, which includes social housing and housing subsidized by government and private businesses.\nNearly 25 per cent of rental homes are social housing rented out by the Nunavut Housing Corporation, while another 39 per cent are staff housing for territorial and federal government employees.\nHousing in Iqaluit continues to be \"among the most expensive to provide\u00a0in Canada,\" the report states, with more than 60 per cent of Nunavummiut unable to afford a place to live without some sort of assistance from their employer or the government.\nThe Nunavut government is spending $34 million this year on housing in the territory, including $12 million for emergency shelters, the report states, with 20 new public housing units expected for Iqaluit in 2019-2020.\nDemand is expected to continue to put pressure on the need for housing as high gold prices and investment in new and existing mining projects at Meadowbank and Hope Bay continue.\nHouse prices in Whitehorse rose slightly in 2018, with most indicators showing it was a seller's market, with rising prices and shrinking housing stock. Prices for 2019 are expected to rise again, with the price range for a home between $422,000 and $452,000.\u00a0\nThe rental market, meanwhile continues to be tight, sitting at 2.4 per cent in October 2018, which was the lowest vacancy rate in the past four years.\nThe CMHC report suggests that the population of young adults will keep the rental demand stable even as the population ages.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "The Goldilocks president says he wants to keep the boom alive: Don Pittis", "description": "Europe and China are also seeking just-right ways to stave off recession", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/recession-economy-1.5256099", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5259667.1566810686!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/g7-summit.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 26, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-08-26T09:12:34.907Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "While so many of us are holding our collective breath waiting for the next recession, U.S. President Donald Trump says he wants to do everything he can to avoid one.\nMaybe he can fulfil his destiny, if not as the chosen one\u00a0as he stated last week, but by channelling Goldilocks, famous for her interaction with the three bears.\nFor those few of you unfamiliar with the children's story antihero named for her hair colour, she was the one who, stumbling into the bears' cottage when they are out for a walk, avoids extremes and chooses to take\u00a0the bears' chair, porridge and bed that are \"just right.\"\nIn business,\u00a0Goldilocks has become the symbol of the just-right economy.\nWhile most economists accept that periodic recessions are inevitable \u2014 some even think they are useful \u2014\u00a0Trump is fervent in his determination to stop recession in its tracks and keep the economy just right. The European Central Bank and China seem to be on the same page, mostly in fear of the political fallout once the music stops.\nOn Friday, there were reports the ECB was about to pour on more stimulus. In China, despite a new exchange of explosive remarks\u00a0with Trump in their escalating trade war, experts have said keeping recession at bay\u00a0is essential to maintain the autocratic regime's grip on power.\u00a0\nAt the G7 this weekend, one of the things the leaders were agreed on is that an economic collapse was\u00a0something to be avoided.\nAs one of Canada's leading\u00a0Keynesian\u00a0scholars, Louis-Philippe Rochon, told me last week, there is a good reason politicians don't like recessions. They hurt.\n\"They're not good,\" said\u00a0Rochon, founder of the Review of Keynesian Economics and\u00a0professor of economics at Ontario's Laurentian University. \"They tend to disproportionately hurt people in lower income brackets. There is a loss of wealth, loss of well-being.\"\nA certain kind of conservative economist sees economic downturns as unpalatable medicine that kills off over-borrowed zombie companies and resets wages. At the other extreme, some Marxists have anticipated the downfall of capitalism so it can be replaced by a communist paradise.\nBut can recession be avoided permanently? In the short term at least, the U.S. president seems to think the answer is to keep cutting interest rates. Last week he said he was\u00a0also considering\u00a0more tax cuts.\nMeanwhile, Democrat supporters of Modern Monetary Theory seem to say a new burst of government spending can do the job. On Friday presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders\u00a0proposed $1.6 trillion in new spending to transform the U.S. economy while creating new jobs.\u00a0\nRelatively few adults have multiple experiences of a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/recession?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#recession</a> <br> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SoberLook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SoberLook</a>: @jkempenerg of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/washingtonpost?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@washingtonpost</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Oc6QPrtoKm\">pic.twitter.com/Oc6QPrtoKm</a>\nRochon\u00a0seems to be of two minds on the issue. He agrees with \"the MMTers\" that governments have huge spending power when they need it to stimulate the economy into activity. Nonetheless, he says, \"recessions are inevitable.\"\nThe answer to the economic contradiction is politics. At some point governments or the people who elect them decide government spending is bad, despite what Rochon says is good evidence to the contrary.\nRochon points to empirical research showing that sufficient government spending in the economy, such as during a war effort,\u00a0can convince consumers and businesses that it is safe to spend and to invest, restarting a new phase of optimism and economic growth. However, that mood can change.\n\"You do have segments of the population who will get spooked, the sky will be falling,\" said Rochon, describing the process when a psychology of optimism turns to pessimism. Companies cut investments. Employers cut jobs.\u00a0\"Then the economy contracts.\"\nEconomies can also be hit by external shocks. The current trade war is an example.\nBut even the perfect Goldilocks economy, balanced and run by, say, a future global artificial intelligence, could still be battered by unforeseen events such as a major\u00a0earthquake or a global outbreak of disease.\nAll that was necessary was for central banks to cut rates a little more and wise government leaders\u00a0\"to invest in those productivity-enhancing assets that will allow them to reap the long-term benefits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\"\nWise business leaders\u00a0must keep investing and refuse to lay off staff. Everyone just has\u00a0to work together, he said.\nHowever, we don't have a global artificial intelligence or co-operative leaders\u00a0to guide us. The U.S. has Donald Trump who, while insisting he wants to avoid recession,\u00a0seems trapped in a series of self-destructive trade wars and battles with the central banker he appointed.\nPerhaps a Goldilocks economy really is possible. Maybe recessions can be delayed if not prevented altogether.

That makes home ownership an option earlier in life, plus paying off the mortgage possible much sooner, allowing residents to allocate more of their income to other expenses or savings.\nIt's an economic advantage many residents are well aware of.

In other provinces, daycare rates are at least double, if spots are even available.\n\"I think it's really sad to think that families have to worry so much,\" says Buro of places where daycare is more expensive and harder to find. \"We've heard of families [in other provinces] who waited till the first child was in school before they had a second.

In Ontario, the burden would be $8,660 or the Yukon, $8,309.\n\"We feel like we're being taxed like we're in the higher levels, although we are considered middle class,\" Buro adds.\nAll of which leaves Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu just slightly ahead of most other Canadian communities when it comes to cost of living. And that has residents paying attention to what the federal parties vying to lead the country in the upcoming election plan to do in terms of reducing the overhead.\nAnd if those in one of Canada's most affordable cities are feeling the financial squeeze, imagine other parts of the country, particularly the Greater Toronto Area and B.C.'s Lower Mainland where living costs in nearly all categories have been on the rise for years, even as income has failed to keep pace.\nHousing prices increased 44 per cent nationally between 2013 and 2018, for example.\nProperty taxes have also shifted northwards as provinces from coast to coast have downloaded responsibilities (and the costs that go with them) to towns and municipalities.\nWith various polls pointing to the rising cost of living as a primary concern of voters heading into the next election, the parties have taken note, says Eric Grenier.\n\"The Conservatives have made it the centrepiece of their campaign, while the New Democrats are also trying to capitalize on that anxiety and concerns about income inequality.\"\nThe Liberals, meanwhile, are pointing to housing policy changes, including a program to provide first-time buyers with 5 per cent towards the purchase of a home.\nMany across the country, even in \"most affordable\" Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, indicate they'll be looking for a candidate, party or leader who can help improve their financial situation. In CBC's poll, for example, one-third of Canadians surveyed said it was their No. 1 concern.\n\"Family issues are most important to me for the election,\" a Saint-Jean resident told CBC News while out with her family at an annual end-of-summer fair.\nMeanwhile, some in Saint-Jean say they would settle for a government that has a plan to at least slow the rising costs of daily life.\n\"Anybody who's going to help us maintain this quality of life is definitely going to have our vote,\" says Buro.\nAnd with that, she returns to her backyard chickens, collecting the eggs they produce for her daily.

It suggests slowdowns in the mining industry will trickle down throughout the economy, affecting the housing market going forward.\n\"The downturn in the mining sector is likely to impact the housing market, as these products provide some support for the housing market in Yellowknife,\" the report states.\nSigns of a slump were recorded in the data for last year, with fewer homes sold and fewer homes under construction.\nHome sales in the N.W.T. capital dropped in 2018, with 240 homes sold last year, compared to 454 in 2017. Construction began on fewer homes as well, with 53 starts in 2018, compared to 65 in 2017.\nDespite this, the average sale price of a home rose slightly\u00a0to $448,721 in 2018, up from $408,290 in 2017. That's likely because most of the homes sold last year were in the upper price bracket, the report says.\nThe report did not have up-to-date numbers on core housing need in Yellowknife, but it did note that in 2016, Statistics Canada found 15.5 per cent of families live in unsuitable, unaffordable or inadequate housing, compared to the national average of 10.7 per cent.\nData suggests the situation is similar in the other territorial capitals, with both Whitehorse and Iqaluit showing a higher core need than the national average.\nThe housing market in Iqaluit remains dominated by non-market housing, which includes social housing and housing subsidized by government and private businesses.\nNearly 25 per cent of rental homes are social housing rented out by the Nunavut Housing Corporation, while another 39 per cent are staff housing for territorial and federal government employees.\nHousing in Iqaluit continues to be \"among the most expensive to provide\u00a0in Canada,\" the report states, with more than 60 per cent of Nunavummiut unable to afford a place to live without some sort of assistance from their employer or the government.\nThe Nunavut government is spending $34 million this year on housing in the territory, including $12 million for emergency shelters, the report states, with 20 new public housing units expected for Iqaluit in 2019-2020.\nDemand is expected to continue to put pressure on the need for housing as high gold prices and investment in new and existing mining projects at Meadowbank and Hope Bay continue.\nHouse prices in Whitehorse rose slightly in 2018, with most indicators showing it was a seller's market, with rising prices and shrinking housing stock. Prices for 2019 are expected to rise again, with the price range for a home between $422,000 and $452,000.\u00a0\nThe rental market, meanwhile continues to be tight, sitting at 2.4 per cent in October 2018, which was the lowest vacancy rate in the past four years.\nThe CMHC report suggests that the population of young adults will keep the rental demand stable even as the population ages.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2680846137", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2685065600", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/755474499728", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/760889923622", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/759161411693", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/759160899895", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/661279299742", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "David Common & Perlita Stroh", "title": "Even in an 'affordable' Canadian city, cost-of-living squeeze has people putting pressure on politicians", "description": "Cost of living is a big federal election issue, even in places where daily expenses are lower than average", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cost-of-living-federal-election-richelieu-1.5280573", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5281699.1568325203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/anais.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 15, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-15T08:00:00.050Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu lies on the banks of a picturesque river about half an hour's drive from Montreal, its main street a collection of charming cafes and historic storefronts.

That's the biggest one-day drop in four year and follows\u00a0President Donald Trump's threat last week of tariff hikes on additional Chinese imports in a fight over Beijing's trade surplus and technology policies.\u00a0\nThe yuan's weakness is among a series of U.S. complaints that are fuelling tensions with Washington. American officials complain a weak yuan makes China's exports too inexpensive, hurting foreign competitors and swelling Beijing's trade surplus.\nThe level of seven yuan to the dollar has no economic significance, but could revive U.S. attention to the exchange rate.\nThe People's Bank of China, which keeps the currency in a narrow range,\u00a0blamed the decline on \"trade protectionism,\" a reference to Trump's tariff hikes in a fight over Beijing's trade surplus and technology policies.\nTrump's tariff hikes have put downward pressure on the yuan by fuelling fears economic growth might weaken.\nThey've also forced down markets worldwide as investors brace for volatility amid the trade tensions. Last week was one of the worst of the year for stocks.\u00a0\nU.S. President Trump slammed China's decision to let its yuan currency breach the key seven-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade, calling it \"a major violation\" and jabbing the U.S. central bank.\nChina dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It\u2019s called \u201ccurrency manipulation.\u201d Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!\n\"China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It's called 'currency manipulation.' Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!\" Trump tweeted.\nThe president has been critical of the U.S. Fed for not making a big enough cut to interest rates last week.\n\"The thought of a currency war is crossing more than a few traders' minds,\" Stephen Innes of VM Markets said in a report. \u00a0 The prospect of heightened U.S.-China trade tension sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling\u00a0throughout the day Monday.\nChina has not yet used all the tools in its arsenal in this trade war. State media were reporting\u00a0that China has not ruled out slapping tariffs on agricultural products from the U.S. bought since Aug. 3.\u00a0 Reuters says the Commerce Ministry has told Chinese companies to stop buying U.S. agricultural\u00a0products.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department declined in May to label China a currency manipulator but said it was closely watching Beijing.\nChinese leaders have promised to avoid \"competitive devaluation\" to boost exports by making them less expensive abroad. But regulators say they are\u00a0trying to make the state-controlled exchange rate more responsive to market forces, which are pushing the yuan lower.\nThe yuan, also known as the renminbi, or \"people's money,\" has lost four per cent since hitting a high in February of 6.6862 to the dollar.\nThat helps exporters cope with tariffs of up to 25 per cent imposed by Trump on billions of dollars of Chinese goods. But it raises the risk of inflaming American complaints.\nTrump rattled financial markets Thursday by announcing plans for 10 per cent\u00a0tariffs on $300 billion US of Chinese goods, effective Sept. 1. That would extend penalty duties to almost all U.S. imports from China.\nChina's central bank sets the yuan's exchange rate each morning and allows it to fluctuate by two per cent against the dollar during the day. The central bank can buy or sell currency \u2014 or order Chinese commercial banks to do so \u2014 to dampen price movements.\nThe Treasury report in May said U.S. authorities believe direct central bank intervention this year \"has been limited.\" However, it urged Beijing to \"take the necessary steps to avoid a persistently weak currency.\"\nA weaker yuan also might disrupt Chinese efforts to shore up weakening economic growth by encouraging an outflow of capital from the world's second-largest economy. That would raise borrowing costs.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Dianne Buckner", "title": "When grocery stores are the only game in town, even entrepreneurs turn into employees", "description": "Leadership coaches, fashion designers jump at chance to deliver groceries, wash down produce", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/grocery-industry-hiring-covid-1.5532391", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5533064.1586968018!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-essential-workers.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 15, 2020 3:11 PM ET", "2020-04-15T21:08:18.115Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canada's supermarkets are scooping up new staff, hiring steadily to meet the\u00a0growing demand for their essential service at a time when everyone has to eat at home and many want their groceries delivered.\nThat need for more staff, combined with the staggering job losses in other parts of the Canadian economy, has resulted in new recruits who never imagined they'd be thrilled to wash down produce\u00a0or deliver\u00a0boxes of groceries.\n\"Thank God I accepted the job,\" said Richard Lyle, a 51-year-old fashion designer and boutique owner in Toronto who has been delivering groceries full-time since he was forced to close his own store.\n\"The money I'm making is allowing us to pay our mortgage, pay our property tax, pay our utilities\u00a0and pay for our food.\"\nScott Graham of Brantford, Ont., normally runs his own company, teaching leadership and anti-bullying programs in schools across Canada \u2014 schools that have now moved their teaching online because of the coronavirus.\nHe's 57\u00a0but just started a new job in the produce department at Goodness Me!, an Ontario-based chain of 10 natural food markets.\n\"The manager was showing me how to keep celery alive, and he asked me if I've ever done anything like this before,\" said Graham. \"I told him, 'Never.'\"\nHis business normally brings in around $400,000 a year while his three-day-a-week grocery job pays $14 an hour. But Graham stresses that he sees the part-time job as his opportunity to give back to the community during a crisis.\nHe's already been able to bring some added value to the position, he says, using his own expertise.\n\"I was talking to one of the other managers today, and she said she's new in her role, she's starting to learn about leadership. I was able to give her a few tips.\"\nIn addition to the need for more staff to accommodate increased demand, maintain hygiene and service deliveries, supermarkets are also having to replace employees who are unable to work because of the coronavirus.\nSome supermarket employees are ill with COVID-19\u00a0themselves\u00a0or are caring for family members who've contracted the virus. Others are too afraid to go to work or are isolating at home because of potential exposure to the virus.\n\"We've had reports of a number of employees choosing to stay at home, especially following some of the payroll measures that were announced federally,\" said Diane Brisebois, president\u00a0of the Retail Council of Canada, an organization that includes large\u00a0supermarket chains\u00a0and smaller independents among its members.\nAccording to the last census, the grocery sector employs more than 400,000 people, and while\u00a0it's hard to quantify how many more the industry needs at the moment, there is \"absolutely\" a growing need for more staff, Brisebois said.\nStores can't afford to be concerned about previous experience.\n\"Most grocers want to ensure that their employees are healthy, so that may mean adding more shifts so that people have time to re-energize, replenish and rest. That means more staff,\" she said.\nWATCH | How essential employees such as grocery store workers are coping with the virus:\nThe risks the virus poses to any essential workers\u00a0interacting with the public are real.\u00a0Late last month, a 48-year old manager\u00a0at a\u00a0Real Superstore in Oshawa, Ont., became one of the youngest people in the province to succumb to the virus \u2014 although it's not clear where he contracted it.\nIn the U.S., the Washington Post reported on the weekend that more than 40 grocery store employees have died and more than 1,500 have tested positive.\nIn recognition of the added strain\u00a0the pandemic has put on staff, Loblaw increased compensation for employees at its 2,500\u00a0stores and more than two dozen distribution centres by about 15 per cent last month, retroactive to March 8.\nThe temporary pay bump was intended to acknowledge employees'\u00a0\"outstanding and ongoing efforts keeping our stores open and operating so effectively,\" Galen Weston, executive chairman of the company, said in a statement, March 21, two days before the chain's first COVID-19 case was confirmed\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 at the Real Superstore in Oshawa, which is owned by Loblaw.\nSobeys also instituted a \"hero pay program\" retroactive to March 8,\u00a0paying all employees an additional $50 a week as well as an additional $2 an hour premium for every hour above 20 hours week.\nMike Saysell,\u00a0manager of Thrifty Foods in Duncan, B.C., says he's hired 37 new employees since March 10, many with no experience in the grocery business.\n\"We've had so many people come into our store and ask how they can help,\" he said. \"They say, 'You guys are on the front line, we know you're in a high-traffic area with a lot of customers, and we want to help our neighbours.'\n\"They're not necessarily trying to bring their skills and experience;\u00a0they're just bringing their desire to help. I couldn't be more proud of them.\"\nCourtney Friesen, 27, is one of the new hires at Thrifty Foods. She had been working as a server at Duncan's York Street Diner for five years, but the restaurant shut down mid-March, when the province went into lockdown mode.\n\"I never imagined I'd work in a grocery store,\" she said. \"Not that there's anything wrong with that. I just have a strong passion for serving, and I've always done that and loved doing that.\"\nHer first-day jitters at the new job weren't the usual ones about taking on unfamiliar duties. She was thinking about the risk of contracting the virus in a busy supermarket.\n\"Obviously, before coming to my first shift, there was a bit of worry. But when I got here, we went through all the safety protocols the store has in place, and now, I can honestly say I feel very safe coming here.\"\nSobeys is the parent company of Thrifty and, like many large chains, it has implemented safety measures that include limiting the number of people in the store, hand-washing for employees every 15 minutes, plexiglass shields for cashiers and extra staff to wipe down shopping carts.\nFriesen says her parents are \"totally OK\" with her decision to keep working.\n\"We're just not spending time together because I'm a bit more exposed than they are, but they're super proud of me for taking this on\u00a0and not staying at home and claiming EI.\"\nSaysell says customers appreciate seeing familiar faces working in the store.\n\"It's such a small community that you know\u00a0people as neighbours or from community events or the soccer fields,\" he said \"We're hiring every week, and we're getting people from all walks of life. We need more heroes.\"\nWATCH | Some grocery workers fed up with customers ignoring social distancing:\nLyle\u00a0and his partner,\u00a0Jennifer Halchuk, had to close their Toronto clothing boutique Gaspard in mid-March. Some online purchases are coming in from regular customers, but it's not enough, Lyle says.\n\"People say, 'Oh, look at all the money you can't spend during a lockdown, you'll be OK.' But you know what? The bills keep coming. The postman drops them in the box every day.\"\nLyle is working for Summerhill Markets, a chain of three upscale grocery stores, delivering grocery orders mostly to seniors. He's paid a daily rate along with an allowance for gasoline.\n\"It's physically exhausting,\" he said. \"A delivery may contain nine boxes, and I'm carrying them back and forth. But every night we ask ourselves, 'Can you imagine if we didn't have this?' We don't want to come out of it and be more in debt. That would be the worst.\"\nHe says he's incredibly thankful to the store's owners for hiring him\u00a0and to the friend who recommended him for the position.\n\"Is my ego ready to let the world know that I'm a grocery delivery boy?\" he said. \"I worked in catering and restaurants in my early life, so I'm not ashamed or embarrassed to be doing this job. I'm grateful.\"\nGraham says his desire to work in the grocery business was less about maintaining some form of income and more about his desire to stay busy.\n\"It's very important for me to feel I'm contributing and involved,\" he said. \"I'm very social. I think it's an important service that has to continue, so I don't focus on the health risk. I think mental health is very important, too, and I take all the necessary precautions. I'm doing everything that's mandated.\"\nIn time, many of these temporary grocery workers will be able to return to their regular jobs. When that time comes, it will be an indicator that life is returning to normal \u2014 not just\u00a0for them but for\u00a0the grocery stores as well.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null,

in the city.\n\"There's a big gap right now because evictions aren't actually recorded anywhere,\" Jacobs told host Gloria Macarenko on CBC's On The Coast.\u00a0\nMany evictions simply require a landlord serving notice to a tenant. It's only when eviction cases proceed\u00a0to the dispute resolution stage that the residential tenancy branch starts tracking information.\u00a0\nThe Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing\u00a0says the\u00a0residential tenancy branch does post arbitrators' decisions\u00a0about eviction cases\u00a0online. However,\u00a0information about individual renters or landlords \u2014 unless they are large companies \u2014 is\u00a0withheld for privacy reasons.\nJacobs says the union is asking the community to submit their own eviction experiences to get around this gap.\u00a0\nHe says, for one, the group will be\u00a0partnering with legal advocacy groups that already work on the front lines. When tenants get evicted, they would be referred to a tracking portal that would get reported to the database.\u00a0\nJacobs says once all the information\u00a0is compiled, the union\u00a0will process and analyze the data.\nHe says the database can then be used to help tenants by identifying specific risk factors, such as\u00a0whether a landlord has applied for a development permit or building permit recently or whether rents are substantially below market rate.\u00a0\n\"If we can categorize the types of risk factors that precipitate an eviction before it happens, we can reach out to folks in high risk areas and educate them of their rights and that the [residential tenancy branch] exists,\" he said.\u00a0\nJacobs says he understands there might be concerns around the creation of an eviction database\u00a0\u2014 particularly because this data is \"very, very sensitive and private.\"\u00a0\n\"It's very, very important that this data doesn't get into the wrong hands.\"\nUltimately, he says,\u00a0the group is simply trying to increase tenures and help people stay put and prevent displacement.\n\"People deserve to set roots down and have a home.\"\nA statement from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing says it is also working toward a more equitable housing environment, pointing to its newly formed Compliance and Enforcement Unit.\u00a0\n\"The [unit] is making sure both landlords and renters understand and follow the rules and is taking strong action against serious offenders, including proactively initiating investigations.\"\nListen to the segment on CBC's On the Coast:\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/665509955917", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/665797699963", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Tanya Fletcher", "title": "Province not prepared to ease policies as housing market sputters", "description": "Vancouver homeowners cite rising taxes, falling equity; NDP argues moderation is improving affordability", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/province-not-yet-prepared-to-ease-policies-as-housing-market-sputters-1.5144280", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4999941.1562873249!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancouver.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 23, 2019 4:00 AM PT", "2019-05-23T20:49:04.283Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Housing measures designed to stabilize the distorted real estate\u00a0market have gone too far, according to lifelong Vancouver resident Ric Pow.\u00a0He and his wife\u00a0are selling the Point Grey house\u00a0they've lived in for 17 years\u00a0\u2014 and not by choice, he claims.\n\"In 2002 when we moved in, our taxes were about $5,000,\" he said. \"We just got our tax assessment for this year and it's going to be $30,000.\u00a0Frankly, that's money we just can't afford.\"\nPow, 66, says\u00a0they've been forced to defer the taxes on\u00a0their $4.2-million\u00a0home,\u00a0which has dropped in value\u00a030 per cent in\u00a0the past 18 months.\n\"Part of our retirement plan has always been that we would take equity out of the home for us to survive,\" he said. \"So our entire retirement savings is down 30 per cent.\"\nPow is joining some other Vancouver homeowners\u00a0in blaming\u00a0an\u00a0array of government policies\u00a0for driving down home equity, including\u00a0new\u00a0provincial\u00a0taxes \u2014 school tax, foreign home-buyers tax, speculation and vacancy tax\u2014\u00a0along with\u00a0the federal mortgage stress test.\n\"A cooling off of the market would be fine, meaning that\u00a0house prices stopped going up,\" he said. \"But this is not a cooling off, this is causing house prices to crash.\"\nB.C.

similar position about a decade ago.\u00a0\n\"You saw\u00a0people not able to close on their pre-sale obligations, that goes back to the developer, then the developer has to pay out the lenders, etc.\" he said. \"So it could potentially unravel a bit if market conditions continue the way they are.\"\nSaretsky\u00a0believes\u00a0a \"multitude of factors\" have contributed to Metro Vancouver's stalling market.\n\"The government intervention has certainly exacerbated the downturn, but\u00a0it's not just provincially \u2014\u00a0the mortgage stress test, higher interest rates \u2014\u00a0they're all going to have an impact,\" he said. \"They're\u00a0all working together to really slow down the housing market here.\"\nHe added the issue has become highly politicized.\n\"You have two sides of the coin where people who are already in the market are obviously upset that the values are coming down and losing some equity, and then you have the other side with people that are maybe locked out, or that have kids and want them to grow up in Vancouver and they're more happy about the changes.\"\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url":

got our tax assessment for this year and it's going to be $30,000.\u00a0Frankly, that's money we just can't afford.\"\nPow, 66, says\u00a0they've been forced to defer the taxes on\u00a0their $4.2-million\u00a0home,\u00a0which has dropped in value\u00a030 per cent in\u00a0the past 18 months.\n\"Part of our retirement plan has always been that we would take equity out of the home for us to survive,\" he said. \"So our entire retirement savings is down 30 per cent.\"\nPow is joining some other Vancouver homeowners\u00a0in blaming\u00a0an\u00a0array of government policies\u00a0for driving down home equity, including\u00a0new\u00a0provincial\u00a0taxes \u2014 school tax, foreign home-buyers tax, speculation and vacancy tax\u2014\u00a0along with\u00a0the federal mortgage stress test.\n\"A cooling off of the market would be fine, meaning that\u00a0house prices stopped going up,\" he said. \"But this is not a cooling off, this is causing house prices to crash.\"\nB.C.

poverty rates increased by 2.2 per cent because the financial cut-off used to define low-income was raised.\nExperts suggest that a plan by Statistics Canada to recalculate the threshold by changing the \"market basket measure\" early next year could lead to a similar bump in poverty rates.\nThe measure calculates the minimum a person or family would have to earn to afford a basket of goods and services needed to reach a modest or basic living standard.\nThe Liberals adopted the measure as the country's official poverty line last year and set aside $12 million over five years to update the basket, which currently doesn't include things like wireless services.\nIn July, the top official at Employment and Social Development Canada and the minister at the time were told federal officials would decide \"on the actions to be taken\" with Statistics Canada's recommendations \u2014 including which to implement\u00a0and which to send for more research.\nA final report from Statistics Canada is expected in February.\nThe Canadian Press obtained copies of the briefing notes under the access-to-information law.\nStatistics Canada has published reports outlining possible updates to the cost of items in the basket of goods and services, as well as \"disposable income\" thresholds \u2014 how much income a family has left over after accounting for taxes and payroll deductions.\nA family or individual would be considered in poverty if the basket of goods strips away too much of their disposable income.\nOther updates proposed by Statistics Canada include reflecting changes to the national food guide in the cost of food, and updating transportation costs to reflect census data showing that while some low-income earners take public transit, others drive.\nThe agency also has suggested excluding capital gains taxes when calculating disposable income to avoid families \"appearing to be in poverty\" from a hefty tax bill, and putting homeowners with a mortgage and people in subsidized housing on \"more equal footing\" with renters when determining who is in poverty.\u200b\u200b\u200b\nGarima Talwar Kapoor, director of policy and research at the charitable foundation Maytree, said the cost of housing, for instance, has gone up faster in the last 10 years than earnings, which could drive up\u00a0the percentage of Canadians living in poverty.\nShe said a similar effect happened in the 2008 update, when costs rose faster than incomes.\n\"That trend is continuing,\" Kapoor said. \"The growth in costs is so much faster than the average income ... which would therefore translate to a higher poverty level.\"\nChanges to measuring poverty would likely result in an increase not only in the percentage of people in poverty but a slight increase in the raw numbers as well, Kapoor said.\nThe Liberals have said that, on their watch, more than 800,000 people \u2014 including some 280,000 children\u00a0\u2014 have been lifted out of poverty, and rates have dropped by about 20 per cent of where they were in 2015. The figures are key benchmarks \u2014 politically and from a policy perspective \u2014\u00a0to track the path of the government's anti-poverty strategy.\nIglika Ivanova, a senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, doesn't foresee a revamped poverty line shifting Canada off the recent decrease in poverty rates.\nThe changes could drop those just above the line into poverty with no material changes to their circumstances, she said.\nUpdates to the measurement will help identify the financial pressure points for people in poverty, which in turn would help governments set anti-poverty plans, she said.\n\"It's just important to keep updating these things because sometimes they are used to say we've done enough by the government \u2014\u00a0provincial or federal.\"\n"}, {"author": "Sarah Rieger", "title": "Oil prices take biggest plunge in decades, taking another bite out of reeling Alberta", "description": "Alberta Premier Kenney, with softened tone, shifts emphasis from restraint to protection of economy, jobs", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/oil-prices-1.5490535", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5462831.1583767653!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pumpjack-oil-alberta.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 08, 2020 4:36 PM MT", "2020-03-10T17:11:03.481Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Oil prices dropped dramatically on Monday and\u00a0Canadian energy companies were sold off hard, meaning an already bruised Alberta is bracing for more pain.\nBy the close of trading on Monday, Suncor's share price had dropped down nearly 18 per cent,\u00a0CNRL plunged more than 29 per cent and\u00a0Cenovus lost more than half of its value \u2014 51.65 per cent.\nThe plunging oil prices sent shock waves through an already hurting Alberta and landed just over a week after the\u00a0UCP\u00a0government introduced a budget that relies heavily on the well-being of the energy sector. Premier\u00a0Jason Kenney\u00a0spoke after markets closed, shifting his government's emphasis on restraint to the protection of the economy and jobs \u2014 even if that means spending\u00a0\u2014 and said the UCP would consider a number of options. Opposition Leader Rachel Notley's NDP demanded the UCP withdraw its budget.\nThe latest crisis\u00a0started Friday, when OPEC tried to get Russia to agree to production caps in order to stabilize oil prices. When Russia refused, Saudi Arabia opened the taps, increased supply and contributed to the price crash.\u00a0\nNorth American stock markets were halted shortly after opening on Monday morning as circuit breakers designed to slow down panic selling kicked in within minutes.\nThe panic started on Sunday evening after Saudi Arabia kicked off the\u00a0all-out price war in the oil market.\nThat move sent the price of crude tumbling more than 25 per cent, and came on top of existing fears over the coronavirus currently spreading around the world.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude\u00a0finished the day down $10.26 US to $31.02 US a barrel. Western Canadian Select closed\u00a0at $17.80 US,\u00a0down $10.08.\nIt was the largest single-day drop since the beginning of the Gulf War in\u00a01991.\nDemand for energy is falling as people cut back on travel around the world. The worry is that the\u00a0coronavirus outbreak will slow economies sharply, meaning even less demand.\n\"We're seeing the outcome of a one-two punch in terms of a demand shock from the coronavirus \u2026 and on top of that this weekend's news of a price war started after the breakdown of OPEC plus Russia arrangements,\" said Blake Shaffer, an assistant professor of economics and public policy at University of Calgary.\nShaffer said the demand-side drop was expected but the more recent development of a price war is a supply-side issue that's hammering the market.\nThe oil market has seen arguments like this before. In 2014, OPEC held off production cuts in order to hold onto market share in the face of a resurgent U.S. oil industry. That led oil to tumble from over $100 US a barrel to below $40 by 2015.\nBut experts say this drop is much more dramatic.\n\"This is a really big move. I was an energy trader for 15 years.\u00a0I don't have all the daily moves in my head, but this would definitely be one of the biggest ones I've seen,\" Shaffer said.\nMartin Pelletier, a portfolio manager with Trivest Wealth Council in Calgary, said this is a \"nuclear-sized event\" for an already-hurting Alberta, and if not contained, the economic malaise could spread to the rest of the country.\n\"This could be the knock-out punch for Alberta, unfortunately,\" Pelletier said, adding that some companies might not survive the hit.\n\"We're going to really need to see some leadership coming out of Ottawa, and I mean both the Bank of Canada and [Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau and the government \u2026 This is a crisis;\u00a0this is a very serious event.\"\nPelletier said he'd like to see both a large fiscal spending program tailored to impacted provinces and an emergency rate cut.\nRichard Masson, the chair of the World Petroleum Council, said some Canadian companies are in a better spot than their U.S. counterparts because of a pipeline crunch that has forced them to contain growth, pay down debts and look for efficiencies.\u00a0\nStill, he too thinks the federal government needs to get involved to prevent a crisis, as financing continues to dry up.\u00a0\n\"We're going to need some support, or we're going to lose a lot of our native companies, and we won't be able to bounce back when prices recover,\" said Masson.\n\"One of the things they're probably going to have to look at is can they provide loans to companies to get them through?\"\nThe Alberta government's recent spring budget forecasts WTI will average $58 US a barrel in the coming year, and Shaffer said this is bad news both for the economy as a whole and for the province's royalty revenues.\n\"Roughly every dollar [per barrel] is about $350 million to the government \u2026 We're talking about a $7 billion decline in revenue expectations,\" Shaffer said, adding that about $2 billion is made up from the improved differential and the Canadian dollar, so the net hit would be about $5 billion.\nThe weight of that impact softened the fiery tone of Alberta Premier\u00a0Jason Kenney.\u00a0\nJust over a week ago, his United Conservative Party government introduced a budget that relies heavily on the well-being of the energy sector.\u00a0\nSpeaking in Calgary on Monday just after markets closed with cratering oil prices threatening to drain billions of dollars from the province's bottom line, the premier shifted from an emphasis on restraint to the protection of the economy and jobs \u2014 even if that means spending.\nThe premier said the Alberta government would look at a\u00a0range of choices that include borrowing money for more capital\u00a0spending to boost jobs, a return to tax incentives to lure high-tech\u00a0startups and directly subsidizing a barrel of oil.\n\"Our priority is protecting jobs. Our priority is protecting the economy,\" he said.\n\"If that means we need to borrow money to make that happen, we will do so.\"\nKenney said he would appoint a panel of experts led by economist Jack Mintz\u00a0with the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary \u2014 who also sits on the board of directors of Imperial Oil \u2014 on how to navigate the economic storm.\u00a0\n\"All options will be on the table. I repeat: all options will be on the table to do everything that we can within our capacity to help protect jobs and Albertans,\" said Kenney.\nHe\u00a0wants the federal government to step up as well.\n\"This is not just about Alberta. As Alberta goes, so goes the national economy,\" Kenney said.\nKenney is to meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday at the first ministers meeting in Ottawa.\nHe said he'll be asking for a range of relief measures, including financial incentives to help create jobs in reclaiming orphan wells, changes to payroll taxes and removal of a cap on fiscal stabilization transfers that would return about $2.6 billion to Alberta.\nKenney, saying now is not the time for partisan politics, said he'll be reaching out to rival politicians, including Opposition NDP Leader Rachel Notley, for advice.\nEarlier in the day,\u00a0Notley called for an immediate reconsideration of the provincial budget, in consultation with her NDP.\nNotley\u00a0said the budget was based on \"irresponsibly optimistic\" oil forecasts and that the UCP government tossed away programs meant to encourage economic diversification that she wants reinstated.\n\"Now more than ever, we know how important that task is and we are all reminded what a necessity it is,\" she said.\nNotley also called\u00a0on the federal government to step in and help the province though actions like lifting the cap on the fiscal stabilization program, designed to buoy sagging provincial economies.\u00a0\nNotley said the low prices will conservatively send the projected deficit for 2020-21 to almost $11 billion from $6.8 billion.\nShe said Kenney has left Alberta vulnerable by slashing corporate income taxes last year and using wildly optimistic oil revenue projections in the budget.\nShe also said Kenney was wrong when his government dismantled tax incentives last fall designed to lure more diversified businesses, including high-tech companies, to Alberta.\n\"Premier Kenney's belief in his corporate (tax) handout has always been magical thinking, but today it has been exposed as pure fantasy,\" said Notley.\n\"It would be profoundly irresponsible for the premier to press forward with this budget when the assumptions it is built on have been proven to be false.\"\nKenney said he will not be withdrawing his budget. He noted it's three weeks until the end of the fiscal year and said the province needs a budget in place. He said the government will revisit projections in the summer when the fiscal situation becomes clearer.\nKenney also resisted Notley's call to revisit an almost three per cent cut to operational spending. He said it remains a realistic goal given that Alberta spends more per capita than comparable jurisdictions.\nAlbertans pay the lowest overall taxes in Canada and there is no provincial sales tax. Both Kenney and Notley dismissed any increases, saying it would be catastrophic to an already hurting economy.\nKenney's UCP won last April's election on a promise to focus on revitalizing oil and gas while eradicating a string of multibillion-dollar deficits and getting the rising debt under control.\nAt the time, Kenney criticized the NDP for what he characterized as mismanaging the economy by borrowing billions of dollars, thereby running up debt interest payments that would cripple future generations.\nKenney said last week that his government's goal of balancing the books by 2023 might not happen.\nSome experts are predicting even lower numbers could be on the way.\nAli Khedery, a former Exxon adviser and now CEO of strategy firm Dragoman Ventures, tweeted \"$20 oil in 2020 is coming\" after news broke of Saudi Arabia's plans to hike production.\nShaffer said seeing such a wide difference in price forecasts after the province's budget dropped just weeks ago makes a strong case for the government to change how royalty revenues are budgeted and push for further economic diversification.\n\"If this is prolonged, you'll see continued job layoffs and effects on families. One of the really important things I'll stress is having an economy that isn't dependent on the outcome of a price war between the Saudis and the Russians \u2026. I hope it's yet another wake-up call in terms of the efforts to diversify our economy,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Getting past the senior stereotypes: U of A researcher says attitudes need to mature", "description": "As population ages, discrimination based on age will cause increasing harm", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/ageism-study-university-of-alberta-donna-wilson-1.5138896", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2807125.1561401535!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/retirement.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 16, 2019 1:16 PM MT", "2019-05-16T19:16:57.907Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It's a stereotype as old as the hills: hit 65 and your body falls apart, your health gets dodgy and your value in society plummets.\nBut it's not a stereotype that is well studied and, as the population increasingly skews to the plus side of 65, that's a problem, says a University of Alberta researcher and nursing professor.\n\"We don't know at this point how bad old age discrimination is,\" Donna Wilson told CBC Radio's Edmonton AM on Thursday.\n\"How many 50-year-olds have been laid off in our oilpatch recession and how many of them have not been able to find work because they have grey hair and because there's a belief that, well, they're kind of old-fashioned, they're not up-to-date on new things, they'll cost us too much and they'll be sick?\u00a0So why hire them.\"\nWilson, along with Gail Low, an associate nursing professor at the U of A, did a study examining\u00a0what is currently known about the prevalence of ageism in society.\nThe\u00a0review of all existing studies on the topic, published this month in Ageing Research Reviews, found that 48 to 91 per cent of all older people surveyed experienced ageism, while 50 to 98 per cent of all younger people admitted having discriminatory thoughts or behaviours toward older people.\nBut the bigger takeaway was that of the 25 measurements identified in the studies\u00a0done all over the world, only six looked at the prevalence of this form of discrimination.

And that's a big concern right now because we have an aging population, a\u00a0very rapidly aging population,\" she said.\nIt is expected that the percentage of Canadians aged 65 and over will rise from 19 per cent of the current population to 26 per cent of the population in 2030.\nThis is caused by two things: a decline in the birth rate following the post-war baby boom\u00a0and\u00a0the vast majority of people\u00a0now living to become \"old.\"\nAccording to Wilson's report, centenarians are the fastest growing sub-population group in Canada, followed by citizens aged 85 through 99.\nThese types of statistics are worrisome to those who foresee an incoming strain on health-care systems\u00a0but, Wilson said, those fears aren't founded in reality.\n\"Eighty per cent of the people admitted to hospitals in Alberta are under the age of 65, and 95 per cent of people admitted to emergency departments are under the age of 65,\" she said.\nOnly about three per cent of older Canadians are so chronically ill that they require a nursing home, she added. \u00a0\n\"So we've got facts telling us that we shouldn't be concerned about older people and their health, but we look at one or two [ill] people and we think that's the way it is for everyone.\"\nWilson said it is important to begin delving deeper into the prevalence of ageism in order to build enough information that governments can eventually act on, as Britain did in 2010 with its Equality Act.\nThe World Health Organization agrees more information is necessary and offers people a chance to test their own attitudes with an online quiz. Wilson said she hopes everyone, regardless of age, takes the quiz to see where they stand.\nThe first of the true-or-false statements is \"All older people are the same.\"\n\"What are your beliefs about old people and then think about what you are doing to perpetuate this age discrimination,\" Wilson\u00a0said.\n\"Someone with grey hair and some wrinkles, do you automatically think they are senile and treat them that way? Or they're old and disabled and treat them that way? Or do you treat them like a regular person.\"\nGaining self-awareness is important not just to how you treat others but also to how you will eventually see yourself, she said.\n\"If you believe that old people are useless and worthless, you self-internalize that.

And that's a big concern right now because we have an aging population, a\u00a0very rapidly aging population,\" she said.\nIt is expected that the percentage of Canadians aged 65 and over will rise from 19 per cent of the current population to 26 per cent of the population in 2030.\nThis is caused by two things: a decline in the birth rate following the post-war baby boom\u00a0and\u00a0the vast majority of people\u00a0now living to become \"old.\"\nAccording to Wilson's report, centenarians are the fastest growing sub-population group in Canada, followed by citizens aged 85 through 99.\nThese types of statistics are worrisome to those who foresee an incoming strain on health-care systems\u00a0but, Wilson said, those fears aren't founded in reality.\n\"Eighty per cent of the people admitted to hospitals in Alberta are under the age of 65, and 95 per cent of people admitted to emergency departments are under the age of 65,\" she said.\nOnly about three per cent of older Canadians are so chronically ill that they require a nursing home, she added. \u00a0\n\"So we've got facts telling us that we shouldn't be concerned about older people and their health, but we look at one or two [ill] people and we think that's the way it is for everyone.\"\nWilson said it is important to begin delving deeper into the prevalence of ageism in order to build enough information that governments can eventually act on, as Britain did in 2010 with its Equality Act.\nThe World Health Organization agrees more information is necessary and offers people a chance to test their own attitudes with an online quiz. Wilson said she hopes everyone, regardless of age, takes the quiz to see where they stand.\nThe first of the true-or-false statements is \"All older people are the same.\"\n\"What are your beliefs about old people and then think about what you are doing to perpetuate this age discrimination,\" Wilson\u00a0said.\n\"Someone with grey hair and some wrinkles, do you automatically think they are senile and treat them that way? Or they're old and disabled and treat them that way? Or do you treat them like a regular person.\"\nGaining self-awareness is important not just to how you treat others but also to how you will eventually see yourself, she said.\n\"If you believe that old people are useless and worthless, you self-internalize that.

And these things cannot be known\u00a0until they are known.\"\nThe number of people around the world infected with the novel coronavirus topped 100,000 Friday, with 54 confirmed and presumptive cases in Canada.\u00a0Health officials in B.C. are investigating after a woman tested positive for the illness who had no history of travel to regions dealing with coronavirus outbreaks and hadn't been in contact with COVID-19 patients. It's Canada's\u00a0first apparent case of coronavirus spread within the community.\nMorneau said Canada already is seeing impacts on commodity prices (including\u00a0oil and metals) and the tourism industry, (including\u00a0air transportation, retail, hotels and restaurants) and is feeling the hit to\u00a0global supply chains, especially in Asia.\nWATCH: Joly describes a drop in Chinese tourism\nMinister of Tourism\u00a0M\u00e9lanie Joly\u00a0said\u00a0Chinese tourism is normally worth $2 billion yearly for Canada, but she expects it to drop by $550 million by June.\n\"The tourism industry is deeply affected,\" she said Friday. \"The duty-free boutique at the Vancouver airport is down 50 per cent of its revenues.\"\nThe spread of the virus has left sport stadiums empty in Asia. This week, public health officials in California recommended that large gatherings such as sporting events be cancelled\u00a0\u2014 although the\u00a0San Jose Sharks opted to keep the stands open for their Thursday night\u00a0game.\nHajdu said that in Canada, those decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis by provincial and local governments with guidance from Health Canada.\n\"If the virus is not circulating in the community, that jurisdiction may decide to go ahead and hold the event. But that also might depend on the number of international travellers that they expect as well, or travellers in this case maybe from the United States,\" said during a\u00a0news conference in Montreal.\nWATCH:\u00a0Hajdu on COVID-19 and big public events\n\"Make no mistake, they are thinking about those things. We are thinking about those things through the lens of the federal events that we'll be hosting, as well as things like our tourism season that is coming up and how we protect communities from an influx of visitors that may create additional health stresses for communities that are are struggling with health services.\"\nHajdu was at the\u00a0Universit\u00e9 Laval\u00a0Friday to announce that the\u00a0federal government will make $27 million available to\u00a047 Canadian research teams to develop\u00a0diagnostic tools and vaccines, and to create\u00a0strategies to tackle misinformation, stigma and fear.\nWorld Health Organization Assistant Director-General Bruce Aylward, who hails from Newfoundland and Labrador, praised Canada's response to date.\n\"Canada has done a pretty exemplary job. You know you've had cases in three different provinces, multiple importations and most of these you've been able to contain very, very rapidly. There's not a lot of advice to be given to Canada. It's a lot of, 'Well on,'\" he told CBC Radio's The House.\nHe said one of the most important things for governments to do is keep citizens informed.\n\"You don't need to alarm them. You don't need to sugarcoat it. But they need to know how severe it is, or can be, so that they're going to engage properly,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "All eyes on Canadian jobs numbers as election heads into 5th week: Don Pittis", "description": "Still few signs of Canadian recession, but this week's data may tell us more", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/jobs-economy-election-1.5298115", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309380.1570212742!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/now-hiring-cafe-at-st-lawrence-market-toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 07, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-10-08T16:40:39.065Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When Canada's jobs numbers come out on Friday there will only be 10 days before Canadians vote in the federal election.\nThose who are already a little sick of wall-to-wall election coverage may find that an encouraging milestone. But for politicians who have made the welfare of voters\u00a0a key plank in their platforms,\u00a0the fresh\u00a0data may give them new fodder to boast or complain about the state of the Canadian economy.\nQuite apart from the election, the latest\u00a0statistics come at a time of conflicting signals about the direction of Canadian, U.S.\u00a0and global growth.\nDire warnings from merely a few weeks ago that markets were about to\u00a0crash\u00a0and a feeling that the economy was heading into a recessionary tailspin have since dissipated, though a background wariness remains.\nLast Wednesday's market conniption was only the latest evidence of lingering worries that likely aren't over yet.\nCanadian gross domestic product numbers last week showed the economy was flat. That's a big change from the previous reading when the Canadian economy was still revelling in the impact of the Toronto Raptors win, and GDP indicated economic growth of\u00a03.7 per cent, a startlingly strong number in a low-growth world.\nAs I write about growth as a good thing, I feel a certain conflict after reporting recently\u00a0on Greta Thunberg and\u00a0the necessity of learning to live well in a low-growth world.\u00a0Evidently, like many others, I have not yet internalized that mental shift.\nFor good or ill, the economic growth figures for July offered\u00a0plenty of\u00a0signs that people were shopping more and gobbling up more in services. The hit to the economy came specifically in oil and gas, and within that sector the principal\u00a0blame fell on a sharp drop in production from the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore due to rig maintenance.\nOne confusing aspect of GDP figures \u2014 besides making us ponder\u00a0whether they are a sign of a planet in trouble \u2014 is that they are always out of date. Like seeing light from a distant planet, the data we are observing represents events that have already happened, and things\u00a0may have changed since.\nJust as the numbers that came out in August told us about the economy\u00a0Canadians were experiencing two months previous, last week's growth numbers reflect conditions in early summer before the mid-August gloom had arrived. As mentioned in the past, a little gloom can make people rein in spending, effectively compounding the effects of a slowing economy.\nCanada's deep connections to the U.S. economy\u00a0mean that chill winds there can blow north, and updated business investment figures released by the Commerce Department two weeks ago showed a sharper decline.\n\"The trade war is threatening the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year,\" reported the business wire service Reuters.\nBut since that report, the\u00a0picture has turned brighter, especially after Friday's trade data\u00a0and U.S. unemployment figures that hit a stunning new low.\nOn Friday we learned that the Canadian trade gap narrowed\u00a0and perhaps more important\u00a0the U.S. economy is still cranking out jobs.\u00a0The unemployment rate south of the border\u00a0hit a\u00a050-year low of 3.5 per cent last month as the economy created 136,000 new jobs.\u00a0\nThe advantage of the jobs figures\u00a0that came last\u00a0Friday in the U.S. and those coming Friday in Canada is that they don't feel quite so historical as many other measures. In that way they will offer the freshest indication of whether\u00a0Canada is losing steam.\nUnlike GDP, which is painstakingly collected from many sources and gradually assembled into increasingly accurate figures as more data is accumulated, the jobs number\u00a0is based on a series of telephone surveys in the weeks before the numbers are released. That make Labour Force Survey results up-to-date, but less accurate.\nStatisticians who watch those numbers often say the accuracy of the results in any month cannot be trusted. The chart above, which\u00a0begins after the\u00a0big weather-related\u00a0plunge in job creation in February\u00a02018,\u00a0swings widely from month to month. The trend over several months would be a more truthful reflection.\nThe other thing about employment data is that it is cumulative. While a single month's survey may indicate a fall in the number of jobs, over the past year periodic\u00a0job losses\u00a0\u2014 those points below the black line\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have been dwarfed by gains in other months.\nBut that is seldom how any month's numbers are perceived when they are released, especially during an election.\nInevitably a sharp rise in monthly job creation or a fall in the unemployed will be extrapolated to say\u00a0the economy remains on an upswing. The opposite will be read as a\u00a0warning of approaching gloom.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\nNeed help preparing for election day? We've got the information you need.

But he says this could be accomplished by effectively setting \"deductibles\" and limiting coverage in such a way that would dissuade a province from \"burning down its home to collect insurance.\"\nHe proposes three possible methods to do this.\nMethod A (the least generous of his proposals) would include a five-per-cent \"deductible\" and a 50-per-cent coverage rate for losses beyond that deductible.\n\"In other words,\" Dahlby writes, \"only reductions in annual own-source revenues in excess of five per cent of the average own-source revenue over the previous five years would be eligible for a payment and only 50 per cent of that would be covered.\"\nMethod B would also include a five-per-cent deductible, but with a 75-per-cent coverage rate.\nAnd Method C would have a lower deductible\u00a0\u2014 just three per cent \u2014 along with a lower coverage rate of 66 per cent.\nDahlby calculates these methods would have resulted in much more financial support for Alberta during its recent economic downturn.\nRemember: the province received roughly $250 million under the current fiscal stabilization program in 2016.\nUnder Dahlby's proposals,\u00a0Alberta would have received $2.1 billion under Method A, $3.1 billion under Method B or $3.2 billion under Method C.\nThe following year, it would have received even more: between $2.8 billion and $4.2 billion, depending on the calculation method.\nProvinces like Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador, which also experience booms and busts related to the prices of oil and gas, would also receive more federal funds during downturns under this approach, Dahlby notes.\nHe suggests such a system would be a more effective \"insurance policy\" for provinces that rely heavily on volatile natural-resource markets and, as such, their lobbying efforts would be better directed at reforming the\u00a0stabilization program than Canada's system of equalization payments.\n\"While it is true that the equalization program needs reform, that program was never meant to help a province such as Alberta, where GDP per capita and household incomes are above the national average, even in times when its economy shrinks,\" he writes.\n\"Alberta and the other resource-rich provinces should also pressure the federal government to reform the fiscal stabilization program in order to address their concerns about the lack of federal support in the wake of the downturn in the oil and gas sector.\"\nDahlby also sits on the expert panel appointed by Premier Jason Kenney that is tasked with offering advice to the Alberta government on how to balance its budget without raising taxes.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/668703811872",

When she looked her a hotel-room-sized unit, all she could think was: \"This can't be me. This can't be the kind of place I live.\"\u00a0\nHer family had paid for the apartment's down payment and though Andresen is paying the mortgage, the arrangement left her with a lingering guilt.\n\"I was used to living in informal housing situations,\" said Andresen. \"It made me feel guilty because I related to my peers who had problems with cockroaches and mould and crazy landlords. And then here I am like the master of my own castle.\"\nAndresen said she found it particularly hard to accept because her partner Michelle Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, 30,\u00a0is a former foster child, who wouldn't\u00a0have the same opportunity.\u00a0\nHer partner has joked she has \"co-opted\" Andresen's family, and gets the benefits from being a part of it.\u00a0\n\"She enjoys that, but [the apartment] is definitely a privilege,\" said Andresen of her family's gift. \"It is unearned, undeserved, pretty much unfair.\"\nAndresen had never expected to own a home, even the small condo where she is living.\u00a0Prior to heading to Australia to finish her bachelor's degree, she said she had accepted the idea of renting for the rest of her life.\u00a0\nHer family used to live in Metro Vancouver, where housing prices have skyrocketed in the last decade \u2014 though there have been recent signs of a decline.\u00a0\nHer mother and grandparents decided to sell their homes in the midst of the boom to move to Vancouver Island. But there was enough extra to give Niki and her brother money for their down payment.\u00a0\nAndresen was still in Australia when the sale happened, and was surprised to hear her mother offering to buy her an apartment in a new city.\u00a0\nShe said initially, she didn't take the idea of owning a home too seriously. She was heading into an unpaid internship, and had to drop a paying job to take it. She said she was having trouble affording food.\nWhen her mother suggested that she'd accrue some rent money if she had an apartment, Andresen took the chance.\n\"It was a feeling of just sort of confusion and then like an acceptance because how can you turn down a gift that amazing?\" said Andresen.\u00a0\n\"Especially when I know who it's coming from and how much it matters to my family that I have a place to stay and housing security.\"\nAndresen said she's especially thankful, considering the rental vacancy rate in Victoria is just 1.2 per cent.\u00a0\nGiven the tight market, she said she's resolved to share how she purchased that apartment with anyone who asks.\u00a0\n\"I think it's important to talk about where the money comes from in the sense that it highlights who is able to access housing right now,\" said Andresen.\u00a0\nThis view is shared by Harper's Bazaar online contributor Jen Doll, who wrote about how the idea of self-made success is often a myth.\u00a0\nPeople like to believe that if you're good enough, you can start a business, buy a home, and live a great life.\u00a0\n\"What does it mean to be good enough? Generally it means that you probably have been privileged in some way or another,\" said Doll. \u00a0\n\"And if you're not that's the other thing, the other side of this. If you are really able to pretty much come from nothing and make yourself something \u2014 that deserves so much more acclaim.\"\nIn 2011, Doll faced a similar conundrum as Andresen. Her parents offered her proposition: they could give her the money for 10 per cent of a down payment in New York City now, or after they died.\u00a0\nShe took the money, bought the apartment and until recently kept quiet about how she was able to afford it. Now, she is trying to share how the story when she can, but said that finding the ideal setting for this conversation can be hard.\n\"What I pull people aside in the break room and tell them, 'Hey, guess what?'\" said Doll, imagining how she could broach the subject with colleagues. \"We don't walk around with debt and assets on our faces.\"\nMeanwhile, Andresen has been considering new ways to conceive of success, that don't favour people who have rich parents. One idea, she suggested, would be to stop viewing wealth as a measure of success altogether. In that case, big purchases, like buying a home, would no longer be seen as markers of an individual's accomplishments.\u00a0\nShe pointed to a quote by the former mayor of Bogota, Gustavo Petro: \"A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It's where the rich use public transportation.\"\nIn Canada, Andresen said, Petro's ideal is reversed.\u00a0\nAndresen said society, generally, would benefit if we shift our priorities away from material wealth and consumption.

He said\u00a0that while it is unfortunate that it has come to having school children like Greta taking to the streets to demand climate action,\u00a0they are part of what he says can \"bring the future into the present\" and prompt change.\nCarney also spoke about how fighting climate change must become a non-partisan issue:\nHe said he has seen much more spin and misinformation around climate science in his position in the U.K. than he saw while leading the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013.\u00a0\nCarney drew international recognition during his five years at the helm of the Bank of Canada, and at one point was named on Time magazine's \"most influential\" list. He took over the job at the beginning of 2008 amid the first signs of the financial crisis, and has been widely credited for helping Canada weather the recession by keeping interest rates low.\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has described Carney as \"a remarkable pioneer in pushing the financial sector to work on climate.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2682682382", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/746193987597", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Tony Davis", "title": "'Cheaper, warmer and newer': P.E.I. seniors move into new affordable building", "description": "'Some people can\u2019t afford $1,200, $1,300 a month in rent, it\u2019s crazy' ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-seniors-housing-affordable-charlottetown-1.5376032", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5376088.1574894504!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/seniors-affordable-house-charlottetown.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Nov 27, 2019 8:00 PM AT", "2019-11-28T00:00:00.613Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It was move-in day Wednesday for Vernon MacDonald and some other P.E.I. seniors.\u00a0\nHe is one of the seniors who got a spot in a new 44-unit affordable seniors' building in Charlottetown on Norwood Road.\nMacDonald said it feels great to be moving into a new home, especially something affordable.

It said the Bank of Canada will begin \"a multi-year research effort,\" as well as collaborate with domestic and international partners to build the bank's capacity to analyze climate risks.\nIn a news conference with reporters, Poloz\u00a0shared the bank's overall take on the economy.\n\"Overall risk to the Canadian financial system has increased slightly since a year ago,\" he said.\u00a0\"That's due to a slowdown to overall growth in Canada and abroad, though we do expect economic growth to pick up in Canada later this year.\"\nOn the housing market, Poloz said \"previously frothy markets in Toronto and Vancouver appear\u00a0to be stabilizing.\"\n\"Expectations of price increases in both Toronto and Vancouver have gone down significantly,\" he said, indicating \"a\u00a0return to market fundamentals.\"\n\"That return to fundamentals is always a positive from the point of view of financial stability.\"\nAs for other risks, the report also points to increasing corporate debt as an emerging source of vulnerability for the economy. It said that companies around the world, including some in Canada, have become more indebted.\u00a0\n\"Investor appetite for high-yield bonds and leveraged loans has driven this increase in borrowing, thus making future activity susceptible to shifts in investor sentiment. We will be monitoring this closely,\" the report said.\nPoloz said that most companies have enough liquid assets to manage their debt, but that lower-rated firms lack the liquidity to cope with changes, including interest rates.\u00a0\nThe review also identified possible risk to the financial system from cyberattacks.\u00a0\nIt said the number of cyber incidents that have or could have resulted in significant\u00a0financial losses\u00a0increased steadily over the past decade, according to international data.\nBrian DePratto, senior economist with TD Economics, said \"by definition, the FSR should give us a bit of a scare.\"\n\"Things have been getting better, but years of rising imbalances and risks can't be undone overnight,\" DePratto said in a written statement about the report.\n\"High household debt and housing market imbalances, among others,\u00a0remain important vulnerabilities to the Canadian financial system. These vulnerabilities on their own may not be enough to swing the business cycle, but will worsen outcomes in the event a trigger becomes reality, such as an external shock sending Canada into an economic downturn.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2416845822", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/programs/edmontonam/syphilis-rates-increasing-in-alberta-1.5215066", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "Vancouver is still in a housing crisis.

Vacancy rates or Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) rental averages? The \"million-dollar line\" for detached homes being at Main, Commercial, or Boundary?\u00a0\nEveryone agreed Vancouver was still in a housing crisis. But nobody could put a set metric to it.\u00a0\nSimon Fraser University\u00a0economist Josh Gordon said ending the crisis isn't the same as Vancouver suddenly becoming affordable to everyone.\u00a0\n\"A return to conditions of 2014 [when home prices were around 10 to 30 per cent lower than they are now]\u00a0would represent the end of the crisis, but it wouldn't represent the\u00a0solution to all our affordability problems,\" Gordon said.\u00a0\u00a0\nA point repeated by University of British Columbia economist Tom Davidoff.\n\"No matter what government does in the long run, Vancouver is going to be an appealing place for people to work, and it's going to be a hard place to build. So affordability is always going to be a problem for government to handle,\" Davidoff said.\nMeanwhile, Central\u00a01\u00a0deputy chief economist\u00a0Bryan Yu said, \"I don't think it's a term I necessarily use because ...\u00a0I can't really define it very easily,\" while B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association CEO Jill Atkey\u00a0provided a more circuitous response.\n\"We can say we're no longer in a crisis when people are no longer experiencing a crisis within the housing system,\" she said.\u00a0\nFun fact of the day: average price of a Greater Vancouver house has increased as much in the past six months as it did from 1980 to 2006.\nEven though the monthly sales statistics are a main\u00a0barometer for talking about the housing market, those surveyed said there are better places to look for determining how much of a crisis the market is in.\u00a0\n\"The rental market is where the affordability issue is most critical,\u00a0because of course low-income people struggle the most with affordability, and they're most prone to be renters rather than owners,\" said Davidoff.\u00a0\nAtkey agreed, and said that while vacancy rates remain low, changes could be on the way, as governments at all three levels have been building rental stock and affordable housing at levels not seen in decades.\u00a0\n\"With every crisis there's a turning point. And I think what's interesting and and in some ways unique here in B.C. is that we are very much at that turning point and the stars are aligning,\" she said.\u00a0\nBut she's hopeful that the end of the crisis\u00a0\u2014 whenever that comes\u00a0\u2014 doesn't mean an end to current government funding and incentives for below-market housing.\u00a0\n\"Once we have it solved I'm really really hoping that we've got enough collective memory to prevent ourselves from getting back here again,\" she said.\u00a0\nAs for James?

Barron.\nThe plan was to keep it that way when Strategic Group bought it, but then the oil crash happened, said Ferguson.\n\"We put a redevelopment plan together that we worked on since 2012 to convert the building \u2014\u00a0double the floor plate \u2014\u00a0into an office building while still respecting the architectural characteristics of the building,\" Ferguson said.\n\"Unfortunately,\" he added, \"our plan was completed and permitted in 2015 where things came\u00a0to a little bit of a stop in the office industry.\"\nNow\u00a0the interior is being reconfigured into residential units, with an expected opening in 2020.\nThat same phenomenon\u00a0came into play a few years ago, when Alberta Health Services announced it wasn't renewing its lease at another Strategic Group building, known as the Cube, on 11th Avenue S.W., across from the Midtown\u00a0Co-Op.\nRather than trying to find a new tenant to replace their departing one, the company decided to\u00a0repurpose the building as apartments.\nFerguson said the combination of design\u00a0and location made it an appealing candidate.\n\"We looked at the building over what might happen in the next 10 to 15 years as an office building,\" Ferguson said, \"and we looked at our costs and our returns on converting it to residential \u2014 and due to the location and the physical structure of the building, it was ideal for repurposing.\"\nThe building contains 67 suites. Ferguson described it as \"more of a jewel box type building\"\u00a0than a lot of the high rise style apartments downtown, which distinguishes it from them, and as the thinking goes, appeals to a different sort of demographic.\n\"There is a big propensity and a big demand for purpose-built rentals in the city of Calgary today,\" Ferguson said.\n\"That could mean singles, it could mean empty nesters. It could mean new citizens moving into the city and even into the country.\"\nThe Cube is still under construction on its exterior, but has people living in it already.\n\"We're particularly proud of the Cube,\" Ferguson said, \"because it's the first repurposing project that we're delivering into the two big markets in Alberta.\"\nStrategic is also converting several office buildings in Edmonton into residential towers, for the same reason they're doing it in Calgary: older stock offices can't compete with new office buildings in a shrinking office demand economy.\nBut, Gray asked, what about the condo gluts that exist in both cities?\nFerguson suggested that there's room for rental units, particularly when compared with aging rental stock in both cities.\n\"The two youngest cities by a demographic in the country are Calgary and Edmonton and a young population,\" Ferguson said. \"Remember, our average age is 35, and a young population has a greater propensity to rent than to buy.\n\"The second leading economic indicator is the fact that our rental inventories in the two big cities in Alberta,\u00a0greater than 50 percent of that inventory was built prior to 1976 \u2014 so there's tranches of inventory every year that are becoming functionally obsolete.\"\nIt's not cheap to convert office buildings into residential units. The Barron Building conversion will cost $44M, while the Cube's is around $24.5M\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but Ferguson said it beats the alternative.\nWill it change downtown Calgary?\nCould a\u00a0ghost town\u00a0transform into something resembling a community?\n\"It can absolutely change,\" Ferguson said.\nWith files from The Calgary Eyeopener\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/stevenandchris/m_life/find-the-hidden-costs-and-savings-in-your-day", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/programs/informationmorningmoncton/do-you-have-a-student-at-mount-allison-university-here-s-an-update-on-the-mta-contract-dispute-1.5444338", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2675328702", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/programs/informationmorningmoncton/do-you-have-a-student-at-mount-allison-university-here-s-an-update-on-the-mta-contract-dispute-1.5444338", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Your guide to COVID-19 and its impact on life in Canada", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/your-guide-to-covid-19-and-its-impact-on-life-in-canada-1.5497009", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5514078.1585492974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-cda-20200326.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 13, 2020 5:57 PM ET", "2020-04-07T14:07:20.968Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Travel restrictions, school closures and event cancellations are the new normal in Canada, and phrases like \"self-isolation\" and \"physical distancing\" are now\u00a0part of the collective lexicon.\nDevelopments in the global COVID-19 pandemic are nearly constant\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and it's certainly difficult to keep track of everything that's happening.\nCBC News has\u00a0compiled a roundup of stories, explainers and videos on a wide range of topics to keep you up to date on the latest information\u00a0about the coronavirus.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned Canadians of a long road ahead.

Both Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam have downplayed the idea that so called \"silent spreaders\" are a common way people are infected.\nBut a growing body of research indicates they may be wrong and people don't have to appear ill at all to infect others.\nJeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University in New York, says he is frustrated when people deny that asymptomatic spread can happen.\n\"We have so much evidence that that is going on,\" he said. \"It's ridiculous.\"\u00a0Read more about \"silent spreaders\" here.\nNursing homes across the world have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, and Canada is no different.

She said the organization\u00a0responds to up to 1,800 calls a year from women with limited housing options, some of whom are considering returning to their abusers.\nMacDougall\u00a0said\u00a0the\u00a0problem has worsened in\u00a0Metro Vancouver in recent years as rents soared and housing stocks plummeted.\nAccording to the most recent data from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the overall vacancy rate across Vancouver and its suburbs is one per cent, and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,649.\n\"With the housing crisis that we have, survivors of violence are dealing with the reality of no housing, no escape,\" said\u00a0MacDougall.\nThe first time D.C.'s partner was violent with her she was pregnant with their daughter\u00a0and he headbutted her in the face in their kitchen.\u00a0The night he beat her with the ironing board, she was still on leave after giving birth when she decided enough was enough.\nAfter she left, she returned home with a photo of her bruised back and threatened to show her partner's family if he didn't leave.

If they were trained in probability, they'd learn to consider all the possibilities,\" he said.\n\"And more deeply, if people were confident in their problem-solving abilities, they would actually think deeply about the problems before they arrived at an opinion.\"\nMighton, who is also the founder of JUMP Math\u00a0\u2014 a Toronto-based charitable organization promoting numeracy \u2014 wasn't always a numbers evangelist.\u00a0\nIn fact, until he was 30 years old, he didn't even think he was very good at it.\nBut as a young, struggling playwright, he decided to pick up a side gig as an elementary school math tutor.\nHe ended up discovering he loved the subject.\n\"It was a revelation to me that by explaining the math and working at it over and over at my own pace, things that were mysterious to me became easier and easier,\" he said.\nMighton realized that for years\u00a0he had bought into what he says is a far too common misconception: that math is difficult and most people don't get it.\n\"We have to drop that myth because at all levels, from early childhood development right up to brain scans of mathematicians, the research is suggesting that math is accessible to any brain,\" he said.\nThe issue, Mighton says, is that math tends to be taught in ways \"that aren't really well supported by evidence in the science of learning.\"\nFor example, teachers and parents often try to teach problem-solving skills by starting out with complex, multi-step math problems, he says.\nBut math, he explains, is more like a ladder than other subjects: \"If you miss something, it's very hard to go on.\"\nIf those initial steps are missed, not only does it become difficult to learn those more complex concepts, but even young children will quickly decide they're not so-called math people, he says.\n\"There's research that suggests as early as Grade 1, kids know where they are in the hierarchy. They know if they're in the inferior group,\" he said.\n\"Once you decide you're in the inferior group, you stop engaging, working, you stop remembering things. Eventually you develop anxieties by Grade 3 or Grade 4, and it makes it very hard for your brain to work.\"\nInstead, he says educators should introduce math concepts in bite-sized chunks, or what he calls \"more scaffolded problems,\" and then gradually work their way up to tougher problems.\n\"The key is keeping the student in a zone that they can be confident and think,\" he said.\nMighton says he's been astounded by the potential of children when they're taught in this way.\nHe recalled teaching a class full of students with violent behavioural issues, \"who were thought to be unteachable.\" Mighton taught them how to read binary code, and how to use it to do a magic trick.\u00a0\n\"They went nuts. They thought they were little code breakers,\" he said.\u00a0\nOn their third lesson, the children actually cheered when Mighton and his team came in.\n\"It tells me there's just this inestimable potential in children, not only for learning, but for a sense of wonder and curiosity.\"\n\"Kids enjoy doing math as much as playing sports or creating art if they're allowed to succeed.\"\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.

So I would be concerned that there is a jump in people who are finding themselves unable to pay their debts,\" says Julie Kuzmic, Equifax Canada's director of consumer advocacy.\nThat would lead to more accounts going to collection agencies and aging even after the original creditor loses interest in collecting.\n\"As you get a higher consumer debt level, more and more of those \u2014 just by the sheer statistics alone \u2014 are going to be older debts,\" says Scott Terrio, manager of consumer insolvency at Hoyes, Michalos & Associates, a Toronto-based company specializing in insolvency.\nStatute of limitations laws across the country protect consumers from lawsuits if their unsecured debt hasn't been repaid within the allotted time.\nThe statute of limitations is two years in Ontario, Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, B.C., P.E.I. and Saskatchewan. It's three years in Quebec, and jumps to six years in the remaining provinces and territories. The federal limitation is six years.\nThe timelines mean creditors and collections agencies can't go to court after that period of time to force payment.\nBut that won't keep aggressive collection agencies at bay. Debt remains on a person's credit file for six years and technically doesn't ever vanish entirely.\nEfforts to collect old debt can resurface after it is sold to a new collections agency for cents on the dollar.\nSuccessfully pressuring just a few unwitting debtors to make a payment could be enough to make the exercise profitable for them.\n\"If I collect from one person, I can probably cover 10 or 20 files because I've only paid five cents or something,\" Terrio said.\nZombie debt comes in many forms, including legitimate debts that have been forgotten or ignored, scenarios where innocent parties share the same name of a debtor, or cases of identity theft or computer error.\nIt involves unsecured credit from credit cards, lines of credit, phone bills and the like. It does not apply to secured debt such as mortgages and money owed to government for income tax, property tax, fines, outstanding health care premiums and student loans.\nOld debt becomes zombie debt when a debtor acknowledges the money owing after the statute of limitations has lapsed, said David Gowling, senior vice-president with MNP Debt, one of Canada's largest insolvency practices.\n\"That can resurrect it and now you're starting your whole statute of limitations all over again.\"\nSome cases of zombie debt border on the absurd. Collections agents hounded one person a few years ago for money owed to Eaton's, even though the department store folded 20 years ago, said Gowling.\nExperts advise debtors not to acknowledge debt and if threatened with a lawsuit, tell the caller to send proof of the debt. Chances are they can't and won't bother because the statute of limitations has passed for seeking a judgment.\nWhile some actions by debtors could get the clock ticking again on the statute of limitations, it usually requires that a person acknowledge their debt in writing, said Lee Akazaki, partner with Gilbertson Davis LLP, a Toronto-based law firm.\nThat could include replying to an email agreeing that the debtor owes the money.\nResponding with \"I don't owe money because that's an old debt\" is not an acknowledgment.\n\"It just means you used to owe the money but you don't anymore,\" he said.\nLaurie Campbell, CEO of Credit Canada, a non-profit debt consolidation and credit counselling agency, has never come across old debt restarting the statute of limitations countdown clock.\nShe worries that people afraid of being sued will unnecessarily seek a bankruptcy trustee.\n\"People should not be running to see a trustee outside of that two-year window because they're going to pay fees for something that may never come about anyway,\" she said in an interview.\nCampbell said some people feel a moral obligation to repay debts even though they legally can't be forced to do so.\nShe advises against taking a knee-jerk reaction.\n\"Make sure you get the right advice before you make a decision that could harm you in the long-run.\"\n"}, {"author": "Terry Roberts", "title": "How a leaner, regulated Nalcor could save millions and better protect consumers", "description": "Liberty Consulting is proposing a dramatic shakeup at embattled Crown corporation in the Muskrat era", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/nalcor-muskrat-mitigation-1.5309082", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5273846.1567796924!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/muskrat-falls.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 05, 2019 7:00 AM NT", "2019-10-05T09:30:00.488Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Newfoundland and Labrador's energy corporation, already described as \"downtrodden\" by one of its leaders, is coming under more scrutiny and criticism as efforts intensify to keep electricity rates affordable in the Muskrat Falls era.\nOne of the cost-saving recommendations for the corporation is the elimination of\u00a0100 positions\u00a0at\u00a0the executive, management\u00a0and supervisory level sfor an annual savings of up to $21 million.

On Credit Karma, his score of 762 was labelled \"very good.\"\nAs for the paid sites, Equifax provided a \"good\" score of 684, while TransUnion said his 686 score was \"poor.\"\nAgarwal was surprised by the inconsistent results.\n\"That's so strange, because the scoring should be based on the same principles,\"\u00a0he said. \"I don't know why there's a confusion like that.\"\nThe other two participants also each received four different scores from the four different services. The largest gap between two scores for the same participant was 125 points.\nThe free websites, Borrowell and Credit Karma, purchase the scores they provide to consumers from Equifax and TransUnion, respectively, yet all four companies share a different score with a different proprietary name.\nCredit scores are calculated based on many factors, including payment history;\u00a0credit utilization, which is how much of a loan you owe versus how much you have available to you;\u00a0money owing;\u00a0how long you've been borrowing;\u00a0and the types of credit you have. But these factors can be weighted differently depending on the credit bureau or lender, resulting in different scores.\nSo, which credit score is giving Agarwal the clearest picture of his credit standing?\nMarketplace learned that none of the scores the four websites provide is necessarily the same as the one lenders are most likely to use when determining Agarwal's creditworthiness.\nWe spoke with multiple lenders in the financial, automotive and mortgage sectors, who all said they would not accept any of the scores our participants received from the four websites.\n\"So, we don't know what these scores represent,\"\u00a0said Vince Gaetano, principal broker at MonsterMortgage.ca. \"They're not necessarily reliable from my perspective.\"\nAll consumer credit score platforms have small fine-print messages on their sites explaining that lenders might consult a different score from the one provided.\nThe score that most Canadian lenders use is called a FICO score, previously known as the Beacon score. FICO, which is a U.S. company, sells its score to both Equifax and TransUnion. FICO says 90 per cent of Canadian lenders use it, including major banks.\nBut Canadian consumers cannot access their FICO score on their own.\nTo find out his FICO score, Agarwal had to agree to what's known as a \"hard\"\u00a0credit check. That's where a business runs a credit check as though a customer is applying for a loan.\nLenders are contractually obligated not to share a copy of the report FICO provides with the customer. They can only discuss the information and provide insight.\nA hard check comes with risk. Unlike the \"soft\"\u00a0check Agarwal agreed to from the four websites, a hard check could negatively impact his credit score.\nAs Credit Karma's website explains, \"Multiple hard inquiries in a short period could lead lenders and credit card issuers to consider you a higher-risk customer, as it suggests you may be short on cash or getting ready to rack up a lot of debt.\"\nMortgage broker Vince Gaetano\u00a0offered\u00a0to do a hard credit check for\u00a0Agarwal, as if he was applying for a loan, so he could learn his FICO score.\nAgarwal took him up on the offer and was stunned to learn his\u00a0FICO score was 829 \u2014\u00a0nearly 200 points higher than the lowest score he received online.\n\"Oh my god!\" Agarwal said when he heard the news. \"I am really happy, but totally surprised.\"\nDoug Hoyes, co-founder of Hoyes, Michalos and Associates Inc., one of the largest personal insolvency firms in Canada, was also surprised by the disparity between Agarwal's FICO score and the other scores he'd received.\n\"How can you be poor somewhere and fantastic somewhere else?\"\nMarketplace asked all four credit score companies why Agarwal's FICO score was so different from the ones provided on their sites.\nNo one could provide a detailed answer. Equifax and TransUnion did say their scores are used by lenders, but they wouldn't name any, citing proprietary reasons.\nCredit Karma declined to comment.\u00a0However, on its\u00a0customer service\u00a0website, it says the credit score it\u00a0provides to consumers is a \"widely used scoring model by lenders.\"\nThe free services, Borrowell and Credit Karma, make money by arranging loan and credit card offers for customers who visit their sites. Borrowell told Marketplace the credit score it provides is used by the company itself to offer loans directly from Borrowell. The company could not confirm whether any of its lending partners also use the score.\n\"So there are many different types of credit scores in Canada ... and they're calculated very differently,\"\u00a0said Andrew Graham, CEO of Borrowell. \"It's a complicated system, and we're the first to say that it's frustrating for consumers. We're trying to help add transparency to it and help consumers navigate it.\"\nFrom Agarwal's perspective, the credit companies are simply using the scoring system as a marketing tool.\u00a0\n\"There should be one score,\"\u00a0he said. \"If they are running an algorithm, there should be one score, no matter what you do, how you do it, should not change that score.\"\nThe FICO score is also the most popular score in the U.S. Unlike in Canada, Americans can access their score easily by purchasing it on FICO's website, or through FICO's Open Access Program, without any risk of it impacting their credit rating.\nFICO told Marketplace it would like to bring the Open Access Program to Canada, but it's up to Canadian lenders.\n\"We are open to working with any lender and their credit bureau partner of choice to enable FICO Score access to the lender's customers,\"\u00a0FICO said in an email.\nHoyes, the insolvency expert, suggests instead of focusing on your credit score, a better approach to monitoring your financial status would be to shift attention to your credit report and ensuring its accuracy.\nAll four websites Marketplace looked at provide credit reports to consumers.\nA credit report is the file that describes your financial situation.

It's stressful,\" said Gerelus, 65, who has lived in her one bedroom apartment with her mother for three decades. \"We don't want to leave our home. We don't want to have to leave Burnaby.\"\nLike other residents in their building, the pair will be forced out once its demolished, and face significant rental increases.\n\"We're on a very fixed income, we have bills and all kinds things going on \u2014\u00a0and we just can't do it,\" she said.\nGerelus\u00a0says she feels unrepresented in the federal election as the growing affordability crisis puts greater pressure on renters like her. It's a sentiment that's been echoed by housing advocates as rental rates across the region skyrocket.\nThe Burnaby South riding where Gerelus lives is among the most expensive ridings for renters in all of Canada, according to the B.C. Non Profit Housing Association. Six Metro Vancouver ridings in total land on the list.\nFrom foreign investment to money laundering to overall population growth, there are many factors playing into B.C.'s hot real estate market.\nBut Andy Yan, director of city policy at Simon Fraser University, traces the affordability gap back to the 1990s, when federal subsidies for non-market housing were effectively shut off.\n\"It really began with this belief that market system would provide the kind of housing that Canadians need,\" said Yan. \"With the hindsight of 2019, we know that there are proportions of the population that market housing isn't going to meet that demand.\"\n\"This is really the accretive effect of decades of non-investment in non-market housing,\" said Yan.\nMusician and local health worker Peter La Grand is among grappling with the swelling costs of living in Metro Vancouver. He\u00a0and his wife are both working professionals, with three kids.\nAfter renting in Vancouver for years, the family recently was accepted into a co-op \u2014 a victory he describes as like \"winning the lottery.\"\nBut times are still tough.\n\"We sold our car a few months ago to try to make things simpler, so our costs are really food and rent. And even then \u2026 I give the image that the water is right here (below our heads). And we keep treading water, but we're not saving.\"\nLa Grand says he plans to vote, and hopes representatives make a push toward building more social and co-op housing.\nHousing is a pillar of the major party platforms.\nThe Liberals plan to\u00a0build 100,000 affordable living units, and renovate up to 300,000 already existing units as part of their national housing strategy. The dollars would be split with the provinces. Subsidies would also be made available to first time home buyers.\nThe NDP\u00a0platform includes building 500,000 affordable living units, and the potential for a rental subsidy in the interim. As for how that money would be raised, representatives said the dollars would come from a one per cent tax increase on the rich. Money would also potentially be re-allocated once the party cuts off fossil fuel subsidies.\nThe Greens have pledged to build\u00a025,000 homes each year for a decade. Representatives told CBC News that the party would also look at an increase to rental supplements.\nThe Conservative Party has promised to ease up the mortgage stress test to get more people into the housing market. A proposed universal tax break would also save Canadians hundreds of dollars per year.\nThe People's Party of Canada does not have a specific housing platform.\nHousing advocates say pledges for widespread affordable units are encouraging,\u00a0but a prolonged effort is needed to curb the 'rental crisis.'\n\"It took us 20 years to get here,\" said Thom Armstrong,\u00a0\u00a0executive director of the Co-op Housing Federation of B.C.\u00a0\"We're not going to get out of here in one electoral cycle or one budget.

On Credit Karma, his score of 762 was labelled \"very good.\"\nAs for the paid sites, Equifax provided a \"good\" score of 684, while TransUnion said his 686 score was \"poor.\"\nAgarwal was surprised by the inconsistent results.\n\"That's so strange, because the scoring should be based on the same principles,\"\u00a0he said. \"I don't know why there's a confusion like that.\"\nThe other two participants also each received four different scores from the four different services. The largest gap between two scores for the same participant was 125 points.\nThe free websites, Borrowell and Credit Karma, purchase the scores they provide to consumers from Equifax and TransUnion, respectively, yet all four companies share a different score with a different proprietary name.\nCredit scores are calculated based on many factors, including payment history;\u00a0credit utilization, which is how much of a loan you owe versus how much you have available to you;\u00a0money owing;\u00a0how long you've been borrowing;\u00a0and the types of credit you have. But these factors can be weighted differently depending on the credit bureau or lender, resulting in different scores.\nSo, which credit score is giving Agarwal the clearest picture of his credit standing?\nMarketplace learned that none of the scores the four websites provide is necessarily the same as the one lenders are most likely to use when determining Agarwal's creditworthiness.\nWe spoke with multiple lenders in the financial, automotive and mortgage sectors, who all said they would not accept any of the scores our participants received from the four websites.\n\"So, we don't know what these scores represent,\"\u00a0said Vince Gaetano, principal broker at MonsterMortgage.ca. \"They're not necessarily reliable from my perspective.\"\nAll consumer credit score platforms have small fine-print messages on their sites explaining that lenders might consult a different score from the one provided.\nThe score that most Canadian lenders use is called a FICO score, previously known as the Beacon score. FICO, which is a U.S. company, sells its score to both Equifax and TransUnion. FICO says 90 per cent of Canadian lenders use it, including major banks.\nBut Canadian consumers cannot access their FICO score on their own.\nTo find out his FICO score, Agarwal had to agree to what's known as a \"hard\"\u00a0credit check. That's where a business runs a credit check as though a customer is applying for a loan.\nLenders are contractually obligated not to share a copy of the report FICO provides with the customer. They can only discuss the information and provide insight.\nA hard check comes with risk. Unlike the \"soft\"\u00a0check Agarwal agreed to from the four websites, a hard check could negatively impact his credit score.\nAs Credit Karma's website explains, \"Multiple hard inquiries in a short period could lead lenders and credit card issuers to consider you a higher-risk customer, as it suggests you may be short on cash or getting ready to rack up a lot of debt.\"\nMortgage broker Vince Gaetano\u00a0offered\u00a0to do a hard credit check for\u00a0Agarwal, as if he was applying for a loan, so he could learn his FICO score.\nAgarwal took him up on the offer and was stunned to learn his\u00a0FICO score was 829 \u2014\u00a0nearly 200 points higher than the lowest score he received online.\n\"Oh my god!\" Agarwal said when he heard the news. \"I am really happy, but totally surprised.\"\nDoug Hoyes, co-founder of Hoyes, Michalos and Associates Inc., one of the largest personal insolvency firms in Canada, was also surprised by the disparity between Agarwal's FICO score and the other scores he'd received.\n\"How can you be poor somewhere and fantastic somewhere else?\"\nMarketplace asked all four credit score companies why Agarwal's FICO score was so different from the ones provided on their sites.\nNo one could provide a detailed answer. Equifax and TransUnion did say their scores are used by lenders, but they wouldn't name any, citing proprietary reasons.\nCredit Karma declined to comment.\u00a0However, on its\u00a0customer service\u00a0website, it says the credit score it\u00a0provides to consumers is a \"widely used scoring model by lenders.\"\nThe free services, Borrowell and Credit Karma, make money by arranging loan and credit card offers for customers who visit their sites. Borrowell told Marketplace the credit score it provides is used by the company itself to offer loans directly from Borrowell. The company could not confirm whether any of its lending partners also use the score.\n\"So there are many different types of credit scores in Canada ... and they're calculated very differently,\"\u00a0said Andrew Graham, CEO of Borrowell. \"It's a complicated system, and we're the first to say that it's frustrating for consumers. We're trying to help add transparency to it and help consumers navigate it.\"\nFrom Agarwal's perspective, the credit companies are simply using the scoring system as a marketing tool.\u00a0\n\"There should be one score,\"\u00a0he said. \"If they are running an algorithm, there should be one score, no matter what you do, how you do it, should not change that score.\"\nThe FICO score is also the most popular score in the U.S. Unlike in Canada, Americans can access their score easily by purchasing it on FICO's website, or through FICO's Open Access Program, without any risk of it impacting their credit rating.\nFICO told Marketplace it would like to bring the Open Access Program to Canada, but it's up to Canadian lenders.\n\"We are open to working with any lender and their credit bureau partner of choice to enable FICO Score access to the lender's customers,\"\u00a0FICO said in an email.\nHoyes, the insolvency expert, suggests instead of focusing on your credit score, a better approach to monitoring your financial status would be to shift attention to your credit report and ensuring its accuracy.\nAll four websites Marketplace looked at provide credit reports to consumers.\nA credit report is the file that describes your financial situation. It lists bank accounts, credit cards, inquiries from lenders who have requested your report, bankruptcies, student loans, mortgages, whether you pay your credit card bill on time, and other debt.\nHoyes said consumers are trying too hard to have the perfect credit score. The fact is, some activities that could boost a credit score, such as getting a new credit card or taking on a loan, aren't necessarily the best financial decisions.\n\"My advice is to focus on what is better for your financial health, not what is best for the lender's financial health.\"\nHe said paying off debt and increasing savings is a better idea than focusing solely on the factors that can increase your credit score.\nHe points to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, the third richest person in the world, as an example.\n\"Would you rather lend to Warren Buffett, who's got \u2026 cash in the bank but has a lousy credit score because he's never borrowed and hasn't built up any history, or some guy who has five credit cards and he constantly \u2026 moves the balance from one to the other and keeps his utilization under 20 per cent?\"\nThe real estate, mortgage and auto lenders Marketplace spoke with said they look at more than just your credit score before making a lending decision.

Multiple post-secondary institutions have signalled that after budget cuts, tuition hikes will be on the horizon.\nIncreases are capped at seven per cent at the institutional level and 10 per cent at the program level, and tuition and education tax credits are being cut.\nPost-secondary students will also pay increased interest of prime plus one per cent on their student loans.\u00a0\nGrocery costs are going up across the country, according to the researchers behind Canada's Food Price Report 2020.\nThe report states that the average Canadian family will pay up to an extra $487 for food next year, with climate change expected to impact prices through factors like unpredictable crop yields due to drought or heavy precipitation and\u00a0heat-wave threats to livestock.\nThe federal carbon levy backstop kicks in for Albertans on Jan. 1, which will start at\u00a0$20 per tonne, increasing to $30 per tonne in April and $50 per tonne by 2022.\u00a0\nPrices are set to rise by about 4.4\u00a0cents per litre for gasoline\u00a0and $1.05 per gigajoule of natural gas \u2014 but experts say that doesn't mean a bigger hit to the average Albertan's wallet.\nA family of four will be due for an $888 rebate, and a single adult $444. So if your costs are lower than that number \u2014 as they're predicted to be for the majority of people who earn less than $90,000 a year \u2014 it means you will likely get back more money than you spend.\u00a0\nThe City of Calgary has changed its pass structure and fees for indoor pools, arenas and leisure centres.\u00a0\nDetails about the new passes and the new pricing structure are available on the city's website.\nSome drivers are facing increases in car insurance premiums, after the province lifted a five per cent cap on rates.\nThe Alberta government signalled in its fall budget that it plans to introduce a tax on vaping products in 2020.\u00a0\nHowever, the government has yet to provide details of what a tax on vaping products could look like.\nAdmission prices at the Royal Tyrrell museum are going up $2 as of April 1, 2020.\nThat means adult day passes will increase from $19 to $21, and family passes from $48 to $50.\nAs of Feb. 1, 2020, Calgarians who rent their homes through Airbnb or other short-term rental services will be required to obtain a business licence, with annual fees applying based on the number of bedrooms in the rental.\nOne- to four-bedroom rental licences\u00a0will cost $100, while owners of larger rentals will need to pay a\u00a0$295 fee which includes the cost of a fire inspection.\u00a0\nThe province also said it intends to apply its four per cent\u00a0tourism levy to\u00a0short-term rentals in 2020.\nThis increase could be good news for sellers, although not so much for buyers.\nThe aggregate price of a home in Calgary is forecasted to increase 1.5 per cent year-over-year in 2020 to $477,000, and the median price of a condo is forecasted to increase 0.75 per cent year-over-year to $267,500, according to Royal LePage's Market Survey Forecast.\nAnd it's not all increases on the horizon.\nRent costs are expected to decrease slightly in 2020, according to website Rentals.ca which prepares annual forecasts with Bullpen Consulting. The site is forecasting the average rent in 2020 in Calgary will be $1,405 per month, down from an average monthly rent of $1,450 in 2019.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/robert-sopuck-delivers-his-goodbye-speech-1.5167201", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/programs/allinaday/call-for-volunteers-to-remove-ottawa-sandbags-this-weekend-1.5167203", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/programs/shift/bird-talk-cliff-swallows-find-a-home-to-nest-literally-1.5167202", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/guy-lauzon-delivers-his-goodbye-speech-1.5167164", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/bev-shipley-delivers-his-goodbye-speech-1.5167183", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/watch-the-uqo-instructional-dress-code-video-1.5167230", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/programs/allinaday/great-lake-swimmers-the-waves-the-wake-1.5167144", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/programs/ontheisland/on-the-island-political-panel-for-june-7-2019-1.5166732", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "COVID-19: Here's what's happening around the world March 4", "description": "Italy cases top 3,000 with over 100 dead, as the sick in South Korea wait for beds", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/covid-19-coronavirus-march-4-1.5484854", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 04, 2020 5:51 AM ET", "2020-03-05T02:11:51.188Z"], "source": null, "content": "The latest:\nThe death toll from the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0outbreak in Italy has risen by 28 over the past 24 hours to 107, the Civil Protection Agency (CPA)\u00a0said Wednesday, with the contagion showing little sign of slowing.\nGlobally, there are now 93,090\u00a0cases of COVID-19 and\u00a03,198\u00a0deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\u00a0\nIn Italy, which has been hardest hit by the virus in Europe, the accumulative number of cases\u00a0totalled 3,089, up from 2,502 on Tuesday.

A 100-bed military hospital that had been handling many of the most serious cases was due to have 200 additional beds available by Thursday, he added.\nCOVID-19 is the illness caused by the new coronavirus, which emerged from China late last year to spread around the world.\u00a0Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said Tuesday that globally \"about 3.4 per cent\u00a0of reported COVID-19 cases have died.\"\nThe WHO \u2014 which has been urging countries to work on containment and simultaneously prepare for increased case numbers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0on Tuesday warned of a global shortage and price gouging for protective equipment to fight the virus and asked companies and governments to rapidly scale up production.\n\"We can't stop COVID-19 without protecting our health workers,\" Tedros said.\nRead on for what's happening in Canada and the United States, as well as some of the harder-hit regions around the world.\nIn Canada, public health officials have reported 34\u00a0cases. On Wednesday, officials in Ontario said the number of cases in that province hasn't changed, but noted that the\u00a0number of cases they are investigating\u00a0has gone up.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada, which has been assessing risk as the global outbreak progresses, says the risk is low in Canada.\nDr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said on Twitter yesterday that it's \"important for each of us to be prepared for all scenarios.\" She urged people to make a plan for what they\u00a0would do if there's an outbreak in their community, including making plans around work and child care and ensuring they have enough prescription medicine.\nVirus clusters in the U.S.\u00a0led schools and subways to sanitize, while fears\u00a0spread among nursing home residents, who are especially vulnerable. The number of\u00a0infections in the U.S. was at least 129. There have now been 11 deaths; 10 in Washington state and one in California.\u00a0\nMost of the deaths in Washington\u00a0were residents of a Seattle-area nursing home, while an elderly person\u00a0died Wednesday in Northern California after apparently contracting the virus while on a San Francisco-Mexico cruise last month. After the state's first fatality was announced, California's governor declared a statewide emergency, a measure intended to help procure supplies quickly.\nGov. Gavin Newsom said the government is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and health-care partners to contact the 2,100 passengers on the\u00a0Grand Princess cruise, half of whom were Californians. That same ship set sail a few days\u00a0after the Feb. 21\u00a0trip\u00a0to Hawaii and was due back Wednesday evening in San Francisco.\nBut after a number of passengers and crew developed symptoms, Newsom\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b said the government had asked it not dock until testing kits can be flown to the ship.\nIn Washington, lawmakers reached bipartisan agreement on an $8.3 billion emergency bill to help fund efforts to contain the virus in the U.S., a congressional aide said. The bill would be introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives later Wednesday.\nOnce the full House approves the bill, the Senate is expected to act quickly so that President Donald Trump can sign the measure into law, putting funds into the pipeline to fight the virus.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced the biggest interest-rate cut in over a decade to try to counter the expected damage to the economy, and stocks rose briefly on Wall Street in reaction before slumping again.\u00a0\nAs federal, state\u00a0and local health organizations planned for a broader outbreak, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave health-care workers the OK to use an industrial type of respirator mask often used to protect construction workers from dust and debris.\nIn China, authorities on Thursday reported 31 deaths over the previous 24 hours and another 139 cases of infection,\u00a0all but five\u00a0in the hardest-hit province of Hubei. That compares with\u00a0119 new cases on Wednesday.\u00a0The update brings China's totals to 80,409 cases and 3,012 deaths.\u00a0\nChina has faced questions about its handling of the outbreak, including questions about its numbers\u00a0and changes it made in how it reported cases.\n\"We scrutinized this data, and we believe this decline is real,\" said WHO outbreak expert Maria Van Kerkhove, who travelled to China as part of a team from the UN agency. She said the extraordinary measures taken there, including the lockdown of more than 60 million people, had a significant effect on the direction of the outbreak.\n\"We believe that a reduction of cases in other countries, including Italy, Korea, Iran, everywhere, that this is possible,\" she said.\nIn France, which has 212 confirmed cases, a fourth person with COVID-19 died.\u00a0President Emmanuel Macron warned that the health crisis could last several months.\nLouvre Museum employees who had stayed off the job since Sunday for fear of infection voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to resume work, allowing the world's most-visited museum to open its doors again in the afternoon.\nSpain reported its first death from the outbreak in Valencia, a local health official said on Tuesday, when around 150 people had been diagnosed and some 100 health workers in the Basque region were isolated in their homes.\nIn the U.K., case numbers rose to 85 Wednesday from 51 on Tuesday.\nSixteen new cases of the coronavirus were confirmed in Stockholm, regional authorities said Wednesday, taking the total number of cases in Sweden to 52.\nIran on Wednesday said the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak there was at 92.\nThe number of cases in Iran has been on the rise, with 586 new cases reported Wednesday, bringing the total reported case count in Iran to 2,922. Iran\u00a0has faced questions about its case reporting after local officials offered figures earlier in the outbreak that didn't align with the government's count.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani said that the coronavirus outbreak has affected almost all provinces in the country.\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Mike Ryan, director of WHO's emergency program, said Iran has a \"very, very strong\" workforce in the health-care system, but there are concerns about equipment, supplies and critical tools like ventilators.\n\"Those needs are more acute for the Iranian health system than they are for most any other health system,\" Ryan said.\u00a0\nRyan also\u00a0noted that the rapid uptick in cases is not unheard of in outbreaks and that things often look worse before they start to get better.\nIn Saudi Arabia, officials temporarily suspended Umrah pilgrimages to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina for Saudi citizens and the kingdom's other residents due to coronavirus concerns, the state news agency SPA said.\nIn Israel,\u00a0workers tallying the results\u00a0of the presidential election had to wear masks and gloves as they handled ballots cast by people under quarantine due to possible exposure to the virus.\nIsraeli health authorities have ordered everyone from a regional high school and dozens of soccer fans into home quarantine after their possible exposure to a teenage boy who tested positive for the coronavirus.\nJapan's confirmed infections topped 1,000, mostly from the Diamond Princess cruise liner.\u00a0Twelve people have died in the country, six from the ship.\nBank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Wednesday said the coronavirus outbreak could inflict big damage on the economy, stressing the central bank's readiness to take \"appropriate action\" to underpin a fragile recovery.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url":

trading day of a holiday-shortened week in the U.S. and followed losses in global markets amid deepening concerns that the new coronavirus spreading in the world's second-largest economy could hurt tourism and ultimately economic growth and corporate profits.\nCanada's main stock index fell for the first time in seven sessions on concerns about the outbreak.\u00a0The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 25.11 points at 17,572.28.\nSix people have died, and 291 have been infected in China, just as the country was\u00a0preparing for its peak travel season over the Lunar New Year travel.\nA U.S. citizen who recently returned from China was diagnosed with the new virus in the Seattle area, making the United States the fifth country to report a case, following China, Thailand, Japan and South Korea.\n\"From an investment standpoint, the risk with any virus is in the scope of its economic impact, and the mere fact that this has spread from China overnight to the U.S. so quickly reinforces the idea that the negative fallout could be global rather than local,\" said Alec Young, managing director of Global Markets Research for FTSE Russell.\nAsian stocks closed sharply lower. European markets also fell. Within the S&P 500, stocks of U.S. companies that cater to Chinese tourists had some of the biggest losses, along with general travel companies, such as casinos and airlines.\nIndustrial, financial and energy companies were among those that declined.\u00a0Those losses outweighed gains in defensive sector stocks, including real estate, utilities and household goods makers. Traders also shifted money into U.S. government bonds, sending yields lower.\nInvestors are looking at playbooks for past outbreaks, such as SARS in 2002-2003, where airlines, railways and other transportation companies saw their stocks slide the most, followed by retailers and hospitality companies, according to strategists at Jefferies.\nHeadlines about the spreading coronavirus have given investors an excuse to take profits following the market's recent record-setting run. The three major U.S. stock indexes were coming off all-time highs set Friday. The S&P 500 hasn't had a single-day drop of more than 1 per cent\u00a0since October.\n\"Investors have shown a lot of optimism, and that might make some a little bit skittish,\" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. \"Valuations are elevated. In this sort of environment, I don't think it takes much of a headline to trigger a reaction.\"\nTuesday's drop for the index follows a strong run. Fears of a possible recession have faded, and investors expect the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low, and the S&P 500 has risen in 13 of the last 15 weeks.\nIn New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 152.06 points at 29,196.04.

They say it symbolizes a real problem.\u00a0\n\"There are people that are very close to this situation, that tent situation,\" said Jason Alward, who is involved with the group. \"I mean you just have to look at the news within the last year or so. There are people living in cars.\n\"To\u00a0see the people out here today is really heartwarming. And it shows the government that there is a growing concern for this.\"\nRepresentatives from the Community Legal Information Association were at the event, offering information about tenant and landlord rights and responsibilities.\u00a0\nPeople were also signing a petition, asking all levels of government to do more to protect access to safe and affordable housing.\u00a0\nThe city recently launched an online survey, asking for input on short-term rental regulation. However, Alward said some within the P.E.I. Fight for Affordable Housing group\u00a0weren't satisfied with the questions on the survey\u00a0\u2014 so the group launched its own survey this week.\u00a0\n\"We hope to give a voice to the tenants that need the most help right now,\" said Alward.\u00a0\nFor Zahorodniy, seeing the group gathered in the square gives him hope that people are talking about the issue of affordable housing.\nBut for him, the tents are more than just symbolic. He worries for him, his wife and three kids, it may soon be a reality.\u00a0\n\"In the end of the month I need bring out my family. So I don't know, probably we will open tent in front of the house, and we'll live there.\"\n"}, {"author": "Trevor Tombe", "title": "Why earnings in Alberta have been stagnant for years", "description": "Albertans earn less because they're working less, and working differently", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-wages-recession-tombe-1.5229086", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5229124.1564421939!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/riggers.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 31, 2019 5:00 AM MT", "2019-07-31T15:32:22.339Z"], "source": null, "content": "Alberta's recent recession was long and deep. Five years later, we're still recovering.\nBetween 2014 and 2016, total incomes of workers, business, and government combined fell by nearly 20 per cent. That's 75 billion fewer dollars per year in Alberta's economy. That's not even the worst of it. Relative to our growth path prior to the recession, we're down $100 billion per year, compared to where we thought we'd be.\nPlunging corporate profits account for most of that drop, but workers weren't spared. Fewer hours, fewer jobs\u00a0and, in some cases, lower wages\u00a0continue to take their toll. And while the recession ended over two years ago, the recovery has been slow and earnings growth especially so.\nWhat's behind our stagnant earnings? Will we return to pre-recession highs? What can government do to help? The latest data, and some new analysis, sheds light on these important questions and provides needed perspective.\nAlbertans earn less because they're working less, and working differently. Government can help in some ways, but only at the margins. Lower earnings today largely reflects a natural adjustment that's moving Alberta to a more normal and balanced labour market.\nThe boom years that ended in 2014 were the outliers, not where we are today.\nExcept for a recent spike in May, earnings have been largely flat for the past year and a half. And as I illustrate below, the modest earnings growth seen by Albertans in recent years was fully eroded by inflation.\nSince 2011, prices in Alberta have increased nearly 18 per cent \u2014 eroding what individuals can buy with their income. So despite an 18 percent increase in earnings, the typical worker is no further ahead. The $1,183 per week a typical worker earns today goes about as far as $1,000 did nearly a decade ago.\nThat's disappointing, especially in light of gains elsewhere in Canada. Had earnings growth kept pace with the rest of the country, workers would be earning roughly 10 percent more, or an additional $120 per week. That would put over $6,000 a year in the pocket of the typical Alberta worker and add nearly $12.5 billion to the economy as a whole.\nTo be clear, Albertans still earn more than most workers elsewhere. At $1,183 per week, Albertans are far above the next highest province of Saskatchewan, where the typical worker brings in $1,070 per week. But despite our lead position, years of disappointing growth matters. It takes a toll on families who were planning on stronger gains and dampens confidence in the overall economy, which remains low today.\nSo why are earnings failing to grow? And how concerned should we be? It comes down to two simple reasons: how much and where are Albertans working.\nIt's not that overall wages have fallen. Rather, Albertans are working less.\nThe typical hourly employee in the province works just over 31 hours per week \u2014 down two full hours since the pre-recession peak of 33 hours per week. Over the course of a whole year, those two hours add up to a lot. At the current average wage of $28 per hour, two fewer hours per week means incomes are nearly $3,000 per year lower.\nWhile certainly disappointing, a broader perspective is needed. An average 31-hour work week is low relative to 2014, but it's above the Canadian average of 30. And, more importantly, 31 hours is in line with what could be considered normal for Alberta. In the decade leading up to 2010, average hours worked fluctuated near 31 per week.\nIn other words, the years between 2010 and 2014 were exceptional. Today, we've returned to normal.\nNot all hours pay the same, of course. Overtime adds significantly to a worker's typical paycheque and those hours are down, too. Some work more, others work none, but the typical worker in Alberta works just over one hour of overtime per week. Since the 2014 peak, overtime is down almost one hour per week.\nBut, again, this returns Alberta's economy to the pre-boom norm.\nSince the recession started, we've seen a big shift in where the jobs are. Sectors with average wages above $30 per hour employ nearly 100,000 fewer Albertans today than they did in late 2014, while other lower paying sectors employ 40,000 more.\nMuch of the decline in high-wage employment is concentrated in only a few sectors: construction (down more than 45,000 jobs), mining, oil and gas (down nearly 35,000), and professional services (down 18,000), while the gains are found in retail, health and social services, education, and to a lesser extent transportation jobs and public administration.\nLow oil prices caused much of this, so those jobs are unlikely to rise to pre-recession levels anytime soon \u2014 if ever. Oil prices are not only expected to remain far below their prior highs, but corporate operations are significantly more efficient. Lower costs in the face of lower prices lead many businesses to streamline and improve operations, so fewer workers are needed.\nSo with hours down and jobs shifting, what should Albertans expect next?\nSince Albertans have returned to working a more normal number of regular and overtime hours, and since resource jobs are unlikely to return to pre-recession highs anytime soon, much of the recent earnings decline may be here to stay.\nOf the $120 per week wage hit Albertans are seeing relative to the rest of the country, two-thirds of that is due to fewer hours and shifting jobs, leaving only $40 per week in lower earnings due to disappointing wage growth. And most of that gap has opened up only fairly recently. This is in stark contrast to the earlier illustration of Alberta earnings massively lagging behind the rest of Canada.\nThis doesn't mean Alberta should settle. Just that we should temper our expectations, and focus our attention.\nThere is a role for government to help boost wage growth. One policy change that might help has already been implemented: the corporate tax cut.\nI know what you're thinking: \"Trickle-down economics doesn't work!\" While there are valid concerns around inequality and around whether shrinking Alberta's revenue at a time of tight fiscal constraints makes sense, no policy choice is without tradeoffs. And the evidence suggests lower corporate rates does indeed boost wages.\nRecent research by my University of Calgary colleague Dr. Ken McKenzie\u00a0and with University of Alberta economist Dr. Ergete Ferede, for example, finds strong evidence that provincial corporate tax changes affect wages. The intuition is simple: taxes affect investment, as more marginal business projects become worthwhile. And rising investment leads to higher activity and demand for workers, which then leads to higher wages and, potentially, employment.\nIt's hard to be precise, but taking their estimates at face value, the long-run effect of the corporate tax cut from 12 to 8 per cent might be 1.6 per cent higher wages in Alberta. For the average worker, that's nearly $19 extra per week (or nearly $1,000 per year).\nOf course, there are other measures to consider. We can help ensure workers have the skills they need to succeed at other jobs outside of oil and gas. Higher skills means higher productivity, and higher productivity means higher wages. Workers making the shift from oil and gas, construction, and certain manufacturing jobs to other activities also need support and retraining opportunities.\nWith hours worked and overtime back to normal levels, there's a limit to how much earnings growth we should expect. But with Alberta's adjustment to the oil price shock appearing complete, normal wage growth may soon return \u2014 though from our new, lower level.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "COVID-19: Here's what's happening around the world March 4", "description": "Italy cases top 3,000 with over 100 dead, as the sick in South Korea wait for beds", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/covid-19-coronavirus-march-4-1.5484854", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 04, 2020 5:51 AM ET", "2020-03-05T02:11:51.188Z"], "source": null, "content": "The latest:\nThe death toll from the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0outbreak in Italy has risen by 28 over the past 24 hours to 107, the Civil Protection Agency (CPA)\u00a0said Wednesday, with the contagion showing little sign of slowing.\nGlobally, there are now 93,090\u00a0cases of COVID-19 and\u00a03,198\u00a0deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\u00a0\nIn Italy, which has been hardest hit by the virus in Europe, the accumulative number of cases\u00a0totalled 3,089, up from 2,502 on Tuesday.

The number of\u00a0infections in the U.S. was at least 129. There have now been 11 deaths; 10 in Washington state and one in California.\u00a0\nMost of the deaths in Washington\u00a0were residents of a Seattle-area nursing home, while an elderly person\u00a0died Wednesday in Northern California after apparently contracting the virus while on a San Francisco-Mexico cruise last month. After the state's first fatality was announced, California's governor declared a statewide emergency, a measure intended to help procure supplies quickly.\nGov. Gavin Newsom said the government is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and health-care partners to contact the 2,100 passengers on the\u00a0Grand Princess cruise, half of whom were Californians. That same ship set sail a few days\u00a0after the Feb. 21\u00a0trip\u00a0to Hawaii and was due back Wednesday evening in San Francisco.\nBut after a number of passengers and crew developed symptoms, Newsom\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b said the government had asked it not dock until testing kits can be flown to the ship.\nIn Washington, lawmakers reached bipartisan agreement on an $8.3 billion emergency bill to help fund efforts to contain the virus in the U.S., a congressional aide said. The bill would be introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives later Wednesday.\nOnce the full House approves the bill, the Senate is expected to act quickly so that President Donald Trump can sign the measure into law, putting funds into the pipeline to fight the virus.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced the biggest interest-rate cut in over a decade to try to counter the expected damage to the economy, and stocks rose briefly on Wall Street in reaction before slumping again.\u00a0\nAs federal, state\u00a0and local health organizations planned for a broader outbreak, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave health-care workers the OK to use an industrial type of respirator mask often used to protect construction workers from dust and debris.\nIn China, authorities on Thursday reported 31 deaths over the previous 24 hours and another 139 cases of infection,\u00a0all but five\u00a0in the hardest-hit province of Hubei.

Iran\u00a0has faced questions about its case reporting after local officials offered figures earlier in the outbreak that didn't align with the government's count.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani said that the coronavirus outbreak has affected almost all provinces in the country.\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Mike Ryan, director of WHO's emergency program, said Iran has a \"very, very strong\" workforce in the health-care system, but there are concerns about equipment, supplies and critical tools like ventilators.\n\"Those needs are more acute for the Iranian health system than they are for most any other health system,\" Ryan said.\u00a0\nRyan also\u00a0noted that the rapid uptick in cases is not unheard of in outbreaks and that things often look worse before they start to get better.\nIn Saudi Arabia, officials temporarily suspended Umrah pilgrimages to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina for Saudi citizens and the kingdom's other residents due to coronavirus concerns, the state news agency SPA said.\nIn Israel,\u00a0workers tallying the results\u00a0of the presidential election had to wear masks and gloves as they handled ballots cast by people under quarantine due to possible exposure to the virus.\nIsraeli health authorities have ordered everyone from a regional high school and dozens of soccer fans into home quarantine after their possible exposure to a teenage boy who tested positive for the coronavirus.\nJapan's confirmed infections topped 1,000, mostly from the Diamond Princess cruise liner.\u00a0Twelve people have died in the country, six from the ship.\nBank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Wednesday said the coronavirus outbreak could inflict big damage on the economy, stressing the central bank's readiness to take \"appropriate action\" to underpin a fragile recovery.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Modelling suggests as many as 800,000 COVID-19 infections could sweep Alberta, Premier Jason Kenney says", "description": "\u2018Perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation,\u2019 Kenney says during televised address ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/premier-jason-kenney-to-address-albertans-about-covid-19-1.5524795", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Apr 07, 2020 10:47 AM MT", "2020-04-08T02:25:02.919Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In a televised address to the province Tuesday evening, Premier Jason Kenney laid out two starkly different scenarios that paint grim pictures of what the next weeks and months may look like in Alberta.\nCalling the COVID-19 pandemic \"perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation,\" Kenney said his government must act to deal with three crises at once, and must focus first on saving lives, then on rebuilding an economy in ruins.\nOn the health care front, Kenney outlined what he called a \"probable\" scenario, based on modelling projections, that suggests Alberta will hit the peak of coronavirus infections in mid-May.\u00a0\nUnder that scenario, by the end of summer, the province could see as many as 800,000 infections, and between 400 and 3,100 deaths.\nHe also spoke directly to Albertans, many of whom are self-isolating at home, about a more serious but less likely \"elevated scenario,\" which would see infections peak at the beginning of May with as many as one million, and between 500 and 6,600 deaths.\n\"I know that these numbers can be overwhelming,\" Kenney said. \"But these models are not a done deal. I want Albertans to see them as a challenge.\"\nAs of Tuesday, 1,373 people in the province have tested positive for COVID-19, with 42 of them in hospital. Twenty-six people have died from the illness.\nKenney said epidemiological models suggest Alberta won't be able to start relaxing physical distancing measures until the end of May.\nOn the economic front, Kenney said, the government has already committed $12 billion to more than two dozen initiatives, such as deferrals on taxes, mortgages, utility payments, and student loans, and given extra money for homeless shelters and charities serving the isolated.\nThe third crisis crippling the province, Kenney said, was the collapse in global energy prices, made worse recently by a feud between the governments of Saudi Arabia and Russia.\nThe extra spending already committed, combined with a collapse in provincial revenues, could see Alberta's budget deficit this year triple from $7 billion to almost $20 billion, he said.\n\"We will face a great fiscal reckoning in the future. I know that many Albertans are fearful of what lies ahead.\"\nKenney then referenced a quotation from former U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt, who told Americans in the early years of the Great Depression\u00a0that they had \"nothing to fear but fear itself.\"\nThe outcome of the health-care crisis, the premier said, will in part depend on what the people of Alberta do themselves in the coming days and weeks, on whether they continue to follow public health orders that have closed schools and most businesses and limited public gatherings.\n\"How this actually plays out,\" Kenney said, \"how many people are infected, how many die, whether we overwhelm our health-care system\u00a0\u2014 all of that depends on us and our choices.\"\u00a0\nThe countermeasures being led by Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the chief medical officer of health, are already working, the premier said.\n\"Our experts project that if we had no social distancing and public health orders in place, we could experience as many as 1.6 million infections, and 32,000 deaths in Alberta \u2014 as many as 640 deaths per day. Our health system would collapse under the chaos of that scenario.\"\nIn an address that referenced the Spanish Flu pandemic, the First World War, and the Great Depression of\u00a0 the 1930s, Kenney said the government's first priority will be protecting people's health and saving lives.\nBut the damage to the economy is also having an impact on the health and well-being of Albertans, he said, which means the province cannot solely focus on either the pandemic or the economy.\n\"The two are intertwined,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"We must do everything within our power to defeat the invisible enemy of the novel coronavirus. The more we do to stop the pandemic now, the faster we can restart our economy, and pave a path to recovery.\"\nAlberta's per capita number of recorded infections is the second highest in Canada, after Quebec, Kenney said.\u00a0\nIn part, that's because the province has conducted one the highest levels of testing in the world, he said, which has helped public health officials track close contacts of those who are infected, which limits the spread.\nAlberta reports 25 new COVID-19 cases, two additional deaths\nReinforcing Kenney's comments, Opposition Leader Rachel Notley said the projected numbers are not inevitable.\n\"Our ability to keep these numbers low is within our power and forms a shared responsibility for all Albertans,\" Notley said. \"This isn't just for our own safety. It's for those who are around us, for all of us. That means we must follow the advice from public health officials. We must take this seriously and continue physical distancing.\"\nBut she said relieving financial stress for Albertans also requires reopening the emergency support payments that closed Monday.\u00a0\nDespite the relatively high number of cases, the premier said, the rates of Albertans hospitalized with COVID-19\u00a0\u2014 and those in ICU beds \u2014 are much lower than\u00a0in Ontario, Quebec and B.C.\n\"The key strategy in our plan to defeat the coronavirus is this: to push down that peak of infections as much as we can, while pulling up the capacity of our health care system to cope,\" Kenney said.\n\"Thanks to the efforts of everyday Albertans to follow our public health rules, we are pushing that curve down.\"\nOnce past the peak, when physical distancing rules begin to relax, Kenney said, the government plans to use new methods now being developed to conduct mass testing, with the goal of doing up to 20,000 tests a day.\n"}, {"author": "Laura Meader", "title": "'Rents have just gone sky high': Cardigan candidates, voters weigh in on housing crisis", "description": "'It's nothing that a senior can really afford'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-housing-federal-election-cardigan-1.5304191", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5304279.1569947262!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/peggy-james.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Oct 02, 2019 12:44 PM AT", "2019-10-02T15:44:08.444Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Peggy James has struggled to find a place to live ever since she went through a divorce and had to sell her home in January.

But it's up to government to make sure they are addressed,\" he said.\u00a0\nGreen candidate Glen Beaton\u00a0says\u00a0a\u00a0housing availability has been lost to tourism rentals such as Airbnb.\n\"There's no question that's a major issue,\" he\u00a0said.\u00a0\nBeaton\u00a0said many more\u00a0affordable housing units are\u00a0needed \u2014\u00a0whether they're\u00a0co-op housing or government-subsidized through an improved CMHC program.\u00a0\n\"When you drive through the rural areas our housing in various areas is not very good,\" said Beaton. \"The present program is light on the number of units.\"\nBeaton\u00a0said wages\u00a0on P.E.I. have to be increased as well so people can afford housing,\u00a0adding the Green Party believes in eliminating tuition for post-secondary students, many of whom struggle to afford a place to live while going to school.\nConservative candidate\u00a0Wayne Phelan says\u00a0his party has already committed to using\u00a0excess federal land\u00a0for affordable housing projects.\u00a0He said said municipal, provincial and federal governments need to get involved in projects together.\u00a0\n\"They've got to sit down and say, where do we need the houses, how many do we need? There's no sense building\u00a025 when you have 350 people looking,\" said Phelan.\n\"You need more units.\u00a0It's that simple.\"\u00a0\nPhelan\u00a0said short-term rentals\u00a0should be taxed\u00a0the same as any other business, but added\u00a0he\u00a0believes\u00a0owners have the right to do what they want with their properties.\u00a0\n\"I have nothing against Airbnbs \u2014\u00a0they're very entrepreneurial, they're a good product,\"\u00a0\nPhelan said he believes\u00a0there was a\u00a0lack of planning by government when it comes to immigration\u00a0and population growth in P.E.I., which have\u00a0affected\u00a0housing supply and price.\u00a0\nHe said going door to door, he can't believe the number of empty homes he's encountered.\n\"Somebody owns a half-million dollar home and they're not living in it,\" Phelan\u00a0said. \"It does worry me,\"\u00a0\nLynne Thiele, Cardigan candidate for the NDP, says\u00a0co-operative housing and seniors housing needs to be increased.\u00a0\n\"There's simply nothing available,\" she\u00a0said.\u00a0\nThiele said the NDP\u00a0has a plan to\u00a0lower interest rates on loans which could help people get their first home.\u00a0\n\"I don't know how anybody can afford a home,\" she said.\u00a0\nThiele said creating affordable housing units\u00a0can't be left to the private sector and that\u00a0government has to step in.\n\"You can get those places going and help those places out right away,\" she said.\u00a0\nShe also said there should be better regulation of short-term rentals.\n\"A\u00a0lot of people are taking advantage of ordinary apartments that would have been used for long-term rentals and they're moving people out and creating an Airbnb.\"\u00a0\nShe questions the benefit to the community\u00a0if people are being forced out to create a\u00a0business.\u00a0\nChristian Heritage Party candidate Christene Squires says\u00a0she knows personally of the shortage of housing \u2014 she said she has\u00a0been approached several times by people asking if she would consider renting out a room in her home.\u00a0\n\"Funding needs to be addressed, to bring more funding here for housing,\" said Squires.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe's said she's not against short-term rentals.\n\"That might be something as a second income for somebody \u2014\u00a0I don't think that's taking away from housing,\" Squires said.\u00a0\nSquires said she is concerned about rising housing prices.\u00a0\n\"For the kinds of jobs that are here, it's not going to match,\" she said.\u00a0\nJames said\u00a0she plans to stay in her rented room\u00a0in Charlottetown, and wants to stay positive \u2014\u00a0she said she gets along well with the homeowner, and it's affordable.\u00a0\n\"I've just made up my mind that I'm going to like it because I have no other choice,\" she said.\nShe misses her old community but makes trips back to the Montague area to visit her doctor, volunteer\u00a0and do some shopping at the local mall.\u00a0\n\u00a0\"I would have like to have stayed in this area, but you know, you\u00a0deal with what you're given,\" James\u00a0said.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Elizabeth McMillan", "title": "Forget Toronto.

Their 10-month old son is crawling around, as their greyhound paces the floor before dinner.\nThe couple has less than 800 square feet of living area.\nAnd though they know they could sell their downtown home in a matter of days, alternatives are hard to find; prices in their neighbourhood have skyrocketed since they bought the property in 2017.\nAs part of their home search, they've started pitching themselves in offers to sellers, assuring them they won't convert the property to an Airbnb. They even include a picture of their baby.\n\"It's quite common practice now to give a story about yourself and your family in hopes that they'll choose your offer over someone else's,\" said Dennis.\n\"We're trying to say that we're a young family that has expanding needs and is looking for something we can grow into, something where he can make new friends,\u00a0have a neighbourhood where he can run around and play,\" said Gray.\nThe growth in Charlottetown's housing market is far outpacing markets in many other Canadian cities. Data gathered by the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA)\u00a0shows house prices have jumped 38.5 per cent in the past three years.\nBased on the areas CREA normally tracks, only parts of Vancouver Island and Ontario's\u00a0Niagara region saw faster growth during the same time period. By comparison, prices rose 25.3 per cent in Toronto, 21.6 per cent in Ottawa and 33.3 per cent in Victoria.\nThe latest CREA figures peg the average house price in Charlottetown at $277,000, up from $200,000 three years ago.\nBut a market where buyers get into bidding wars is new for P.E.I., which recently surpassed 153,000 residents. Adding to the housing challenges, the rental vacancy rate in Charlottetown has been hovering around 0.2 per cent.\nIn the past decade, the smallest province's population has grown quickly. Thousands of immigrants have moved to the Island and many homes are being converted into short-term rentals for tourists.\nRealtors say people from other parts of Canada are also buying on the Island, attracted to the relatively lower prices and, in some cases, the investment potential.\u00a0\n\"It does happen, no question.\u00a0People are banging on doors, saying 'I really like your house, are you interested in selling?' And some people say\u00a0'yes, maybe we are if the price is right,'\" said Joel Ives, a real estate broker and the owner of Century 21 and Colonial Realty in Charlottetown.\u00a0\nOther factors driving up the average price are sales of high-end, luxury homes and a demand for starter homes that has outpaced the number of new builds, he said. When new homes do go up, they are more\u00a0expensive than older homes.\u00a0Properties in the $250,000 to $350,000 range are particularly hard to come by.\n\"I think as we get some more supply in, that's going to settle it down a bit more.\u00a0And it already has,\" said Ives.\nWith property and infrastructure getting more expensive, Ives\u00a0predicts young families will have to adapt to moving to semi-detached homes or duplexes\u00a0\u2014 something that is still rare in tree-lined neighbourhoods around Charlottetown.\n\"It's always been somewhat of a struggle. Parents have helped children buy houses for generations and that'll continue,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, some people are moving further outside the city, where it's still possible to find properties under $200,000.\nDian Miguel and Ainsley Kendrick, who both work in tourism, have been packing up their downtown apartment to move to a more rural area.\u00a0\nAfter a lengthy housing search, they heard of one\u00a0property\u00a0the afternoon it went on the market.\u00a0By 10 p.m. that night, they were the fifth potential buyers to visit \u2014 but still managed to nab it.\nWithout money they tucked away while working in Toronto, they said they too would never be able to enter the market. Even still, they've had to pay more than expected for a property that will need substantial work.\n\"We find ourselves looking at our budget every day,\" said Miguel.\nMiguel and Kendrick moved to P.E.I. two years ago, just as prices were rising and apartments had started becoming harder to find. Though the Island's housing prices may seem enviable to their friends back in Ontario, the move was a trade-off. They now earn half as much as they previously did.\n\"For people in an industry like ours, it's seasonal. We're not working for government, nothing is guaranteed for us. If the cruise ships stop coming, there goes half of our business,\" said Miguel.\nThough they\u00a0rely on the tourism industry, they're also\u00a0perturbed after\u00a0seeing\u00a0numerous neighbouring rentals sell\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and then\u00a0reopen as Airbnbs.\n\"It's a catch-22 for us,\u00a0because we want more tourists here, but we don't want them taking up spaces for the community. We think there are other options for that,\" said Kendrick.\n\"The rental market is way scarier right now than buying a house. That's why we made that leap to buying a home;\u00a0we felt we had less risk,\" Miguel said.\nMiguel and Kendrick are both part of a grassroots group, PEI Fight For Affordable Housing, that\u00a0thinks the various levels of government could do more\u00a0to tackle the Island's housing issues.\nDennis said she also worries that people who don't have the means to buy end up trapped living in undesirable rentals.\n\"There's a lot of vulnerable people who have been pushed to live in situations, very close by, that I don't even know if they're safe.\u00a0But where else can they go and what can they afford? We think about that a lot. We see it everyday,\" she said.\nShe and Gray, who have one vehicle and\u00a0would like to continue living\u00a0close to Dennis's workplace, are also considering moving off-Island\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to a community where wages are higher and rentals are more accessible.\nFor now, they're keeping an eye on every new listing;\u00a0they often run into friends when a rare showing of a downtown home pops up.\n\"It's really kinda cutthroat. You have to be willing to jump on a property when you see it, if it fits your needs in any way,\" said Dennis.\n"}, {"author": "John Paul Tasker", "title": "Scheer pitches east-west energy corridor, blasts Trudeau for 'all-out attack' on oil", "description": "Conservative leader insists he can return budget to balance without deep spending cuts", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-economic-address-energy-corridor-1.5138649", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5138706.1558026182!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/caucus-20190515.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 16, 2019 1:27 PM ET", "2019-05-16T19:56:59.567Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said today he wants to do away with many of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's economic initiatives \u2014 with the notable exception of the Canada Child Benefit \u2014 as he looks to balance the federal books and jump-start economic activity in Western Canada.\nWhile promising to lay out a \"positive vision\" for the economy, Scheer's\u00a0speech to the Economic Club of Canada took multiple personal shots\u00a0at the prime minister, describing Trudeau as an incompetent and entitled spendthrift who has put Canada on a path to economic calamity.\nScheer said that while economic indicators are largely positive \u2014 Canada currently has one of lowest unemployment rates in its history, a surging stock market\u00a0and economic growth rates as good or better than those in other G7 countries \u2014 he pointed to self-reported polling data that indicate\u00a0many Canadians surveyed feel the economy isn't\u00a0working well for them in an era of sky-high household debt.\n\"The economic indicators might say one thing. But the human indicators say something entirely different. People are only barely getting by. And they're not getting ahead,\" he said.\nScheer has the difficult task of running against a sitting prime minister in good economic times. Since Trudeau was elected, the country has added 1 million new jobs and, according to the latest StatsCan jobs report,\u00a0more jobs were added in April than in any other single month since 1976.\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau said Thursday most Canadians are better off than they were four years ago.\n\"I think Canadians will make their decisions based on those economic outcomes. I think people will see Andrew Scheer does not have a credible approach for the economy and our approach to the economy is actually working,\" he told reporters at an event at Toronto's Ryerson University.\n\"There are obviously continuing challenges ... people in Alberta are facing a challenge around the changing oil and gas sector. Those issues are real. But what we're also seeing\u00a0across the country is significantly more people employed.\"\nScheer accused Trudeau of fostering national disunity with the government's natural resources policies, saying two pieces of legislation in particular \u2014 Bill C-69, the environmental assessment overhaul, and Bill C-48, a northern B.C. oil tanker ban\u00a0\u2014\u00a0amount to\u00a0an \"all-out legislative attack\" on the energy industry that will \"deliver a death knell to a critical Canadian industry.\"\n\"You see, ladies and gentlemen, under Justin Trudeau, Canada has become a country of 'no'. We have what most countries could only dream of \u2013 a booming labour market, world-leading clean technology and a rich abundance of a finite resource the world demands \u2013 and under Trudeau, we're squandering it. We have a winning lottery ticket. And he wants to throw it away. Canada should be a country of 'yes',\" he said.\n\"Instead of unity \u2014 instead seeking to help all Canadians benefit from our nation's prosperity and natural resources \u2014\u00a0Trudeau has sown division.\"\nThe Liberal government has defended the assessments overhaul \u2014 which bolsters Indigenous consultation, tweaks timelines and ensures greater public participation in the regulatory process, among other changes \u2014 as a necessary step after a series of legal setbacks\u00a0put projects like the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in limbo.\nOpponents of the legislation say they fear it gives too much leeway to the federal environment minister and have dubbed it the \"no-more pipelines\"\u00a0bill.\nThe Liberals have defended the tanker ban legislation as a way to\u00a0protect the natural beauty of northern B.C. by blocking crude-laden vessels from the ecologically sensitive area. Critics say the bill shuts off\u00a0another potential avenue for energy exports in an era of severely constrained pipeline capacity.\nScheer vowed to scrap those bills\u00a0along with the federal carbon tax, and floated a new policy proposal \u2014 a dedicated, coast-to-coast right-of-way specifically set aside for energy infrastructure projects like pipelines and new hydroelectric projects.\nHe said with global demand for oil poised to increase in the coming years (he cited OECD projections that put \"peak oil\" demand at 2030 at the earliest),\u00a0Canada should position itself as a global energy superpower, given its considerable natural wealth.\n\"With a single corridor, we could minimize environmental impacts, lower the costs of environmental assessments, increase certainty for investors\u00a0and, most importantly, get these critical projects done,\" he said.\n\"The fact is, Canada has more than enough oil, not only to displace imports from the aforementioned rogue states\u00a0but to put an end to all foreign oil imports once and for all.\"\n\u201cWe could have a single corridor \u2013 planned up front and in full consultation with the provinces and with Indigenous Canadians who would share in the prosperity that it would provide.\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewScheer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AndrewScheer</a> pledging to build an east-west energy corridor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cdnpoli</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/m2g4P5SBtc\">pic.twitter.com/m2g4P5SBtc</a>\nWhile promising to keep the Liberal government's tax-free Canada Child Benefit if elected, Scheer said that, under his leadership, spending would be constrained and any new expenditures\u00a0would be cleared only after first making cuts to government outlays elsewhere to ensure budgetary balance.\n\"The message to politicians and top bureaucrats will be simple: you want to spend new money, go find it first.

Scheer insisted Wednesday that such cuts wouldn't be necessary, but he\u00a0offered few specifics on how he would manage that difficult fiscal manoeuvre.\nHe said he'd\u00a0cancel Canadian contributions to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \u2014 a $256 million expense \u2014 and wind down\u00a0what he called\u00a0the \"money-sucking administrative nightmare\" that is the Canada Infrastructure Bank. That bank has so far been a source of funds for Montreal's transit expansion.\nTogether, those two initiatives amount to only a small part of Ottawa's spending and account for only a fraction of the current budget deficit.\nScheer also said he'd end \"government handouts,\" or \"corporate welfare,\" for companies like Bombardier.\n\"Drastic spending cuts aren't necessary to balance the budget. Simply taking a responsible, measured approach to spending growth will go a long way. And that is what I will do,\" he said.\nHe also re-announced two economic policies: a promise to remove GST from home heating bills and make maternity and parental benefits \u2014 Employment Insurance (EI) benefits \u2014 tax-free.\nScheer also promised to \"rework the mortgage stress test,\" that the federal Liberals introduced to stabilize a hot housing market \u2014 a policy that's\u00a0unpopular with real estate agents, mortgage brokers and some would-be homeowners.\nMorneau said stress tests contribute to market stability and they're also subject to ongoing reviews. \"A big difference between Andrew Scheer and our government is we actually consider the evidence,\" he\u00a0said.\nGet analysis from our Parliamentary bureau as we count down to the federal election.

The retail portion of the\u00a0industry remains an important employer, and\u00a0with its glamorous\u00a0advertising and gleaming showrooms, persists as a quintessential symbol of consumer lust. A large Canadian auto parts sector is still a global player.\nBut\u00a0Ford's latest announcement that it is once again slashing jobs and shrinking its operations in Canada is only the latest signal that the car business is becoming less relevant to the economy and less important to many of our lives.\nAlmost\u00a0a year ago, General Motors announced it would be shutting down a plant this December, an unwelcome\u00a0Christmas present to Oshawa, Ont., which will likely lose\u00a0thousands of precious\u00a0industrial jobs.\nThe job losses may be part of a more general movement of industrial employment\u00a0from the U.S. and Canada to lower-wage countries, as recently described by Canadian economist and author Jeff Rubin.\n\"The North American Free Trade Agreement might have been a godsend for auto manufacturers, but it has been a nightmare for Canadians on the assembly line, just as it has been for their American counterparts,\" Rubin wrote\u00a0in the New York Times earlier this month.\nBut according to other analysts, the loss of car jobs is part of a larger global phenomenon sometimes called\u00a0the peak car hypothesis, usually attributed to British academic Phil Goodwin, a longtime transportation policy expert at University College London.\nA series of studies published\u00a0since Goodwin wrote about the subject seven\u00a0years ago\u00a0purport to show that due to congestion, rising costs, increasingly urban living conditions and the fact that consumer electronics have taken the place of the car\u00a0as objects of youthful consumer yearning, kilometres\u00a0driven per person have peaked and are starting to decrease.\nA flurry\u00a0of media reports in 2012\u00a0prompted by Goodwin and others like\u00a0Michael Sivak, from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, pronounced peak car had happened or was happening.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"Among the 15 economically advanced countries [Sivak] analyzed, he found that places with a higher number of Internet users correlated with lower licensure rates among youths between 20 and 24 years of age \u2014 including in the United States,\"\u00a0Scientific American magazine reported.\nSince then, many critics of the peak car theory have said the decline \u2014\u00a0in North America, at least \u2014\u00a0was due to the recession that followed the 2008 credit crunch. During research for\u00a0a recent story on mobility as a service, automotive analyst\u00a0Dennis DesRosiers told me that although figures show the growth in car sales had been tailing off, \"vehicle ownership in Canada is at all-time record levels, and it's been increasing.\"\nBut yesterday, a new report from the news wire service Reuters projected\u00a0that numbers out Friday will show that U.S. automotive sales in October\u00a0declined by 1.3 per cent, according to two automotive consultancies, J.D. Power and LMC Automotive. Canada is unlikely to do better.\nGrowing fears of recession may be contributing to the decline as car-buyers decide to make do rather than splash out\u00a0on a new vehicle. But the report says rising costs, partly because the cars being sold are pricey SUVs and trucks, are an increasing barrier, forcing automakers to offer large enticements.\n\"Incentive spending is on pace to exceed $4,000 per unit for the fourth consecutive month as record levels of old model-year inventory persist,\" the auto analyst report\u00a0says.\nSales of autos, as with other expensive consumer goods, inevitably rise\u00a0and fall\u00a0with the health of the economy. But as I have reported in the past, there is growing evidence that something different may be underway. Whether it is happening now or will happen eventually, the logic\u00a0persists that as more people move to\u00a0cities that are increasing\u00a0in\u00a0density, making roads more congested, the utility of owning a car will fall.\nBut whether ownership and kilometres\u00a0driven have reached a peak, what seems even clearer now is that as Ford and GM reduce their Canadian production, auto industry production here has\u00a0begun to decline, only made worse by the recent GM strike in the U.S. that led to shutdowns in the Canadian parts industry.\nBefore the Second World War,\u00a0Canada was the second largest car exporter on Earth. After the war, Canada slipped to number\u00a03, and with foreign competition and the export of jobs to low-wage countries, Canada's share has continued to decline ever since. Estimates show\u00a0production\u00a0down about six per cent this year, with sales down nearly four\u00a0per cent.\nIn the decades after the Second World War, automotive manufacturing was seen as a keystone industry for the Canadian economy, creating\u00a0\"core employment\" that brought money into the community and helping to sustain many more jobs, from shoe salespeople to accountants.\nAs well as providing core manufacturing jobs in its own right, the sector contributed to jobs in upstream industries such as design, engineering,\u00a0steel making and mining. With the globalization of the industry, now many of those jobs have moved elsewhere. And if we've reached peak car, it's unlikely they are coming back.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Kathleen Harris", "title": "Trudeau promises $40K interest-free loans to make homes energy efficient and safer from severe weather", "description": "Liberals offer retrofit program to assist 1.5 million homes with upgrades", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-climate-change-plan-home-retrofits-1.5296400", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295588.1569347814!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-liberals-20190924.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 25, 2019 1:14 PM ET", "2019-09-26T04:47:40.176Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is promising Canadians access to interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to upgrade old furnaces, replace\u00a0leaky windows or retrofit their homes to make them more energy-efficient and resilient to floods and wildfires caused by climate change.\nTrudeau is in Delta, B.C. today to make his party's second climate change action plan announcement of the week \u2014 a promise\u00a0to introduce a new program to cut energy bills and fortify homes if he's re-elected.\nThe Liberal Party says\u00a0the program would offer a free energy audit\u00a0and would help to retrofit about 1.5 million homes.\nHomeowners and landlords would be eligible for an interest-free loan of up to $40,000 for eligible\u00a0green-friendly renovations \u2014 such as high efficiency doors or windows, rooftop solar panels, basement flood-proofing or insulation.\nUnder the Liberal plan, the loan would be paid back over 10 years through a Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation\u00a0insured mortgage, a bank loan\u00a0or in partnership with a utility company through savings on monthly bills.\nCanadians who took out such a loan\u00a0could receive a cash incentive of between $250 and $750 based on how much energy waste they reduce.\nCanadians who buy new homes that are certified as zero-emissions would also be given a Net Zero Homes Grant of up to $5,000.\nThe Liberals also say they would invest $100 million in skills training to make sure there are enough qualified workers to handle the energy audits, retrofits and net-zero home construction.\n\"It's a win-win-win,\" Trudeau said.\nTrudeau said Canada has an obligation as a society to help those living in flood zones, who will face increasingly difficult decisions about whether to rebuild or relocate.\n\"This is a conversation we know is only going to become more difficult and more acute for more people over the coming years with the very real impacts of climate change,\" he said.\n\"Our commitment today is that we will be there with people, supporting them through these difficult moments in their lives as we fight climate change.\"\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer, meanwhile, used a campaign event in Quebec this morning to highlight his party's promise of a\u00a020 per cent refundable tax credit that could be claimed by anyone who spends between $1,000 and $20,000 on energy-saving home renovations.\nThe Conservatives say the $900 million measure, first announced by the party in June,\u00a0would allow Canadians to save up to $3,800 on renovations every year. The tax measure is part of the Conservative Party's overall climate plan, which includes a vow to repeal the Liberal government's carbon tax.\nThe Liberals are also promising to:\nAccording to the Liberal Party, the gross cost of\u00a0the measures would be about $370 million in 2020-21, increasing to $432 million in 2023-24. Costs associated with retrofits and the Net Zero Home Grant would be financed through the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation by drawing down on the Crown corporation's shareholder equity.\nCosts for training and flood mapping would be paid out of the government's general revenues, costing an estimated $70 million net in 2020-21, decreasing to $20 million by 2023-24, according to the party.\nThe Liberal Party has not yet released any independent costing analysis of its campaign promises from the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), as the Conservatives and NDP have done. The party repeatedly has said that further costing will be announced \"over the course of the campaign.\" Earlier today, the Green Party released its fully costed platform with analysis from the PBO.\nToday's announcement is the second in what's expected to be a series of Liberal platform promises related to action on climate change.\nOn Tuesday, Trudeau announced that a re-elected Liberal government would halve the corporate tax rate for companies that develop or manufacture products with zero emissions \u2014 part of the party's plan to move to net-zero emissions by 2050.\nEligible sectors could include manufacturing related to renewable energy, production of renewable fuels, zero emission vehicles and batteries for them, carbon capture and removal technology and electric vehicle charging systems.\nIt's part of the Liberal promise to push Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050. The European Union and other countries made the same climate pledge at the United Nations in New York City this week.\nThe Liberal Party's plan is to set legally-binding, five-year milestones to reach net-zero emissions in 30 years. The party says the net-zero plan would be based on the advice of scientists, economists and other experts, as well as consultations with Canadians.\nNet-zero means some sectors could still emit carbon pollution, but those emissions would be offset by other actions such as planting trees.\n"}, {"author": "Kyle Bakx", "title": "Recounting a devastating week in North America's biggest oil play", "description": "A day-by-day account in the west Texas oilfields as oil markets in a free fall", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/permian-midland-houston-1.5498270", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5498277.1584222566!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/texas-pumpjacks.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 15, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-15T08:00:00.547Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In Houston, the second week of March usually marks a highlight on the city's business calendar, a few days when the city hosts political and business leaders from around the world at what is arguably the most important energy conference\u00a0of the year.\nThis year, organizers pulled the plug on CERAWeek\u00a0\u2014\u00a0just days before it was set to begin \u2014\u00a0because of fears of the spread\u00a0of COVID-19.\u00a0\nIt was a sign of things to come.\nThe last week has been devastating for many oil producers in North America.\nAn oil price war launched between Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2014\u00a0combined with growing coronavirus fears \u2014\u00a0rattled markets to the core and sent energy prices spiralling to their lowest levels in years.\nWhile Canada's energy sector has struggled in recent years, Texas has been a haven as the home to one of the hottest oil plays in the world, the Permian Basin.

This area isn't a tourist attraction\u00a0but rather communities solely focused on the oilpatch. People here either work in the oilfield or cater to the sector by selling trucks to oil companies and teaching oilfield kids.\nThat's why everyone on the flight knew the week ahead was going to be grim.\nAround 9:30 in the morning, half a dozen trucks are waiting their turn to fill up on mud. The substance is used in drilling oil wells throughout the area.\nHour after hour, oil prices keep falling and it is the talk all around the plant.

Lankford is the company's vice-president of\u00a0Permian Basin development. He grew up in Texas and this is his 40th year working in the oilfield.\nBy his guess, he's experienced seven significant price crashes in the industry, but he admits the wisdom earned does little to anticipate what this depression will be like.\u00a0\n\"I think every one is different. This one is going to be a little different because it's dropping so fast. The fact that you think you're prepared for it \u2014\u00a0nah, you never are,\" he said.\nWith every spare minute he has, Lankford calls another client to check in. There is little panic on the other end of the phone, he said. Still, the two big questions are how bad will this be and how long will it last.\n\"Several years ago my wife and I were in Las Vegas when Frank Sinatra passed away. I said it was kind of like being in the Vatican when the pope passed away.

The Permian Basin extends into New Mexico and that's where one of its drilling rigs is working around the clock.\nHoffman is from Camrose, Alberta, but spends two-thirds of his time in Texas overseeing operations for Calgary-based Citadel Drilling. Traffic is heavy with workers and heavy trucks navigating the area.\nHe is convinced the company can withstand a period of depressed oil prices after surviving through several years of tough prices in Western Canada, before all of Citadel Drilling's rigs were moved to Texas two years ago.\n\"We've overcome a lot. We've come here and really done a good job and made a name for ourselves,\" said Hoffman.\u00a0\nThe 2,000 horsepower drilling rig, named\u00a0\"The Commander,\"\u00a0is hard to miss outside the town of Jal, New Mexico, with little vegetation in the desert to hide the towering red, white and gold machine.\nThe majority of the workers are Canadian. They fly in from across Canada to work rotations of 20 days on, 10 days off. Depending on what decisions the oil producers make, drilling activity could be impacted. For now, at least, there aren't any signs of disruption on the rig.\n\"No, I don't think we've recognized any real change.\" said Hoffman. \"Everyone is trying to feel out the process and see what's happening.\"\nThat evening, the crowd at the PNG Stadium in Houston is glaringly sparse. The annual rodeo is in full swing, but the majority of people are staying far away as the coronavirus threat increases.\nStill, competitors like bareback rider Pascal Isabelle from Okotoks, Alberta, bring some life into the giant 72,000 seat arena.\n\"That's a buckin' son of a gun,\" yells the announcer.\nJeremy Thompson watches the rodeo event from one end of the arena and sees parallels to what the oilpatch is going through, especially the bull riding.\n\"You do a lot of work in the chute to get that bull where you want it to go. and then you come out and it turns the wrong way and you're in the dirt. You're picking your hat up, dusting it off and wondering what's next,\" he said.\nThompson regularly travels to different parts of the U.S. to meet with clients and show off the software developed by the company he works for, Calgary-based Spira Data.\nWith the majority of the American oilpatch focused in Texas, he easily knows his way around Houston and other cities in the state.\nFor him, this week has been eventful as some customers are too preoccupied with the price meltdown and cancel their meetings with Thompson, while others seem more eager to move ahead with projects as they see technology as a way of being more efficient in their operations.\nThe following day, the rest of the rodeo is cancelled due to rising coronavirus concerns, marking the first shutdown of the Houston Rodeo in its nearly 90-year history.\nAt this point, oil prices are 40 per cent lower than they were a month ago.\nIt's the middle of an incredibly tumultuous week and at the Houston office of research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, analysts are looking into the financial health of companies to see which are best suited to survive a prolonged downturn, while also revising their forecasts and models for oil production and demand.\nAfter returning from a meeting with Exxon Mobil earlier in the day, analyst Brandon Davis sits down for an interview to explain all the developments he is seeing in the sector.\n\"We've talked to a lot of clients, both from the company side and investor side as well, hedge funds and things like that. I think the only thing everyone can agree upon is they don't know. It's an uncertain situation. Who knows what will happen with the Middle East and Russia. Maybe something will emerge.\"\nIn a sustained low-cost scenario, the larger producers are likely better off, while most distressed companies will likely be either junior or mid-sized firms. The oilfield service sector is going to have a rougher ride too.\nAt this point, the safest thing for the oilpatch is to plan for low prices for the rest of the year, said Davis. Then if prices do recover, companies \"have excess inventory you can bring online in that scenario.\"\nIt's another tough day for stock market investors who are awash in red ink with major stock markets down by between three and five per cent.\nAs stock markets open, there is red across the board again, this time as investors reel from U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement the night before to restrict travel from\u00a0Europe.\nIt's another blow to the oilpatch as it \"just adds to the negative demand impetus,\" said Ken\u00a0Medlock,\u00a0from inside his office at the Center for Energy Studies at\u00a0Rice University in Houston.\nMedlock already knows of several people who have cancelled flights and plan to drive to their spring break ski trips. Still, he anticipates even vehicle traffic will decline in the near future as anxiety grows about being near crowds.\nOn the production side, OPEC and Russia continue to pump more oil and sink prices further. Medlock says they are hoping to force oilpatch bankruptcies in the U.S. and restore more control over the global sector.\n\"That's the classic market share game. That's what that is,\" he said.\nMedlock expects consolidation in the Permian and for production to fall this year.\u00a0\nThe depths of the oilpatch's woes, though, are difficult to predict. Medlock describes it as a perfect storm with countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia pumping oil with all their might and the coronavirus sapping away demand more and more every day. The virus, in particular, seems to be the greater unknown for the sector.\n\"Any time you get into a discussion about fear that just embeds massive uncertainty in terms of how consumers are going to respond and what governments are going to do, etc.,\" he said.\nThe headlines spread across the Wall Street Journal, which arrives at corporate head offices and hotel doorsteps, all focus on the coronavirus, including \"Virus Batters Economy,\" \"In U.S., Threat Upends Daily Life,\" and \"U.S. Hospitals Face Major Challenges.\"\nThe week ultimately ends just like it began \u2014 in surprising fashion. Trump declares the coronavirus a national emergency, the Federal Reserve pours $1.5 trillion\u00a0into the American stock market and the Bank of Canada makes an unexpected interest rate cut.\nStocks jumped across the continent with the Dow up nine per cent and the Toronto Stock Exchange up 10 per cent. Still, the upward swing wasn't enough to salvage one of the worst weeks in the North American stock market's history.\nOil edges up slightly to $33.38 US a barrel. It still represents about a 25 per cent drop in one week and there are few clues about what the next week, month or year have in store for the Permian or oilfields across the continent.\n"}, {"author": "Kyle Bakx", "title": "Recounting a devastating week in North America's biggest oil play", "description": "A day-by-day account in the west Texas oilfields as oil markets in a free fall", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/permian-midland-houston-1.5498270", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5498277.1584222566!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/texas-pumpjacks.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 15, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-15T08:00:00.547Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In Houston, the second week of March usually marks a highlight on the city's business calendar, a few days when the city hosts political and business leaders from around the world at what is arguably the most important energy conference\u00a0of the year.\nThis year, organizers pulled the plug on CERAWeek\u00a0\u2014\u00a0just days before it was set to begin \u2014\u00a0because of fears of the spread\u00a0of COVID-19.\u00a0\nIt was a sign of things to come.\nThe last week has been devastating for many oil producers in North America.\nAn oil price war launched between Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2014\u00a0combined with growing coronavirus fears \u2014\u00a0rattled markets to the core and sent energy prices spiralling to their lowest levels in years.\nWhile Canada's energy sector has struggled in recent years, Texas has been a haven as the home to one of the hottest oil plays in the world, the Permian Basin.

According to the government's estimates, that would mean that nearly 1.1 million more Canadians would no longer pay any federal income tax.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau had promised during the election campaign that the tax cut would be the government's top order of business if re-elected.\nAsked during a news conference on Parliament Hill\u00a0if the tax cuts are big enough to have\u00a0a noticeable impact, new Minister of Middle Class Prosperity Mona Fortier said it will help Canadians pay for their children's activities and camp, or help them save for retirement.\nAaron Wudrick, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, supports the tax cut, but would have preferred to see reduced\u00a0tax rates instead.\n\"Nonetheless, we're glad that the government has recognized a lot of Canadians could use more money in their pockets by raising the Basic Personal Amount,\" he said in an email.\n\"The real concern that remains is spending. If they keep cutting taxes without getting a handle on the deficit, it's simply trading relief today for pain tomorrow.\"\nConservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre called today's announcement \"too little and too late,\" because taxpayers will need to wait four years for the full benefit, and because most of the increase will be taken up by inflation.\u00a0\n\"To restart Canada's weak economy, we need bigger and faster tax cuts,\" he said in a statement.\n\"Conservatives love tax cuts. They reward workers with more money to save, pay down mortgages or support local business and charities. However, the last time Liberals promised to cut taxes, they raised them. We'll read their latest proposal to ensure their deeds match their words. We'll also urge the government to consider bigger and faster tax cuts.\"\nThe Conservatives will review the motion and discuss in caucus before taking a formal position.\nWhen fully implemented, the tax cuts will cost $6 billion in foregone revenues a year, the Finance Department said.\nNDP finance critic Peter Julian proposed capping the tax changes at $90,000\u00a0and using the money to provide basic dental care for low income Canadians.\n\"We know that relieves pressure on the health-care system\u00a0and we know would make a terrific difference in the lives of those families,\" he said.\nLast week,\u00a0the Liberal government's throne speech said Parliament should explore the feasibility of a national dental care program.\n"}, {"author": "Jennifer Moss", "title": "HAPPINESS COLUMN | How the affordable housing crunch is affecting our well-being", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/happiness-column-affordable-housing-1.5376817", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5146801.1569956660!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-rent-sign-regina-sask-stock-rental-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 30, 2019 6:00 AM ET", "2020-03-31T15:24:23.533Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Take a moment to answer this question: How happy does your home make you?\nSome of you may say \"overall, pretty happy.\"\u00a0 Even despite its quirks or the current state of mess it's in; you like where you live. It's the place where you feel like you can unwind. It holds great memories. It's comforting and safe after a long day. Basically, it just works.\nThis is an example of how a home can make us happy.\nUnfortunately, for 1.7 million Canadian households who live in \"core housing need,\" their experience is vastly different. These Canadians may live in a home that is too small or too costly, or the place they live in is structurally unsafe, or their neighborhood is dangerous.\nThey may not\u00a0have a home at all.\nIn response to their current housing situation, many feel mentally and physically unwell. Currently, 283,000 households across the country are on a wait list for\u00a0affordable housing\u00a0with nearly two-thirds waiting more than two years to get access, according to Statistics Canada.\nThe lack of affordable housing is significant because the health effects stretch way beyond just those without access \u2014 it impacts the entire community.\nStudies continue to find a connection between affordable housing and improved well-being both at a personal and\u00a0community level.\nCanada Mortgage and Housing Corporation\u00a0surveyed 326 Canadian families who received access to affordable housing through Habitat for Humanity. The organization looked into changes to people's health\u00a0and how social and financial dynamics were impacted after receiving access to affordable housing. Three main benefits stood out.\nIncreased well-being and academic performance in youth: A\u00a0stable home eliminates frequent moves and fewer school transfers. Children have a \"home base\" where they can make friends, develop meaningful connections with their teachers and engage in extracurricular activities.\nThey also\u00a0enjoy school more, have\u00a0higher rates of attendance and better behaviour\u00a0while in school. They experience increased participation in sports and the arts as well. According to a\u00a0campaign\u00a0by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, children living in affordable housing are more likely to secure post-secondary education.\nImproved mental and physical health: There are many ways living in stable, affordable housing helps improve an individual's mental health. This can include\u00a0reduced financial stress and improved family dynamics. Also, moving away from areas where high crime rates are an issue\u00a0unburdens the stress of living in a state of fight or flight.\nFor those who were previously living in unsafe conditions, this posed a massive risk to their health. Over 70 per cent\u00a0said they've experienced\u00a0fewer colds, flus, allergies\u00a0and\u00a0asthma symptoms.\nFinancial stability:\u00a0To sustain mental wellness and happiness, it is key to be able access affordable housing because it allows for money left over for other key expenses, such as food and services, and additional healthcare costs like dentists and out of pocket expenses that the healthcare system may not cover.\nIn Canada, access to affordable housing is challenging, particularly when so many are spending half of their income on housing \u2014\u00a030 per cent\u00a0is the norm. This means that Canadians who might be making a decent income\u00a0are still paying way too much for a home.\nUnfortunately, it's the most vulnerable who are hit the hardest. For those in the lowest income bracket across the country, they pay nearly 70 per cent\u00a0of their income on housing each month \u2014\u00a0that is just astronomically high and leaves no room for even the basics like food and clothing.\nThe current federal government is four years into a 10-year strategy that aims to build more affordable housing and offer rent subsidies. They've allocated $40-billion in financial commitment with a goal to build 100,000 affordable housing units over a decade.\nThe most recent budget added some additional first-time buyer initiatives and more resources to solving homelessness, but in the meantime, other innovative ideas have come into view. For example, Toronto HomeShare is a City of Toronto program that matches older adults with university and college students seeking affordable housing.\nIn exchange for reduced rent of $400 to $600 per month, the student provides up to seven hours of companionship and/or assistance with light household tasks like preparing and sharing meals, tidying up, carrying groceries, or walking a pet. In return, the householder gets weekly support, overnight security, guaranteed companionship and (hopefully) friendship.\nThere is also an Ontario Homeshare program as well as a McMaster University initiative named Symbiosis that are helping to spread these alternative solutions. When we come up with social innovations focused on solving for the greater good, they tend of have positive knock-on effects for our communities.\nIt's also important to remember that big wealth gaps are found in the least happy countries around the world and in reality only serve a small portion of the population.\nTo enjoy diverse and thriving communities, we need to consider how all income levels can intersect.\nWhen there is equity, we find dignity \u2014\u00a0a key aspect of human flourishing.\nWhen we have equity, we give every person the chance to have safety and comfort, a space with all its quirks and gifts, its mess and sanctitude.\nWhen we have equity, we give everyone a place they can call home.\n"}, {"author": "Kathleen Harris", "title": "PM says closures, social distancing measures could be in place for weeks or months", "description": "COVID-19 emergency funds will be flowing in 2 to 3 weeks, government promises", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/morneau-coronavirus-funding-1.5502562", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5503227.1584642583!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cda-coronavirus-20200319.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 19, 2020 9:30 AM ET", "2020-03-19T19:32:27.082Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered more assurances today that the government would help all Canadians through the COVID-19 crisis \u2014 but warned that \"extraordinary\" measures to contain the virus could be in place for weeks or months.\nSpeaking from his residence at Rideau Cottage where he remains in self-isolation, Trudeau urged everyone\u00a0who can to donate blood.

Tam said the number of cases is expected to climb\u00a0and it\u00a0could take weeks before officials can determine the impact of mitigation measures such as social distancing and\u00a0social isolation.\nTo date, Tam said,\u00a0there has been no evidence of substantial community transmission \u2014\u00a0but\u00a0that could change.\n\"I don't want people to be complacent because I do think that with this trajectory and the increasing in numbers, we have some degree of community transmission. But anything that's more widespread, any severe spectrum, we will detect it Canada,\" she said. \"That much we know.\"\nTam has warned Canadians that there could be a second wave of infections. The goal now, she said, is to slow the rate of transmission to avoid a sudden spike in cases that could overload the health care system.\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland\u00a0said today that all asylum-seekers crossing into Canada at Roxham Road in Quebec will now be required to go under quarantine for 14 days upon arrival, and that the federal government will supply a place for them to stay.\n\"We are going to find a place where that can happen,\" she said.\nHealth Minister Patty Hajdu\u00a0said the challenge facing the federal government\u00a0is not to find the\u00a0money to pay for the pandemic measures, but rather to mobilize\u00a0enough\u00a0research capacity to find a vaccine\u00a0and\u00a0ensure\u00a0people follow best practices to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\"I think it's important for Canadians to know that money will not be a barrier, but what we are relying on is really the collective actions in a time where there is so much uncertainty,\" she said.\n\"We need Canadians to take action, we need our research community to take action, we need our political system to take action. And we need to do that together.\"\n\"We will spend whatever it takes to support the health and safety of Canadians,\" Freeland said.\nEarlier Thursday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Canadians worried about having enough money to pay for food, rent and medication can expect emergency funds in two to three weeks.\nIn an interview with CBC News Network, Morneau\u00a0said the government understands the urgency of the situation and is leveraging existing government social services\u00a0to get money out the door.\nThe government has waived the one-week wait for employment insurance sickness benefits and announced a series of new measures Wednesday to help Canadians and businesses taking a financial hit from the pandemic.\n\"One of them, very clearly, is setting up this new approach for people that are not in the employment insurance system. And that, we expect, will be able to have money to people in the two to three-week time period,\" Morneau said.\n\"If we could find a way to sit down at a desk and write cheques today, we would. This is the fastest way we can determine how to get money out to people.\"\nMorneau\u00a0said the government is working hour-by-hour to find\u00a0ways to release funds more rapidly. He said Parliament could be recalled this weekend or early next week to pass the legislation required to distribute the money.\nWednesday's $82-billion emergency response package includes $27 billion in\u00a0direct supports and another $55 billion in tax deferrals.\nThe supports aim to help\u00a0Canadians pay for rent and groceries, to help businesses continue to meet payroll and pay bills, and to stabilize the economy.\nThe emergency aid plan includes:\nOther measures include a GST credit for low-income Canadians and special\u00a0support for the homeless and shelters helping people escaping gender-based violence.\nMorneau said the government is also working with the private sector to find ways to help Canadians. Banks, for example, could be flexible with mortgage and loan payments to help people who are struggling\u00a0financially.\nHe said there is no way to know how the pandemic will affect\u00a0the economy at this stage, or how long those effects will last,\u00a0but he is confident the crisis is temporary. Canada is well-positioned to deal with the challenge due to a talented workforce, a strong health-care system and a government with the capacity to financially support Canadians and businesses, he said.\n\"This is going to be all hands on deck for a long time until we get through this,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Toronto area housing sales up 24.3% in July, prices rise due to tighter supply", "description": "Overall average selling price for properties in GTA was $806,755", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-home-sales-1.5237143", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5237166.1565368546!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/luxury-home-report-20181023.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 06, 2019 9:25 AM ET", "2019-08-09T16:36:32.577Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Greater Toronto Area's home price index was up 4.4 per cent last month as the supply of properties for sale tightened and the number of sales jumped 24.3 per cent from July last year, the Toronto Real Estate Board reports.\nThe overall average selling price for properties in the Greater Toronto Area was up 3.2 per cent year-over-year to $806,755, TREB said in a monthly report issued Tuesday.\nThe number of properties sold increased to 8,595 from 6,916, with sales of all four categories of housing up by double digits.\n\"Broadly speaking, increased competition between buyers for available properties has resulted in relatively strong price growth above the rate of inflation for semi-detached houses, townhouses and condominium apartments,\" Jason Mercer, the real estate board's chief market analyst, said in a statement.\nOn the other hand, he said, sales of fully detached homes have been more affected by a stress test required for federally regulated mortgages and the average price for that category of housing was down 0.9 per cent overall.\nIn the City of Toronto itself, the average price for fully detached homes fell 9.1 per cent to $1.23 million, offsetting a 2.5 per cent increase in the surrounding 905 area to an average of $929,633.\nTREB says that the supply of properties for sale in the Greater Toronto Area was also tighter than it was last year.\nThere were 14,393 new listings in the GTA during the month, up from 13,873 in July 2018, but the total number of active listings at the end of July was down 9.1 per cent from a year ago.\nTREB CEO John DiMichele said there's a growing demand for residential properties due to population growth.\n\"As more and more households come to terms with the stress test and move back into the market in the coming months and years, they could suffer from a chronically under-supplied marketplace and an acceleration of home price growth to unsustainable levels,\" DiMichele predicted.\n\"Fortunately, policy makers have acknowledged the housing supply issue and are working toward solutions.\"\nThe board said it welcomes a move by Toronto Mayor John Tory and the city council, which instructed staff to report on ways to increase housing options in neighbourhoods that traditionally have had single-family dwellings.\nTREB also said it supports provincial government consultations to \"spur on and speed up\" the development of different forms of housing.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Vanessa Blanch", "title": "'I've never felt shame like this in my life': 500 homeless, 5,000 await affordable housing", "description": "Despite desperate need for affordable housing, new agreement will create just 151 units in first 3 years ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/housing-affordable-lisa-ryan-cmhc-social-development-new-brunswick-1.5373494", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5383787.1576157813!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/karen-brooker-homeless-new-brunswick.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 04, 2019 6:00 AM AT", "2019-12-04T15:56:12.075Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When New Brunswick signed a $299.2 million\u00a0agreement with Ottawa under the National Housing Strategy, many hoped there would soon be affordable apartments for at least some of the 500 people across the province who are\u00a0homeless.\nHowever, more than eight months into the first year of that 10-year agreement, there hasn't been an influx of new units, nor a flurry of plans to start building them.\nIn the past year, Karen Brooker's situation has gotten worse, not better.\nThe 58-year-old Moncton woman is homeless and has been living at the Nazareth House shelter since Aug.\u00a01.\n\"I've been rattling doors, talking to people, and I can't find affordable housing.

Craig Sauv\u00e9, who is the councillor responsible for housing,\u00a0said he has been getting calls from all over Canada asking about his city's new bylaw.\n\"We've made it one of our core priorities \u2026\u200b \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bto make housing affordable for Montrealers\u00a0in the long run,\" he said. \"In order to receive the construction permit you have to follow this bylaw.\"\nSauv\u00e9\u00a0said there has been backlash from developers who\u00a0don't want to have affordable units in their buildings, but he is confident the policy is a good one.\n\"I want [developers] to make money, but they have to contribute and make a place for social and affordable housing for the neighbourhoods.\"\nThe City of Moncton has an affordable housing plan. It doesn't include plans for a developer bylaw\u00a0but does include the goal of looking at the creation of a housing corporation and increasing the use of municipal land grants and incentives to developers.\nChris Gorman, who is also a systems manager at Saint John's Human Development Council, knows the names and the stories of everyone who is experiencing homelessness in Saint John.\n\"There is no one picture of homelessness,\" he said. \"The only truth is everybody on this list needs a home.\"\nOne of the biggest successes he has seen was a young man who was on the list for a very short time, and never heard from again.\n\"He just moved into an apartment, got a job immediately and is now fine. And to me that's the whole point of this \u2026 all he needed was an apartment.\"\nGorman said New Brunswickers have to decide what they want as a community.\n\"These are people that you grew up with. So do we value our neighbours? We have to figure this out.\"\n"}, {"author": "Robyn Urback", "title": "What's the difference between the Conservative and Liberal platforms?

Let's start to brand Calgary as \"North America's Family Friendly City.\"\u00a0It is our sweet spot!\nRecently, I sold two very cool Bob lounge chairs\u00a0on Kijiji (which I had previously purchased on Kijiji) to a Calgary newcomer who had just bought a new house in Airdrie with two living rooms\u00a0\u2014 a fact he shared with me several times.\nAfter we loaded the first chair into the back of his new Kia Telluride, with his young daughter sleeping in the back seat, I had to ask, \"What brought you to Calgary?\"\u00a0\nHe told me he and his wife were living in a small flat in Paris with two children and another on the way and decided they needed to live somewhere more family friendly.\nHe smiled and said, \"We were living the good life in Paris, but realized we needed more room.\"\u00a0\n\"Why Calgary?\" I asked.\nIt turns out these two IT professionals, born in Cameroon, picked Calgary because they could get a good paying job in their profession\u00a0as well as a big house and a big vehicle to get around in.\u00a0\u00a0\nThen the light bulb went on!\u00a0\nCalgary shouldn't be focusing on trying to attract the young-and-hip\u00a0tech worker, looking for big city culture and nightlife. We should be trying to attract the 30-something tech workers who are looking to settle down and raise a family.\u00a0\nCalgary needs to play to its strengths.\u00a0\nWhile Calgary is the fifth most livable city in the world (The Economist 2019 survey), it probably isn't in the top 50 (maybe 100) of the most exciting places to live for young entrepreneurs.\nI am betting Amsterdam, Austin, Berlin, New York, Barcelona, Paris, London, San Francisco, Melbourne, Sydney, Seoul, Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal enter their minds\u00a0long before Calgary. If Calgary ever does.\nIronically, as I was researching family-friendly cities for this piece, a German relocation service called Movinga published its Best Cities for Families 2020 findings that ranked 150 cities around the world. Calgary was ranked eighth.\nNot surprisingly, the top 10 was dominated by northern European cities, but a big surprise was Quebec City coming in at No. 2, just behind Helsinki.\u00a0Montreal finished ninth and Ottawa 14th. Neither Toronto nor Vancouver made it into the top 20.\u00a0\nCalgary ranked high in several of the 13 factors Movinga measured: affordability, education, air quality and neighbourhood safety.\u00a0Our high unemployment rate hurt us, as did children's activities, which surprised me.\nOne of the biggest barriers to raising a family in many cities is housing affordability.\u00a0\nSo, rather than talking up our new library, music museum, bike lanes or festivals, Calgary should be promoting the fact that you can buy an 1,800-square-foot house just minutes from downtown,\u00a0for under $500,000 US, or an even bigger house in the suburbs for the same price. This is unheard of in Vancouver, San Francisco, New York or London.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it comes to renting, a small one-bedroom apartment rents for $3,400 US in San Francisco or New York City \u2014 if you can find one.\nYou could get a $450,000, three-year fixed mortgage in Calgary for about $1,800 US per month, which would be an annual saving of $19,000 a year.\u00a0Or you could get a 625-square-foot, one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in Sodo (the shiny new 35-storey residential building on 10th Avenue in the Beltline) for about $2,000 Cnd. or $1,523 US per month, and pocket $1,900 per month, or $22,800 per year.\u00a0\nAnd yes, we should quote value in US dollars. Not only does it make our housing look more affordable, it also makes it easier for internationals to understand.\nAccording to a\u00a0study done by Zoocasa, based on December 2018 data, the most affordable North American\u00a0cities were:\nYes, Calgary is No. 1.\nSecond on the list of what makes Calgary attractive to parents is our average commute time: 26 minutes.\u00a0Compared with 68 minutes in San Francisco or 74 minutes in London or 43 minutes in New York City, this is a great selling feature for parents of a young family.\nCalgary is a great place for families to live because it is clean and safe, relative to other big cities. Also, our schools and health-care facilities are attractive and inexpensive, when you compare them to most other cities. Plus Calgary has one of the most child-friendly (read, fun-looking) hospitals in the world. Yet I can't recall ever seeing the Alberta Children's Hospital in a promotional video.\u00a0\nUNICEF's \"Child-Friendly Cities\" initiative encourages cities around the world to consider the perspectives, needs and interests of children when making decisions and developing policies and programs.\nAmong its key points, the initiative calls for children to \"live in a safe, secure and clean environment with access to green spaces,\" and to \"meet friends and have places to play and enjoy themselves.\" Hey \u2014 that's Calgary.\nDid you know that every Calgarian is within a five-minute walk to a park?\nYes, Calgary is blessed with over 5,600 parks and open spaces, as well as 1,000 kilometres of pathways, over 100 dog parks (dogs are a big part of family life these days) and 1,000 city playgrounds (that's about five per community, and that doesn't include school playgrounds).\u00a0\nAnd our modern recreation centres offer a plethora of programs and activities that makes them a welcoming gathering place for people of all ages and backgrounds.\nWhile some might say Calgary isn't family friendly because it is so car-oriented, I would argue most international families would love the fact that they can own a car and drive their kids to places, rather than using crowded transit or cycling \u2014 especially in the middle of winter.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd while it is legitimate to lament Calgary's car dominated culture, Calgary drivers are some of the most pedestrian-friendly in the world. There are not many cities where drivers routinely stop and let families cross the street (walking or cycling).\nCalgary is also one of the most ethnically diverse cities in North America, making it an attractive place for international families looking to raise a family in a welcoming society.\nBack in 2002, Richard Florida wrote a book called The Rise and Fall of the Creative Class.\u00a0His premise was that, in the 21st century, young creative professionals would choose where they wanted to live and work based on how bohemian, gay-friendly and ethnically diverse a city was.\nThe creative class included everyone from software engineers to dancers, from IT professionals to chefs.\nFlorida argued it would be the employees, not the corporations, who would determine what cities would thrive in the 21st century, as companies would move to cities where their employees wanted to live, or were already living, to avail themselves of the knowledge workers they needed.\nWe saw this exact situation play out when Amazon was determining where it would locate its second headquarters.\u00a0\u00a0\nFlorida created several indexes (bohemian, diversity, talent, gay) to help cities identify their strengths and weaknesses in attracting the creative class. Soon cities around the world were scrambling to see how they measured up and trying to determine how they could get themselves a higher ranking.\u00a0\nWhat Florida missed was the \"family friendly\" index.\u00a0\nWhat happens when the 20-somethings reach their 30s? Most of them pair up and start raising families, which means they start thinking about a house instead of an apartment, a mortgage instead of rent, a car instead of transit or a bike, and schools and playgrounds\u00a0rather than bars and festivals.\u00a0\u00a0\nPerhaps Calgary Economic Development should adopt the moniker, \"Calgary: The Family Friendly City\" or maybe \"The Family Fun City,\" as we try to diversify our economy.\nAnd how about including more families having fun in our promotional videos, rather than the young and restless.\u00a0\nJust a thought.\nThis column is an opinion.

Both the Liberals and the Conservatives unveiled broadly based tax cuts for the lowest tax bracket. Both plans were\u00a0simple, fair and efficient \u2014 a welcome departure from years of boutique tax credits that narrowly targeted small groups of voters.\nThen, much to the dismay of economists across the country, both\u00a0parties rolled out a series of very specific, very targeted tax credits:\nThe Conservatives offered up tax cuts that would allow businesses\u00a0with more than\u00a0$1 million in assets to shelter money made through stock market investments.\nThe Liberals offered interest-free loans to those renovating their homes to make them more energy efficient.\nThe Conservatives unveiled a $20,000 tax credit for energy-efficient home renos.\nThe Liberals offered\u00a0$2,000 bursaries\u00a0to encourage low-income Canadians to visit national parks.\nThat sound\u00a0you hear is economists across the country grinding their teeth.\nTo understand why these boutique tax proposals are so disappointing to policy experts, look first at why the broadly based approaches met with their approval.\nBoth the Liberal and Conservative broadly based tax proposals targeted the same group of Canadians. Two-thirds of Canadians make less than $46,000 a year;\u00a0both the Liberal and Conservative\u00a0plans would apply to that large cohort and reach a huge number of Canadians.\nThe duelling tax plans took different slightly approaches \u2014 the Conservative plan lowered the tax rate in that bracket, while the Liberal plan raised the amount of income that is exempt from taxation. But tax experts on either side of the aisle said they were a step in the right direction.\n\"[It's]\u00a0a\u00a0fair approach,\" said Aaron Wudrick of the Canadian Taxpayer's Federation. \"A simpler approach is preferable to what we've seen, which is increasingly micro-targeted boutiques, which ... again, are designed for their political impact rather than their policy soundness.\"\nBroadly based tax policies reach large swaths of the population. Economists say they benefit the most people and let them decide what to do with the money.\nEconomist\u00a0Trevor Tombe of the University of Calgary said he's a fan of such tax policy precisely because \"it doesn't care how you make your money, where you make it or what you choose to do with it.\"\n\"It leaves those decisions to you, your business and your family,\" he said.\nBoutique tax gestures, like the ones the parties unveiled this week, \"distort decisions and add complexity to the tax code itself,\" he said.\nMost economists say the best tax policies are simple and easy to understand.\u00a0They're good for the bottom line and they make tax filing less of a hassle,\u00a0renowned tax expert Allan Lanthier said.\nSmall, targeted tax cuts like the ones we saw this week \"significantly increase\u00a0the compliance cost [for] taxpayers,\" Lanthier said. Filers have to find their old receipts for their kids' art programs or fitness classes, decide whether the new windows they installed meet the new requirements, and send everything off to an accountant in the hopes of getting some money back.\n\"It adds complexity and costs,\" he said. \"And it adds a cost to\u00a0the [Canada Revenue Agency]\u00a0as well, because they have to process all these claims.\"\nAnd yet, such boutique tax cuts have dominated fiscal and tax policies for years.\n\"Most boutique measures end up being more about their political saleability rather than their policy soundness,\" Wudrick said.\nThere's a reason parties like boutique tax cuts: they're easy to sell. People see themselves in those boutique credits and feel like the government is doing something\u00a0for them. If you have kids in a sports or arts program, you'd welcome a tax credit. If you run a small business, you're probably cheering for the tax changes proposed by the Conservatives.\nBut Lanthier said their political utility doesn't make them good policy.\nAs an example, he points to the small business tax changes that were hotly debated last year. They were framed as a way of helping small businesses, the biggest source of jobs in the country. But a closer look at the fine print shows the changes would provide tax shelter to businesses with more than $1 million in so-called \"passive investments\".\nThat's not investment in new equipment or\u00a0new mortgages. Passive investments tend to be in stocks\u00a0or bonds.\u00a0Less than three\u00a0per cent of small businesses have more than $1 million in passive investments, meaning\u00a0these changes would allow just a tiny fraction of Canadian businesses\u00a0to lower the tax rate they pay on the earnings those investments bring in.\nToday's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CPC_HQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CPC_HQ</a> announcement *brings back* income sprinkling, and allows firms with $1million+ of assets to <br>shelter their savings in ways not available to other Canadians.<br><br>These proposals clearly benefit the highest earners who have private corps.<a href=\"https://t.co/2M15W61esk\">https://t.co/2M15W61esk</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/OvkaVJZXUk\">pic.twitter.com/OvkaVJZXUk</a>\n\"The stated objective [of the small business deduction], when it was introduced, is to\u00a0assist small businesses in growing and to create more employment,\" said Lanthier. \"The legislative objective was not to provide for someone's retirement.\"\n\"Moving toward something that's broad-based and simple is better,\" said Tombe.\u00a0\"It costs less to administer, it costs us less to comply with and it leaves us to make decisions based on their merits, rather than their provisions in the tax code.\"\nTombe pointed\u00a0out that there's still a lot of campaign left to go and the campaign to date has seen more actual policy talk than he expected. The parties saw how experts of all stripes applauded the broadly based tax\u00a0policies while denouncing the boutique measures. So maybe future campaigns will see a shift toward an emphasis on tax policies that are more clear, more fair and more efficient\u00a0\u2014 policies that make the tax code simpler.\nOr maybe the 2019 campaign will end up proving that boutique tax measures are here to stay because they work\u00a0\u2014 politically, at least.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada's economy grew at 0.4% pace to start 2019, barely ahead of late 2018 pace", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-economy-gdp-1.5157146", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2674823.1402676311!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/brp-annual-meeting-20140612.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 31, 2019 9:10 AM ET", "2019-05-31T13:12:12.075Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada's economy expanded at an annualized pace of just 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year, giving the country its weakest back-to-back quarters of growth since 2015.\nThe real gross domestic product reading for the first quarter followed a revised growth number of just 0.3 per cent in the previous quarter, Statistics Canada said Friday in a new report.\nIt was the slowest two-quarter stretch of growth since an oil-price plunge caused the economy to shrink over the first half of 2015.\nEconomists had expected growth at an annualized rate of 0.7 per cent for the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.\nThe Statistics Canada report said downward pressure on first-quarter growth was driven by weakness in net trade as imports increased 1.9 per cent and export volumes dropped one per cent for their first quarterly decrease since 2017.\nCanada also saw a substantial contraction of 9.5 per cent in its exports of farm and fishing products as well as a 2.8 per cent drop in crude-oil shipments.\nOn the positive side, the agency said overall economic growth was boosted by the highest quarterly level of household spending in two years, following broad-based increases that included strength in auto purchases and audio-visual equipment.\nThe economy also saw an 8.7 per cent increase in business investments on equipment and machinery \u2014 the biggest jolt in 23 years.

Let's start to brand Calgary as \"North America's Family Friendly City.\"\u00a0It is our sweet spot!\nRecently, I sold two very cool Bob lounge chairs\u00a0on Kijiji (which I had previously purchased on Kijiji) to a Calgary newcomer who had just bought a new house in Airdrie with two living rooms\u00a0\u2014 a fact he shared with me several times.\nAfter we loaded the first chair into the back of his new Kia Telluride, with his young daughter sleeping in the back seat, I had to ask, \"What brought you to Calgary?\"\u00a0\nHe told me he and his wife were living in a small flat in Paris with two children and another on the way and decided they needed to live somewhere more family friendly.\nHe smiled and said, \"We were living the good life in Paris, but realized we needed more room.\"\u00a0\n\"Why Calgary?\" I asked.\nIt turns out these two IT professionals, born in Cameroon, picked Calgary because they could get a good paying job in their profession\u00a0as well as a big house and a big vehicle to get around in.\u00a0\u00a0\nThen the light bulb went on!\u00a0\nCalgary shouldn't be focusing on trying to attract the young-and-hip\u00a0tech worker, looking for big city culture and nightlife. We should be trying to attract the 30-something tech workers who are looking to settle down and raise a family.\u00a0\nCalgary needs to play to its strengths.\u00a0\nWhile Calgary is the fifth most livable city in the world (The Economist 2019 survey), it probably isn't in the top 50 (maybe 100) of the most exciting places to live for young entrepreneurs.\nI am betting Amsterdam, Austin, Berlin, New York, Barcelona, Paris, London, San Francisco, Melbourne, Sydney, Seoul, Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal enter their minds\u00a0long before Calgary. If Calgary ever does.\nIronically, as I was researching family-friendly cities for this piece, a German relocation service called Movinga published its Best Cities for Families 2020 findings that ranked 150 cities around the world. Calgary was ranked eighth.\nNot surprisingly, the top 10 was dominated by northern European cities, but a big surprise was Quebec City coming in at No. 2, just behind Helsinki.\u00a0Montreal finished ninth and Ottawa 14th. Neither Toronto nor Vancouver made it into the top 20.\u00a0\nCalgary ranked high in several of the 13 factors Movinga measured: affordability, education, air quality and neighbourhood safety.\u00a0Our high unemployment rate hurt us, as did children's activities, which surprised me.\nOne of the biggest barriers to raising a family in many cities is housing affordability.\u00a0\nSo, rather than talking up our new library, music museum, bike lanes or festivals, Calgary should be promoting the fact that you can buy an 1,800-square-foot house just minutes from downtown,\u00a0for under $500,000 US, or an even bigger house in the suburbs for the same price. This is unheard of in Vancouver, San Francisco, New York or London.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it comes to renting, a small one-bedroom apartment rents for $3,400 US in San Francisco or New York City \u2014 if you can find one.\nYou could get a $450,000, three-year fixed mortgage in Calgary for about $1,800 US per month, which would be an annual saving of $19,000 a year.\u00a0Or you could get a 625-square-foot, one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in Sodo (the shiny new 35-storey residential building on 10th Avenue in the Beltline) for about $2,000 Cnd. or $1,523 US per month, and pocket $1,900 per month, or $22,800 per year.\u00a0\nAnd yes, we should quote value in US dollars. Not only does it make our housing look more affordable, it also makes it easier for internationals to understand.\nAccording to a\u00a0study done by Zoocasa, based on December 2018 data, the most affordable North American\u00a0cities were:\nYes, Calgary is No. 1.\nSecond on the list of what makes Calgary attractive to parents is our average commute time: 26 minutes.\u00a0Compared with 68 minutes in San Francisco or 74 minutes in London or 43 minutes in New York City, this is a great selling feature for parents of a young family.\nCalgary is a great place for families to live because it is clean and safe, relative to other big cities. Also, our schools and health-care facilities are attractive and inexpensive, when you compare them to most other cities. Plus Calgary has one of the most child-friendly (read, fun-looking) hospitals in the world. Yet I can't recall ever seeing the Alberta Children's Hospital in a promotional video.\u00a0\nUNICEF's \"Child-Friendly Cities\" initiative encourages cities around the world to consider the perspectives, needs and interests of children when making decisions and developing policies and programs.\nAmong its key points, the initiative calls for children to \"live in a safe, secure and clean environment with access to green spaces,\" and to \"meet friends and have places to play and enjoy themselves.\" Hey \u2014 that's Calgary.\nDid you know that every Calgarian is within a five-minute walk to a park?\nYes, Calgary is blessed with over 5,600 parks and open spaces, as well as 1,000 kilometres of pathways, over 100 dog parks (dogs are a big part of family life these days) and 1,000 city playgrounds (that's about five per community, and that doesn't include school playgrounds).\u00a0\nAnd our modern recreation centres offer a plethora of programs and activities that makes them a welcoming gathering place for people of all ages and backgrounds.\nWhile some might say Calgary isn't family friendly because it is so car-oriented, I would argue most international families would love the fact that they can own a car and drive their kids to places, rather than using crowded transit or cycling \u2014 especially in the middle of winter.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd while it is legitimate to lament Calgary's car dominated culture, Calgary drivers are some of the most pedestrian-friendly in the world. There are not many cities where drivers routinely stop and let families cross the street (walking or cycling).\nCalgary is also one of the most ethnically diverse cities in North America, making it an attractive place for international families looking to raise a family in a welcoming society.\nBack in 2002, Richard Florida wrote a book called The Rise and Fall of the Creative Class.\u00a0His premise was that, in the 21st century, young creative professionals would choose where they wanted to live and work based on how bohemian, gay-friendly and ethnically diverse a city was.\nThe creative class included everyone from software engineers to dancers, from IT professionals to chefs.\nFlorida argued it would be the employees, not the corporations, who would determine what cities would thrive in the 21st century, as companies would move to cities where their employees wanted to live, or were already living, to avail themselves of the knowledge workers they needed.\nWe saw this exact situation play out when Amazon was determining where it would locate its second headquarters.\u00a0\u00a0\nFlorida created several indexes (bohemian, diversity, talent, gay) to help cities identify their strengths and weaknesses in attracting the creative class. Soon cities around the world were scrambling to see how they measured up and trying to determine how they could get themselves a higher ranking.\u00a0\nWhat Florida missed was the \"family friendly\" index.\u00a0\nWhat happens when the 20-somethings reach their 30s? Most of them pair up and start raising families, which means they start thinking about a house instead of an apartment, a mortgage instead of rent, a car instead of transit or a bike, and schools and playgrounds\u00a0rather than bars and festivals.\u00a0\u00a0\nPerhaps Calgary Economic Development should adopt the moniker, \"Calgary: The Family Friendly City\" or maybe \"The Family Fun City,\" as we try to diversify our economy.\nAnd how about including more families having fun in our promotional videos, rather than the young and restless.\u00a0\nJust a thought.\nThis column is an opinion.

She estimates the backups have cost her as much as $3,000 over the years.\nThe most recent backup occurred on July 5. Ramsay said city workers came three days later to do repairs on the sewer line at the edge of her property.\nThat's when she learned the pipe was clogged with roots, that likely belong to a tree on city property.\n\"They had their camera and the camera wouldn't go any further, and then their eel wouldn't go any further. And the worker told me it was tree roots,\" she said.\nDespite this discovery, Ramsay may still be required to pay for the repairs to the sewer line according to city bylaw.\nOn Tuesday, the city's civic works committee discussed a letter Ramsay wrote requesting compassionate compensation.\nScott Mathers, London's director of water and wastewater, told the committee there are two options in this kind of situation.\n\"One is that they pay up front, or the other is that it be put onto their property taxes over a period of 10 years, with an interest rate of 2.79 per cent,\" Mathers explained.\nRamsay says the second option would require her to pay $117 for five months of the year, over the next decade \u2014 a cost she can't afford.\n\"I've got my CPP and my guaranteed income supplement and I get part of a widow's benefit,\" said Ramsay, whose husband passed away in 1999.\n\"That all comes to about $1500 and something a month.

I've got a nice garden, you know, I like living here.\"\n\"Where am I going to go? There's no affordable housing for seniors that's decent enough to live in.\"\nRamsay still has one possible avenue for compensation from the city.\nThe civic works committee voted on Tuesday to refer her case to the London's risk management division, which assesses claims for property damage where the city may be responsible.\nAccording to the city's website, claims typically take three weeks to review and investigate.\u00a0\nWhatever the outcome, Ramsay hopes she can continue to grow old in her own home.\n\"I'm really keeping my fingers crossed. That's why I did what I did, that's why I wrote the letter,\" she said. \"I just want to be able to live here until I'm 75 or 80 or 85.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Stocks fall as trade concerns spark growth fears, push investors to bonds", "description": "Each of the major U.S. indexes suffered their fourth decline in five sessions", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-investors-1.5154835", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5154868.1559162314!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/financial-markets-wall-street.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 29, 2019 4:41 PM ET", "2019-05-30T16:50:02.729Z"], "source": null, "content": "North American stocks fell on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing just above key support levels, as worries that a lengthy U.S.-China trade war would crimp global growth pushed investors into the safety of government bonds.\nTrade tensions between the two largest economies in the world showed little signs of relaxing as Chinese newspapers warned that Beijing could use rare earth elements to strike back after President Donald Trump remarked on Monday that he was \"not yet ready\" to make a deal with China over trade.

The current level of taxation for small businesses would remain the same.\nCalling her party's platform\u00a0\"comprehensive,\" May also is proposing\u00a0more affordable housing, electoral reform, improved Indigenous relations,\u00a0a single-payer, universal pharmacare system and dental care for low-income Canadians.\nThe Green Party also would eliminate fossil fuel subsidies worth several billion dollars annually, including those for liquefied natural gas (LNG), oil and gas projects and\u00a0coal mining exploration and development.\nMay said that, despite a promise to eliminate federal subsidies a decade ago, they have actually expanded for fracking and LNG development.\u00a0Under then-prime minister Stephen Harper, Canada was among the G20 countries that promised to phase out \"inefficient\" fossil fuel subsidies in 2009.\nA\u00a0Green government would halt all fossil fuel subsidies in its first year in office, she said.\nMay said that while she believes she is the best person to serve as prime minister, she conceded that prospect is unlikely.\nShe urged more parliamentary cooperation to accomplish real results and said she is not in the game for credit or to defeat the NDP.\n\"Overtaking the NDP isn't a goal. Ensuring we have good government and a strong Parliament is our goal,\" she said.\nThe CBC's latest Poll Tracker, which\u00a0aggregates all publicly available polling data, shows the Green Party now with 9.9 per cent support, with the NDP at 13.7 per cent.\nThe platform also promises to work with the provinces to establish a universal Guaranteed Livable Income (GLI) program to replace various other income supports such as disability payments, social assistance and income supplements for seniors.\nUniversity of British Columbia economist Kevin Milligan said the Green platform offers some \"visionary\" but costly ideas.\n\"They may be worthy policy proposals, but they will be expensive,\" he said.\nHe pointed to a means-tested guaranteed basic\u00a0income program\u00a0costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office\u00a0last year, which came with an annual price tag\u00a0of at least $76 billion.\n\"The Green platform commits to a guaranteed livable income\u00a0that would even more generous \u2014 no means testing,\" Milligan said in an email. \"We haven't seen a costing for this. The Greens are trying to offer both visionary policy and budgetary prudence, but I think they will struggle to deliver both.\"\nThere are also proposals in the platform\u00a0to protect consumers \u2014 including 'Right to Repair' legislation that would require manufacturers to provide consumers or repair shops with replacement parts,\u00a0software and tools for diagnosing, maintaining or repairing their products, for a fair price. It would also require them to\u00a0reset any electronic security that may disable the device during diagnosis, maintenance or repair.\n\"Setting product and service standards for consumer protection are well within the purview of government. A Green government will drop the hands-off approach. It's time to intervene,\" the platform reads.\nOther consumer protection measures in the platform\u00a0include:\nThe Green platform also promises to establish a Federal Tax Commission to analyze the tax system for fairness and accessibility\u00a0and says the federal tax system under a Green government would be based on the principle of \"progressive taxation.\"\u00a0The plan also includes a vow to find\u00a0a way to tax cryptocurrencies.\nThe platform also would introduce\u00a0a\u00a0corporate tax on transnational e-commerce companies doing business in Canada, requiring them to\u00a0register, collect and remit taxes.\n\"The e-commerce sector,\u00a0giants like Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, Google\u00a0and Uber, command a significant share of the Canadian market but pay virtually no tax,\" the platform reads.\nThe Green Party is also promising to amend the law on medical assistance in dying to ensure \"everyone has the choice of dying with dignity.\" It proposes giving every Canadian\u00a0the right to a \"living will\" allowing them to limit or refuse medical intervention and treatment.\nThe plan also offers $10 billion in post-secondary and trade school support and offers free tuition for all Canadian college and university students.\nAccording to the platform, the abolition of tuition fees would be financed by redirecting existing spending on bursaries and\u00a0tuition tax credits, savings from administering the student loan system, and the hundreds of millions of dollars in student loan defaults written off every year.\nOther measures in the platform include:\n\"Within the federal civil service, workers are still bullied by supervisors and redress is illusory,\" the platform reads.\n"}, {"author": "Meghan McCabe", "title": "As province gets stable credit ratings, finance minister says can't cut services for surplus", "description": "Tom Osborne is no longer promising the province will reach surplus in 2022-23", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/stable-credit-rating-services-vs-surplus-1.5298644", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5298748.1569527151!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tom-osborne.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 26, 2019 5:31 PM NT", "2019-09-26T22:51:37.783Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "With a second credit rating agency giving the province a stable outlook Thursday but calling for government to cut spending, the finance minister says it's not that easy.\u00a0\nAnd Tom Osborne is no longer promising to reach surplus in 2022-23.\u00a0\n\"I won't risk getting back to surplus if it means closing hospitals where people need them,\"\u00a0said Finance Minister Tom Osborne on Thursday afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We're going to provide the services that people need, but at the same time we are focused on providing fiscal stability and ensuring that tomorrow looks brighter than yesterday.\"\u00a0\nIn a press release, DBRS\u00a0confirmed Newfoundland and Labrador is at A (low) with all trends remaining stable, and said the government has \"maintained its plan to balance the provincial budget by 2022-23.\"\nAlthough it noted the fiscal and economic outlook are challenging, the government has \"significantly reduced annual budget deficits and slowed the pace of debt growth.\"\nThat's with a budget shortfall of $577 million in 2019-20 without the renewed Atlantic Accord, \"down from a peak shortfall of $2.2 billion in 2015-16.\"\nStill, the agency said structural measures\u00a0are needed to cut government spending.\u00a0But that doesn't mean the province will immediately cut spending to reach the once-promised surplus in a few years, although Osborne said they're \"still working towards returning to surplus.\"\u00a0\nOsborne said with DBRS and S&P giving the province stable credit ratings, and Moody's going down slightly, the province actually got better interest rates on borrowing than it has in recent years and\u00a0is in a \"very good place\" with lenders.\u00a0\n\"The same as a person sitting at home, their credit rating will determine what level of interest they'll pay when they get a mortgage or a car loan,\u00a0our bond ratings, to a large degree, determine what level of interest we pay when we borrow money on behalf of the people of the province,\" said Osborne.\u00a0\n\"We won't sacrifice services in making decisions solely focused on our bond ratings. They are important, but we still have to provide the services that are important to the people of the province.\"\u00a0\nOsborne noted all three credit rating agencies continue to cite the over-budget hydroelectric project Muskrat Falls as the province's single biggest financial challenge, but said they support the government's efforts to tackle that liability.\n\"If it was about political popularity, we'd still have a $2 billion deficit and we'd have a majority in the House. We've made tough decisions, we've paid a bit of a price for making those tough decisions,\" Osborne said.\u00a0\nOsborne said the province is moving away from the fiscal crisis of 2015-16, and he has \"a great deal of optimism for Newfoundland and Labrador.\"\nDespite mounting concerns internationally about what many call a climate crisis, Osborne said with 94 explorations wells and the oil industry confident one in six of them will be profitable, \"we've got a bright future.\"\u00a0\nHe added the province is \"dealing with the federal government on Bill C-69,\" which imposed tougher environmental requirements for things like offshore oil extraction.\nEspecially with Muskrat Falls power, Osborne said the province is at 98 per cent green energy\u00a0while the world transitions to a greener economy.\u00a0\n\"For the next 40 or 50 years we are going to need to use oil as a globe,\" according to the province's oil partners, Osborne explained,\u00a0using planes and boats as examples of that need.\u00a0\n\"Our oil is amongst the cleanest in the world, [carbon dioxide]\u00a0levels for our oil offshore are amongst the best in the world.\"\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and

he carries \u2014 apart from the hard hat and safety vest he wears \u2014 is his smartphone.\nThe 22-year-old received his mechanical engineering degree\u00a0in April\u00a0from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology in Oshawa, recently rebranded\u00a0 the Ontario Tech University, and is now a mechanical-electrical-plumbing\u00a0co-ordinator\u00a0for Deltera.\nHe's located on a project called The Well,\u00a0a residential and commercial development in Toronto's downtown core, one of the biggest job sites in Canada.\nThe technology on Rotaru's cellphone\u00a0makes his line of work \"just all around less tedious,\" he says.\nHis employer is one of growing number of construction companies to use web and mobile software applications to connect the back office to the construction site, collapsing data from armloads of technical drawings and countless spreadsheets and emails into something that fits in a back pocket.\nThat saves a lot of time and effort, he says. \"You don't have to climb up six levels of stairs to get a drawing.\"\nTech tools are not only a way of saving time \u2014 and therefore money \u2014 they're\u00a0a critical part of attracting and keeping generation Z and millennial workers who have grown up expecting the efficiency afforded them by their iPads and smartphones.\u00a0That's especially vital for the trades, which are working hard to overcome a labour shortage that stems in part from a cultural bias that pushes young people toward university and office work.\n\"We have this perception that these are second-tier occupations, and they're definitely not,\" said\u00a0Shaun Thorson, CEO of Skills/Comp\u00e9tences Canada,\u00a0a non-profit\u00a0that promotes\u00a0careers in skilled trades and technology.\u00a0\nPositioning industries like construction as more cutting-edge than people imagine\u00a0could help overcome some of that perception problem, he said. \"I think having those technologies will definitely appeal to young people and probably will help in the recruitment. I think it also demonstrates\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that there are a lot of different skill sets involved in these occupations, and they are complex.\"\u00a0\nThe tool Deltera\u00a0uses is called Procore, which in addition to managing all the data and plans associated with anything from a home renovation\u00a0to a sky-high condo development, also connects all contractors, subcontractors and trades\u00a0who work on a project. That\u00a0simplifies\u00a0communication and helps avoid\u00a0costly do-overs when work is done wrong simply because of a\u00a0breakdown in communication.\nKylie\u00a0Campbell, Deltera's\u00a0project manager for The Well, who works primarily off site, says there are six site superintendents working on the Deltera\u00a0part of the development,\u00a0all logging information into Procore.\u00a0\"It allows us to have a more detailed, accurate report as to what's happening on site daily.\"\n\"If anyone from head offices wants to know what's\u00a0happened on site that day, they don't have to make the phone call and have the site superintendents read their handwriting from their black pocket books anymore. They can go right into the system and pull up all the man hours, daily events, the concrete deliveries, the safety issues \u2014 anything they want to report on, they can do that through Procore.\"\nThe same goes for every person working on a project. A painter, for example, is much less likely to apply the wrong colour as a result of\u00a0consulting an outdated work order. Instead, plans are updated dynamically, eliminating the need for a lot of time-consuming email updates.\nAnis\u00a0Khoury, an enterprise solutions engineer for Procore who previously worked in\u00a0construction, said the mobile app makes all those tools handy, even if you're \"on the roof of a 60-storey building.\"\n\"And that all syncs as soon as you're back within Wi-Fi.\"\nHimself a millennial, Khoury\u00a0said\u00a0he's seen the industry become more willing to adopt tech tools in the past five or six years. He attributes that in part to the fact that millennials are now more established in the field.\n\"If you have someone coming out of university today who's applying for a job, and you're telling them, 'You're going to have to manage 300 quality issues on this project manually with email and spreadsheets,' or that you'll give them something like Procore where you can walk around, take photos, it's intuitive, it's easy to use, has reminders, actionable items, what do you think their reaction's going to be?\"\n\"They grew up with an iPhone in their hand, so this is easy for them to use.\"\nTech tools can help construction shake off an image of being a legacy industry, and instead \"It's going to feel like an advanced industry,\" he said.\nThe field was arguably a\u00a0little overdue for an efficiency upgrade.\u00a0\n\"The construction sector has lagged in productivity,\" said Brendon Bernard, economist for job site\u00a0Indeed Canada. That's in part because it wasn't as easy to apply high-tech solutions to the field, unlike some others such as manufacturing, he said. For a time that made it harder to raise wages because the industry wasn't getting more profitable.\nAccording to Statistics Canada's most recent job vacancy and wage survey, the construction industry had 42,690 job vacancies in the second quarter of this year, a vacancy rate of 4.1 per cent. That's higher than the national average across all industries of 3.5 per cent.\nThat puts the onus on the industry to do more to attract young professionals such as\u00a0Ariana\u00a0Rodriguez, a senior co-ordinator for quality control at\u00a0Deltera, who is also working on The Well.\n\"The younger generation tend to like to use their phone for everything, technology for everything. They may think that construction is\u00a0old school, like you only use concrete or\u00a0rebar.\"\u00a0\nIf they knew the industry is adapting these high-tech tools, they'd be more likely to pursue construction careers as she has, said Rodriguez.\nAlthough these construction jobs aren't readily available everywhere in the country \u2014\u00a0most notably\u00a0in the resource-dependent provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, which are\u00a0still climbing out of recession \u2014\u00a0Rodriguez said she feels there are lots of opportunities for tech-savvy young people\u00a0in construction who are willing to go where the work is.\nIn fact, after completing\u00a0a\u00a0civil engineering degree and working for a year in\u00a0her home country, Venezuela, she came to Toronto and completed graduate certificates in construction management and project management. \"Here in Toronto, the demand for construction is pretty high.\"\n\"Knowing how to use technology in the right way on a construction site is really on the money because not a lot of people know how to use it.\"\nJas Saraw, vice-president in charge of Procore's Canadian\u00a0operations, said, \"We have to look at construction as more of a STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] field moving forward.\"\nThat's an important part of addressing the skills shortages he hears about from clients.\n\"It's almost every meeting or every other meeting, we'll hear something about the fact that it's a competitive marketplace for talent today,\" he said.\n\"Younger folks in the industry, millennials, will go to a company that has forward-looking technology, rather than go to a laggard in the industry that isn't really thinking about the future.\"\nThe trick is making sure they're aware of the industry, said Thorson of\u00a0Skills/Comp\u00e9tences Canada.\n\"I think if we let students discover these occupations and give them opportunities to participate in them, put materials and tools in their hands, which would be some of the traditional tools as well as the new\u00a0tools that are being used, and then we'll see a larger uptake in students wanting to pursue that right when they leave high school.\"\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Transat still negotiating takeover with Air Canada, as rival bidder says counteroffer is coming", "description": "Two companies are still negotiating until exclusive window closes on June 26", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/transat-air-canada-update-1.5173967", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5138900.1558030331!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/air-transat-air-canada-composite.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 13, 2019 1:18 PM ET", "2019-06-13T17:19:12.817Z"], "source": null, "content": "A Quebec developer seeking to outbid Air Canada with a takeover proposal for Transat AT Inc. says he will hand a formal offer to the tour operator before Transat's exclusive talks with Air Canada end on June 26.\n\"We will file one, because they'e asking for one,\" Group Mach Inc. chief executive Vincent Chiara told The Canadian Press. \"We don't have any obligation toward Air Canada to respect an agreement.\"\nTransat began exclusive talks with Air Canada on May 27 after the country's largest airline made a bid of $13 per share or about $520 million.\nLast week Mach announced in a press release a higher offer of $14 per share or $527.6-million, which includes trying to convince the Quebec government to finance nearly one-quarter of the purchase.\nTransat chief financial officer Denis Petrin said the company has \"taken note of the press release\" but has not received a formal proposal.\n\"Should any further acquisition proposal be communicated to the company before or after the end of the exclusivity period, it will be addressed by our board of directors in consideration of their duties and obviously the agreement with Air Canada,\" Petrin said on a conference call with investors Thursday.\nUnder its offer, Mach committed to keep Transat's head office, executive team and decision-making hub in Montreal \u2014 all essential, it said, if the Montreal developer hopes to get the $120 million in financing it seeks from Quebec.\nChiara, who told The Canadian Press he aims to continue Transat's current business operations \u2014 with no layoffs or selloffs planned \u2014 said Thursday he spoke with Quebec Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon since his initial expression of interest June 4.\nKey to the deal would be proposed minority partner TM Grupo Inmobiliario, a Spanish real estate developer that would roll over its three hotels in Mexico to Transat, according to Chiara, who has criticized how Transat is handling its $750-million plan to develop a hotel chain in the Riviera Maya and the Caribbean.\nTM would contribute about $15 million in cash in exchange for a minority equity stake in Transat after the proposed agreement closed, Mach said.

It said fuel prices and exchange rates contributed to a drop in year-over-year profits last quarter, which nonetheless beat analysts' expectations amid higher revenues.\nNet income attributable to shareholders fell 71 per cent to $2.27 million in the quarter ended April 30, down from $7.94 million in the same quarter last year, the company said.\nOn an adjusted basis, Transat lost $6.31 million or 17 cents per share for the quarter compared with an adjusted loss of $456,000 or one cent per share during the same period in 2018. That beat analysts' expectations of a loss of 23 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.\nRevenue rose more than three per cent to $897.4 million from $867.2 million.\nThe company said aircraft fuel costs rose nearly 12 per cent year over year last quarter to $118.9 million.\n"}, {"author": "Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani", "title": "Trade war darkens economic forecasts for Canada", "description": "National Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut growth forecasts for 2019", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-gdp-banks-growth-1.5161849", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3209062.1518187080!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canada.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 04, 2019 4:21 PM ET", "2019-06-04T20:21:11.613Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Two big banks cut Canada's growth forecasts on rising trade tensions\u00a0this week, and others could follow suit if the new U.S. tariffs against Mexico are implemented next week.\nEconomists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch revised Canada's growth forecast from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent for this year, and made an even bigger cut to their growth estimate\u00a0for\u00a0next year from 1.8 per cent to 1.3 per cent.\n\"We had already marked downside risks to our GDP growth forecast for 2019 given lower oil prices and risks of trade war escalation,\" economists said in a note on Tuesday.\n\"With the U.S. threat of tariffs to Mexico, trade wars have effectively escalated, and uncertainty over global trade increases, which is negative for Canadian investment and exports.\"\nU.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed\u00a0in a news conference in London on Tuesday that he would likely order new tariffs on Mexican exports\u00a0next Monday, because of\u00a0a high number of Mexican migrants\u00a0entering the U.S.\nThe economists also said they believe that it is\u00a0now \"unlikely\" that the new trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico will be approved this year, because of the new tariffs.\n\"In our new numbers we are using our estimate that a 10 per cent\u00a0drop in Canadian exports would reduce Canada's GDP by 210 basis points,\" the report\u00a0said.\u00a0\n\"Strong domestic demand in the first quarter\u00a0shows that there is some upside risk to our forecasts.

With a population of 60 million, Italy has recorded at least 3,405 deaths as of Thursday, or roughly 150 more than in China \u2014 a country with a population over 20 times larger. Also on Thursday, a northern Italian town whose cemetery has been overwhelmed began loading bodies into trucks to move them to neighbouring provinces.\nItaly reached its bleak milestone the same day that Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged three months ago, recorded no new infections\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a sign that the communist country's draconian lockdowns were a powerful method to stop the virus' spread.\u00a0\nThe United Nations and Italian health authorities have cited a variety of reasons for Italy's high toll, key among them its large elderly population, who are particularly susceptible to developing serious complications from the virus. Italy has the world's second-oldest population after Japan's and the vast majority of Italy's dead \u2014 87 per cent\u00a0\u2014 were over age 70.\nIn addition, virtually all of Italy's dead had one or more underlying medical condition, such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension or renal insufficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Italy still has far fewer confirmed cases than China \u2014\u00a041,035 as of Thursday, compared to more than 80,900 in China.\nSchools in Italy are likely to remain closed beyond April 3, Italy's education minister said on Thursday. \"As Prime Minister [Giuseppe] Conte said, I think we are going toward\u00a0an extension of the April 3 deadline,\" Lucia Azzolina told SkyTG24.

He did tell her to tell police that she was afraid of Craig Loverin, a friend and supposed bodyguard of the victim. Police needed to know that, Keith Hobbs told Voss.\nCourt also heard that there were three houses suggested to Voss: one on Onion Lake Road, one on Edward Street, and one on Gemstone Drive.\nKeith Hobbs said he became\u00a0involved in the negotiations about the house purchase in November\u00a02016, and met with the alleged victim on the morning of November 16.\nThe victim \"seemed off,\" Hobbs told court, and while Keith Hobbs was going to suggest the victim give a home they already owned to Voss, the victim wanted to discuss purchasing a piece of city property behind one of their homes.\nKeith Hobbs also testified he felt the victim knew about a series of videos showing them acting erratically; Keith Hobbs had copies of those videos.\nThe victim then suggested giving Voss cash for a house, and then Voss could get her own mortgage. Voss wasn't in favour of that idea, however, Keith Hobbs said.\nKeen points out all the videos and texts the Hobbs\u2019 have could bring charges against alleged victim, yet still holds onto them until final document signed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think there was a time limit on when I had to come forward with this evidence,\u201d Hobbs. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hobbstrial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Hobbstrial</a>\nShortly after that meeting, the victim texted\u00a0Voss and told her they would buy her a home on Edward Street.\nHowever, things took a turn about a half-hour later, Keith Hobbs said, with the victim firing off a series of disturbing texts. The victim agreed to sign documents pertaining to the house purchase, but wanted that to happen quickly.\nThe victim then sent another series of texts, characterized by Keen as \"panicked,\" and suddenly offered a $1,000 signing bonus for Voss.\nKeith Hobbs tells court at that point, things went from \"signing these documents to extortion.\"\nKeen agreed, suggesting the change in the victim's tone came due to Keith Hobbs telling them about a series of videos that showed the victim acting erratically; Keith Hobbs had the videos.\nKeith Hobbs denied that, saying he hadn't told the victim about the videos at that point.\nKeen pressed the matter in court, pointing out that the victim was not concerned with protecting their reputation until after the November 16 meeting with Keith Hobbs.\n\"He spontaneously generates this fear after the meeting with you and your wife,\" Keen told Keith Hobbs.\nThat, Keith Hobbs said, had \"nothing to do with us.\"\nKeen refers to dealing with the victim post-November 16 as a \"roller coaster ride,\" with the victim making threats, and questioning the house purchase and who will pay for it.\n\"I guess you could say that,\" Keith Hobbs replied, agreeing that the victim did repeatedly change their mind, and extortion was mentioned.\nKeen also noted that after Keith Hobbs gave the videos to Loverin,\u00a0the victim offered Keith Hobbs a loan.\nKeith Hobbs, however, turned the offer\u00a0down, which he told court Wednesday would not have happened if he intended to extort the victim.\nThe question of whether or not Keith and Marisa Hobbs were motivated by their own financial situation has been raised before.\nIn videos showing OPP Det. Inspt. Martin Graham interviewing the accused that were shown in court, Graham suggests Keith and Marisa Hobbs attempted to extort the victim into buying a house for Voss, and pressured Voss into accepting it, so Voss could borrow money against the house, and lend it to them.\nMuch has also been made about Keith and Marisa Hobbs attempting to get a $150,000 consolidation loan from CIBC to pay off credit cards, and the fact that Keith Hobbs worked as a private investigator while serving as Thunder Bay's mayor; court has also heard he asked the victim for a job as a bodyguard, as well.\nBack to Thursday's testimony, Keen said the victim was trying to get Keith and Marisa Hobbs a loan at a better interest rate than what the Hobbs' themselves could get.\nThe victim also offered Keith Hobbs a loan on November 19, after Keith Hobbs threatened them with jail time over criminal allegations, telling the victim \"pack your\u00a0toothbrush\u00a0and your pyjamas, you're going to jail.\"\nOn Thursday, Keith Hobbs disputed the nature of that comment, saying it was a \"promise,\" not a threat.\nHobbs denies making any threats toward the victim.\nThe matter of a $10,000 cheque the victim offered Keith Hobbs comes up again. Thursday, Keith Hobbs testified that the victim never forced the cheque on him, but was pushy.\nKeith and Marisa Hobbs discussed whether or not to cash it. The victim would have to clear it through the bank, first, however.\nIn the end, the cheque was not cashed.\nKeith Hobbs told court his intention as far as his dealings with the victim was to get help on a deal involving CIBC, which Keith Hobbs believed could result in his receiving $2 million.\nHowever, Keen pointed out that Keith Hobbs knew about issues between Voss and the victim as early as October 27, as that's when Marisa Hobbs received a text from Voss alleging the victim had physically assaulted her.\nKeen asked Keith Hobbs why he waited until the next month to get involved in the house negotiations. Keith Hobbs replied that by then, he had evidence to bring to the police.\nKeen then brought up the final page of the house purchase agreement, which included a non-disclosure clause: if the agreement was ever shared, it would be rendered null and void.\nHowever, Keith Hobbs replied that he didn't want any of the issues involving the victim to be swept under the rug. He said he saw the agreement as a confession by the victim, and it wouldn't hold up in court as a legal document.\nIn fact, Keith Hobbs intended to void the document later, he said. He wanted to have a contract signed for the house purchase, however.\nVoss asked Keith Hobbs not to go to the police with criminal allegations against the victim, but Keith Hobbs testified he had an obligation to report them, court heard.\nStill, Keen continued to question\u00a0the timing, pointing out all the videos and texts Keith Hobbs had were enough to bring charges against the victim; Keith Hobbs, however, didn't come forward until after the house purchasing agreement was signed.\n\"I didn't think there was a time limit on when I had to come forward with this evidence,\" Hobbs said.\nKeen asked how the document would help with credibility, when there's a \"clear financial motivation.\"\nThe alleged victim was \"driving the bus,\" Keith Hobbs said.\nKeen suggests alleged victim is up and down emotionally, and Hobbs was frustrated, annoyed and up and down as well. \u201cHighs and lows\u201d Hobbs says. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hobbstrial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Hobbstrial</a>\n\"Why would you go to the police when you get a free home?\" Keen asked. \"What person in their right mind would go to the police when there's $429,000 on the line?\"\nThe extortion trial, Keith Hobbs replied, has cost him $500,000. In any case, the housing agreement, Keith Hobbs said, was part of his plan to bring the victim to justice.\nKeen said Keith Hobbs brought forward a document with some \"pretty powerful\" promises and inducements. As a former police officer, Keith Hobbs should have known better, Keen said.\nKeith Hobbs retorted he waited to make sure he had enough evidence, as the more the better for an investigation.\nAs for the meeting with Loverin in a grocery store parking lot, Keith Hobbs testified he gave Loverin a copy of the videos as a \"loyalty test,\" an effort to determine how faithful Loverin was to the victim.\nEarlier in the trial, Loverin testified he was given the videos so he'd pass them on to the victim. Keith Hobbs wanted the victim to know the amount of trouble they were in, Loverin told court.\nKeen brought up that testimony to Keith Hobbs, suggesting the videos themselves were an implicit threat against the victim, as by giving them to Loverin, Keith Hobbs was ensuring the victim would see them.\nKeith Hobbs disagreed, saying he told Loverin the police would be told, as well. His intent was for Loverin to stop working for the victim, court heard.\nLoverin had earlier told court the police already had a copy of the videos.

But playing too long or seriously can have potentially negative consequences. Where does that line begin and how can we spot it, in ourselves or others, in order to maintain a healthy distance? We spoke to Dr. Tara Elton-Marshall, Independent Scientist at the CAMH Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, to discuss why we like gambling, the effect it has on us and how to know when a fun time becomes a little too much.\nWhy are people drawn to gambling?\n\"There are a lot of different reasons people are drawn to gambling,\" says Elton-Marshall. \"Some reasons are basic, like that gambling can simply be an exciting and fun activity, or a good way to socialize, like how older people take casino bus trips as a way to interact with other people.\" She also notes that gambling \"is not always a problem, but can become a problem for different people in different ways,\" making it important to understand the dynamics at play.\n\"Gambling can trigger brain reward systems like a drug does,\" Elton-Marshall says, and with certain kinds of games, that trigger is even stronger. \"Slots are addictive,\" she notes, \"as they can set up reward mechanisms in the brain to keep trying to win. Certain components can make players feel as though they've won even when they've lost,\" like when you get a big return but it's still less than you've bet.\nDr. Elton-Marshall focuses a lot of her research on the rise of online gaming, an area she says has seen significantly higher rates of problem gambling.\u00a0\nWhat is \"problem gambling\"?\nDefining \"problem gambling\" can be difficult because it can mean different circumstances for different people. Losing the same amount of money could have a variety of impacts to people in differing situations \u2014\u00a0in that sense, even a small amount could be considered problematic. Which is why Elton-Marshall considers problem gambling to be any time \"it disrupts or negatively affects an aspect of someone's life.\"\nWarning signs\nPotential warning signs aren't always simple to spot. \"It's easier to hide than other problems,\" says Elton-Marshall, so it's important to be vigilant. Some key signs that you or someone you love may be developing a gambling problem include:\nLying about gambling\n\"This is popular with online gambling,\" says Elton-Marshall. \"Since there can be underlying\u00a0shame associated with it and it's not talked about or normalized as much.\" Any lying about gambling, for how long or how much you bet/win/lose can all indicate a growing problem.\nIncreased time and intensity\nA sudden spike in duration or depth of involvement can be an indicator, but again, there are different limits for everybody, so it's important to consider how that level of gambling impacts the rest of a person's life.\nMissing work/school/family responsibilities to gamble\nNo matter what the situation, not being able to meet or maintain non-gambling obligations (showing up for work or appointments on time, inability to focus on other tasks, forgetting important dates) is a clear-cut example of a negative external impact.\u00a0\nUsing gambling as an escape\nGambling can be used as a way to get out, have fun and socialize, but when it becomes a compulsive escape or one that doesn't really present a positive outlet at all, it's become too much.\nBetting more than you can afford or using money intended for other things\nIt depends on the individual and their own financial status, but Elton-Marshall says, \"People who start chasing losses get more and more in debt.\" When gambling debt occurs, people begin pulling money designated to other areas (mortgage, car/phone payments, groceries), and then the situation has begun to get out of control.

But playing too long or seriously can have potentially negative consequences. Where does that line begin and how can we spot it, in ourselves or others, in order to maintain a healthy distance? We spoke to Dr. Tara Elton-Marshall, Independent Scientist at the CAMH Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, to discuss why we like gambling, the effect it has on us and how to know when a fun time becomes a little too much.\nWhy are people drawn to gambling?\n\"There are a lot of different reasons people are drawn to gambling,\" says Elton-Marshall. \"Some reasons are basic, like that gambling can simply be an exciting and fun activity, or a good way to socialize, like how older people take casino bus trips as a way to interact with other people.\" She also notes that gambling \"is not always a problem, but can become a problem for different people in different ways,\" making it important to understand the dynamics at play.\n\"Gambling can trigger brain reward systems like a drug does,\" Elton-Marshall says, and with certain kinds of games, that trigger is even stronger. \"Slots are addictive,\" she notes, \"as they can set up reward mechanisms in the brain to keep trying to win. Certain components can make players feel as though they've won even when they've lost,\" like when you get a big return but it's still less than you've bet.\nDr. Elton-Marshall focuses a lot of her research on the rise of online gaming, an area she says has seen significantly higher rates of problem gambling.\u00a0\nWhat is \"problem gambling\"?\nDefining \"problem gambling\" can be difficult because it can mean different circumstances for different people. Losing the same amount of money could have a variety of impacts to people in differing situations \u2014\u00a0in that sense, even a small amount could be considered problematic. Which is why Elton-Marshall considers problem gambling to be any time \"it disrupts or negatively affects an aspect of someone's life.\"\nWarning signs\nPotential warning signs aren't always simple to spot. \"It's easier to hide than other problems,\" says Elton-Marshall, so it's important to be vigilant. Some key signs that you or someone you love may be developing a gambling problem include:\nLying about gambling\n\"This is popular with online gambling,\" says Elton-Marshall. \"Since there can be underlying\u00a0shame associated with it and it's not talked about or normalized as much.\" Any lying about gambling, for how long or how much you bet/win/lose can all indicate a growing problem.\nIncreased time and intensity\nA sudden spike in duration or depth of involvement can be an indicator, but again, there are different limits for everybody, so it's important to consider how that level of gambling impacts the rest of a person's life.\nMissing work/school/family responsibilities to gamble\nNo matter what the situation, not being able to meet or maintain non-gambling obligations (showing up for work or appointments on time, inability to focus on other tasks, forgetting important dates) is a clear-cut example of a negative external impact.\u00a0\nUsing gambling as an escape\nGambling can be used as a way to get out, have fun and socialize, but when it becomes a compulsive escape or one that doesn't really present a positive outlet at all, it's become too much.\nBetting more than you can afford or using money intended for other things\nIt depends on the individual and their own financial status, but Elton-Marshall says, \"People who start chasing losses get more and more in debt.\" When gambling debt occurs, people begin pulling money designated to other areas (mortgage, car/phone payments, groceries), and then the situation has begun to get out of control. To avoid this, Elton-Marshall suggests taking a predetermined amount of money with you when you go out gambling since, she says, \"ATMs can make it too convenient.\"\nGambling more to win back lost money\nElton-Marshall says that when you're at a loss, the answer is to stop, not gamble more. Looking towards gambling as the answer, when it caused the problem in the first place, can create a negative cycle that's hard to break.\nWaiting for the \"big win\"\nThe biggest illusion is that the \"big win\" is somehow influenced by how much or well you play. \"That's not the case,\" says Elton-Marshall. \"It's random and it's a false belief that you have better odds.\" Even in games that are partially skill-based (like poker), it's important to remember that gambling is all ultimately a game of chance.\nNegative emotions around gambling\nGambling stops being fun when it stops being fun.

Then, that house needed repairs, and she had to find another home for her family.\nShe's now sharing her sister's \"one-person\" house with six people. The unit has mould, and her child's health has been affected. But her sister has been on a waiting list for five years already.\n\"It's very stressful,\" she said. \"You get depressed.\"\n\"It makes me feel sad for my kids, that they don't have their own place to stay.\"\nGreen's story is not unusual in the territory, where the N.W.T. Housing Corporation\u00a0oversees 2,400 public units in 33 communities. In some places, like Paulatuk, those units\u00a0make up the majority of the housing stock.\nBut conversations about housing are taking on a new urgency as local authorities, contractors, and residents push for changes to \"paternalistic, colonial\" policies in the public housing system during territorial and federal campaigns.\n\"People across the North are facing the same crisis,\" said Jason Snaggs, chief executive officer for the Yellowknives Dene First Nation. \"The enormity of it is so great that, in my opinion, we need the equivalent of a Marshall Plan for housing, particularly within Indigenous communities, and in the North.\"\nPart of Snaggs's work is overseeing the local housing authority in Detah and Ndilo, where more than 70 per cent of houses are publicly-owned.\n\"It's a very difficult relationship,\" he said. \"We have limited control.\"\nSnaggs said eligibility rules mean residents are asked to pay expensive market rates when their salary increases by as little as $50.\nEven residents who aren't on restricted incomes have no options when it comes to housing. Government policies make it impossible to secure a mortgage to build on Yellowknives Dene land.\nThat means aging housing stock is left to decay.\n\"If you come to Ndilo and Detah you will see \u2026 houses that are derelict, abandoned,\" he said. \"There needs to be changes.\"\nDerelict houses are a sign of core housing need, a term used by housing authorities to measure the number of households either too expensive for their residents or otherwise inadequate \u2014 in need of major repairs, for example, or overly crowded.\nAccording to a 2014 survey, just under one in five households in the territory fit this definition. But in some communities, it's far worse.\nIn Wrigley, more than half of households surveyed in the 2016 census fit this description, with more than 40 per cent needing major repairs.\nIn Behchoko, one in five houses were crowded. In K'atl'odeeche First Nation, almost a third were unaffordable, meaning residents spent more than 30 per cent of their income on rent.\nBut even those numbers may underestimate the scale of the problem. In a different community survey, produced for the housing authority in 2017, more than half of respondents said housing conditions had gotten worse.\nEven where the territory is trying to tackle the problem of limited and degrading housing, its approach to contracting is raising serious questions.\nIn 2015, the housing corp. began construction on a new housing complex in Fort Good Hope, which a representative told the community would be \"the most expensive nine-plex in the N.W.T.\"\nAccording to Heather Bourassa, a local contractor, the contract was awarded to Tee Jay Contracting, a Fort Good Hope-based company owned by territorial candidate and former Sahtu\u00a0grand chief Wilfred McNeely, Jr.\n\"The project has been on again, off again,\" said Bourassa. For a while, it stalled \u2014 materials degraded and had to be replaced, and paint froze.\n\"It was just a bit of a gong show,\" she said.\nRecently, Bourassa said, the work on the nine-plex was taken over by Energy Wall, a Yellowknife-based contractor.\nThe crew, flown in to work on the job, was given a public housing unit to stay in.\nAs of 2016, 57 households in Fort Good Hope were living in inadequate or unsuitable conditions. The housing corporation's 2017 survey said nine applicants were on a waitlist for housing.\nIn an open letter to Tom Williams, the president of the N.W.T. Housing Corporation, Bourassa's brother, Robert, said \"the use of government accommodations is prohibited\" to contractors.\n\"There is a housing shortage,\" the letter concludes. \"[We] can't see any justification for putting a contractor in front of the people of Fort Good Hope.\"\nTom Williams and the N.W.T. Housing Corporation declined an interview for this piece, citing the ongoing election.\nThough increasing access to affordable housing was in the mandate of the 18th Assembly, the last government actually significantly decreased its contribution to the housing corporation \u2014 by almost 18 per cent from 2015 levels.\nThe federal government, by contrast, is contributing virtually the same amount now as in 2015, and actually boosted its contribution significantly in the intervening years.\nThe feds also signed an almost $140-million, 10-year agreement last year to provide \"long-term and predictable funding.\"\nDespite those boosts, the housing corp.\u00a0still projects a nearly $5-million deficit by 2020 \u2014 a year in which the territorial government plans to drop its contribution by nearly $6 million.\nOn the ground, the territory's decreased investment has had real consequences.\n\"We don't seem to build houses here anymore with government funding,\" said Sean Whelly, mayor of Fort Simpson. \"I'd say that the private market has done more to alleviate the strains here than the government has in the last five years or so.\"\nWhelly said private companies recently renovated about 20 units in town using funding from a discontinued housing\u00a0program.\nThe housing corp.\u00a0also contributed a few modular houses that \"looked like places designed for the High Arctic,\" he said, \"almost like leftovers from other failed projects.\"\nFort Simpson has had a strained relationship with the N.W.T. housing corporation since July, when it fired the local housing board and appointed a replacement.\nAt the time, the outgoing director said local boards were no more than \"window dressing\"\u00a0to give the appearance of local control.\u00a0\nWhelly said the incident was \"unfortunate\" and a \"distraction,\" but echoed complaints about the corporation's relationship with communities.\n\"I don't think there's a lot of consultation as to what kind of housing a community wants,\" he said. \"There's always \u2026 dog-and-pony shows going around, or whatever, but in the end they just do what they want.\"\nAlfred Moses, the housing minister, declined an interview for this story.\nSince its survey in 2017, the territory has done some things to make it easier for residents to take advantage of housing programs. It eliminated co-payments for several repair and maintenance programs, and committed to providing customer service training to all staff.\nIn some areas, it also committed to develop new housing policies in consultation with local governments.\nIn April, for the first time in a decade, the housing corporation hosted a Northern Housing Summit, bringing together bureaucrats, experts, and leadership from across Canada.\nOne of the speakers was Shelagh McCartney, director of Ryerson University's Together Design Lab, which is working with Yellowknives Dene First Nation to develop a locally-designed housing plan.\nShe said communities in the N.W.T. lack large parts of the \"housing continuum\" \u2014 a spectrum of supported and unsupported housing that ranges from homeless shelters to transitional homes, to market housing.\nMcCartney said committing to long-term, stable funding and allowing communities to dictate their demands is key to community wellness.\n\"I know politicians might not like that advice,\" she said, \"but when we think about wellness, and allowing people to see their future, and plan for that future \u2026 longer term funding is something that would work very well.\"\nSnaggs, the CEO of Yellowknives Dene First Nation, agrees.\n\"They also need to realize it's not about bricks and mortar, and wood,\" he said.\nOther government departments should get involved in developing financial literacy, helping communities with planning, and making sure housing is \"holistic,\" he suggested.\n\"They have to move away from the colonial past of the policies which do not help people,\" he said. \"As a matter of fact, they put them down.\"\nHe's seen some movement from the territorial government. In a letter he received earlier this year, Moses and Tom Williams, the housing corporation president, committed to provide $110,000 in funding for an $800,000 community plan, he said.\nBut\u00a0they haven't seen the money yet.\n"}, {"author": "Bobbi-Jean MacKinnon, Elizabeth Fraser", "title": "N.B.

Retired nurses have been brought in to help, she said.\nInformation brochures about the requirement for returning travellers to self-isolate are being distributed to airports, Russell said.\nHere is a roundup of other developments.\nA limited number of Service New Brunswick centres will reopen on Monday\u00a0for essential services only, said Higgs.\nThese services include:\u00a0\nThe number of customers allowed in\u00a0at one time will be restricted and customers will be expected\u00a0to remain six feet apart, he said.\nCash payments will not be accepted.\nThe centres that will reopen on Monday are:\nTwo major grocery store chains are taking steps to protect their employees from the COVID-19 outbreak.\nIn a news release, Sobeys\u00a0said it is starting\u00a0to install plexiglass cashier shields in all of its stores.\u00a0\u00a0\nStaff have been ordered to wash their hands every 15 minutes and cashiers will wipe down common areas more often.\u00a0\nStore hours have also been\u00a0reduced from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The first hour of opening is dedicated to allow seniors to shop.\u00a0\nThe reduced hours will allow\u00a0Sobeys\u00a0staff to have more time to sanitize stores and restock shelves.\u00a0\nLoblaw\u00a0stores have also reduced their hours from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. with the first hour dedicated to seniors and those with disabilities.\u00a0\nLoblaws will also begin to reduce the number of people in the stores at the busiest times.\u00a0\nBoth grocery stores have stopped selling bulk baked goods and bulk items and tried to limit purchases of some items.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, independent grocery stores like Victory Meat Market in downtown Fredericton are still open, but cashiers are wearing masks and gloves.\nRestaurants like the Snooty Fox and Cora's in Fredericton are closed until further notice, as required by the emergency declaration. Chess Piece, a local caf\u00e9 in Fredericton is still open to customers for takeout\nAlthough many retail operations have been ordered to close, NB Liquor and Cannabis NB stores will stay open.\n\"The concern here is not allowing the black market to explode at a time when we certainly need to maintain control of activities in our province,\" Higgs said.\u00a0\nIf businesses are not sure whether they should stay open, they are asked to call:\nThere is also a link on the Government of New Brunswick's\u00a0Covid-19 website.\nThe province is working with the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency to come up with a comprehensive plan to ensure any issues businesses may face during this time are addressed.\nWork Safe NB is also deferring premiums for businesses for three months. It will be visiting businesses to see if they're complying to the orders given by the province and to help make sure employees are performing their duties safely.\u00a0\nBusiness property taxes are required to be paid by May 31, but the province will review\u00a0late\u00a0penalties on a case by case basis to see if the penalty can be waived for financial challenges caused by closure.\n\u00a0Banks are also working with small businesses\u00a0to help them manage unexpected challenges. Higgs said this will include a deferral of mortgage payments for up to six months. It could also mean\u00a0providing\u00a0some relief to other credit products.\nA new link that offers a COVID-19 self-assessment tool has been added to the Department of Health's website.\nThe assessment tool has three parts with different coloured flags for the degree of symptoms:\u00a0\nEach category asks you to respond to a series of self-assessment questions and then act based on the answers. This will help New Brunswickers determine if they should call the 811 line. This will also help reduce the volume of calls.\nAccording to the government\u00a0website, there have been at least 509 negative tests done so far.\u00a0\nAt Friday's\u00a0news conference, Russell said 13 clinics are opening up across the province to increase capacity to test New Brunswickers.\n\"I can see the number of tests will most likely increase based on the fact that the system is now responding at this stage.\"\nAccording to NB Power's website, it will not be disconnecting customers for non-payment until further notice. The New Brunswick utility has also asked the Energy and Utilities Board to delay rendering a decision on its general rate application and for the request of implementing smart meters.\u00a0\nNB Power has also moved its operations to essential services only. This includes emergencies, outage restoration, moving requests and essential water heater services.\n\"We understand that New Brunswicker may have difficulty paying their bills due to illness, job loss, or requirements to self-isolate as a result of this pandemic,\" the website said.\u00a0\nCriminal trials in the provincial courts scheduled between March 23 and May 31 have been adjourned.\u00a0\nUnless someone has been ordered to appear or is in custody, Chief Judge of the New Brunswick Provincial Court Jol\u00e8ne Richard, said trials will be rescheduled to a later date.\u00a0\nPeople with trials scheduled must email or call the court where the trial was to be held to receive further directives.\u00a0\nWitnesses for trials between those dates must contact the public prosecution service as well for more information.\u00a0\nRichard said anyone who was scheduled to appear in provincial court for any other matter must call or email the provincial court office before that date to have a\u00a0 telephone conference with the judge.\nThe chief judge said urgent matters will proceed by video conference including hearings for people in custody, bail hearings, trials, sentencing hearings, preliminary inquiries, and youth criminal sentence reviews.\nPremier Blaine Higgs said, despite the U.S.\u00a0border being closed, Campobello residents shouldn't have a problem getting to mainland New Brunswick.\n\"We've been told by the authorities that residents of Campobello will be allowed to move equally,\" said Higgs.\u00a0\nHiggs said ambulances would be able to transport residents across the border without a problem.\u00a0\nNew Brunswick has decided to limit its explanation of where the cases are in the province to the medical zones they are in, without specifying the communities.\nRussell said the situation is evolving, and she may consider being more specific.\nBut she said case location shouldn't impact how closely people follow public health's directives during the pandemic.\n\"The message needs to be province-wide around staying at home and following these messages because we can't predict again which location we are going to see a case pop up,\" said Russell.\n\"We do have to be prepared for that in every corner of the province.\"'\nRussell said that if there is a case of COVID-19 because of community transmission, the public would be told right away.\nThe Department of Education has announced it will cover child-care fees for anyone who has lost their income because\u00a0of the COVID-19 outbreak.\nIn a letter to parents, Education Minister Dominic Cardy, said day-care centres who have laid off their employees cannot charge parents. But if a centre has not laid off their staff, parents will have to pay to ensure a place is reserved for their child.\u00a0\nHe also said that parents who are essential service workers won't have to pay double fees for childcare services, \"even if you are paying to reserve a space at your usual childcare facility but have your child attending one of the emergency child-care facilities.\"\u00a0\nCOVID-19 test samples\u00a0are sent to the Georges-.L.-Dumont Hospital lab for confirmation of the results.\nAt the same time, the lab would package part of the sample and send it to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada's only Level-4 virology facility.\u00a0The Winnipeg lab is equipped to work with the most serious and deadly human and animal diseases, such as Ebola.\u00a0\nIt's also one of only a handful in North America capable of handling dangerous pathogens.\nThe Moncton hospital has been processing around 100 tests over the last week, according to\u00a0Dr. Richard Garceau, a microbiologist and an infectious diseases specialist at the hospital.\u00a0\nThe hospital hasn't run into any backlogs yet, but Dr. Garceau expects the number of testing requests to climb.\u00a0\n\"We've seen a major increase in testing since the past seven days,\" Dr. Garceau said.\u00a0\nEarlier this week, the federal government announced it would provide an\u00a0$82-million aid package to help workers and businesses to cope with COVID-19.\u00a0\nThe announcement also included two new national benefits that those who aren't eligible for regular employment insurance can apply for beginning April.\nThe Emergency Care Benefit is for people who are self-employed or gig workers. It pays up to 15 weeks of benefits at a maximum of $450 per week, administered by the Canadian Revenue Agency.\u00a0\nThe Emergency Support Benefit provides up to $5 billion in support for unemployed workers who aren't eligible for EI.\nThe emergency benefits will be made available in April for those who don't qualify for EI.\nSymptoms of coronavirus can include fever, cough and shortness of breath.

But will it deliver?\nThe NDP plan carves out a middle ground between commitments to policies that might meet Canada's 2030 target from the Liberals, and the wildly ambitious platform of the Green Party.\nSingh's plan, though, is riddled with inconsistencies and short on details and, where details are given, the policies simply aren't stringent enough to meet the goals.\nThe NDP Plan highlights nine areas for action, of which six are related to reducing emissions.\nIn addition to setting new emissions targets, the NDP proposes a program of job creation through clean energy adoption, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, energy efficiency retrofits for buildings, cleaner transit, subsidies for zero-emissions vehicles and more involvement of Indigenous peoples in climate action.\nThere are also commitments related to single-use plastics, climate adaptation and the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).\nLet's start with their targets.\nWith all of the policies proposed to date by the governing Liberals, and notwithstanding potential reductions in the stringency of policies in Alberta and Ontario, we're on track for emissions of about 592 megatonnes (Mt) by 2030, well above our Paris target of 513 Mt.\nThe NDP plan sets a much deeper target.\nThey claim, with little evidence, that their policies will reduce our emissions to 450 Mt by 2030, and then add a statement that they plan to do more.\nThe monumental task of reducing national emissions by 38 per cent in 10 years is described as\u00a0\"an important first step,\" and they plan to add more measures to drive emissions down by a further 50 to 80 Mt, according to my calculations based on statements in the plan. We're just not told what those measures might be.\nHow is the NDP going to take this monumental first step? We're not told much about that either.\nThe plan states that the NDP will\u00a0\"continue carbon pricing, including rebates to households that fall under the federal backstop plan, while making it fairer and rolling back the breaks the Liberals have given to big polluters.\"\nWe're not told what the carbon price will be, just that there will continue to be one.\nInterestingly, later in the plan, the NDP has its own breaks for big polluters, although they call them a \"Low Carbon Industrial Strategy\" which will include\u00a0\"a fund that industrial operators like manufacturers can apply to in order to access support for investments in lowering emissions and keeping jobs here in Canada.\" This will also be complemented with a $3-billion \"Climate Bank\" that would provide loans to spur investment in green technology.\nThe plan tells us that\u00a0\"workers most impacted by the changes in our economy will not pay the price of action on climate change.\"\nHere, they draw on the work of the Task Force on Just Transition for Canadian Coal Power Workers and Communities, but managing a broad economic transition on the scale proposed by the NDP is an entirely different proposition than managing the impact of closing 14 coal power stations over 15 years. If you're not going to protect some of Canada's emissions-intensive sectors from competitiveness impacts, as the existing output-based-pricing system applied to industrial emissions does, you're talking about much more significant worker displacement still.\nWhat about oil and gas?\nFirst, the plan states that, \"where oil and gas will continue to form a part of Canada's energy mix in the immediate future, we will continue to prioritize domestic upgrading and refining instead of shipping our raw resources and jobs to other countries.\"\nDoes that mean new upgraders and refineries? Keeping the ones we have? Reducing production and export at the same time? If so, how? We're left to wonder.\nI was shocked that the plan doesn't even mention the oilsands, Canada's fastest-growing source of emissions, although it does mention bitumen once.\nThe plan also commits to eliminating oil and gas subsidies, claiming that\u00a0\"Canada spends $3.3 billion per year on oil and gas subsidies,\" and that\u00a0\"[the federal government] purchased the [Trans Mountain] oil pipeline for a staggering $4.5 billion,\" and that the government\u00a0\"gave another $1.6 billion in handouts to the oil patch.\"\nThese claims are worth unpacking because they're mostly smoke and mirrors.\nThe $3.3 billion number comes from a 2015 version of this IISD study, which is pretty dated when you consider how much has happened in oil and gas since then.\nThe up-to-date estimates from the same study group are smaller, with only about $380 million worth of federal subsidies on their list. Most of the subsidies in the original and up-to-date studies are attributed to Alberta and B.C. government policies: resource royalties, taxes, research grants and the like.\nIf Singh thinks the federal government can affect these policies, Sections 92 and 92A of the Constitution might have something to say about it.\nWhat about the $1.6 billion in \"handouts\"? That's where it gets interesting.\nThese were funds announced last year to, among other things, support investments in green technology and environmental efficiency. In other words, the same types of investments envisioned by the NDP's own proposed multi-billion-dollar Climate Bank and Low Carbon Industrial Strategy.\nAre we to understand that the NDP would not allocate any of these dollars to reduce emissions in the oil and gas sector? Or that similar investments made by the NDP would not count as subsidies or handouts for some reason?\nAs for Trans Mountain, the government did buy the pipeline for $4.5 billion, but this can't be seen as a direct subsidy, since the government also received a valuable asset in return.\nArguably, the pipeline expansion would not have been underwritten by any private sector company, but even so, the lion's share of the purchase price was not for the expansion but for the existing pipeline.\nInterestingly, the plan doesn't say what an NDP government would do with the pipeline, although presumably divestiture or outright cancellation would be on the list.\nIt's not clear in the plan how much the NDP expects these reductions in so-called subsidies to reduce emissions. What's certainly clear is that there are not billions of dollars worth of new dollars available to the federal government if federal oil and gas tax expenditures and other programs are cancelled.\nThe rest of the NDP plan for emissions reduction centres on three key commitments to buildings, greening transit and personal transportation and emissions-free electricity.\nThe NDP sets a target of retrofitting all housing stock in Canada by 2050, with half of these retrofits completed by 2030.\nHalf the homes in the country getting some sort of improvement by 2030 is ambitious in and of itself, but we're only told that\u00a0\"homeowners would be able to access low-interest loans repayable through energy savings to cover upgrades like insulation, windows, heat pumps, and other renewable technologies.\"\nInterest rates are already very low, so you're going to have to do a lot more than offer a low-interest loan (which would still likely have a higher rate than a mortgage or home-equity-secured line of credit) to get people to do a lot of things they would not already do to reduce emissions.\nOn electricity, the NDP will set\u00a0\"a target to power Canada with net carbon-free electricity by 2030, and move to 100 per cent non-emitting electricity by 2050.\"\nAs I wrote with the Green Party plan, this doesn't sound that ambitious at the national level, but regionally it's near-impossible.\nWe're not told much about the road from target to reality;\u00a0there's talk of the new Canadian Climate Bank, but new investment isn't the issue. If you're talking about a near-complete phase out of fossil fuel power in 10 years, you're going to need a big regulatory hammer or a much higher carbon price.\nAnd, supposing you were able to do that, you're going to need a massive increase in intertie capacity, storage and alternative, dispatchable electricity sources. Otherwise, it's going to be impossible to power many parts of the country when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing.\nOn vehicles, the plan is also quite ambitious in goals, but without a lot of detail on policies. Where there are details, there are also concerns.\nThe plan promises federal purchase incentives and federal sales tax exemptions\u00a0\"for working families\" on zero-emission vehicle purchases. I'm not sure how that means testing is actually going to work.\u00a0Do retired people not qualify?\nThese federal incentives will grow in value to $15,000 and be targeted to made-in-Canada vehicles only.\nThis is, of course, likely to run afoul of our free trade agreements, while also being a very regressive and costly policy.\nWe know that, historically, a significant share of electric or hybrid vehicle subsidies have been paid to those who a) would have purchased EVs anyway (see here for a review of research by Gulati and Antweiler) and b) are in the higher end of the income distribution.\nIf you walked into an NDP policy convention and pitched a policy that would hand out $15,000 cheques, predominantly to the most well-off households, and nothing to those who can't afford to buy a new car, how well do you think that policy would go over? Somehow, subsidies for electric vehicles always seem to escape that same type of scrutiny.\nTransportation and transit is the biggest line item in the plan at $6.5 billion, but when you consider that we have more than\u00a020-million light-duty vehicles on the roads in Canada, you're going to need a lot more than that to drive a large-scale conversion of Canada's fleet on subsidies alone, without additional regulations or, again, carbon prices.\nI was deeply critical of the Green Plan for pitching outcomes that, in many cases, were technically infeasible and of the Conservative Plan for promising more reductions from demonstrably weakened and/or undefined policies. The NDP fits in the middle of those two.\nThey offer targets which are, for the most part, at least technically feasible, but they don't offer the policy horsepower to get there.\nMany of the policies they do identify might be popular, but they simply won't generate the levels of emissions reductions promised.\nThis column is an opinion.

The Conservative Party has detailed some of its major promises, and a full platform is expected to be released by midweek.\nThe Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) has produced reports on many of the campaign commitments from at least four of the major parties, documenting just how much each of the promises will cost federal coffers if they are enacted.\nHere's a reminder of some of the major promises from each of the four main parties vying for votes in English Canada.\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau is looking to build on his oft-cited slogan that his party is focused on improving\u00a0the lives of the \"middle class and those working hard to join it.\"\nTo accomplish that, the Liberal platform includes a tax cut by raising the basic personal exemption limit over the next four years until the first $15,000 of income is tax-free for most Canadians, which will\u00a0save the average taxpayer roughly $292 a year.\nFor new parents, the Liberal party is promising to make all maternity and parental employment insurance (EI) benefits tax-free at source. They will also make the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) more generous in the first year of a child's life.\nFor students, the Liberal plan includes a\u00a0boost to post-secondary grants so that they're worth up to $1,200 more a year.\nFor seniors, the Liberals are promising to increase Old Age Security payments for those 75 years and older and enhance\u00a0Canada Pension Plan (CPP) survivor benefits for single seniors.\nThey've also pledged $6 billion in new spending for health care with the goal of giving\u00a0every person in this country access to a family doctor.\nFor workers, the Liberal plan includes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 an hour and a new\u00a0Career Insurance Benefit that will supplement existing EI payments when someone loses their job.\nThey've also promised to make the First-Time Home Buyers Incentive more easily\u00a0accessible for people living in Toronto, Vancouver and Victoria.\nOn the environment, the Liberal party has promised to plant 2 billion trees and to invest all the tax revenues resulting from the Trans Mountain Expansion Project in\u00a0green and clean technology\u00a0initiatives. They are also promising up to $40,000 in interest-free loans so people can renovate their homes to make them more energy efficient.\nIf the Liberals are re-elected, they are promising motorists will see\u00a05,000\u00a0new electric vehicle charging stations along the Trans Canada highway.\nThe Conservative Party is promising to make life more affordable through a series of tax cuts and tax credits at a time when employment levels are high and yet many people\u00a0feel like they aren't benefiting.\n\"It's time for you to get ahead,\" is the party's slogan.To accomplish that, the party is promising a universal tax cut that will cost federal coffers about $6 billion a year in foregone revenue. The cut will be broad-based\u00a0and save virtually every taxpayer hundreds of dollars each year by\u00a0lowering the tax rate on taxable income under $47,630 to 13.75 per cent from 15 per cent.\nBased on the party's calculations, the average single taxpayer would save about $444 a year. A two-income couple earning an average salary would save about $850 a year.\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer\u00a0is also promising to renew tax credits that were put in place by the Conservative government of Stephen Harper and then killed by the Liberal government in the last Parliament.\nScheer\u00a0would\u00a0reinstate the federal tax credit for transit passes, which, according to party estimates, would save\u00a0a\u00a0family of four transit users in the Greater Toronto Area\u00a0nearly $1,000 a year.\nHe would also bring back\u00a0the children's fitness tax credit and the children's arts tax credit to help offset the costs associated with programs\u00a0for kids.\nThe Conservatives have promised a non-refundable tax credit on maternity and parental leave\u00a0Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. They've also vowed to remove\u00a0the federal GST\u00a0from\u00a0sales of home heating fuels.\nTo make the dream of home ownership more affordable, Scheer has promised 30-year amortization on mortgages for first-time home buyers \u2014 a longer loan period that could lead to smaller payments up front \u2014 and he's promised to review the \"stress test\" that has made it more difficult for some would-be borrowers to\u00a0get financing.\nOn the environmental front, Scheer has said he'd scrap the carbon tax and encourage industries to innovate so that they can lower emissions. \"Technology, not taxes,\" is the Conservative Party's message on the environment.\nScheer\u00a0has also said he'll give tax credits worth up to $3,800 a year over the next two years to Canadians who spend their own money to complete green-friendly home renovations, such as replacing windows and doors, installing solar panels or upgrading ventilation.\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has promised \"a new deal for the people,\" a plan he says will close gaps in the country's social safety net to help those families who are struggling the most.\nAmong his proposals is a plan to institute national pharmacare, a multibillion-dollar plan that the party says will\u00a0save families more than $500 a year.\nWhile the Liberals have committed funds for some sort of pharmacare solution down the line, Singh has said an NDP government would bring about such a drug plan right away, in 2020.\nSingh is also promising to expand medicare to include dental services.\nA New Democrat government led by Singh would also\u00a0create 500,000 units of affordable housing in the next 10 years.\nAnd, to ensure even more affordable housing units are built, Singh has promised to waive the federal portion of the GST/HST on the construction of new\u00a0rental units.\nSingh has also said an NDP government would spend $10 billion over the next four years to create 500,000 new child-care spaces in Canada.\nOn climate change, Singh is promising to kill the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and effectively give provinces a veto on major natural resources projects that move through their jurisdictions.\nHe's also promised large-scale building retrofits in all sectors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the country's housing stock. Singh has set a\u00a0target of retrofitting all homes in Canada by 2050 through low-interest loans.\nTo pay for this ambitious agenda, the party has promised to raise taxes on the wealthy. The party would slap a \"wealth tax\" on people who earn\u00a0$20 million annually. It also would raise corporate taxes, end fossil fuel subsidies, close tax loopholes and, like the Liberals,\u00a0levy a foreign home buyers tax.\nThe environment is, naturally, front and centre in the Green Party platform. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May is proposing a fundamental reordering of Canadian society.\nCentral to the Green plan are measures to address the \"climate emergency\"\u00a0\u2014 a 20-step action plan called\u00a0Mission: Possible.\nThe platform offers a vision of a Canada in 2030\u00a0where homes and businesses are all powered by renewable energy, all new vehicles and public transit and passenger ferries\u00a0are electric and most food is locally sourced.\nThe platform says a Green government would pass\u00a0into law a Climate Change Act that would require a 60-per-cent cut in emissions below 2005 levels by 2030, doubling the current 30 per cent target.\nNo new pipelines, or coal, oil or gas drilling or mining, including offshore wells, would be approved under a Green government. The party is also promising to ban all gas-powered \u2014\u00a0internal combustion engine \u2014 cars by 2030.\nThe Green Party is also promising to institute national pharmacare, a promise it says will cost some $27 billion a year.\nThe Green plan also proposes eliminating tuition fees by offering\u00a0$10 billion in post-secondary and trade school support so that all Canadian college and university students can go to school without paying any fees.\nTo pay for the promises, the\u00a0Green Party has said it would eliminate fossil fuel subsidies worth several billion dollars annually, including those for liquefied natural gas (LNG), oil and gas projects and\u00a0coal mining exploration and development.\nThe Greens are also promising to impose a financial transactions tax of 0.5 per cent to collect nearly $18\u00a0billion in 2024-2025.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coronavirus: Here's what's happening in Canada and around the world on March 20", "description": "Provinces ramp up restrictions as number of COVID-19 cases in Canada passes 1,000", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-covid19-canada-world-march20-1.5504080", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 20, 2020 6:52 AM ET", "2020-03-21T04:00:53.376Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The latest:\nBorder restrictions between the United States and Canada aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19\u00a0came into effect across the country\u00a0at midnight ET on Friday\u00a0while political leaders in both countries have continued to ramp\u00a0up their response to the pandemic. Manitoba declared\u00a0a state of emergency on Friday, while New York,\u00a0California and Illinois all introduced sweeping restrictions, limiting mobility and business operations for millions of residents.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said travel restrictions \u2014 which also apply to the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 will \"reduce the incentive for a mass global migration\" and disallow \"non-essential\" border-crossing.\u00a0\nOttawa also announced it has reached a reciprocal agreement with Washington to turn back\u00a0irregular migrants who attempt to cross anywhere along the border \u2014\u00a0a move described as unprecedented.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed\u00a0the coming border restrictions\u00a0in a Friday morning briefing, and went on to outline\u00a0an industrial strategy to\u00a0allow companies already\u00a0making sanitizers, masks and other equipment to scale up quickly, while mobilizing others\u00a0to shift production to\u00a0items that are in high demand.\u00a0The news comes on the same day that cases in Canada grew beyond 1,000, for a total of 1,087. There were 214 new cases on Friday, the most in one day in Canada since the pandemic was declared on March 11.\u00a0\nSpeaking outside his home at Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, where he is in voluntary quarantine after his wife tested positive for the coronavirus, Trudeau said that his government is in touch with major airlines about Canadians stranded abroad. He said details would come in the days ahead, but added that a repatriation flight for travellers stuck in Morocco is expected to go ahead this weekend.\nThe repatriated travellers will need to pay for the flights, which will be co-ordinated through commercial airlines. Global Affairs Canada is offering up to a $5,000 loan to Canadians stuck abroad, and\u00a0that money can be used to pay for these flights. The first area of focus will be Morocco and Peru, where governments have implemented highly restrictive border controls.\n\"These are historic times in which we need to do everything we can to support Canadians,\" said Trudeau.\nAt midnight tonight, we\u2019re restricting all non-essential travel across the Canada-US border to slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep you safe. But we\u2019ll preserve supply chains so food, fuel, and life-saving medicines can continue to reach people on both sides of the border.\nThe government has urged all Canadians who are abroad to return home quickly, but some have struggled to find flights as they face border restrictions and limited travel\u00a0options as airlines cut capacity. On Friday, Air Canada announced they are operating a special flight for Canadians stranded in Morocco, which will leave from Casablanca on Saturday.\u00a0Passengers will have to pay\u00a0as it's a commercial flight \u2014 not a rescue flight chartered by the Canadian government.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue Cambridge is facing right now is the housing crisis. There are not enough units available for the demand on the market, and not enough affordable housing units for those on wait lists in Waterloo region.\nAffordable housing is a solution to the issues that so many people face. It's a big part of the puzzle when it comes to helping people end drug abuse, to finding a job, for keeping a family together, and for reducing poverty overall. A re-elected Liberal government would continue to address the housing gap by building affordable housing and renovating existing stock.\nAlready in Cambridge, $6 million has been spent on new and renovated affordable housing, and under the $55 billion National Housing Strategy, that building of new units will continue.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nAs your Member of Parliament, I will continue to fight for investment in Cambridge, and keep a close eye on the policies that affect families here. Our government has been addressing affordability directly \u2014\u00a0every year, through our government's Canada Child Benefit, Cambridge parents receive over $80 million dollars. This supports more than 23,000 children in our community. We will continue to invest in the services and programs that families depend on.\nOur government has a plan to reduce cell phone bills, make housing more affordable for families, and support seniors who don't have the finances to retire securely. I will continue to fight for policies like this that put money directly into the pockets of middle-class families, and make life significantly more affordable for families.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur track record on the environment speaks for itself, and I want our government to keep making progress.\u00a0Our government put a price on pollution, polluting is no longer free in Canada. We will continue to take action on reducing emissions, supporting clean growth, and protecting and preserving our wildlife.\nOur government has been working to transition away from a carbon-based economy, and we must continue this progress, because the economy and the environment go hand-in-hand, and we cannot have one without the other. I will continue to fight for greater investment in renewable energy, programs to grow green solutions like our electric vehicle rebate, preservation of Canadian wildlife and our plan to plant two\u00a0billion trees.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI love Cambridge. I've lived here for two decades, and it's where I've chosen to raise my two children. Nothing is more important to me than helping families in this community succeed and access the help they need when they're facing challenges.\nEven before being your Member of Parliament, I spent my career serving our community in non-profit organizations like the YMCA,the Boys & Girls Club, and the University of Waterloo. I will always fight for our community, and the people that live here.\nWebsite\nResponses not yet received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI've knocked on over 10,000 doors now, and what I hear most about is the opioid and addictions crisis. We've seen the harm caused by addiction, homelessness, and mental health issues in Cambridge. As your MP, my first task would be to declare a public health emergency on the opioid crisis, and commit to working with all levels of government, experts, and Canadians, to develop a national strategy on opioids.\nI would work to end the criminalization and stigma of addiction while getting tough on the real criminals - those who traffic in and profit from illegal drugs. I'll also work to pursue financial compensation from the drug companies responsible for this crisis. In parallel, I'll pursue an effective Affordable Housing strategy for\u00a0Cambridge, that will tackle homelessness, poverty, and housing shortages.\nThe opioid crisis stems from previous cuts to affordable housing, education, social services, and the unexpected impact of oxycontin and oxycodeiene being produced and pushed by pharmaceutical companies in the 1990s. To start fixing the crisis in Cambridge and beyond, we need to take these roots into consideration and deal with them today. There's no magic bullet, but we can heal our riding.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an\u00a0MP?\nFirst: Wages have stagnated while the cost of living, mortgages, tuition, etc., has skyrocketed. This means families are stuck paying for essentials like food, and services like childcare and medicine, on their credit cards. So, the first thing we can do is recoup the billions of dollars that are lost to corporate tax evaders, and implement a 1 per cent tax on those with more than $20 million in wealth. This will raise over $10 billion-plus per year, helping us pay for the services our families need, allowing us to pay off debts and make lives more affordable.\nSecond: The climate crisis demands immediate and rapid action. We must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions quickly. The silver lining is that we are presented with an unprecedented economic opportunity, because the world is at the frontier of a green energy revolution. My vision is that, Cambridge, as an industrial town with our infrastructure and skilled workforce, is at the leading edge of this low-carbon energy transformation, building the electric cars and public-transit fleets and infrastructure of tomorrow. This will create hundreds of thousands of new, well-paying jobs. Either we build the future we want to see, or someone else will.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThis is an important question for me, since my PhD centered on Climate Politics.\nWe need less talk, and real action, immediately. We have less than 10 years to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by half to meet the IPCC's targets.\u00a0\nWe need a Green New Deal. This will require nothing less than a mass mobilization and transformation of the way our society understands and consumes energy. First and foremost, we cannot continue to increase emissions, which the TMX pipeline would do. So: no new pipelines; cut all fossil-fuel subsidies; and use the $3.3 billion previously given to the biggest polluters, to be directly invested into the low-carbon technologies of the future.\u00a0\nWe need this to science-based targets in line with keeping warming to 1.5 degrees.\nTo finance new projects, New Democrats will launch a Canada Climate Bank to make the big, meaningful investments in the innovative clean energy projects we need.\nRetrofitting homes to be energy efficient and electrifying public transit by 2030 will create over 300,000 good jobs all over Canada, rebuilding local economies while lowering emissions. This is crucial: fighting climate change in Cambridge BY building the low-carbon future we want to see.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI listen to everyone and I never cast judgment on anyone.\nI used to work as a landscaper, in minimum-wage retail, and then as a recruiter in human resources. I went back to school as a 'mature student' to study politics, because I was concerned about where the world was headed environmentally, economically, and politically. I studied hard, was accepted to do a Masters degree at Oxford University and a PhD in International Politics at the LSE (UK), and then I taught International and Environmental Security at Wilfrid Laurier University and the Balsillie School in Waterloo. I'm also on the Board of Directors of the Cambridge Self-Help Food Bank.\nI decided to run for the NDP after the birth of my baby boy at Cambridge Memorial Hospital last year. I started thinking more about the future, and it scared me. So, I'm working now to make a better future for him, and for all of us. Cambridge is my home, it's where my wife and I want to raise our young family, and despite its issues, it's still an amazing place to live and it has much more potential.\nCambridge: Let's be good to one another.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue is the climate crisis.\u00a0We have a small window to respond before damage becomes irreversible.\u00a0We are already seeing negative impacts\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe gap is getting larger between the rich and poor and many Canadians are getting lost in the system.\u00a0The Green Party advocates a universal living income and universal pharmacare.\u00a0\nAlso, we need to start focusing on health and well-being rather than always measuring how we are doing in terms of economic activity. I am already a supporter of the Well-Being Waterloo project and would like to see this focus on well-being scaled up\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe Green Party has put forward a detailed action plan:\u00a0Mission Possible which\u00a0includes ending subsidies to fossil fuel immediately,\u00a0no new pipelines,\u00a0banning fracking\u00a0and scaling up the green economy.\u00a0\nWe need to make this transition for the planet and to participate in the global green economy and to do so in a way that supports workers and their families.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am an entrepreneur, social innovator, community activist, artist and a grandmother.\u00a0In my business as a graphic recorder, I have worked with non-profits, municipal government and community leaders to facilitate creative solutions to some of the most wicked social problems facing\u00a0Cambridge,\u00a0Waterloo region and Brant County.\u00a0\nMy decision to run as Green Party candidate in Cambridge is motivated by my passion for a sustainable economy and a caring community.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nWhen I'm talking with Cambridge residents, I most often hear two concerns,\u00a0one with a very local focus and the other with a national focus.\nRelated to the former, residents are concerned about drug use, especially opioids, in the downtown core. For the PPC, addressing the drug issue will involve putting the safety and well-being of law-abiding citizens first. Research proves that safe injection sites encourage riskier drug use leading to more deaths but do almost nothing to get people clean. So I don't support a SIS (supervised injection site). A compassionate approach will focus on getting addicts off drugs and that's what the PPC is for.\nThe other concern that is mentioned is the issue the corruption of national government leaders. [Liberal Leader Justin] Trudeau's broken promises and [Conservative Leader] Andrew Scheer's willingness to pander to get votes \u2014 whether it's caving in to the dairy cartel or giving Quebec, but no other province, the ability to set immigration rates \u2014 people are frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow does one address this problem of corruption? One needs to vote in politicians who tell the truth and refuse to pander even if it means it will cost them votes. Only Maxime Bernier and the People's Party is willing to follow that path.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nA People's Party government will let citizens keep more of the money from their pay cheques through lower income taxes. If you make less than $15,000 per year, you will pay no tax. If you make between $15,000 and $100,000 your income tax rate is just 15 per cent.\u00a0 And that will give middle-class Canadians thousands more every year. Those making over $100,000 pay 25 per cent.\nThe PPC is also the only party to end supply management \u2014 or producer price fixing \u2014 on milk, eggs and poultry. Ending supply management will lower the price on these food staples and lower people's grocery bill by about $600 a year.\nThe PPC is going to open up cellphones, internet and cable industries to full competition. With more businesses competing for your business, prices will go down. We'll also open airlines and other near-monopolies to competition to increase competition and get prices lower.\nFinally, we'll also lower immigration and that will lead to increased wages for lower skill and entry level position (see work of Harvard economist, George Borjas); it will also lead to lower housing prices (see work of Dr. Daniel Hiebert, UBC).\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe PPC is skeptical of the alarmist claims being made because they just don't stand up to the science. We agree that the temperature is getting gradually warmer \u2014 now up 1 degree Celsius since 1800. Science also shows that CO2 in the atmosphere can increase warming.\nHowever, the science is also very clear that levels of C02 in the atmosphere didn't reach concentrations great enough to effect warming until the 1960s. The warming we see now started in the 1800s. For something to be a cause, it cannot come after the effect.\nBased on the evidence, the People's Party is going to focus on the most pressing environmental needs for Canadians. Health Canada's says that currently over 14,000 people in North America die annually from air pollution from human sources. Pollution in our lakes, rivers and oceans causes hundreds of cases of illness every year.\nMany indigenous communities have no clean water to drink.\nWe're making safe drinking water for remote indigenous communities our first priority and it's part of a larger, firm commitment to combat air and water pollution.\nThis video is my response to climate alarmism.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nMy family \u2014 my wife Maggie and our five children \u2014 and I have made their home in Cambridge for almost 20 years. Our ties to the community have been made strong though volunteer involvement like running summer camps for kids.\nI'm a tenured professor at Wilfrid Laurier University and I've been a leading proponent for freedom of conscience and expression on academic campuses and in Canadian society more generally. My decision to enter politics is rooted in my concern that:\nThe people of Cambridge need to know that I will tell the truth even if the truth is uncomfortable to hear. I will not pander for votes. I think that every human being must be treated with respect but every idea must be open to debate.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing the riding and how would you address it?\nThe most pressing issue facing the people of Cambridge and all of Canada is the need for political renewal.\nWe need to change the political and electoral process so people can participate in making the decisions that affect their lives and the society.\nIn the present situation the major parties act as a cartel to keep their monopoly on power and control of the political process and the peoples' participation is merely to vote every four years. The interests served by this cartel of parties are not those of the working people, they are the interests of the monopolies and the oligopolies which they serve. The most people can hope for\u00a0is to \"influence an MP.\"\nWe can reject this system where the political parties come to power. By speaking in our own name about our concerns, about what should be the priorities in the economy, health care, education and other matters of national interest, working people can embark on a new path to serve their own interests. We can exercise direct control over the decisions we ourselves take and speak in our own name. Importantly, this includes what to do in the 2019 election itself.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP.\nWe need a new direction for the economy. Workers are the producers. We and our families are those most affected by upheavals in the economy, as the basis of our livelihoods is destroyed and public services and social programs come under attack. The austerity agenda which has been unleashed is playing havoc with our lives.\nWorkers are the producers of all the social wealth necessary for the economy and the society to function. It is our rights that must be at the centre of setting a new direction for the economy, one that recognizes the rights of all people. In the current situation, it is monopoly right that is held sacred. Multinationals move in or out of the area, according to their own private interests. Governments at all levels entice them to move in with various pay-the-rich schemes, and then protect them when they move out.\nSpeaking with our peers in own voice about the problems that face us, presenting our own experience with the ruling class and its pay-the-rich schemes, working out our own proposals to humanize the natural and social environment and taking our own decisions are important in breaking with the status quo.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address these concerns.\nA very significant step the government should take, is to withdraw from NATO, NORAD, and the U.S. war machine, which is the world's biggest\u00a0polluter, and the major source of war and aggression internationally.\nThe problems in the environment are crying out for the working people to empower themselves to set a direction for the economy that serves to humanize the social and the natural environment\nA government whose aim is to address the concerns of the people and to build a bright future for the people and the coming generations will restrict the monopolies and oligopolies from their destructive activities.\nAround the world, it is the people speaking out in their own name on these issues that is depriving the monopolies and oligopolies, and governments in their service, of their ability to pollute, destroy, super-exploit, trample on the sovereign rights of Indigenous peoples, and wage war for self-serving aims.\nThe government should stop blaming individual behaviour for destroying the environment. Here and internationally, governments must take measures to end\u00a0 destructive practices of the monopolies and oligopolies, such as fracking, clear cutting, detrimental mining methods, contamination of lakes and oceans, the privatization of water and fraudulent environmental assessments.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm running because it is the right of working people, as the producers of all of the social wealth, to have a say in how the society is organized. It is our right to participate in making those decisions which affect our lives.\nThe cartel parties deprive us of this right with their monopoly on power and cordon sanitaire around all areas of decision-making. The interests they serve are those of the monopolies and oligopolies. They decide all matters pertaining to the election \u2014 including who the candidates will be and what the \"issues\" are.\nThe Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada is calling on people to discuss with their peers how make their vote count.\nA vote for the candidates of the Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada and its program for democratic renewal is an affirmation of working peoples' right to have a say in how society and the economy is organized \u2014 that it's not the exclusive preserve of the cartel parties.\nIn ridings where MLPC candidates are not running, this statement can be made by voting for other small party candidates or independents.\nParty website\nResponses not yet received.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Perth-Wellington candidates on environment, cost of living and top issues in this election", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/perth-wellington-federal-election-candidate-survey-1.5313132", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5315794.1570677080!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/candidates-in-perth-wellington.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-13T09:00:00.823Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Voters will head to the polls on Oct. 21 and in Perth-Wellington, people will have a choice between six candidates.\nThe candidates in Perth-Wellington are:\u00a0\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has asked the candidates to answer a survey. All were presented with the same questions.\u00a0Clicking the candidate's name above will take you to their survey responses. The candidates were told they had a 200-word limit for answers.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nTrust is the most important consideration facing residents of Perth\u2013Wellington in this election. Voters should consider two equally important questions.\nFirst, we must ask which leader, and which party, should we trust to take on serious national challenges.\u00a0Who do we trust to help make it possible for all of us to get ahead? Who do we trust to budget responsibly? Who do we trust to be a leader the world can take seriously?\nSecond, we must ask which local candidate has shown the ability to represent our values and capably serve our community. Which candidate do we trust to be accessible when we need them most? Which candidate has the experience we need to represent every community in Perth\u2013Wellington?\nTo earn voters' trust, I will continue doing what I have always done over the last four years: serving people to the best of my ability.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you return as the MP?\u00a0\nOver the last four years, we've been paying more for gasoline, home heating, hydro, housing, and much more. We must address the rising cost of living. As an MP, I would do what the Liberals did not do: I would oppose any measure that does not respect this reality facing too many Canadians.\nWe can start by trusting people with their own money. With the Conservatives' universal tax cut, the average Canadian family will save over $850 per year.\nAlso in our plan: tax credits for children's fitness and arts programs; tax-free maternity benefits; increasing the age credit for seniors by $1,000; and removing the federal tax on home heating.\nWe would also introduce four new measures to make it easier for first-time home buyers to buy a home.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nClimate change is real and requires immediate action. Andrew Scheer's plan would require the biggest polluters to reduce their carbon emissions or invest in new green technologies.\nIt is also a global problem requiring global solutions. For that, we must restore Canadian leadership on the world stage. We need a prime minister the world will take seriously.\nImposing additional taxes on people in our riding \u2014 who may have no choice but to drive to work or transport their crops to elevators \u2014 will make no meaningful difference in reducing emissions. It will just make life even more expensive.\nYou can read the Conservative plan for the environment at the website arealplan.ca.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nRaised on our family's farm near Mitchell, I learned early the importance of hard work. I believe in public service and our capacity to build strong, healthy communities\u00a0and a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I'm running to serve every person in every corner of Perth\u2013Wellington.\nService means representing our values and interests. That's what motivated me to introduce a bill to protect young people and those with disabilities from exploitation.\nIt's also why I have championed rural communities, stood up for local small businesses\u00a0and challenged the government to respect the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system.\nI'm running because I know we can build a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I will continue to be accessible to every constituent, no matter where they live, whether one-on-one or at community events. I ask for your support to continue serving everyone in Perth\u2013Wellington.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nSustainability is the top issue facing Perth-Wellington. I will work to ensure that life in Perth-Wellington is both economically and environmentally sustainable.\nWe owe it to our children and grandchildren to find solutions that are good for both the environment and the economy. The Liberal climate action plan is both ambitious and realistic. It includes innovation, research, clean technology, and putting a price on pollution. I am proud to support the Liberal plan that is committed to encouraging lower greenhouse gas emissions without putting a financial burden on households.\nWhen the Ford government cancelled Ontario's successful cap and trade system, the federal government implemented a carbon price (so-called \"carbon tax\") and a corresponding rebate called the climate action incentive payment.\u00a0\nLiberals value the small businesses in rural communities that create good jobs and the farmers that feed Canada and the world. We will help our family farms stay strong, help connect rural communities with high-speed internet, and continue to make rural success a priority with a dedicated minister of rural economic development.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Liberal government's plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class is working. It helped Canadians create over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014\u00a0most were full time positions \u2014\u00a0and brought the unemployment rate to a 40-year low. Despite that, many Canadians struggle to make ends meet given the high cost of living.\nA re-elected Liberal government will:\nCanada has the lowest debt to GDP ratio among G7 countries and this ratio has been reduced each year we've been in office. That means we will have the capacity in whatever economic situation to deal with that situation appropriately. To keep our economy strong and growing, we will also move forward with modest and responsible increases to immigration, with a focus on welcoming highly skilled people.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe've seen the impact of climate change, with floods and fires destroying entire communities in Canada. Our children are scared, because they know this will become their mess to clean up.\nThe Liberal plan isn't perfect, but it is both ambitious and feasible. Progress has already been made \u2014 putting a price on pollution, protecting our oceans, phasing out coal, banning single-use plastics. Canada is on track to reduce our emissions by 30 per cent\u00a0by 2030 and Liberals are committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That means not putting any more carbon emissions into the air than we take out.\u00a0\nA re-elected Liberal government will cut corporate tax in half for zero-emissions clean tech companies. We are committed to moving Canada forward \u2014 building a country where clean tech companies can thrive, where businesses and citizens are encouraged to go green, and where workers can succeed in the clean energy transition.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nPublic service means working to create a better community and country for our children and grandchildren \u2014 that is what motivates me to become the MP for Perth-Wellington. I will work to improve the environment, reduce the cost of living, and strengthen social services.\nMy varied work experience includes hosting a children's talent program on CFPL-TV in London; teaching special education students with the Thames Valley District School Board; and ministering to United Church congregations in St. Marys, Stratford, and Palmerston. My wife Ruth and I are residents of St. Marys; we have five children and three grandchildren.\nAs a former town councillor in Parkhill, I have political experience at the municipal level. I helped establish the London Convention Centre and was an early supporter of the Stratford Perth Rotary Hospice. I was a member of Stratford's Housing Committee looking for housing solutions for homeless people, and a co-organizer of St. Marys' Community Dinners.\nMy life's work has been focused on helping people in need. I will always stand up for the little guy. I know that public service is about addressing tough challenges, and I'm committed to continuing my work serving the citizens of Perth-Wellington at the federal level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nOne of the most important issues to citizens of Perth-Wellington is the climate emergency.\u00a0\nWe are keenly aware of the threat posed by climate change to the planet and our way of life. Extreme weather events like flooding, heavy rain, forest fires and intense hurricanes are seen across the country and we've felt the effects here in every part of the riding, both rural and urban. We have a number of active environmental groups such as Climate Momentum in Stratford, The Maitland Valley Carbon Footprint Initiative, and the City of Stratford itself has been a leader in a number of sustainability projects.\nI am inspired by the leadership of young people and was pleased to participate in the student-led climate action here in September.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy first order of business would be to press for action on affordable housing. Many people in Perth-Wellington can't afford to wait for solutions to the housing crisis.\nWe need the federal government to get back to work building social and non-market housing and supporting co-ops. I would work with colleagues from all parties to expedite the funding and assistance needed for municipalities, co-ops or social enterprises to get projects off the ground.\nDealing with precarious employment is a priority for the NDP. As a member of the NDP caucus, I will support the party's re-institution of a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour.\u00a0\nWe will work toward a living wage for all federally regulated workers which will set a standard for employers in every sector. We will give temporary and part-time workers access to the same compensation and benefits as their full-time counterparts.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe NDP knows that we don't have the luxury of time in taking action on climate change. On Day One, an NDP government would cancel the billions in fossil fuel subsidies as well as the Trans Mountain pipeline project.\nWe also stand firmly behind working people and will create 300,000 new jobs in our first mandate in the clean energy sector. Confronting climate change will require a massive mobilization of labour and resources to train and retrain Canadians.\nPriorities in a new energy economy include:\u00a0building a sustainable auto sector by manufacturing electric and zero-emission vehicles right here in Canada; retrofitting every home and public building by 2030 so that they are net zero ready; and expanding the availability of low-cost, zero-emission and accessible public transit.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI have been a social activist and a member of the NDP for the past 17 years. I\u00a0grew up in Markham and have an honours degree in political science from the University of Guelph. I was a member of the board of the Guelph Campus Co-op for five years, as well as serving as president of both the federal and provincial Guelph NDP riding associations. While in Guelph, I was the host of Words and Music\u00a0on 93.3 CFRU FM.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am also a person living with cerebral palsy. As such I know what it is to face and overcome challenges. I also know what it is to confront inequality and succeed.\u00a0\nIn Stratford, I am on the executive of the Rotaract\u00a0Club and have been working on the 211 database through the United Way of Perth Huron. I am committed to building a society where human need comes before corporate greed.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nClimate change is the world's biggest issue, but locally we won't see major frequent impacts until it's too late.\u00a0\nWe need to act because our cumulative emissions will continue to act for decades. To meet our 2030 goals, we have work to do, and only the Green Party's plan meets those goals. The Liberal government (and the Conservatives before them) continue to support the oil and gas industry despite the fact that continued resource extraction at this level will hasten the onrushing climate catastrophe. In 2017, just to extract the oil and gas, 200 of Canada's 700 megatons of CO2 were emitted.\nWe cannot maintain the status quo policy and have a livable planet. The Green Party will declare a climate emergency, work with the other parties in an inner cabinet, cancel all fossil fuel subsidies, ban fracking, support the adoption of electric vehicles, bolster public transportation, replace coal and natural gas electricity generation, modernize and expand the national electric grid, complete a national building retrofit, switch to biodiesel, ban foreign oil imports, and restore natural carbon sinks such as the soil and forests. It is all possible, we just need the political and personal will to do it.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nLife is expensive, and wages haven't kept up with costs. People are worried about making sure their families have what they need to get by and be happy. The Green Party wants to help financially with the things that matter the most.\nWe plan to abolish tuition at post-secondary institutions, expand public transportation (low cost and electric), and mandate a livable minimum wage ($15/hr).\u00a0 We will limit credit card interest rates to 10% and encourage competition in the cellular phone and internet markets to lower costs for everyone.\nGood health is currently a luxury and it shouldn't be; poverty directly affects your ability to care for yourself properly.\u00a0 We are proposing a guaranteed livable income (GLI) to replace the patchwork of federal and provincial programs that assist people who cannot work or are in low income situations. To pay for these programs, we will close tax loop holes used by the very wealthy and large corporations, so that they pay their fair share.\u00a0 Tax breaks for huge corporations don't help everyday people.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe climate crisis is the most important issue for Canadians, whether they realize it or not.\u00a0 The climate crisis requires a concerted effort at all levels of government and grass roots action by everyone.\u00a0\nFor the government to act in the long term best interest of the people of Canada, we need increased transparency and accountability.\u00a0The oil and gas industry is the largest source of emissions in Canada. The federal government needs to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry and put those funds into environmentally sound energy.\u00a0\nThe Transmountain Pipeline expansion should be stopped. The BC Liquid Natural Gas project should be stopped. We need to transition to 100% renewable energy sources. We need to do what is best of the health of our population and planet, not what makes the fossil fuel industry the most money.\u00a0\nThe argument that it is either\u00a0the economy or the environment is invalid, as there are more jobs in a renewable and sustainable economy (estimated 3 times\u00a0more). Corporate influence must be removed from politics and the science must be respected.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm a doctor and anesthesiologist. I've put my practice on hold to run for office\u00a0because I think climate change is the most important issue facing the country.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce I read the IPCC\u00a0(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate report last fall, I knew I had to get involved.\u00a0\nAt my regular job, I deal with sick people in complex situations as part of my routine work.\u00a0 For most people that would be stressful. After examining the evidence for climate change, I was losing sleep thinking about ways to change my personal environmental footprint.\u00a0 We need to make changes at the federal level because they control the sectors where the largest emissions occur.\nI got involved to try and make the changes we need to keep our planet in a livable condition.\u00a0The Green Party is the only political party with the ethics and conviction to stand up to the old parties and corporations, to get things done.\nI'm doing this so we have the best chance to maintain a livable planet, so my kids have a chance at a reasonable existence.\u00a0To not act given the current evidence will be disastrous, and future generations won't understand why we seemingly chose self-destruction because it was more convenient than change.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nHealth care is top of mind. Although this is a provincial responsibility, we can see that wait times and quality of care have been long time concerns without question. No one has been able to assist with changing this.\nThe People's Party of Canada understands that one of the issues here is that provinces have had an unreliable source of federal funding year to year, making it difficult for them to plan and deliver the necessary services. Ottawa's health care transfers to the provinces have doubled since 2006 from $20 billion to $40 billion this year with nothing to show for it.\nWe will give up the GST, which is expected to be around $40 billion and send it to the provinces each year in order to stabilize health care funding. Ottawa will stop meddling in health care\u00a0and allow the provinces to be fully responsible for delivery of this service as the Constitution states.\n2.\u00a0People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nPersonally, I will stand up as the MP for Perth-Wellington and speak out for what the residents of this riding need. Our party policies are extremely helpful in this regard.\nTo assist with the cost of living we will abolish the carbon tax, which is going to impact the cost of everything that we need from groceries to shelter and etc, and replace the tax with nothing.\nWe will simplify the income tax system by raising the personal exemption to $15,000, charging only 15% tax from $15,001 to $100,000,\u00a0and charging 25% for $100,001 and over. This will help the more vulnerable while assuring that more fortunate citizens will pay their fair share of tax.\nWe will end supply management which will allow Canadians to access nutritious food at a reasonable price. To assist the Canadian economy, one step is to ensure that pipelines get built by using the Constitutional laws and we will do that.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change has always happened, thankfully, as we could not live here in Perth-Wellington without it. Twelve thousand years ago, this area was under ice and the earth warmed up. It did not warm up due to human activity.\nWe do not believe that there is a climate emergency. Due to the fact that there is no scientific consensus on this issue, we will not invoke costly taxes that will hurt our prosperity. Until such time, if ever, there is clear consensus, our approach to climate change will be to assist those most vulnerable to flooding and other natural disasters.\nWe do believe in a clean environment and all of us need to assist with that each day, we can all do our part. What will you do? Give up single-use plastics? Walk and bicycle more? Stop burning large amounts of fossil fuels on personal vacations? Will you drink municipal tap water? Will you plant trees? Will you conserve electricity? All of these actions will help us build a cleaner environment.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a lifelong resident of Perth County, having grown up on a dairy farm. I built a successful tool and die business in Stratford and retired financially independent at the age of 38. I ran as an independent candidate in this riding in 2015.\nI am thrilled to be part of this grassroots movement, the People's Party of Canada, whose policies I align with. I stand for fiscal responsibility and a vibrant Canadian economy. I stand for secure Canadian borders and our rights as a sovereign nation. We must uphold the rule of law and I believe in putting Canadians first.\nI believe we need to stop sending billions of dollars overseas for various reasons while so many Canadians, such as our veterans and etc., are experiencing difficulty making ends meet. I believe we need to stop or minimize UN funding. I believe in ending corporate welfare in Canada, a policy which only makes the wealthy\u00a0wealthier. I stand for a bold, new, proud Canadian future for all of us.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThe national debt and interest payments of $70 million a day!\u00a0 We would treat the debt as a mortgage and begin paying it down.\nFamily breakdown is leading to a housing crisis and CHP CANADA would strengthen the traditional family unit by providing income to the parent, either or, who stays home to raise the children or care for disabled, elderly or others in their own home.\u00a0\nFibre [internet]\u00a0to the home is important and CHP Canada offers infrastructure loans to move this project forward.\nCHP Canada wants to maintain our borders, protect our sovereignty and slowly extend legal immigration to those most able to assimilate into our Canadian culture that was and still is, based on \"The Supremacy of God and the Rule of Law.\"\nOur Christian heritage protects the freedom of religion for all people while secularism and humanism would deny religious freedom to Christians.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nCHP Canada would eliminate the income tax \u2014\u00a0completely freeing Canadians from the associated compliance costs. Replacing the income tax would be a fair tax\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a national sales tax on NEW goods only. This would allow both rich and poor to decide when to pay tax.\u00a0\nFor example, the rich buy a new car and pay a higher tax, the poor buy a used car and pay no tax. It will lead to economic advantages! Strengthen the traditional family unit and teach individuals how to manage money. Playing the game Cash Flow with my preteen grandchildren has taught them to get out of the rat race and avoid doodads.\nIt is a shame that the government preys on people's weakness by the get-rich quick scheme of the lottery.\u00a0 If five\u00a0per cent\u00a0is returned to the town, then, after expenses, big bucks left town for big business profits.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change, and associated alarmism, is a financial movement in favour of big business and increased control over people all around the world.\u00a0\nC02 is not a pollutant. Farmers buy it to put into their greenhouses to make the flowers grow. Farmers inject it into soil to beneficially create plant growth.\u00a0\nThe more C02 the better everything grows. Canada was once much greener than today as the fossil records show. We will adapt as changes are slow! CHP Canada would protect water, air and soil by fighting nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulates.\u00a0\nOf greater concern is Canada's moral environment which is creating family breakdown.\u00a0The porn industry is harming everyone's ability to maintain strong family ties ... The lack of respect for life, from the not-yet born human beings who are not granted human rights, to the elderly and disabled who may be coerced to assisted suicide because of their life's circumstances. The moral compass of our nation is eroding leading to a weak and vulnerable populace.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI am a farmer and small business owner with my husband. We raised four children to be healthy adults and have grandchildren.\u00a0I love to read and learn and I read legislation, court cases and alternative news sites. I like to garden and scrapbook and play with grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0\n"}]
