The loss of hours in other provinces ranged from 22.2 per cent in Saskatchewan to 36.4 per cent in Quebec.\nThe average Manitoban worker also lost fewer hours than the average worker in other provinces. The average working-age Manitoban spent 6.9 per cent fewer hours at work in April than they did in February.\u00a0\nIn the rest of the country, the average worker lost anywhere from 11 per cent of their hours in Saskatchewan to 21.8\u00a0per cent of their time on the job\u00a0in Quebec.\nTo be clear, these are flimsy silver livings. Still, Manitoba's relatively strong employment showing compared to the rest of the country demands examination.\nThere are a number of potential explanations.\nFor starters, Manitoba reported very few cases of COVID-19 during the initial weeks of the pandemic and relatively few cases compared to its population overall.\nGiven how disruptive the illness is\u00a0\u2014 demanding quarantines and shuttering workplaces\u00a0\u2014 it makes sense to see Manitoba's relatively favourable economic picture mirror its public health outcome.\nIt's also plausible the nature of Manitoba's economic shutdown threw\u00a0fewer people out of work. While some provinces banned all non-essential business, Manitoba allowed retailers to continue operating with curbside pickup.\n\"Our lockdown wasn't as comprehensive as others,\" said Phil Cyrenne, a University of Winnipeg economist. \"I think that should help us in general.\"\nJust as\u00a0significantly, Manitoba held on to more of its public-sector workers between February and April than did most other provinces.\nAccording to Statistics Canada, 2.1 per cent of Manitoba public-sector workers lost their jobs between February and April. Only in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia did smaller proportions of\u00a0public-sector employees wind up out of work.\nIn Ontario,\u00a0Alberta and B.C., closer to six per\u00a0cent of public-sector workers wound up unemployed. The figure was 9.5\u00a0per cent in Quebec.\nThese tallies\u00a0include all public-sector workers, not just provincial employees. In Manitoba,\u00a0Finance Minister Scott Fielding\u00a0said the provincial public workforce will be cut by an average of 2.2 per cent.\u00a0\nThe province got closer to that goal on Monday, when Crown corporation Manitoba Hydro signalled its intention to lay off as many as 700 workers.\nThere's no guarantee Manitoba's relative good fortune\u00a0in terms of job losses will translate into an earlier economic recovery. Too many variables remain unknown.\n\"I\u00a0don't\u00a0think businesses are\u00a0ready for how long it will take to rehire people,\" said Cyrenne, noting some people collecting Canada Emergency Response Benefits are earning more than they did when they held minimum-wage jobs.\nThe even greater question is how badly the loss of 84,900 jobs will impact the rest of the economy, as the loss of consumer spending power spins off into manufacturing, transportation and other sectors of the economy.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Lenard Monkman", "title": "First Nations fishermen in northern Manitoba welcome federal COVID-19 relief response", "description": "'We have faced lots of obstacles but nothing like COVID,' says Albert Ross of Grand Rapids ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/first-nations-fishermen-manitoba-relief-1.5570593", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5570608.1589500767!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/chris-clarke.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 14, 2020 8:05 PM ET", "2020-05-15T00:05:19.011Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A couple of First Nations commercial fishermen in northern Manitoba are glad federal relief is on its way for the struggling industry.\n\"I was looking forward to fishing but it is great news.

He has been fishing in the Lake Winnipeg region for 40 years and has been the co-op president for 15.\nRoss said he is hoping that the new support measures will help to pay for some of the operating costs that come with being a commercial fishermen, things like boating leases and equipment.\n\"We have faced lots of obstacles but nothing like COVID,\" said Ross.\n\"We got all of our equipment and we can't fish anymore. Hopefully in the fall we can fish.\"\nKuss, the DFO's director of communications, said the money will begin to flow immediately for fish harvesters across the country.

Why are you helping out?'

added.\u00a0\n\"We're all in this together.\"\u00a0\nMany community members seem to agree with that notion.\u00a0\nAfter the Islamic Society of Toronto donated the warehouse space needed to operate the food bank, other community groups started chipping in with donations of their own.\nOne of those groups, The Leaside Toy Drive, organized\u00a0a GoFundMe that has raised $10,000 to date.\u00a0\n\"When we got the call we jumped into action,\" said Daryn Everett, who's on the committee that runs\u00a0the Leaside Toy Drive.\u00a0\nThe project, which officially launched\u00a0two weeks ago, operates differently than a typical food bank.\u00a0\nInstead of people coming to pick up the products, food is\u00a0delivered by volunteers directly to families' doorsteps\u00a0to avoid large gatherings and reduce the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0\n\"Boxes are going to be picked up this afternoon and tomorrow by volunteers and taken to families in need \u2014\u00a0an entire high-rise community,\" said Michael Zivot, who's also a member of Leaside Toy Drive's committee.\u00a0\nThe boxes have been filled with food\u00a0donated by local grocery stores, community members and businesses, and will include non-perishable items, such as oil, canned goods, pasta and\u00a0gift cards.\u00a0\nEverett said he's proud of the food bank, which didn't exist a month ago and is already feeding families in need.\nBut he said the project will only survive if businesses and individuals continue to donate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We're hearing directly from the TNO that there's a lot of families here that are hungry,\" he said.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1733823555515", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null,

claiming the $2,000 monthly benefit when they don't qualify.\nThe National Post has published internal memos that instruct public servants to process claims even if they suspect the applicant isn't eligible.\nWhen pressed about fraud Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was eager to get the support money out to Canadians as quickly as possible and it was willing to accept some impropriety.\n\"If it meant even accepting that 1 or 2 per cent might make fraudulent claims, that was the choice that we gladly made. We needed to get help to Canadians immediately and that's what we did,\" Trudeau told reporters at his daily briefing.\nThe government has so far refused to say how many cheques have knowingly been sent to people who are ineligible. Employment Minister Carla\u00a0Qualtrough told CBC's Power & Politics\u00a0Wednesday that fewer than 200,000 claims have been red-flagged so far. The government has processed more than 7.8 million payments to this point.\nP.E.I. Liberal MP Wayne Easter, the finance committee chair, said the money should be clawed back from those who are ineligible in order to protect the integrity of the system.\n\"The government has to make it clear that we're not going to accept what is outright fraud and that money will be hauled back in. I think somebody needs to be clear,\" Easter told Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who was a witness before the committee Thursday.\n\"The answer, to be honest, hasn't been clear from the minister or the prime minister on that issue,\" Easter added.\nHe acknowledged\u00a0errors are\u00a0inevitable\u00a0in a system of this size \u2014 some of his constituents were automatically enrolled in CERB in error, he said\u00a0\u2014 but the government should discourage \"outright fraud.\"\nMorneau faced repeated questions at committee\u00a0from Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative finance critic, about these claimants. Morneau said again that the government's primary focus has been on getting cash to those who need it.\nBut\u00a0after Easter's\u00a0remarks, Morneau promised action down the line to recoup funds, saying\u00a0the benefit is only intended for a certain subset of the Canadian population \u2014 those who have lost most of their income as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"I'd encourage people to be fair and honest in their attestation because the ramifications of not being [honest will be] a\u00a0problem for them afterwards,\" Morneau said, citing the terms applicants must agree to before submitting a CERB\u00a0application.\n\"The fact that there are some people who are committing fraud, or that there are accidents, is a problem and we're going to have to come back to these problems. For people who are fraudulent \u2014 it's not acceptable.\"\nCliff Groen, a senior public servant in Service Canada's benefit delivery services branch, told the committee today that a departmental memo was issued to bureaucrats instructing them to process payments even in cases where they suspect abuse.\nBut Groen said there are measures available to recoup money in future for people who do not meet the program requirements.\nTo qualify for the CERB, an applicant must be a Canadian resident over 15 years of age who has been forced to stop working because of the pandemic. The applicant also must have earned a minimum of $5,000 over the last 12 months and must expect to make less than $1,000 a month while collecting the benefit.\nWatch | The National: Cracking down on CERB fraud will take time\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1713193027988", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1693717571885", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/employment-gains-1.5452316", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1709652035734", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "N.W.T. schools to remain closed for remainder of academic year", "description": "Education leaders to keep schools closed due to the challenges reopening presents", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-schools-staying-closed-1.5570328", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5140758.1562187661!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ecole-allain-st-cyr.JPG", "publishedAt": ["May 14, 2020 3:00 PM CT", "2020-05-15T00:19:54.627Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Schools in the Northwest Territories will stay closed for the remainder of the school year.\nIn a news release Thursday, education leaders say they are acting as a group to keep schools closed, because \"circumstances vary greatly across communities and regions in terms of capacity to reopen schools at this time.\"\nThey've decided to keep schools closed for the rest of the 2019-2020 academic year, because of \"the many complex operational challenges faced by schools at this time.\"\nThose challenges include teachers who are currently away from many communities, concerns from local governments, and a shortage of equipment needed to maintain safety according to\u00a0public health recommendations, reads the press release.\nThis week Dr. Kami Kandola, the territory's chief public health officer, said elementary, middle and high schools could reopen after the first set of COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, which could happen as soon as Friday.

While he's pleased with the forgivable portion of federal loans, he's heard the province's new grant program is \"insufficient.\"\nHe said\u00a0it's going to take some \"extraordinary\" and innovative measures to make sure everyone pulls through.\n\"The health-care problem is one side of this,\" he said. \"The economic problem is going to have its own victims.\"\nUnemployment also rose in Nova Scotia by 4,800 people, about 10.9 per cent, up to 48,500.\u00a0\nThe unemployment rate \u2014 the percentage of unemployed people in the provincial labour force \u2014 jumped from 8.7 per cent in February to 10.1 per cent in March.\nThe survey also broke down job impacts by industry.\nAccommodation and food services saw employment numbers drop 22 per cent, more than 8,000 people, from 36,900 employees in February to 28,700 in March.\u00a0\nBut Luc Erjavec, Atlantic vice-president of Restaurants Canada, said Friday the reality now is much more bleak.\nThe organization's own survey, conducted March 25-29, shows 24,500 jobs in food service have been lost in Nova Scotia alone.\nThe province's $2.1-billion food-service industry represents 4.6 per cent of the province's GDP. Erjavec expects sales to be down $440 million for the second quarter of 2020.\n\"We're going to be decimated,\" Erjavec said, adding that many full-service restaurants haven't been able to make the jump to takeout or delivery that is now the\u00a0only option.\nErjavec said these job losses and closures have quite the \"ripple effect,\" since each dollar spent in the restaurant industry triggers $1.85 in spending in the rest of the community.\nWhen asked about the Labour Force Survey in the COVID-19 press conference Thursday, Premier Stephen McNeil agreed it has yet to capture the \"full impact\" of what's happening in the province.\nHowever, he thanked those people still out working and following the physical distancing protocols. He added the province is hoping to pull forward infrastructure projects in the coming months to help the economy rebound when restrictions are eased.\n\"I have every bit of confidence that once we see our way through this pandemic, Nova Scotia's entrepreneurs will do what they've always done \u2014 start to rebuild and their government will be there with them,\" McNeil said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1720854083727", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1720807491526", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Employment minister outlines N.W.T.'s changes to income support during pandemic", "description": "One-time allowance, changes to program introduced as part of territory's COVID-19 relief package", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/income-support-details-nwt-covid-19-1.5519037", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5459901.1581447970!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/r-j-simpson-talking-head.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 02, 2020 11:03 AM CT", "2020-04-02T17:03:14.065Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The N.W.T.'s employment minister says that most people in the territory on income assistance should have already seen a one-time emergency allowance distributed as part of the territory's COVID-19 relief package in their bank accounts.\nMinister R.J. Simpson discussed details of the allowance, as well as other changes to the income assistance program, with The Trailbreaker's Loren McGinnis on Thursday morning.\nThe one-time allowance \u2014 of $500 for a single recipient, or $1,000 for households with two or more people\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is being automatically distributed to everyone on income assistance in the territory in March, Simpson said, and recipients don't need to apply again to receive it.\u00a0He said that as of the last update\u00a0he had been given, over 70 per cent of those eligible had already received the funding.\n\"It's rolling out to everyone, and hopefully within a day or two, everyone should have it, who was eligible,\" he said.\nThe allowance is part of an $8.2 million \"wave two\" relief package announced by the government earlier this week. That complements an initial $13.2 million package, announced earlier in March.\nSimpson also outlined temporary changes to the income assistance program, including the exemption of \"gifts or unearned income\" until June 30 from calculations.\nThis change, he said, was designed to allow people to receive funds for on-the-land activities from their First Nation or other COVID-related assistance, without having it count against their reported income for income assistance.\n\"We didn't want to punish those people who receive that money,\" said Simpson.\u00a0\"Any money you receive that's related to COVID[-19], essentially, we're not going to count against your income.\"\nOther changes to the program include the elimination of monthly income reporting for the time being. Instead, clients will report their income every three months, a change Simpson said was designed to keep people in their homes and out of the income assistance offices, which are currently closed.\nNew clients will also apply over the phone instead of in person, he said.\nThe final change Simpson outlined relates to \"productive choice,\" a requirement for clients to participate in their communities through activities like schooling or volunteering.\n\"What we've done is moved everyone who collects income assistance to one productive choice, and that is to take care of yourselves and your family, and essentially stay home,\" Simpson said.\nFor those seeking more information or looking to apply for income assistance, Simpson said that they can look for information on the department's website, or call their regional office.\n\"The client service officers are still working, and they'll be the ones in the best position to let people know how to apply and what they may be eligible for,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Tory Gillis", "title": "Sask. students feeling summer employment crunch due to COVID-19", "description": "University of Regina's depleted emergency fund calls for donations while students search for jobs", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/students-feel-summer-employment-crunch-1.5517858", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3661986.1563311920!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/university-of-regina.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 01, 2020 3:08 PM CT", "2020-04-01T21:08:38.244Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Post-secondary students are nearly finished with their winter semester. For many, that means it's time to start searching for summer employment.\u00a0\nThat task is one of many\u00a0commonplace activities that have been drastically impacted by\u00a0to\u00a0the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\n\"The search has been pretty difficult,\" said third-year University of Regina political studies major\u00a0Katarina Ewert. \"If you go on like, [job search website] Indeed, there are so many people hiring in Regina for waitressing jobs, but now all that's been shut down. So that was my plan, but it's not doable at the moment.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nEwert said\u00a0she's been able to secure provincial government employment in the past as a summer student. She has applied this year, too, but she's not sure there will be as many seasonal jobs available.\n\"They're usually around $17 per hour\u00a0to start with, so you can make all your money during the summer and live on that for the rest of the year,\" she said.\nEwert knows she's not alone in her struggle.\u00a0\nShe said\u00a0that while it's nice to see governments deferring payments for student loans, that's not helpful for people like her who are still in the midst of their studies.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the University of Regina is calling for donations to its emergency fund, which awards bursaries to students for housing, food security, technology, medical care, necessary travel\u00a0or unforseen circumstances. The school also offers emergency loans, but in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic it's highlighting the bursary program.\u00a0\nThe university's interim president and vice chancellor, Thomas Chase, said\u00a0the bursary fund\u00a0normally awards $90,000 to students annually. Right now, it's seeing three times the amount of daily applications it normally sees.\u00a0\nChase said\u00a0the fund is dealing with the added difficulty of being unable to host its usual fundraiser events due to restrictions around the pandemic, so it's asking people to donate online at urgiving.ca/emergency.\nChase said\u00a0the university knows its students are facing hardship around summer employment.\u00a0\n\"There's no question.
