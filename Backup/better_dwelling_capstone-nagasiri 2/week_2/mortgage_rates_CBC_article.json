But we know that debt levels are going to rise, so the right combination of economic policies will be important, too.\"\nOne of the issues on the bank's radar will be the number of people having\u00a0trouble staying on top of their mortgages.\nThe bank said that if no new policies had been implemented in response to the unprecedented economic impact of COVID-19, the mortgage arrears rate may\u00a0have risen\u00a0to 2.1 per cent of all loans by the end of this year. That means more than one out of every 50 homeowners would be at least three months behind on their payments\u00a0\u2014 almost 10 times the number that were before the COVID-19 crisis.\nAs it stands, because of some of the policies put in place, the bank says that under the current worst case scenario, the\u00a0mortgage arrears rate will spike to about 0.8 per cent and remain on a much flatter curve that doesn't peak until next year, once payment deferral plans offered by the big banks at the outset of this crisis\u00a0are set to expire.\nCurrently, the mortgage arrears rate is at slightly more than 0.2\u00a0per cent. If the rate peaks to 0.8 per cent, that would be roughly twice as high as its highest point during the financial crisis of 2009.\u00a0\nThe bank did caution that those forecasts are assuming the worst case scenario for its stress-test modelling, and far more optimistic scenarios could play out.\n\"The unprecedented nature of the pandemic .. makes the uncertainty around the results exceptionally high,\" the bank said.\nWe already know about record-setting job losses during the\u00a0pandemic, but the bank gave some new data regarding just how many people are finding it hard to make ends meet.\nBy its calculations, the bank says about one out of every five home-owning households\u00a0in Canada doesn't currently have enough money to cover two months'\u00a0worth of expenses, and almost one third don't have enough to cover four months'\u00a0worth.\nEven despite the financial support programs, such as\u00a0wage subsidies, implemented by the federal government, \"some households are likely to fall behind on their loan payments,\" the bank said.\u00a0\"This typically appears first in missed credit card and auto loan payments and later in mortgage payments.\"\nWatch | Deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins on the outlook for Canada's housing market:\nThat's not just a problem for homeowners, either, Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Brian DePratto\u00a0says.\n\"Renters are not immune, as they are more likely to work in industries most affected by COVID-19,\" he said. \"The longer the income shock, the greater the risk of increased consumer insolvencies.\n\"Broad-based income support measures can only last so long, making the gradual economic reopening crucial to the health of the Canadian economy's financial underpinnings.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Interest rates are plunging \u2014 so why aren't mortgage rates?", "description": "Bond yields and central bank rates have never been lower, but not all the savings are filtering down", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/interest-rates-coronavirus-evans-1.5515884", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5516600.1585684340!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mortgage-applications.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 04, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-04-04T13:24:14.398Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Central banks around the world have slashed their benchmark interest rates to pretty much zero in an attempt to stimulate the economy by making it as easy as possible to borrow, spend and invest.\nBut a curious thing is happening in Canada's mortgage market: rates aren't going down by as much as they probably should be. And in some cases, they're actually rising.\n\"Usually\u00a0when the Bank of Canada cuts rates like they have, by 1.5 percentage points in a month, you can expect all rates to fall,\" said\u00a0James Laird, president of mortgage brokerage CanWise Financial and\u00a0co-founder of\u00a0Ratehub.ca.\n\"At first they did ...\u00a0but a week and a half ago, we started to see a shift [and] now we are seeing our\u00a0lenders increase rates. Every two days, we get a different lender saying we are going up by point one, point two.\"\nMortgage rates tend to move up and down based on a number of factors, but one of the main ones is the costs borne by the lenders themselves.\nPeople tend to think that when someone walks into a bank to ask for a home loan, if they are approved, the bank just takes the cash out of some safe at the back, hands it over to the borrower and charges them interest over time to make a profit.\nBut, in fact, banks don't keep that much money just lying around either \u2014\u00a0they typically borrow it themselves\u00a0and make money on the spread between how much they're charged for it\u00a0and how much they turn around and charge the borrower for it.\nThe cost of financing a variable rate loan is strongly influenced by the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, because banks tend to set their own prime lending rates based on whatever the central bank's rate is.\nThe bank has cut that rate by 150 basis points \u2014 1.5 percentage points \u2014\u00a0in the past month\u00a0to try to make it as easy and cheap as possible for people to borrow, spend and invest to stimulate the economy that has been waylaid by COVID-19.\nA few short weeks ago, it wasn't hard to find a variable rate mortgage for something around prime minus one \u2014 a full percentage point below whatever a bank's prime lending rate was at the time.\nBut a funny thing has happened since then. Prime lending rates have gone down more or less in lockstep with the Bank of Canada's moves, but those discount rates for mortgages have evaporated.\n\"About half of the savings have been passed along and half kept by banks for a higher margin,\" Laird said.\nThe reason they're doing that is the same as why\u00a0stock markets plunged\u00a0and governments rushed to\u00a0implement lockdowns on millions of people: fear.\n\"Lenders are saying, 'Hold on a second,'\" Laird said. \"If a million people are going to lose their jobs and unemployment is going to rise, maybe we should build in a bit of a risk premium to our\u00a0pricing to account for possible defaults for this new money we are lending.\"\nWhen the economic outlook was more clear, banks were happy to cut rates as low as possible to try to gobble up market share. But now, they're saying \"We better earn a bit more of a spread on this money because these things might default at a higher rate than we're used to,\" Laird said.\nThe impact isn't dramatic. Laird says a few weeks ago, the best mortgage rates were something in the range of between two and 2.5 per cent. Today, they're between 2.5 and three per cent because, as he puts it, \"they are demanding a higher risk premium than what they typically do.\"\nOthers aren't quite so diplomatic.\n\"It's total garbage,\" Marcus Tzaferis with mortage brokerage Cannect said. \"It's complete profit taking.\"\nWhile banks borrow at a rate slightly above that government rate,\u00a0Tzaferis says \"the spread between their cost of borrowing and some of their five-year fixed mortgage rates is still around 250 points, which is highly profitable for them.\"\nFixed-rate loans aren't pegged to the Bank of Canada's rate and are instead more influenced by the bond market. And there, too, Tzaferis says what's happening in the market doesn't reflect what's happening behind the scenes.\nLenders finance fixed-rate loans on the bond market, where yields have fallen to record lows in the current COVID-19 crisis. The yield on a five-year government of Canada bond bottomed out at around 0.37 per cent this month and is currently hovering just over 0.5 per cent.\u00a0\nThough banks must pay a credit spread on bond yield and that may be widening, Tzaferis says they are also widening their profit margins. Most fixed-rate mortgages are currently going for around three per cent, he points out.\nThe difference for borrowers adds up fast. Laird calculates that a theoretical buyer who put down a 10 per cent deposit on a house costing $500,000 before this crisis would likely have been able to get a mortgage rate of 2.6 per cent, which would make their payment $2,102 a month.\nIf all three rate cuts since then were to be fully factored into that loan, that borrower's monthly payment would fall\u00a0as low as $1,769 a month\u00a0\u2014 that's\u00a0$333 per month or $3,996 per year on their mortgage payments, compared to what they were paying less than a month ago.\nThe overwhelming majority of first-time buyers opt for fixed-rate loans because they like the security of knowing that their monthly payment is guaranteed to not increase.\u00a0The banks know this, Tzaferis says, and it could soon have a heavy cost for borrowers.\n\"They're using this as an opportunity to lock people into big fat juicy\u00a0and profitable five-year mortgages,\" he said. \"When their rates drop those consumers are going to have massive penalties to break them ...\u00a0tens of thousands of dollars.\"\n\"It's absolutely insanity,\" Tzaferis\u00a0said. \"This is a totally manufactured crisis to profit.\"\nLaird and Tzferis both say that the current situation can't last forever. Economists are already predicting that the COVID-19 recession is likely to be incredibly sharp, but it's anyone's guess\u00a0how long it will go on for.\nLaird says the best sign that things are getting back to normal will be when the big banks start to act in a way that seems paradoxical.\nBanks are raising their rates right now because they feel just as uncertain about the future as Canadians do. Once that cloud lifts, they'll want to start lowering rates again, and \"they won't build in that uncertainty premium like they are now,\" said Laird.\n\"As confidence returns, you'll see rates fall.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Why worries about the coronavirus are pushing mortgage rates down", "description": "Fear has pushed investors to buy up bonds, which is causing cheaper borrowing for home buyers", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-mortgage-rates-canada-1.5443071", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5443215.1580239186!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/germany-dax.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 29, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-01-29T09:00:00.512Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Economists are busy trying to calculate the potential economic toll of the coronavirus\u00a0outbreak that's currently making its way around the world. But there's one marketplace that is already, quite unexpectedly, quantifying the full force\u00a0of the bug: mortgages.\nRates for fixed- and variable-rate home loans are based on a variety of factors, but one of the biggest is the price that lenders have to pay to borrow money themselves.\nFor fixed-rate Canadian home loans, the benchmark that sets the price that consumer rates are based on is the five-year Government of Canada bond.\nInvestors who covet bonds like that one do so because they are perceived to be safe. Investors\u00a0are willing to accept the relatively meagre returns that government debt\u00a0offers because it's better than the alternative \u2014 losing money on whatever other, riskier investment they would have had to buy instead.\nCounterintuitively, the price of a bond and its yield move in opposite directions. So when appetite for bonds goes up, the amount they pay out goes down, because lenders don't have to offer quite as good a deal to find a buyer for their debt.\nThe price of bonds tends to increase when people are feeling fearful,\u00a0a situation that certainly describes the state of affairs today amid a mysterious coronavirus emanating from mainland China\u00a0that has killed more than 100\u00a0people and infected\u00a0thousands more.\nThat fear is prompting investors to pour money into the safety of\u00a0government bonds, and all that buying is pushing down the yield on that debt.\nAs recently as the start of the year, the yield on the five-year Canadian government bond was about 1.7 per cent. This week, it dipped as low as just above 1.3. In the staid world of bonds, a 40-point drop in a relatively short period is huge, and it's filtering down into the mortgage market.\nFixed-rate loans are highly influenced by bond yields, because\u00a0a\u00a0mortgage lender makes money on the spread between the\u00a0bond rate and what they offer to consumers. If the five-year bond yield goes up, they can\u00a0just pass that cost on to consumers. If it goes down, as it is now, the lender's cost of borrowing goes down, so they can turn around and lower their rates for consumers to drum up new business.\nThat's what seems to be happening.\nFixed-rate loans are falling, according to James Laird, CEO of mortgage broker Canwise Financial and co-founder of rate comparison website RateHub.ca. While specific rates will vary based on the borrower and what part of the country they're in, currently the best deal on offer for a five-year fixed loan is 2.64 per cent with a trust company\u00a0and 2.74 per cent from a big bank. Barely a month ago, those rates would have been roughly 10 to 20 points higher.\nWhile bond yields have fallen by about 40 basis points in that period, that means lenders so far have only passed on about a quarter of those savings to consumers. But that is likely to\u00a0soon change.\nLenders are always slower to pass on savings than they are to pass on added costs, Laird said, but they can only hold off for so long.\n\"If\u00a0bond yields were up by 40 points, you can guarantee far more [lenders] would have changed rates and by a greater amount,\" Laird\u00a0said. \"On the way down they're a little slower ... they enjoy thicker margins for a while.\"\nCoronavirus fears have really only sped up the process of a move toward lower rates that was already underway, he said.\nIn its policy decision last week, the Bank of Canada elected to keep its benchmark interest rate where it is for now.\u00a0But by singling out concerns over the job market, international trade and other factors, it's clear the bank is leaning more toward rate cuts than hikes, Laird said.\nVariable-rate mortgages set their rates based on what the Bank of Canada is doing, not bond yields. And based on the central bank's last statement, traders think there's about an 80 per cent chance of at least one rate cut by the end of 2020. That means home buyers with variable-rate loans can expect some relief soon, too.\nThere's also some seasonality at play in all this. All things being equal, lenders like to hit the ground running on the busy spring home buying season, so Laird often sees rate cuts in mid-February or March, regardless of what bonds are up to.\u00a0\nThe sudden impact of the coronavirus is just causing that to happen a little earlier and a little more dramatically than anticipated.\n\"It's\u00a0not like rates were on the rise and the coronavirus\u00a0caused them to do a U-turn,\" he said. \"I'd say this is another area which is putting downward pressure on bond yields, and therefore downward pressure on mortgage rates.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "U.S. Fed chair rules out negative interest rates even as Trump trumpets them", "description": "U.S. president goes negative on Jerome Powell for rejection of below-zero interest rates", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/powel-trump-negative-rates-1.5567512", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5258204.1566589338!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/869482910.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 13, 2020 10:48 AM ET", "2020-05-13T15:17:41.088Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The head of the Federal Reserve said Wednesday the U.S. central bank is not considering using negative interest rates, despite President Donald Trump seemingly pushing for them.\nIn a tweet Tuesday night, the president said other countries are enjoying the advantages of negative interest rates, and he urged his own central bank to accept the \"gift\" they would bestow on the U.S. economy.\nTypically central banks tinker with lending rates in an attempt to control inflation, raising rates when they want to cool down an overheated economy, and cutting them when they want to encourage borrowing and investment.

That's the lowest range since the summer of 2017, he says, and a big reason why is the bond market.\nUnlike variable rate loans which take their cues from the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, lenders finance fixed-rate loans based on the rates they can get in the bond market. Essentially, they'll borrow money themselves at one rate, loan it out to a borrower at a higher rate\u00a0and make money on that spread.\nSo current rock-bottom interest rates on fixed loans are no coincidence, considering the yield on a five-year Government of Canada bond dipped below 1.3 per cent this month. If a lender can borrow funds for as little as 1.3 per cent then turn around and make money by loaning it out for twice that rate, they have every incentive to keep offering those deals.\n\"The hard cost of funding these loans is going down,\" Laird said. \"And at the same time we are at the tail end of the most competitive market, when lenders fight for [business], so that's when they are willing to thin out their margins a bit to attract volume.\"\nVariable rate loans are also sliding lower, too.\nMost borrowers prefer the peace of mind\u00a0of fixed rate loans, but lenders can tempt borrowers to variable rate loans with even better rates \u2014 even if they're only temporary.\nLaird says typically it takes a spread of about a full percentage point to entice most people to make the leap. Which is why those loans are even less popular than usual because that premium has almost completely vanished.\nHe says the best variable rate loans are about 2.65 per cent at the moment, which is barely better than the fixed rate, for a lot more risk.\nAnyone signing up for that loan today is \"assuming the Bank of Canada is going to be forced to drop their rate once or twice. That would be the only way to justify taking it,\" he said. The bank's benchmark rate is 1.75 per cent.\u00a0\nTrading in investments known as overnight index swaps suggests investors think there's about a 50 per cent chance of a rate cut by the central bank\u00a0this year \u2014 but two would be very unlikely, and never mind any more beyond that.\nLower rates could be good news for those who've already bought, too.\nA recent report by National Bank found that a little more than one out of every six mortgages in Canada is up for renewal this year, and as recently as January the bank was calculating that most of them could expect to be paying between 70 and 90 more basis points on their next loan than they were on their current one.

He said the industry could contract by 40 per cent.\nThe report notes real estate and population growth have been stunted by COVID-19 as well.\n\"The pandemic and its resulting travel restrictions will slow Hamilton's recent strong growth in net in-migration, which hit 8,325 in 2019\u2014the highest level since 1989. This year we expect 6,520 net new arrivals\u2014a 21.7 per cent decline compared with last year. This will cut Hamilton's population growth to 8,094, down from 9,133 in 2019,\" reads the report.\n\"The local retail trade sector will contract in 2020, as a depressed economy, a weak labour market, and slower household disposable income growth force nervous consumers to tighten their purse strings. Retail sales are forecast to fall by 3.3 per cent, leading retail trade output to contract by 3.8 per cent. A rebound of 5.2 per cent is expected in 2021.\"\nHamilton's GDP is set to decline by 3.2 per cent this year but will jump by 6 per cent and kick off a steady and strong resurgence \u2014 as long as the pandemic continues to become less of a threat and there isn't another set of shutdowns.\n\"When economic activity contracts so swiftly, on the other side of it you will have a stronger rebound,\" Crawford said.\nHe added Hamilton was in a great economic position before the pandemic, which has softened the impact.\nThe city is also planning an economic recovery task force to deal with the aftermath of COVID-19.\nBy summer, if the virus hasn't rebounded, Crawford thinks people will begin spending more as businesses open up and restrictions fade away.\n\"If cities like Hamilton, which have seen very strong population growth, which do have a strong and vibrant housing market, which do benefit from high-paying jobs \u2026\u00a0can just get through this lockdown period and successfully navigate the re-opening hopefully we can all put this in our rearview mirror and start the recovery in mid-summer moving on into the fall.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Housing starts up in some parts of Canada despite COVID-19", "description": "Multi-unit housing projects remained strong in some provinces in April, CMHC says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/housing-starts-april-1.5561214", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5358323.1573674927!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cranes-front-spadina.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 08, 2020 2:17 PM ET", "2020-05-08T18:17:56.530Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. says construction of multi-unit housing projects remained strong in some provinces last month despite the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCMHC estimates a 10.8 per cent month-over-month increase in its national seasonally adjusted annual rate last month compared with March, excluding Quebec.\nThe federal agency says there was growth in multi-family starts in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba in April but Quebec was left out of the monthly national tally because the province's COVID-19 containment measures were in place until April 20.\nThe April seasonally adjusted annualized rate, excluding Quebec, was 166,415 units, up from 150,224 units in March.\nExcluding Quebec, multiple dwelling starts in urban areas of Canada were up 35.7 per cent from March, while urban single-family starts fell 27.1 per cent.

Since then, said Giroux,\u00a0new\u00a0aid programs have been announced for commercial rent support, the agricultural sector, students and seniors \u2014 things he called \"very expensive measures.\"\n\"I think $252 billion is on the very optimistic side, as things stand now,\" Giroux said.\n\"In all likelihood the deficit will be higher than $252 billion. If I had to bet on that number, I'd say it's more likely to be worse than that than better than that.\"\nAs a result, the federal debt will rise to more than $900 billion \u2014 or roughly $24,000 for every man, woman and child in Canada.\nGiroux said it's \"not unthinkable\" that the federal debt could reach $1 trillion, and it's\u00a0both \"possible and realistic\" that the debt could hit\u00a013 figures by this time next year.\nIn fact, depending on how long the pandemic lasts, it's possible that pandemic\u00a0programs could cost more than what the entire federal government\u00a0spent last year on everything \u2014 which was roughly $337.8 billion for the 2018-19 fiscal year.\nWatch:\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's full press conference for Tue.

Before the pandemic, the government projected a ratio closer to 30 per cent.\nWhile that figure is high, Giroux said it's still well below the 66 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio the country reached in the 1990s\u00a0\u2014 when the Wall Street Journal branded Canada \"an honourary member of the Third World.\"\nThe cost of financing this massive increase in government spending, and the resulting debt, will be relatively low, Giroux said. He said interest rates have hit rock bottom \u2014 the Bank of Canada's benchmark interest rate is now at 0.25 per cent \u2014\u00a0and\u00a0the cost of servicing the debt will be manageable.\n\"We anticipate that debt charges will not go up, which is surprising and counterintuitive,\" Giroux said. \"Interest rates are so much lower than what we anticipated them to be just two or three months ago. It doesn't cost that much to finance that growing debt.\n\"Is the government in a worrisome position right now? The answer is no.\"\nHe said the debt load could become \"unbearable\" in the event of a sizeable spike in interest rates and added the prospect of such an increase is\u00a0\"concerning.\"\nThe Liberal members of the committee asked Giroux what the cost to Canadians would have been if the government hadn't\u00a0stepped in to flow funds to Canadians through programs like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the wage subsidy.\nGiroux said that, without government support, Canadians would have suffered considerable economic pain because of the pandemic.\n\"We would have seen widespread \u2014 and I mean widespread \u2014 bankruptcies at the individual and corporate level,\" he said. \"There would be lots of defaults on mortgages, repossession of homes and cars, credit card debts that would go unserviced.\n\"The cost of doing nothing would be high.\"\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "Time to buy?

Bidding wars are still occurring and it remains a sellers' market for condos under $700,000 and detached homes around $1.6 million, whereas the market for more expensive homes tends\u00a0to favour buyers. \u00a0\nSo far, there hasn't been a lot of panic or forced selling, but I believe that could change in the fall.\nWhen trying to forecast where the market is heading, there are two variables that I will be closely monitoring \u2014 the post COVID-19 employment numbers and the expansion or\u00a0introduction of new government programs created to combat the financial effects of the pandemic.\u00a0\nA low unemployment rate does wonders for real estate valuations as it is an indicator that the economy is functioning well. Strong economies attract new investments, businesses, immigrants, temporary workers, international students, refugees \u2014 all of which increases demand for housing\u00a0and results in higher rents and house prices.\u00a0\nA weak economy does the opposite. People will not move here unless they think they can find a job, while recently laid off workers with few ties to Vancouver may leave. In other words, we see less demand and more supply.\nAccording to Moody's analytics, for every one\u00a0per cent increase in unemployment, house prices typically drop about 4 per cent. Based on this ratio, if our unemployment rate were to double from pre-COVID-19 levels, home values would drop by roughly 20 per cent.\nThe main reason house prices are not currently dropping is due to government intervention.\u00a0The various levels of government\u00a0stepped in with a series of temporary programs to replace or subsidize the income of those affected by COVID-19. They also arranged for many of our expenses to be deferred \u2014 such as utility bills, taxes and mortgage payments. All these programs have bought struggling homeowners some time, and have taken the pressure off to sell their homes.\u00a0\nBut what happens when the safety nets disappear? That is when the ill-prepared or vulnerable homeowners will be forced to sell. \u00a0Many of the government programs are expected to wind down in the summer and\u00a0fall, and we may see a spike in new listings \u2014 a great time for buyers but terrible for sellers.\nIf I had plans to sell my home sometime in\u00a02020 or early 2021, I would be listing my home sooner rather than later. While I'm not expecting a 20 per cent drop in value over the short term, it also wouldn't surprise me if it did happen.\u00a0I also wouldn't be surprised if the government bailed out the housing market and valuations returned to all time highs. The B.C. government's tax base is heavily reliant on the construction and housing industries,\u00a0so they can't afford to have housing valuations drop too low. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile I'm very cautious on real estate over the short term, I still think it's a solid long-term investment.\nMy advice to prospective buyers, if valuations drop by 15 to 30 per cent in 2020 or early 2021, consider leaving the sidelines as it could be the buying opportunity that many of you have been waiting for.\nIf you have a COVID-19-related story we should pursue that affects British Columbians, please email us at\u00a0impact@cbc.ca\n"}, {"author": "Vianne Timmons", "title": "Put yourself in their shoes: Let's thank the women on the front line of the pandemic", "description": "Women are often in harm's way in this pandemic, says MUN president ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/vianne-timmons-pov-women-1.5559214", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["May 09, 2020 9:00 AM NT", "2020-05-09T11:30:00.782Z"], "source": null, "content": "Chances are the last time you bought your groceries, you were checked out by a woman.\nWomen are the majority of cleaners, cashiers and food-service workers.

The decline since February (-15.7 per cent) outpaces previous financial crises, including\u00a0the 1981-1982 recession, which resulted in a drop of\u00a0-5.4 per cent over 17 months.\u00a0\n\"Today's job numbers start to complete the picture of just how devastating the COVID-19 crisis has been to the Canadian labour market,\" said economist Brendon Bernard of job site Indeed Canada in an email.\n\"While April's decline was a bit more modest than expected, that 6.4 per cent\u00a0of all Canadian adults could lose employment in a single month is staggering.\"\nJob losses are not the only way the COVID-19 crisis has impacted employment. In addition to those who are now out of work, the number of people who were employed but worked less than half their usual hours because of the pandemic increased by 2.5 million from February to April.\nThat means the cumulative effect of the economic shutdown \u2014 people\u00a0both no longer employed or working far less \u2014 was a staggering 5.5 million as of the week of April 12.\nAll provinces have been hard hit by the crisis. Employment dropped in all provinces for the second month running, with losses of more than 10 per cent everywhere.\nQuebec had the worst losses in April at -18.7 per cent, or 821,000 jobs.\u00a0\u00a0\nHere are the jobless rates last month by province (numbers from the previous month in brackets):\nAs for Canada's three territories, due to logistical challenges,\u00a0Statistics Canada's Labour Force Survey methodology is somewhat different there than in the rest of Canada, said Bernard.\n\"Employment rates in the territories haven't been hit as hard as the rest of Canada. That said, Nunavut saw a noticeable drop in the share of the population with a job in April, a sign of how public health concerns and economic uncertainty have extended beyond just the pandemic's hot spots.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nThere is evidence to suggest, however, that\u00a0many pandemic-related\u00a0job losses are temporary.\nIn the month of April, almost all of the newly unemployed \u2014 97 per cent \u2014 were on temporary layoff, indicating they expect to return to their previous places of work as the shutdown is relaxed.\nAt the same time, workplace participation declined to\u00a03.7 percentage points, bringing Canada's participation rate to 59.8 per cent, as more than 1 million dropped out of the labour force, said Porter.\nAmong those still employed, the Labour Force Survey found that an additional 3.3 million workers were working\u00a0from home in April.\nLosses continued to be more rapid in jobs with less security and poorer pay.\nOver the two-month period since February, overall employment (not adjusted for seasonality) declined 17.8 per cent.\nBut it was\u00a0above average among employees with temporary jobs (-30.2 per cent) and those who had been in their jobs one year or less (-29.5 per cent).\nDeclines were sharper for employees earning less than two-thirds of the median hourly wage of $25.04 (-38.1 per cent) and those paid by the hour (-25.1 per cent).\nStatistics Canada said this is consistent with job declines observed in accommodation and food services, and wholesale and retail trade, which tend to be more precarious and lower paying.\nThe\u00a0number of people age 15 and older living households where no one is employed increased\u00a023.5 per cent \u2014 or more than 1.6 million \u2014 in the two months between February and April.\nAmong couples, the number where neither partner is employed increased by 22.5 per cent, or 845,000,\u00a0while single parents who are not employed increased by 53.9 per cent, or\u00a0126,000.\nSmaller companies \u2014 defined as those with fewer than 20 employees \u2014 have shed 30.8 per cent of their workers, medium-sized firms have let 25.1 per cent of workers go, and large companies have seen employment decline by 12.6 per cent.\nHard-hit sectors at the outset include retail, hotels, restaurants and bars, which continued to see losses in April. The losses in the service sector also continued in April, down 1.4 million, or 9.6 per cent, Statistics Canada says.\nProportionally, the losses were greater in goods-producing sectors like construction and manufacturing, which combined lost 621,000 jobs for a drop of 15.8 per cent after being virtually unchanged in March.\nThe federal government announced Friday it will extend its emergency wage-subsidy to the end of June. The program \u2014 which covers 75 per cent of employees' pay, up to $847, to help employers keep their workers on the payroll for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis \u2014 was previously set to end June 6.\nAverage wages in April were up 10.8 per cent compared with a year ago.

That's down 244,000 from mid-March, when social-distancing measures had only just begun.\nCombined with the roughly 117,000 people who lost work in March, the province has now seen a decline in employment equal to about 10 per cent of its total, working-age population\u00a0\u2014 in the span of two months.\nThat's by far the largest and fastest decline the province has seen\u00a0since Statistics Canada's modern employment records began in 1976.\nThe new numbers further reveal the extent of the economic shutdown across Canada, as well.\nNationally, there were nearly two\u00a0million fewer Canadians working\u00a0in April, compared with March. That's on top of the roughly one million people who lost work in March, compared to February.\nThe global pandemic has had a more pronounced effect on some types of employment, particularly service-industry workers, who tend to be younger.\nOver the past two months, the employment rate \u2014 that is, the percentage of people working\u00a0\u2014\u00a0among Albertans under the age of 25 has fallen by nearly 20 percentage points.\nYoung women in the province saw their employment rate nearly cut in half, falling from\u00a055.9 per cent in February\u00a0to just\u00a030.3 per cent in April.\nThis trend was evident in March, as many service-industry employers were among the first to shut down in the wake of COVID-19.\nHope Sheridan, 25,\u00a0worked as a recruiter with GoodLife Fitness in Calgary until the gym closed down in mid-March and she was laid off on a temporary basis.\nShe said her employer hopes to reopen as soon as possible but it's still not clear exactly when they will be allowed to resume operations and, as a young mother, the uncertainty has been difficult.\n\"It's been extremely stressful,\" she said.\n\"There are no answers on whether we're coming back anytime soon.\"\nAnd while younger female workers were hit hard again in April, Tombe said the effects of the pandemic expanded to other, more male-dominated sectors, as well.\n\"What we saw in April is, as the economic contraction proceeded, losses in the construction sector and in manufacturing really closed that gender gap quite a bit,\" he said.\nThe overall unemployment rate in Alberta jumped 4.7 percentage points from March, rising to\u00a013.4 per cent in April.\nBut Tombe says that figure masks the extent of the job losses, given how many people are not looking for work amid the deliberate shutdown of the economy, and are not included in that count.\nWhen looking at the total\u00a0\"potential\" labour force, he said, 32 per cent of Albertans who could be working are not.\nAnother unusual aspect to this economic shutdown is the number of people who are still employed but working fewer hours.\n\"There are a large number of individuals who didn't actually lose their job but have basically lost all of their hours worked,\" Tombe said.\nAbout 330,000 people in Alberta recorded zero hours worked in April, he said.\nOverall, the number of hours worked in province was down 24.8 per cent compared with February.\nThe number of hours worked was down even more sharply in other provinces, particularly Quebec.\nTombe noted Alberta was already in an economic slump, even before the pandemic arrived.\n\"In Alberta's case, the downturn due to the virus is following many months of disappointing economic performance and, indeed, employment losses even prior to February,\" he said.\n\"We were potentially entering a second recession even before the virus hit in Alberta, so it's a particularly challenging time for this province.\"\nThe province's employment numbers were the subject of an exchange between Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley and Premier Jason Kenney in a rare Friday question period at the Alberta legislature.\nNotley called on Kenney to extend provincial measures like eviction protections and utility bill deferrals beyond the end of June.\nKenney said his government has already provided $15 billion in relief for Alberta workers and businesses, including emergency isolation payments and a break on WCB premiums.

What could emerge from that process is what the senior\u00a0official described as a \"glide-and-launch phase,\" where some direct aid programs slowly wind down while economic stimulus programs are launched.\nTrudeau revealed\u00a0one of the first steps of that review on Friday when he announced that the wage subsidy program would continue beyond June to help kick-start the reopening of provincial\u00a0economies\u00a0and allow people to move from the CERB to paid work.\n\"We need an economy to come back to and direct support is a key part of that,\" said a finance official speaking on background.\u00a0\"Everything is going to be largely dependent on where we are and what the needs are.\"\nBut even as the federal government prepares for the next phase of its pandemic response, it's\u00a0still busy trying to deal with the first wave of challenges. The already-extended wage subsidy is still in the getting-money-out-the-door phase. There's also the\u00a0unfulfilled promise of direct financial help for seniors to address. And hard-hit sectors such as airlines, energy and hospitality will need some kind of sector-specific bailouts.\n\"The big business bailout is the hardest one to do out of all of them,\" said the senior federal official. \"How do you bridge people to a better time and what do you get in return for that?\"\nPart of the government's\u00a0concern here is the risk of being seen bailing out companies that use tax havens or engage in tax avoidance. There's a desire at the federal level\u00a0to make sure that any bailout includes a degree of public oversight and can support\u00a0the argument that it was done in the public's interest.\n\"We will, over the coming days, start looking at specific sectoral supports,\" Trudeau said Friday. \"But even then, our focus will be on the workers \u2026 and not on the corporate well-being of an industry or sector.\"\nAnd while airlines have been promised some sort of help, public transit companies are also knocking on Ottawa's door.\u00a0The Trudeau government is a big booster of mass public\u00a0transit and a big spender\u00a0when it comes to capital investment to boost transit capacity.\nBut transit operations are largely a municipal responsibility. Ottawa is trying to find a way to help that sector without becoming a long-term player in transit policy.\nAs this crisis continues, jurisdictional lines are blurring. Many municipal and provincial governments were in\u00a0precarious\u00a0financial situations going into the pandemic and will be even more\u00a0vulnerable as they emerge from it. The Bank of Canada already\u00a0has launched a multi-billion dollar program to buy provincial government bonds because provinces like Newfoundland and Labrador have had trouble borrowing on the open market.\nAll of this will require Ottawa's attention when the dust settles \u2014 and billions of dollars more in federal spending may be required. Senior Liberals are already conceding they may need to go slower and be less aggressive on their campaign commitments, because the virus\u00a0has presented them with an urgent new\u00a0set of priorities.\n\"We are not yet talking about stimulus,\" Trudeau said. \"We are still very much in the support and emergency phase right now.\"\nBut the costs will keep growing. We still have no clear idea of how much this will cost the country. And the government's view is that it's still too early to talk about paying the bill.\n"}, {"author": "David Cochrane, Vassy Kapelos", "title": "Tiff Macklem to lead the Bank of Canada", "description": "Stephen Poloz\u2019s term as governor ends in June", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bank-of-canada-tiff-macklem-1.5551828", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5552086.1588341998!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/boc-governor-20200501.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 01, 2020 12:09 AM ET", "2020-05-01T15:08:34.449Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Finance Minister Bill Morneau has appointed Tiff Macklem, the former senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, to take over the top job at the central bank\u00a0as it navigates the uncertainty of a pandemic-driven recession.\nMacklem is currently the dean of the Rotman School of Management in Toronto, but had spent decades with the Bank of Canada before starting that appointment.\u00a0\nMacklem began his career at the bank in 1984. He was widely expected to win the contest for bank governor in 2013, but was beaten out by Stephen Poloz, who was then CEO of Export Development Canada.\nPoloz's term ends June 2.\u00a0\nThe transition to new leadership comes as millions of Canadians have signed up for government aid and companies big and small are relying on federally backed wage subsidies to weather the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring Friday's announcement,\u00a0Morneau\u00a0said he's confident Macklem's expertise in financial markets will help the central bank\u00a0navigate\u00a0an economic crisis never before seen in Canada.\nBank of Canada holds rate steady at 0.25% and hints it has no plans to go any lower\nStephen Poloz to step down as Bank of Canada governor at end of term\n\"The bank has to be humble about what it doesn't know. There's a lot we don't know about this disease. There's a lot that medical experts don't know about this disease,\" Macklem said during his unveiling in Ottawa.\n\"But the Bank of Canada has tremendous analytic economic financial capacity to analyze what's going on in the economy, and the important role for the Bank of Canada is to provide Canadians with as much information as it can honestly provide as to what is happening and what the recovery could look like, recognizing that we're probably going to have to look at more than one scenario.\"\nIn the past months, Poloz and Morneau have appeared at several joint news conferences to show a co-ordinated approach on monetary and fiscal policy to deal with the economic fallout of the pandemic and global oil shocks.\nMorneau has announced more than $250 billion in direct financial aid, credit support and tax deferrals to help offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPoloz has cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25 per cent, committed the central bank to buying billions in government bonds each week until the economy is in recovery and taken steps to strengthen liquidity in the banking sector.\nThe person who replaces Poloz will be facing an economy that, according to the bank's own projections, could shrink by 30 per cent or more in the second quarter.\nThe next government will have practically no room to use interest rate cuts to help the economy. Poloz has already taken the unprecedented step \u2014 in Canada at least \u2014 of directly buying government bonds.\nThat limited flexibility is compounded by the rapid use of the federal government's fiscal firepower to put a financial floor under Canadian households and businesses.\nThe parliamentary budget officer said it's likely the federal deficit for the year will hit $252 billion as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and could go even higher if emergency measures remain in place longer than planned.\nIn selecting Macklem, the government passed over Poloz's top deputy, Carolyn Wilkins, the first woman to serve as the bank's senior deputy governor. She\u00a0would have been the first woman to serve as governor.\nWilkins was viewed by many as the front-runner for the position and would have provided some continuity at the country's central bank as it navigates the uncertainty of a pandemic-driven recession.\nWATCH |\u00a0Morneau announces Tiff Macklem as governor of the Bank of Canada:\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canada's big banks cut credit card interest rates to ease coronavirus impact", "description": "Big Six will temporarily reduce credit card interest rates amid COVID-19 pandemic", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/big-six-banks-credit-card-interest-rates-relief-covid-19-1.5522343", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5253932.1570659856!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/transunion-debt-report-20190820.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 04, 2020 6:55 PM ET", "2020-04-04T22:55:15.561Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada's Big Six banks all said they will reduce interest rates on credit cards to provide relief to customers affected by COVID-19 pandemic.\nBank of Montreal said on Saturday it will temporarily reduce credit card interest rates to 10.99 per cent\u00a0for personal and small business customers receiving payment deferrals due to the outbreak.

On Wednesday, it said it would keep doing that but also buy up to $50 billion worth of provincial debt and up to $10 billion worth of corporate debt in order to ensure there is enough of what central bankers refer to as \"liquidity\"\u2014 a complicated term that boils down to the simple\u00a0notion of making sure there is enough cash in the system to allow normal transactions to happen.\nBy buying up bonds from governments and companies and taking it off their books, the central bank is freeing up cash that those entities can then use to put to work in the real economy.\n\"This helps ensure that households and businesses continue to have access to the credit they need to bridge this difficult time, and that lower interest rates find their way to ultimate borrowers,\" the bank said.\nStrategist Andrew Kelvin with TD Bank thinks the move to extend\u00a0liquidity help to provinces and corporations is a significant development.\n\"I don't think there was a problem in the provincial market or the corporate bond market, but the Bank of Canada just saw an opportunity to add more stimulus,\" he said. \"It's just another way of them injecting stimulus into the market.\"\nCentral banks cut their rates when they want to encourage borrowing to stimulate the economy. They raise them when they want to cool down inflation. The Bank of Canada's rate filters down into the economy by impacting rates on things like mortgages and savings accounts at banks.\u00a0\nThe bank noting that its rate is as low as it can realistically go is a direct message to consumers, says James Laird, co-founder of\u00a0Ratehub.ca\u00a0and president of\u00a0CanWise\u00a0Financial mortgage brokerage.\n\"Consumers should not expect their rate to go any lower since the bank has reiterated that they are at their lower bound.\u00a0The position of the bank is to leave the rate unchanged until the economic situation stabilizes.\"\nTD Bank economist Brian DePratto agrees that the bank is saying it can't\u00a0plausibly cut its interest rate any more than it already has. But that doesn't mean it's going to sit on the sidelines doing nothing as the economy goes through the biggest downturn in decades.\n\"Further rate cuts may be off the table, but the bank clearly stands ready to scale up [bond] purchases as needed,\" he said.\nAlicia MacDonald with the Conference Board of Canada thought the bank's signaling that it would not put its rate down to negative territory was the right move to make. \"As interest rates approach zero, further rate cuts have a less stimulative impact...when weighing the small stimulative benefit against the feasible large cost to the financial sector, there is not a strong case for further cuts to the overnight rate at this point,\" she said.\n"}]
