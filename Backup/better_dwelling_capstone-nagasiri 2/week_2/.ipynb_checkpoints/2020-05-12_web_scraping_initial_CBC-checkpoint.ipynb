       " 'content': 'The head of the Federal Reserve said Wednesday the U.S. central bank is not considering using negative interest rates, despite President Donald Trump seemingly pushing for them.\\nIn a tweet Tuesday night, the president said other countries are enjoying the advantages of negative interest rates, and he urged his own central bank to accept the \"gift\" they would bestow on the U.S. economy.\\nTypically central banks tinker with lending rates in an attempt to control inflation, raising rates when they want to cool down an overheated economy, and cutting them when they want to encourage borrowing and investment. But in recent years, central banks in Europe and Asia have gone as far as making their interest rates go below zero in an attempt to counter unprecedented economic situations.\\n\"As long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates, the USA should also accept the \\'GIFT\\',\" Trump tweeted.\\nAs long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates, the USA should also accept the âGIFTâ. Big numbers!\\nThe president has long criticized his central bank chief for keeping interest rates higher than Trump would like them to be. That\\'s largely because cheap lending rates tend to be good news for the stock market, which Trump is understood to view as a proxy for his own popularity and economic aptitude.\\nCurrently, the U.S. Fed\\'s benchmark interest rate is set at 0.25 per cent.\\nSpeaking at a think-tank in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday morning, Powell addressed the economic impact of the coronavirus. He was asked by reporters afterward whether or not the bank was considering negative interest rates.\\n\"I know there are fans of the policy, but for now it\\'s not something that we\\'re considering,\" Powell said. \"The committee\\'s view on negative rates really has not changed â¦. This is not something that we\\'re looking at.\"\\nPowell\\'s reluctance to go negative may be wise. While other countries have tried it, Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist of Cambridge Global Payments, says there is some\\xa0academic research to suggest that negative rates could harm the U.S. economy\\xa0by raising precautionary savings rates and reducing incentives to lend.\\n\"As the euro area, Japan, Sweden\\xa0and Switzerland have shown, there\\'s no conclusive evidence to suggest that negative rates lift lending, growth\\xa0or inflation,\" Schamotta said.\\nWhile pouring cold water on the idea of negative rates, Powell didn\\'t suggest the Fed planned to stay on the sidelines while the U.S. economy goes through what he described as an experience \"significantly worse\" than any recession seen since the Second World War.\\nPowell cautioned that widespread bankruptcies among small businesses and extended unemployment for many people remain a serious risk.\\n\"We ought to do what we can to avoid these outcomes,\" Powell said.\\nBank of Montreal economist Michael Gregory said there\\'s a lot that the Fed can still do besides negative savings rates.\\n\"The Fed has more policy cards up its sleeve, and is more than willing to play them to promote economic recovery,\" he said. \"And it won\\'t be taking these cards off the table for a while.\"\\n'}"

But we know that debt levels are going to rise, so the right combination of economic policies will be important, too.\"\\nOne of the issues on the bank\\'s radar will be the number of people having\\xa0trouble staying on top of their mortgages.\\nThe bank said that if no new policies had been implemented in response to the unprecedented economic impact of COVID-19, the mortgage arrears rate may\\xa0have risen\\xa0to 2.1 per cent of all loans by the end of this year. That means more than one out of every 50 homeowners would be at least three months behind on their payments\\xa0â almost 10 times the number that were before the COVID-19 crisis.\\nAs it stands, because of some of the policies put in place, the bank says that under the current worst case scenario, the\\xa0mortgage arrears rate will spike to about 0.8 per cent and remain on a much flatter curve that doesn\\'t peak until next year, once payment deferral plans offered by the big banks at the outset of this crisis\\xa0are set to expire.\\nCurrently, the mortgage arrears rate is at slightly more than 0.2\\xa0per cent. If the rate peaks to 0.8 per cent, that would be roughly twice as high as its highest point during the financial crisis of 2009.\\xa0\\nThe bank did caution that those forecasts are assuming the worst case scenario for its stress-test modelling, and far more optimistic scenarios could play out.\\n\"The unprecedented nature of the pandemic .. makes the uncertainty around the results exceptionally high,\" the bank said.\\nWe already know about record-setting job losses during the\\xa0pandemic, but the bank gave some new data regarding just how many people are finding it hard to make ends meet.\\nBy its calculations, the bank says about one out of every five home-owning households\\xa0in Canada doesn\\'t currently have enough money to cover two months\\'\\xa0worth of expenses, and almost one third don\\'t have enough to cover four months\\'\\xa0worth.\\nEven despite the financial support programs, such as\\xa0wage subsidies, implemented by the federal government, \"some households are likely to fall behind on their loan payments,\" the bank said.\\xa0\"This typically appears first in missed credit card and auto loan payments and later in mortgage payments.\"\\nWatch | Deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins on the outlook for Canada\\'s housing market:\\nThat\\'s not just a problem for homeowners, either, Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Brian DePratto\\xa0says.\\n\"Renters are not immune, as they are more likely to work in industries most affected by COVID-19,\" he said. \"The longer the income shock, the greater the risk of increased consumer insolvencies.\\n\"Broad-based income support measures can only last so long, making the gradual economic reopening crucial to the health of the Canadian economy\\'s financial underpinnings.\"\\n'}\n"

The terms of the sale would have had Shell responsible for existing contamination and Pieridae on the hook for future problems.\\n\"The scope and extent of the contamination at the site is not well known and is not well described in the applications,\" the decision said. \"To date, the contamination at the sites has not been fully understood.\"\\nWithout knowing that, the regulator said, it would be impossible to know which company would have been responsible for what.\\nThe decision also said the company that made the mess should clean it up.\\n\"Shell is the polluter,\" said the decision. \"The ... applications appear to request that the AER, by way of approval, override or at least significantly dilute Shell\\'s obligations.\\n\"The AER is of the view that it cannot, by way of approval, carve up and redistribute fundamental regulatory obligations in a manner that is contrary to or inconsistent with (the law).\"\\nThe two companies agreed to the deal last summer. It involves 284 wells, 66 facilities and 82 pipelines in the southern Alberta foothills.\\nIt came shortly after the regulator had promised a closer eye on such licence transfers to ensure purchasers are able to cover reclamation costs. At the time, Pieridae\\'s market value was less than the price of the Shell assets and its stock value was less than a dollar.\\nThe number of energy facilities left unreclaimed by struggling producers has boomed in recent years. As of May 14, Alberta alone had more than 10,000 unreclaimed wells, pipelines, facilities and sites.\\nIn April, the federal government pledged $1.7 billion for such so-called orphan wells in Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, although they are supposed to be reclaimed by an industry-funded group.\\nThe energy regulator said the two companies were free to restructure their deal and try again to get the licence transfers approved.\\n'}\n"
