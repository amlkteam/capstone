Per-capita output will contract in more than 90 per cent of countries, the biggest share since 1870.

Emerging and developing economies will shrink 2.5 per cent, their worst performance in data that starts in 1960, it said. Those with limited health-care capacity, deeply integrated global value chains, heavy dependence on foreign financing and extensive reliance on international trade, commodity exports and tourism are likely to be the hardest hit.While the World Bank sees China\u2019s economy eking out 1 per cent growth this year, the lowest rate since 1976, it forecasts India\u2019s will shrink 3.2 per cent. U.S. GDP may contract 6.1 per cent.The World Bank presents two alternative scenarios. In one, where the COVID-19 outbreak persists for longer than expected, requiring the continuation or reintroduction of restrictions on movement, the global economy would shrink almost 8 per cent this year. If control measures can be largely lifted in the near term, the contraction would be 4 per cent \u2014 still more than twice as deep as the global financial crisis of 2009.\u201cThe global recession would be deeper if bringing the pandemic under control took longer than expected, or if financial stress triggered cascading defaults,\u201d the World Bank said.The International Monetary Fund will update its World Economic Outlook on June 24. In April, the fund forecast a 3 per cent contraction for this year, though chief economist Gita Gopinath has since said that the outlook has worsened. The methodologies are different because IMF aggregate forecasts are based on purchasing-power parity, which gives more weight to developing economies, while the World Bank uses market exchange rates.Most central banks have cut interest rates to about or below zero to buffer the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve starting an unprecedented range of emergency programs providing as much as US$2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal-stimulus packages have varied. The U.S. is providing about 15 per cent of GDP in support and Germany about 4.7 per cent, while Japan\u2019s program is worth about 42 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jacqueline Thorpe and Sandrine Rastello", "title": "Setback to Montreal retail reopening shows rocky path to getting economy running again", "description": "The high number of COVID-19 cases in Montreal hospitals caused Premier Francois Legault to postpone store openings by a week", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/montreal-retail-setback-shows-canadas-rocky-path-to-reopening?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/quebec.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 4, 2020 5:35 PM EDT", "content": "Quebec has been forced to dial back plans for reopening its economy, just six days after the premier announced them.The high number of COVID-19 cases in Montreal hospitals caused Premier Francois Legault to postpone store openings by a week in the province\u2019s largest city. Last week he said the city\u2019s retail outlets would be allowed to open May 11; the new date is May 18.Next door in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford indicated he would continue to take a slow approach to restarting Canada\u2019s biggest provincial economy. Ford said the province is getting close to allowing more retail stores to open for curbside pickup \u2014 as long as virus cases continue to decline. He didn\u2019t give a date.Getting back to business is proving to be no easy task, even as the Canadian economy continues to buckle under the strain of shutdowns. The two neighbouring provinces account for more than 55 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP but have been the epicentre of its virus cases, with 93 per cent of Canada\u2019s deaths as of Monday.The next dilemma for Quebec is whether to stick to a planned May 19 reopening of primary schools and daycares in Montreal. \u201cIt\u2019s out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitals, while we have very little room for maneuver in Montreal,\u201d Legault told reporters in Quebec City.Most of Quebec\u2019s 1,772 hospitalized COVID-19 patients are in the Montreal region, which has enough beds for now but where the situation is \u201cvery tight,\u201d he said.Quebec\u2019s death tally rose to 2,280 Monday, with 32,623 confirmed cases. Deaths now register 267 per million people, higher than the U.S. at 208 and more than double Canada at 101, according to Quebec\u2019s public health institute. The problem for both Quebec and Ontario has been severe outbreaks at long-term care facilities, which account for about 80 per cent of fatalities.It's out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitalsMeanwhile, fresh evidence arrived Monday that the economic strain continues to build. Figures showed companies took out loans at the fastest pace since 1981 in March. Employment data due on Friday may show the economy lost more than 4 million jobs in April, a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decline on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Still, stores outside of Montreal were allowed to reopen Tuesday with manufacturing and construction still planned to restart everywhere in Quebec on May 11.In Ontario, only a handful of businesses were allowed to get back to business on Monday, including garden centres offering curbside pickup, automatic car washes and a few more essential construction projects. Ontario has 17,923 cases and 1,300 deaths.However, the province is getting close to relaxing restrictions on retail if infection numbers continue to improve, Ford said.\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable. The numbers keep going down. We\u2019re going to get the economy going based on health and science,\u201d he said at a news conference in Toronto. \u201cJust because we open up these stores it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a free-for-all.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "America\u2019s longest economic expansion is over \u2014 and the deepest recession in at least eight decades has begun", "description": "GPD falls 4.8%, consumer spending down most since 1980, business investment plummets to 11-year low", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-economy-shrinks-at-4-8-pace-signaling-start-of-recession", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/recession.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 29, 2020 9:25 AM EDT", "content": "The record-long U.S. economic expansion is over after almost 11 years, with the deepest recession in at least eight decades now under way. The world\u2019s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.That will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Despite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus\u2019s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn\u2019t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what\u2019s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP \u2014 the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 \u2014 compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Consumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn\u2019t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "Canada's AAA credit rating on the line as oil crash slams debt-loaded provinces", "description": "Provinces are likely to need more assistance from the federal government \u2014 which could trigger a downgrade", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-aaa-on-the-line-as-oil-crash-hits-debt-loaded-provinces?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/canada-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 23, 2020 11:53 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s stellar credit rating is being put to the test as the oil crash and recession expose the country\u2019s weak link: its provinces.Among the Group of Seven countries, only Germany and Canada have AAA ratings from S&P Global Ratings. But as pressure rises on the government of Justin Trudeau to aid provinces and key industries, Canada\u2019s fiscal position is looking shakier.Going into the COVID-19 crisis, Canada\u2019s provincial governments had $853 billion (US$602 billion) of debt securities outstanding, more than the national government. They also shoulder most of the cost for health care and eduction. Several of them rely on energy revenues that are evaporating. Oil-rich Alberta released a budget in February based on West Texas Intermediate prices of US$58 a barrel. Its deficit projections crumbled within days.Last week the Bank of Canada expanded its asset purchase program to include as much as $50 billion in provincial debt to bring down yields. That may not be enough: Trudeau will likely have to come up with new fiscal measures too.\u201cThere is a very good chance that the need for more massive federal assistance for the provinces, for households, for the business sector, will trigger a downgrade at some point\u201d for Canada, said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co.Canadian governments will have net borrowing needs of 11.8 per cent of GDP this year, higher than all G7 countries except the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund.Pricing on credit default swaps suggests traders see Canada\u2019s profile as similar to Australia \u2014 whose top credit rating was put on negative outlook by S&P on April 7 \u2014 and lower-rated New Zealand. Canada\u2019s economy is set to contract by 5.3 per cent in 2020, compared with 2.4 per cent decline globally, S&P said in an April 20 note.The federal and provincial governments have put together a virus response package of at least $315 billion, S&P said.\u201cThe fact that the Bank of Canada is now buying provincial debt, and that will help keep borrowing costs low \u2014 I think that will be very important for the credit rating,\u201d said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co. She sees the Canada\u2019s top credit rating as \u201cextremely resilient,\u201d citing the central government\u2019s relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio, which was a little more than 30 per cent before the crisis.Fitch Ratings, which is in the process of updating its projections for Canada as well as other sovereigns, looks at gross consolidated general government debt rather than federal debt in its models, said Kelli Bissett-Tom, a director of Americas sovereign ratings. By that yardstick Canada is \u201camong the weak\u201d AAA-rated sovereigns, she said, though it isn\u2019t an automatic trigger for a credit action.While the federal government doesn\u2019t explicitly guarantee the debt issued by provinces, credit-rating companies and investors assume a high probability of support.For instance, Newfoundland and Labrador\u2019s rating of A1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service would be two levels lower if not for the assumption of \u201ca high level of extraordinary support from the government of Canada,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in an April 1 statement. Moody\u2019s put the province on negative outlook, citing the decline of oil prices. It\u2019s the most indebted province, with debt at about 2.5 times revenues for the fiscal year that ended March 31.Newfoundland and some other provinces, including Manitoba, want the Trudeau government to set up an emergency credit agency to help them borrow more cheaply. They also want changes to the fiscal stabilization program, a federal mechanism created in the 1960s to help provinces facing revenue drops.\u201cWe still believe the proposal for an emergency fund has merit, and we will continue to work with our provincial counterparts and the federal government on solutions to the challenges we collectively face,\u201d said Newfoundland Finance Minister Tom Osborne.Alberta continues to press for a package of between $20 billion and $30 billion to help oil and gas companies stay afloat, Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said.\u201cOil and gas is the largest subsector of the Canadian economy and we have advocated to the federal government that the liquidity package needs to be significant,\u201d said Toews in an emailed statement.Provincial debt issuance for this year may reach $150 billion compared with about $100 billion estimated before the COVID-19 outbreak, Bank of Nova Scotia analysts including Rebekah Young wrote in an April 15 note. That\u2019s on top of federal financing needs of about $450 billion.\u201cProvincials are absolutely key for Canada\u2019s rating, because provincial debt in Canada collectively makes up the largest sub-sovereign debt issuance in the world,\u201d said Alexandra Gorewicz, portfolio manager at CI Investments.

As its oil sector shrivelled in recent years, Canada\u2019s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis. Nearly one in three workers have applied for income support.What\u2019s more, its households are among the world\u2019s most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm.\u201cI think it is the Great Reckoning,\u201d says Douglas Hoyes, a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener, Ontario. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a period for so long where it didn\u2019t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were. Well, guess what? Now it matters.\u201dSince the economy began shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus, policy makers have raced to buttress the property market. Banks are offering mortgage holidays, including to landlords with multiple loans on investment properties.That has raised eyebrows even within the real estate industry. \u201cShould someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance?\u201d asks Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor. \u201cWhere exactly do we draw the line?\u201dThe country may not have much of a choice but to prop up housing. Real estate has become Canada\u2019s largest sector. Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent.If it collapses, there\u2019s not much that can pick up the slack \u2014 certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer. Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven\u2019t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiralled higher, homeowners felt richer \u2014 they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher.That virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it\u2019s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can\u2019t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year.It\u2019s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city\u2019s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents.Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t use your house like an ATM\u201d \u2014 as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties.This virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predictedToday, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 \u2014 a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis.Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt \u2014 an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country\u2019s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust.\u201cYou have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,\u201d says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. \u201cAnd this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only 2 per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas.That\u2019s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren\u2019t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September.For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That\u2019s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections.Then there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that\u2019s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada\u2019s Airbnb hosts \u2014 who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 \u2014 need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Economists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.\u201cIt\u2019s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter\u2019s grandchildren aren\u2019t even going to be able to pay this off,\u201d says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan after?\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Eric Martin", "title": "\u2018Crisis like no other\u2019: IMF warns \u2018Great Lockdown\u2019 recession will be worst in almost 100 years", "description": "In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/imf-says-great-lockdown-recession-likely-worst-since-depression?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/closed-5.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 14, 2020 12:52 PM EDT", "content": "The International Monetary Fund predicted the \u201cGreat Lockdown\u201d recession would be the steepest in almost a century and warned the world economy\u2019s contraction and recovery would be worse than anticipated if the coronavirus lingers or returns.In its first World Economic Outlook report since the spread of the coronavirus and subsequent freezing of major economies, the IMF estimated on Tuesday that global gross domestic product will shrink 3 per cent this year.That compares to a January projection of 3.3 per cent expansion and would likely mark the deepest dive since the Great Depression. It would also dwarf the 0.1 per cent contraction of 2009 amid the financial crisis.Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shockWhile the fund anticipated growth of 5.8 per cent next year, which would be the strongest in records dating back to 1980, it cautioned risks lay to the downside. Much depends on the longevity of the pandemic, its effect on activity and related stresses in financial and commodity markets, it said.Even if the IMF\u2019s forecast proves accurate, it said output in both advanced and emerging markets would undershoot their pre-virus trends through 2021, seemingly dashing any lingering hopes of a V-shaped economic rebound from the health emergency.In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both. A lengthier pandemic would wipe 3 per cent off GDP this year compared to the baseline, while protraction plus a resumption next year would mean 8 per cent less output than projected in 2021, it said.\u201cThis crisis is like no other,\u201d Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a foreword to its semi-annual report. \u201cLike in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.\u201dAs with the virus\u2019s reach, the economic hit is sweeping.

The euro area will probably shrink 7.5 per cent in 2020 and expand 4.7 per cent in 2021, it said.\u201cMany countries face a multi-layered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital-flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cRisks of a worse outcome predominate.\u201dThe grim projections are a stark reversal from the IMF\u2019s outlook less than two months ago. On Feb. 19, the fund told Group of 20 finance chiefs that \u201cglobal growth appears to be bottoming out.\u201d Three days later, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicted the virus would likely cut just 0.1 percentage point from the fund\u2019s global growth forecast for this year, although she acknowledged \u201cmore dire scenarios\u201d were being studied.The fund sees advanced economies shrinking the most, contracting 6.1 per cent. Emerging-market and developing economies will see a 1 per cent drop. Growth in China and India will decelerate but their economies will still manage to expand 1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, the fund said.The IMF\u2019s baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of this year and that containment measures can be gradually wound down.Global trade volume in goods and services will probably tumble 11 per cent this year, the fund said.Growth in consumer prices in advanced economies may average 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 1.5 per cent in 2021, it said. The jobless rate in the U.S., which was at a half-century low before the pandemic, may swell to 10.4 per cent in 2020, the IMF said.Most central banks around the world have cut interest rates to around or below zero to blunt the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal stimulus packages have varied more. The U.S. is providing about 10 per cent of gross domestic product in support and Germany about 4.5 per cent, while Japan\u2019s program is worth about 20 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.The IMF said that fiscal measures will need to increase if stoppages to economic activity persist, or if the pickup in activity once restrictions are lifted is too weak. Economies with financing constraints may also require external support, the fund said. Georgieva had repeatedly pledged to use the IMF\u2019s $1 trillion in loan capacity to help its members.The IMF and World Bank are holding their spring meetings via video conference for the first time ever this week. Their normal in-person meetings typically draw thousands of delegates, observers and journalists from 189 member countries. The program has been pared down to mostly media briefings and private meetings, skipping the typical seminars and public discussions.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reed Stevenson", "title": "Michael Burry of 'The Big Short'\u00a0slams coronavirus lockdowns in tweetstorm", "description": "Burry says lockdowns intended to contain the pandemic are worse than the disease itself", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-slams-virus-lockdowns-in-tweetstorm", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/michael-burry.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 7, 2020 2:43 PM EDT", "content": "Michael Burry, the doctor-turned-investor who famously bet against mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, has taken to Twitter with a controversial message: lockdowns intended to contain the coronavirus pandemic are worse than the disease itself.Government-directed shutdowns in the U.S., which led to millions of job losses and may trigger one of the country\u2019s\u00a0 deepest-ever economic contractions, aren\u2019t necessary to contain the epidemic and have disproportionately hurt low-income families and minorities, Burry argued in a series of tweets over the past two weeks. He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to\u00a0become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame\u00a0after his hedge fund\u2019s\u00a0bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d\u00a0an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis.Although Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled \u201cbubble\u201d in passive investment products. He\u2019s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.\u201cUniversal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,\u201d Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.\u201dBurry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community,\u00a0began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle\u00a0as the \u201creal personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.\u201d He said he began speaking out\u00a0because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. \u201cUnconscionable,\u201d is how he described job losses in the U.S.,\u00a0which have caused a once-unthinkable\u00a010 million people to apply for unemployment benefits\u00a0in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN\u00a0Bloomberg.Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He\u2019s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a \u201csignificant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201d without providing details except to say it was a trade of a \u201cgood size\u201d against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201d\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201d\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201d\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201d\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada ekes out meagre growth in January before COVID-19 pandemic shut down economy", "description": "Gross domestic product rose 0.1 per cent from December, missing economist estimates for a 0.2 per cent gain", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-ekes-out-meager-growth-in-january-before-pandemic?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/economy.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 31, 2020 2:15 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy expanded less than expected in January even before the pandemic caused a virtual shutdown, reinforcing views the first quarter will be weak.Gross domestic product rose 0.1 per cent from December, missing economist estimates for a 0.2 per cent gain, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.

It would still have to pass in the House before it gets to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had consulted with Schumer throughout his negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The plan includes about US$500 billion that can be used to back loans and assistance to companies, including US$50 billion for loans to U.S. airlines, as well as state and local governments. It also has more than US$350 billion to aid small businesses. Then there is US$150 billion for hospitals and other health-care providers for equipment and supplies.For individuals the package provides direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of US$1,200 for each adult, as well as US$500 for each child. Unemployment insurance would be extended to four months, the benefits would be bolstered by US$600 weekly and eligibility would be expanded to cover more workers.Democrats demanded and won a series of restraints on corporations that would benefit from loans or investments from the Treasury Department, as well as an oversight mechanism for who gets money.Any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. They also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers. The Treasury Department would have to disclose the terms of loans or other aid to companies and a new Treasury inspector general would oversee the lending program.Notably, Democrats won language that would bar any business owned by Trump or his family from getting loans from Treasury. Businesses owned by members of Congress, heads of executive departments and Vice President Mike Pence also would be blocked.With the prospect that Congress was closing in on a deal Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 11% in its biggest advance since 1933, and the S&P 500 rebounded with the biggest one-day gain since October 2008 after starting the week with a rout. In Asia markets, U.S. futures pared early losses after news of the deal.In a letter to his fellow Democrats, Schumer highlighted a series of transparency measures that would prevent keeping loans secret and create a new inspector general to oversee the program.Schumer also said that hundreds of billions would be spent on Democratic priorities, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, money for hospitals as well as more funding for cities and transportation.Democrats also rejected the US$3 billion sought by the Trump administration to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Pelosi said on Tuesday that the House could quickly approve a Senate-passed coronavirus stimulus with a voice vote that doesn\u2019t require members to travel to Washington \u2014 as long as the bill does not have any \u201cpoison pills\u201d Democrats object to.That would also require the unanimous consent of all House Republicans. The second-ranking House Republican, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, told his vote-counting team during a conference call Tuesday night that the best option is to accept a Senate-passed economic stimulus bill, according to Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine.Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, said after the agreement was reached that the \u201cthe president and his team look forward to swift action for urgently needed assistance to the American people and powerful aid to the nation\u2019s economy as we work through this crisis.\u201dThe size of the stimulus package is unprecedented, dwarfing the approximately US$800 billion Obama stimulus that passed five months after the 2008 financial crash.Together with Fed intervention, the proposed legislation amounted to a US$6 trillion stimulus, according to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, or about 30% of annual GDP.The package will likely more than double a U.S budget deficit that was already set to hit US$1 trillion this year before the outbreak. It also may not be the last infusion of government spending in response to the spread of the virus.Lawmakers universally expressed a sense of urgency as the nation\u2019s economy deteriorates and the health outlook grows more dire. The World Health Organization said the U.S. has the potential to become the new epicenter of the global pandemic as the number of known infections soars.The proposal is the third \u2014 and biggest \u2014 plan by Congress to confront the coronavirus crisis as the disease spreads.An initial US$8 billion plan passed by Congress March 5 is funding emergency health care needs stemming from the coronavirus, and a second plan enacted last week will provide many Americans with paid sick leave, food assistance and free coronavirus testing.

The market was about 1 per cent away from that as of noon on Wednesday.\u201cThe 2016 low is a key support level and one we are watching right now. This is an important technical support level that we would expect to hold. Given valuation, the current market environment is very similar to 2014-16 not only within the energy sector but financials and other areas of the market.\u201d\u201cIn 2016 there were many great opportunities for investors based on valuation and dividend yields.

The return of Chinese shoppers to glitzy malls and boutiques will help boost demand for these types of companies, he said.Energy stocks now have smaller weighting on the Canadian benchmark than they did four years ago, Prince said.

Morneau is expected to release a stimulus package of about 1 per cent of GDP in a bid to help stave off a recession as Canada grapples with fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and a sharp drop in oil prices.Speculation had been rising that the Bank of Canada would announce another surprise cut to interest rates at the same time as the government\u2019s aid package.

A rapid rise in coronavirus cases globally, the sharp fall in oil prices and volatility in financial markets make a contraction in the second and third quarters this year \u201clikely\u201d in the absence of fiscal measures, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Perrault, chief economist at Scotiabank, said Wednesday.\u201cA reasonably mild recession appears likely unless timely and targeted fiscal measures are deployed in the very near future to deal with the economic impacts of the virus,\u201d Perrault wrote in a research note.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released $1.1 billion in new funding earlier Wednesday in response to the virus, and said the government is ready to do more if necessary. Trudeau also said his government is prepared to use federal financing agencies to further stimulate the economy if needed, a measure that was deployed during the 2008-09 financial crisis.But that may not be enough. Canada\u2019s measures pale in comparison to those set out by countries such as Italy, which plans to spend as much as 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion) on stimulus measures. Perrault recommends the government roll out a fiscal package equivalent to one per cent of GDP, or just over $20 billion, in order to prevent the Canadian economy from going into recession.The Toronto-based bank sees the country\u2019s gross domestic product growth slowing to 0.3 per cent for the year in the absence of significant stimulus. Scotiabank\u2019s isn\u2019t the first bearish call to emerge this week in the aftermath of the oil price collapse but it does represent the most aggressive take yet on Canada\u2019s future.National Bank of Canada Financial and Royal Bank of Canada will release their forecasts later this week. Bank of Montreal was the first of the six banks to revise their forecasts lower this week, with a call for full year GDP growth at 0.5 per cent.The latest stream of downward revisions include predictions that the Bank of Canada will cut rates to 0.25 per cent by June from its current 1.25 per cent. That\u2019s in line with financial market expectations, according to overnight index swaps trading. The last time the Bank of Canada policy rate reached 0.25 per cent was in 2009. Earlier this month, the central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points amid escalating coronavirus concerns, matching an emergency move by the Federal Reserve.Here are the latest revisions from bank economists this week:Scotiabank \u2014 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois PerraultSees Canada\u2019s 2020 GDP at 0.3 per cent in absence of substantial fiscal stimulus and 0.7 per cent if there is fiscal stimulus worth one per cent of GDP.

Monday\u2019s plunge in oil prices is sending them back to the drawing board to consider a much more dire situation. The country\u2019s five largest banks will release updated forecasts in the next few days that will show a significantly weaker growth picture.\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth,\u201d Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a phone interview. Besides the shock from lower oil prices, the financial market pressures and confidence impacts from coronavirus are \u201cquite a lot to bear\u201d if sustained, Caranci added.The oil crisis could be the last straw for the Canadian economy which was already on soft footing at the end of 2019, after a drop in exports and business investment resulted in the slowest quarterly pace of growth in three years. Now the oil shock has created more downside risk.Some economists are even flirting with the idea of a recession.It's very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth\u201cGiven market developments in the last couple of days, the likelihood of a recession has increased dramatically,\u201d Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said by phone.As recently as last month, the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for growth of 1.6 per cent in 2020 \u2014 in line with what the federal government has been projecting in its fiscal outlook. That forecast was slashed last week to about 1 per cent on the back of the fallout from the coronavirus. The impact of this week\u2019s oil shock is set to drive it even lower.Stocks dropped as much as 10 per cent early Monday in Toronto, the loonie weakened and government bond yields plunged as investor pessimism deepened. Canada exported just over $80 billion (US$59 billion) in crude oil and bitumen in 2018, when benchmark oil prices averaged US$57 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude for April slumped as much as 34 per cent to US$27.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before paring losses to 19 per cent.The Bank of Canada lowered interest rates last week in an attempt to stimulate growth. The outcome for the economy in 2020 may hinge on what the federal government does to bolster consumer and business confidence.Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week the government has the tools to shield the economy from the coronavirus crisis, though he stopped short of spelling out specific steps. With the federal budget expected within weeks, Morneau said the government plans to increase the amount it sets aside for emergencies.To be sure, Canada\u2019s oil sector isn\u2019t as large as it used to be, so the impact of lower prices may not be as dramatic. And the industry already underwent a significant adjustment after the rout in crude markets in 2014-15.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a negative, that\u2019s undeniable, but the footprint of the oil and gas sector is not what it was back then,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, a macro-strategist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto.Still, the combination of headwinds could weaken growth to the point where the pain shows up in the labour market. Given Canada\u2019s elevated levels of household debt, that poses broader risks for the country\u2019s financial system.According to the finance department\u2019s own sensitivity analysis, a one-year, 1 percentage point decline in real GDP would have an annual $5-billion (US$3.69-billion) hit on the government\u2019s bottom line. That would be on top of the near $30-billion deficit already forecast this year from the federal government, even before any new spending measures Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during last fall\u2019s election campaign.Markets are already anticipating the Bank of Canada will lower interest rates to levels not seen since the 2008-09 recession. Swaps trading suggests the central bank will lower its policy rate to 0.5 per cent over the next six months, from 1.25 per cent currently.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Vildana Hajric and Claire Ballentine", "title": "Stocks plunge after CDC warns Americans to prepare for coronavirus outbreak in U.S.", "description": "Dow down 880 points as virus spreads further around the world and officials describe it as 'a rapidly escalating epidemic'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/stock-drop-accelerates-after-cdc-warns-americans-to-prepare-for-coronavirus-outbreak?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/coronavirus-markets.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 25, 2020 4:17 PM EST", "content": "U.S. stocks tumbled to an almost 12-week low and bond yields plunged to records on rising concern the coronavirus will upend global supply chains critical to economic growth.The S&P 500\u2019s four-day rout reached almost 7.6 per cent, with losses accelerating Tuesday after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans to prepare for a coronavirus outbreak at home.
