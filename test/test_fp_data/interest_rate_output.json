Per-capita output will contract in more than 90 per cent of countries, the biggest share since 1870.

Emerging and developing economies will shrink 2.5 per cent, their worst performance in data that starts in 1960, it said. Those with limited health-care capacity, deeply integrated global value chains, heavy dependence on foreign financing and extensive reliance on international trade, commodity exports and tourism are likely to be the hardest hit.While the World Bank sees China\u2019s economy eking out 1 per cent growth this year, the lowest rate since 1976, it forecasts India\u2019s will shrink 3.2 per cent. U.S. GDP may contract 6.1 per cent.The World Bank presents two alternative scenarios. In one, where the COVID-19 outbreak persists for longer than expected, requiring the continuation or reintroduction of restrictions on movement, the global economy would shrink almost 8 per cent this year. If control measures can be largely lifted in the near term, the contraction would be 4 per cent \u2014 still more than twice as deep as the global financial crisis of 2009.\u201cThe global recession would be deeper if bringing the pandemic under control took longer than expected, or if financial stress triggered cascading defaults,\u201d the World Bank said.The International Monetary Fund will update its World Economic Outlook on June 24. In April, the fund forecast a 3 per cent contraction for this year, though chief economist Gita Gopinath has since said that the outlook has worsened. The methodologies are different because IMF aggregate forecasts are based on purchasing-power parity, which gives more weight to developing economies, while the World Bank uses market exchange rates.Most central banks have cut interest rates to about or below zero to buffer the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve starting an unprecedented range of emergency programs providing as much as US$2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal-stimulus packages have varied.

Hydrogen fuel cell company Ballard Power Systems Inc. is second with a 75 per cent gain.These tech stars may not have a catchy acronym like FAANG in the U.S., BAT in Asia or even WAAAX in Australia but investors have flocked to these names due to their stronger growth outlook compared with other sectors during the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cThere\u2019s a view that the pandemic should actually help accelerate tech adoption in a bunch of different areas because ultimately technology is one of the only ways to mitigate some of the impact of the pandemic,\u201d Thanos Moschopoulos, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said by phone.Kinaxis has become \u201cespecially topical\u201d given its supply chain management software can help companies track global shipments amid the havoc caused by COVID-19, and to help mitigate the challenges, Moschopoulos said.Last month, the Ottawa-based company reported a 15 per cent increase in revenue and maintained its 2020 guidance, which included a sales forecast that\u2019s about 10 per cent to 12 per cent higher than 2019.With the bulk of its revenues coming from the U.S. mortgage industry, low interest rates are keeping things busy for Real Matters. The Markham, Ontario-based provider of network services for the mortgage and insurance industries has seen increased refinancing volumes as central banks cut rates to pump financial markets with liquidity during the global recession.Sky-high valuations suggest things may be moving too fast, too soon. The price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P/TSX Info Tech Index is about double the five-year average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u201cThere\u2019s an argument to be made that because interest rates are where they are, at record low levels, that dynamic justifies higher valuations. Tech on a relative basis is looking better than a lot of other sectors,\u201d Moschopoulos said.Still, recent price action in North American stock markets suggest investors are shifting away from tech and into more cyclical sectors as confidence in the recovery builds. Unexpectedly strong jobs data from Canada and the U.S. on Friday amplified this theme.At about 9 per cent of the Canadian benchmark, the tech sector\u2019s impact is still small compared to the nation\u2019s banks, miners and energy companies.So while their shares have surged this year, helping offset some of the losses on the S&P/TSX Composite, the benchmark remains in the red for the year \u2014 for now.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jack Farchy", "title": "HSBC Reveals It Was Caught Out as Lockdowns Snarled Gold Market", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 HSBC Holdings Plc, one of the largest players in the gold market, was caught out in March as lockdowns disrupted physical shipments of bullion and caused prices to ...", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/hsbc-reveals-it-was-caught-out-as-lockdowns-snarled-gold-market", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 6, 2020 1:17 PM EDT", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 HSBC Holdings Plc, one of the largest players in the gold market, was caught out in March as lockdowns disrupted physical shipments of bullion and caused prices to diverge dramatically in key trading hubs.In a filing, the bank cited \u201cdelivery disruptions in the gold market\u201d as one reason why it breached its value-at-risk limits 12 times in March \u2014 something it would normally expect to occur only two or three times a year.The price of gold futures in New York and spot gold in London diverged by the most in four decades at the end of March, after refinery closures and grounded planes strangled the supply routes that allow physical gold to move around the globe.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep rates near zero for three or more years.Policy makers last month slashed their benchmark rate and launched a massive bond-buying campaign to stabilize markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities that had become dangerously unsettled amid the pandemic. The federal funds rate has stood in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent since mid-March.The central bank\u2019s Board of Governors has also responded to the crisis by announcing nine extraordinary lending programs, pledging to make funds available to banks, money market funds, companies, cities and states in an unprecedented use of the Fed\u2019s emergency powers.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "America\u2019s longest economic expansion is over \u2014 and the deepest recession in at least eight decades has begun", "description": "GPD falls 4.8%, consumer spending down most since 1980, business investment plummets to 11-year low", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-economy-shrinks-at-4-8-pace-signaling-start-of-recession", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/recession.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 29, 2020 9:25 AM EDT", "content": "The record-long U.S. economic expansion is over after almost 11 years, with the deepest recession in at least eight decades now under way. The world\u2019s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.That will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Despite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus\u2019s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn\u2019t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what\u2019s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP \u2014 the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 \u2014 compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Consumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn\u2019t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Bank of Canada set for bigger buying spree \u2014 here\u2019s where the billions might go", "description": "Next up may be provincial debt which is showing signs of credit strain", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-set-for-bigger-buying-spree-decision-day-guide", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/stephen-poloz-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2020 6:00 AM EDT", "content": "As Stephen Poloz goes into his penultimate policy meeting as Bank of Canada governor on Wednesday, economists are trying to gauge how much of a buying mood he\u2019s in.With the country suffering one of its sharpest downturns since the Great Depression, Poloz is widely expected to dig deeper into his unconventional toolkit, whether that\u2019s at the April 15 meeting or later. The central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero and injected $150 billion into financial markets with a program of asset purchases.Additional measures could include following the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s recent move into yield curve control, introducing more explicit forward guidance on future policy intentions, or broadening asset purchases to include long-term provincial securities and corporate debt.One thing he\u2019s not expected to do is lower the Bank of Canada\u2019s policy rate below the current setting of 0.25 per cent, which Poloz has said is the effective lower bound.The Bank of Canada embarked on its first ever large scale asset purchase program last month. The move to buy at least $5 billion of Canadian government bonds each week, on top of almost $100 billion of securities purchased under resale agreements, will help sop up the massive amount of debt the federal government is expected to issue in coming months to finance its stimulus package.That program could easily be expanded to include other asset classes, with longer-dated provincial bonds the most likely option, according to Derek Holt at Scotiabank. That\u2019s one corner of the credit markets still experiencing strained credit conditions, at a time when provincial governments are looking to finance growing deficits.By targeting provincial debt, \u201cyou\u2019d be saying \u2018look, we\u2019ve got your back,\u2019\u201d Holt said in a phone interview, adding that would likely have beneficial effects on borrowing costs for municipalities, agencies and large corporations. Though one difficulty is political: how much of each province\u2019s debt to buy?The central bank could also increase weekly purchases to more than $5 billion, or buy more non-government debt such as mortgage bonds or corporate securities.Right now, the bank is acquiring assets primarily to restore proper functioning of financial markets, which is why much of the buying has been at the shorter end. But as markets return to more normal conditions, it will eventually need to shift its focus to stimulating the economy. To do that, officials will need to target longer-term borrowing costs where most of the funding for households and businesses takes place, a practice known as quantitative easing.There are doubts whether QE can be effective in smaller countries like Canada whose long-term bond yields are dictated by monetary policy in other countries. But the practice can be much more effective if the asset buying is concentrated around specific maturities, what economists call yield curve control.Focusing on the five-year part of the curve would be the most compelling move, according to Ian Pollick at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cTo do this, they would likely target a \u2018zone\u2019 for yields in a part of the curve that matter most for businesses and households, which in our view is the 5-year tenor of the curve,\u201d Pollick, global head of non-equity market research, said in a report.Australia\u2019s central bank adopted a similar policy last month, when it announced a target for 3-year government bonds of around 0.25 per cent.The central bank may also commit to specific monetary policy intentions for a certain period, a tool known as forward guidance. Promising to keep rates low for a long time reduces the risk of a spike in funding costs, allowing banks to offer lower rates to households and businesses than they otherwise might.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz provided a sliver of guidance when he promised last month to continue buying assets until the \u201ceconomic recovery is well underway.\u201d More clarity around that promise could help cement expectations that interest rates will remain low for much longer.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Eric Martin", "title": "\u2018Crisis like no other\u2019: IMF warns \u2018Great Lockdown\u2019 recession will be worst in almost 100 years", "description": "In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/imf-says-great-lockdown-recession-likely-worst-since-depression?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/closed-5.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 14, 2020 12:52 PM EDT", "content": "The International Monetary Fund predicted the \u201cGreat Lockdown\u201d recession would be the steepest in almost a century and warned the world economy\u2019s contraction and recovery would be worse than anticipated if the coronavirus lingers or returns.In its first World Economic Outlook report since the spread of the coronavirus and subsequent freezing of major economies, the IMF estimated on Tuesday that global gross domestic product will shrink 3 per cent this year.That compares to a January projection of 3.3 per cent expansion and would likely mark the deepest dive since the Great Depression. It would also dwarf the 0.1 per cent contraction of 2009 amid the financial crisis.Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shockWhile the fund anticipated growth of 5.8 per cent next year, which would be the strongest in records dating back to 1980, it cautioned risks lay to the downside. Much depends on the longevity of the pandemic, its effect on activity and related stresses in financial and commodity markets, it said.Even if the IMF\u2019s forecast proves accurate, it said output in both advanced and emerging markets would undershoot their pre-virus trends through 2021, seemingly dashing any lingering hopes of a V-shaped economic rebound from the health emergency.In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both. A lengthier pandemic would wipe 3 per cent off GDP this year compared to the baseline, while protraction plus a resumption next year would mean 8 per cent less output than projected in 2021, it said.\u201cThis crisis is like no other,\u201d Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a foreword to its semi-annual report. \u201cLike in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.\u201dAs with the virus\u2019s reach, the economic hit is sweeping. In the U.S., gross domestic product is expected to contract 5.9 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent expansion in its last global outlook in January. It may grow 4.7 per cent next year, the IMF said. The euro area will probably shrink 7.5 per cent in 2020 and expand 4.7 per cent in 2021, it said.\u201cMany countries face a multi-layered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital-flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cRisks of a worse outcome predominate.\u201dThe grim projections are a stark reversal from the IMF\u2019s outlook less than two months ago. On Feb. 19, the fund told Group of 20 finance chiefs that \u201cglobal growth appears to be bottoming out.\u201d Three days later, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicted the virus would likely cut just 0.1 percentage point from the fund\u2019s global growth forecast for this year, although she acknowledged \u201cmore dire scenarios\u201d were being studied.The fund sees advanced economies shrinking the most, contracting 6.1 per cent. Emerging-market and developing economies will see a 1 per cent drop. Growth in China and India will decelerate but their economies will still manage to expand 1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, the fund said.The IMF\u2019s baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of this year and that containment measures can be gradually wound down.Global trade volume in goods and services will probably tumble 11 per cent this year, the fund said.Growth in consumer prices in advanced economies may average 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 1.5 per cent in 2021, it said. The jobless rate in the U.S., which was at a half-century low before the pandemic, may swell to 10.4 per cent in 2020, the IMF said.Most central banks around the world have cut interest rates to around or below zero to blunt the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal stimulus packages have varied more. The U.S. is providing about 10 per cent of gross domestic product in support and Germany about 4.5 per cent, while Japan\u2019s program is worth about 20 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.The IMF said that fiscal measures will need to increase if stoppages to economic activity persist, or if the pickup in activity once restrictions are lifted is too weak.

That prompted the bank\u2019s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned earlier this month that the bank wouldn\u2019t be immune to fallout from the pandemic, predicting in his annual letter to shareholders that the economy would suffer a \u201cbad recession\u201d and financial stress mirroring the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cGiven the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves,\u201d Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe first quarter delivered some unprecedented challenges and required us to focus on what we as a bank could do \u2013 outside of our ordinary course of business \u2013 to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support all of our stakeholders.\u201dSome of the damage was offset by gains in the bank\u2019s trading operation, which benefited from record volatility during the quarter as investors moved in and out of positions in response to the unfolding crisis. JPMorgan generated US$7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trading gains came off a wild three months for the markets, with stocks reaching record highs in January only to suffer the biggest decline since the 1987 crash as the extent of the pandemic started to become clear.JPMorgan shares rose 1.1 per cent in early trading at 6:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has fallen 30 per cent this year through Monday.The bank on Tuesday lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income \u2014 revenue from customers\u2019 loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors \u2014 by US$1.5 billion to US$55.5 billion. The revenue source accounted for about half the company\u2019s total last year, and in the past has helped counter more volatile results in the trading and investment-banking divisions.The Federal Reserve had two emergency rate cuts, bringing the central bank\u2019s benchmark to virtually zero. The emergency action came as more evidence emerged that the U.S. economy was being hit hard by the virus and the global economic shutdown.For its part, JPMorgan has been waiving fees for some loans, allowing customers to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans, and removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards. It\u2019s planning to lend an additional US$150 billion to clients across the world.KBW analysts led by Brian Kleinhanzl said in an April 8 report they expect provisions to peak in the second quarter as banks build reserves in advance of expected charge-offs under the newly adopted CECL accounting rules.Investors and analysts are taking comfort in the fact that banks are entering the uncertain period with higher capital levels than they had during the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid \u2013 with a CET1 ratio of 11.5 per cent and total liquidity resources of over US$1 trillion,\u201d Dimon said in the statement.While the results offer a look at the impact of the virus, the picture is somewhat muddled because they include January and February, before government lockdown measures began in earnest. Analysts are expecting future quarters to show even more damage to consumer businesses, as near-zero interest rates and rising unemployment take a toll.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reed Stevenson", "title": "Michael Burry of 'The Big Short'\u00a0slams coronavirus lockdowns in tweetstorm", "description": "Burry says lockdowns intended to contain the pandemic are worse than the disease itself", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-slams-virus-lockdowns-in-tweetstorm", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/michael-burry.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 7, 2020 2:43 PM EDT", "content": "Michael Burry, the doctor-turned-investor who famously bet against mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, has taken to Twitter with a controversial message: lockdowns intended to contain the coronavirus pandemic are worse than the disease itself.Government-directed shutdowns in the U.S., which led to millions of job losses and may trigger one of the country\u2019s\u00a0 deepest-ever economic contractions, aren\u2019t necessary to contain the epidemic and have disproportionately hurt low-income families and minorities, Burry argued in a series of tweets over the past two weeks. He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to\u00a0become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame\u00a0after his hedge fund\u2019s\u00a0bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d\u00a0an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis.Although Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled \u201cbubble\u201d in passive investment products. He\u2019s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.\u201cUniversal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,\u201d Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.\u201dBurry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community,\u00a0began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle\u00a0as the \u201creal personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.\u201d He said he began speaking out\u00a0because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. \u201cUnconscionable,\u201d is how he described job losses in the U.S.,\u00a0which have caused a once-unthinkable\u00a010 million people to apply for unemployment benefits\u00a0in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN\u00a0Bloomberg.Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He\u2019s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a \u201csignificant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201d without providing details except to say it was a trade of a \u201cgood size\u201d against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201d\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201d\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201d\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201d\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "'This is freezing the market': Once roaring, Canadian home sales brace for 30% drop from coronavirus", "description": "Real estate listings are drying up, open houses have been cancelled, and buyers are staying home", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadian-home-sales-30-percent-drop-coronavirus?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/for-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 2, 2020 12:23 PM EDT", "content": "Real estate listings are drying up, open houses have been cancelled, and buyers are staying home. One more pillar of the Canadian economy is under threat from the coronavirus pandemic.What was a roaring start to the spring house-hunting season has ended in a whimper. By the time the dust settles on what\u2019s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.\u201cThis is freezing the market,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really expecting anything before that.\u201dReal estate, along with residential building construction, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Canada\u2019s output last year, ahead of energy at about 9 per cent. It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it\u2019s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it\u2019s all but shut down in Quebec.It\u2019s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven\u2019t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.\u201dRobert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a \u201ctough but temporary blow\u201d to Canada\u2019s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodHow quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.\u201cThe longer this goes, the more it\u2019s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. \u201cSo it\u2019ll affect qualifications.\u201dThe uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,\u201d Collu said in a phone interview. \u201cPurchase activity is going to be curtailed.\u201dStill, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.\u201cWe see the outlook improving markedly next year,\u201d RBC\u2019s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. \u201cExceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.\u201dPapailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and \u201cyou can go outside without getting your children or parents sick \u2014 I think the market is going to go bananas.\u201dElton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there\u2019s a broader recession \u2014 and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.\u201cThere\u2019s the big unknown \u2014 the elephant south of the border,\u201d said Ash.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Mortgage rates are rising in Canada even as central bank cuts", "description": "Canada\u2019s mortgage rates are creeping up \u2014 even though the country\u2019s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/mortgage-rates-rising-canada", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "March 30, 2020 4:01 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s mortgage rates are creeping up \u2014 even though the country\u2019s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.That\u2019s due to the \u201cenormous pressure\u201d Canadian banks face amid disruptions caused by the outbreak, said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centers.\u201cThe costs of funds for banks is skyrocketing and bank earnings are plunging,\u201d Cooper said Monday in a phone interview. \u201cEvery single business they have ever loaned to is subject to a massive decline in revenues, and therefore their own revenues are going down because nobody is taking out new business with banks except to extend debt.\u201dThe Bank of Canada has cut its overnight interest rate three times this month, bringing the benchmark to 0.25 per cent. The large Canadian banks matched those moves by cutting their prime rates, which influence borrowing rates for variable mortgages and credit lines, to 2.45 per cent from 3.95 per cent at the start of the month.As those rates have dropped, banks have been eliminating discounts off prime on variable mortgages. At the start of the month, qualified borrowers could get a rate of prime minus 1 per cent from HSBC Canada, for example, while Canada\u2019s large domestic lenders were also offering \u201cprime minus\u201d deals as well.But those discounts have shrunk by 75 to 85 basis points, said Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com.Typical five-year fixed rates at also rising. Rates at large Canadian bank are now at 2.99 per cent to 3.04 per cent versus around 2.49 per cent to 2.59 per cent at the end of February, McLister said.\u201cThe big banks are leading the charge higher here, on both the fixed side and the variable side,\u201d he said. Preferred borrowers can still get some prime minus deals at big banks, but they\u2019re more like prime minus 10 or 15 basis points.McLister said the rising cost of short-term funding, used for variable mortgages, explains the jump. Spreads are wide, fewer people want to lend big banks money at preferable pricing, so that gets passed through to the borrower, McLister said.Fixed-rate mortgages, which are tied more to swings in the bond market, are also creeping up after Canadian bond yields hit record lows earlier in the month, added Cooper.\u201cThe banks just can\u2019t afford to price their loans at what are de minimis bond yield levels,\u201d Cooper said.She expects banks to start charging prime plus a premium for variable loans, as well as higher rates for fixed mortgages than those seen earlier in the year.\u201cI believe mortgage rates will trend around current levels,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI don\u2019t think interest rates in general are going to be a lot higher in the next year.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Bank of Canada cuts rate for third time to 0.25% in bid to shield economy from coronavirus fallout", "description": "The last time the rate was this low was the global financial crisis", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/breaking-bank-of-canada-cuts-rate-emergency-move?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/boc-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 27, 2020 11:15 AM EDT", "content": "The Bank of Canada slashed interest rates for a third time in a matter of weeks and announced plans to acquire more commercial paper and government securities to help shield the nation\u2019s economy from coronavirus fallout.The central bank lowered its policy rate Friday by another half a percentage point to 0.25 per cent, adding in a statement that the unscheduled rate decision brings the rate down to its effective lower bound. The Bank of Canada last cut rates to these levels in 2009, during the global financial crisis.The move was necessitated by quickly deteriorating conditions, including a flood of new jobless claims last week, that suggest the economy is poised to produce one of the sharpest drops in economic activity in history.Policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz announced two new programs: the Commercial Paper Purchase Program and the buying of Canadian government securities in the secondary market.

The Bank of Canada is likely to follow with its first foray into so-called quantitative easing soon, according to market watchers at Canada\u2019s largest banks.Although the central bank has already announced several programs aimed at unclogging credit markets, strategists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will need to introduce formal, large-scale asset purchases to keep borrowing costs low amid the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers.\u201cMore stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,\u201d Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They\u2019ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.Toronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program \u2014 between $50 billion and $75 billion \u2014 to be announced at the central bank\u2019s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.\u201cThe BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.The Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.\u201cThere is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy \u2014 but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,\u201d Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.\u201cWe can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,\u201d CIBC\u2019s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katherine Chiglinsky", "title": "Warren Buffett says negative interest rates puzzle him, but don't scare him", "description": "Buffett cautions he's not an expert in predicting interest rates", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/warren-buffett-says-negative-interest-rates-puzzle-him-but-dont-scare-him", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/warren-buffett-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 18, 2020 1:35 PM EDT", "content": "Warren Buffett said the prospect of negative interest rates is a bit confusing.\u201cThey puzzle me, but they don\u2019t scare me,\u201d Buffett said in a Yahoo Finance interview when asked if negative rates frighten him.U.S. policy makers have been seeking to grapple with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, with the Federal Reserve on Sunday cutting its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to near zero.

Liquidity has vanished in many global markets, a bond rout is now underway and the Canadian dollar has plunged below 70 U.S. cents.Strategists, ensconced in home offices, are in the dark about what will happen to corporate earnings as authorities around the world shut down economic activity to avert a humanitarian disaster.

The market was about 1 per cent away from that as of noon on Wednesday.\u201cThe 2016 low is a key support level and one we are watching right now. This is an important technical support level that we would expect to hold. Given valuation, the current market environment is very similar to 2014-16 not only within the energy sector but financials and other areas of the market.\u201d\u201cIn 2016 there were many great opportunities for investors based on valuation and dividend yields.

The return of Chinese shoppers to glitzy malls and boutiques will help boost demand for these types of companies, he said.Energy stocks now have smaller weighting on the Canadian benchmark than they did four years ago, Prince said. If the slide falls below the 2016 level, \u201cit\u2019ll mean that defaults are accelerating in this country.

In addition, it united with five other central banks to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell held a conference call with reporters to discuss the actions during which he reiterated the central bank\u2019s resistance to negative interest rates as some countries have used.

That\u2019s likely to hurt revenue for thousands of companies and put many jobs as risk, if not cause outright layoffs.With Sunday\u2019s announcement, the Fed is firing some of the biggest guns in its arsenal, but economists say without a similar, forceful response from the government, the country\u2019s record 11 year expansion could end in recession.

Central bankers and investors have pressed governments to do more to support their economies given monetary ammunition is running low and because fiscal policy can be targeted at corners of an economy that need it most.\u201cThe Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,\u201d it said.To support smooth functioning in the Treasury and mortgage backed securities market, the Fed said it would lift its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and of MBS by at least $200 billion.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester cast a lone dissent, preferring rates were instead cut to a 0.5 per cent-0.75 per cent range.The Fed\u2019s actions followed the Trump administration and Congress\u2019s first comprehensive steps Friday to assure the public that it has a coordinated public health and fiscal policy response \u2014 in what could serve as a one-two punch that shores up investor confidence and helps stem a weeks-long meltdown in markets.The dramatic Sunday evening moves follow aggressive action by the Fed on Thursday to ease strains in the Treasury debt market through massive injections of liquidity and broader purchases of U.S. securities in a measure reminiscent of the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis.U.S. stocks have plunged, along with Treasury yields on virus outbreak The Fed\u2019s action also comes less than two weeks after it slashed rates by a half percentage point in an emergency move that failed to reassure nervous investors, in part because it was not accompanied by steps from other policy makers.

A rapid rise in coronavirus cases globally, the sharp fall in oil prices and volatility in financial markets make a contraction in the second and third quarters this year \u201clikely\u201d in the absence of fiscal measures, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Perrault, chief economist at Scotiabank, said Wednesday.\u201cA reasonably mild recession appears likely unless timely and targeted fiscal measures are deployed in the very near future to deal with the economic impacts of the virus,\u201d Perrault wrote in a research note.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released $1.1 billion in new funding earlier Wednesday in response to the virus, and said the government is ready to do more if necessary. Trudeau also said his government is prepared to use federal financing agencies to further stimulate the economy if needed, a measure that was deployed during the 2008-09 financial crisis.But that may not be enough. Canada\u2019s measures pale in comparison to those set out by countries such as Italy, which plans to spend as much as 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion) on stimulus measures. Perrault recommends the government roll out a fiscal package equivalent to one per cent of GDP, or just over $20 billion, in order to prevent the Canadian economy from going into recession.The Toronto-based bank sees the country\u2019s gross domestic product growth slowing to 0.3 per cent for the year in the absence of significant stimulus. Scotiabank\u2019s isn\u2019t the first bearish call to emerge this week in the aftermath of the oil price collapse but it does represent the most aggressive take yet on Canada\u2019s future.National Bank of Canada Financial and Royal Bank of Canada will release their forecasts later this week. Bank of Montreal was the first of the six banks to revise their forecasts lower this week, with a call for full year GDP growth at 0.5 per cent.The latest stream of downward revisions include predictions that the Bank of Canada will cut rates to 0.25 per cent by June from its current 1.25 per cent. That\u2019s in line with financial market expectations, according to overnight index swaps trading. The last time the Bank of Canada policy rate reached 0.25 per cent was in 2009. Earlier this month, the central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points amid escalating coronavirus concerns, matching an emergency move by the Federal Reserve.Here are the latest revisions from bank economists this week:Scotiabank \u2014 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois PerraultSees Canada\u2019s 2020 GDP at 0.3 per cent in absence of substantial fiscal stimulus and 0.7 per cent if there is fiscal stimulus worth one per cent of GDP.

The country\u2019s five largest banks will release updated forecasts in the next few days that will show a significantly weaker growth picture.\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth,\u201d Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a phone interview. Besides the shock from lower oil prices, the financial market pressures and confidence impacts from coronavirus are \u201cquite a lot to bear\u201d if sustained, Caranci added.The oil crisis could be the last straw for the Canadian economy which was already on soft footing at the end of 2019, after a drop in exports and business investment resulted in the slowest quarterly pace of growth in three years. Now the oil shock has created more downside risk.Some economists are even flirting with the idea of a recession.It's very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth\u201cGiven market developments in the last couple of days, the likelihood of a recession has increased dramatically,\u201d Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said by phone.As recently as last month, the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for growth of 1.6 per cent in 2020 \u2014 in line with what the federal government has been projecting in its fiscal outlook. That forecast was slashed last week to about 1 per cent on the back of the fallout from the coronavirus. The impact of this week\u2019s oil shock is set to drive it even lower.Stocks dropped as much as 10 per cent early Monday in Toronto, the loonie weakened and government bond yields plunged as investor pessimism deepened. Canada exported just over $80 billion (US$59 billion) in crude oil and bitumen in 2018, when benchmark oil prices averaged US$57 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude for April slumped as much as 34 per cent to US$27.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before paring losses to 19 per cent.The Bank of Canada lowered interest rates last week in an attempt to stimulate growth. The outcome for the economy in 2020 may hinge on what the federal government does to bolster consumer and business confidence.Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week the government has the tools to shield the economy from the coronavirus crisis, though he stopped short of spelling out specific steps. With the federal budget expected within weeks, Morneau said the government plans to increase the amount it sets aside for emergencies.To be sure, Canada\u2019s oil sector isn\u2019t as large as it used to be, so the impact of lower prices may not be as dramatic. And the industry already underwent a significant adjustment after the rout in crude markets in 2014-15.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a negative, that\u2019s undeniable, but the footprint of the oil and gas sector is not what it was back then,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, a macro-strategist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto.Still, the combination of headwinds could weaken growth to the point where the pain shows up in the labour market. Given Canada\u2019s elevated levels of household debt, that poses broader risks for the country\u2019s financial system.According to the finance department\u2019s own sensitivity analysis, a one-year, 1 percentage point decline in real GDP would have an annual $5-billion (US$3.69-billion) hit on the government\u2019s bottom line. That would be on top of the near $30-billion deficit already forecast this year from the federal government, even before any new spending measures Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during last fall\u2019s election campaign.Markets are already anticipating the Bank of Canada will lower interest rates to levels not seen since the 2008-09 recession. Swaps trading suggests the central bank will lower its policy rate to 0.5 per cent over the next six months, from 1.25 per cent currently.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Stephen Spratt, Ruth Carson and Dana El Baltaji", "title": "'The market is panicking': Fed seen cutting rates to 0% within months, fuelling a global bond frenzy", "description": "The entire U.S. yield curve fell below 1 per cent for the first time in history as investors reached for longer-dated securities", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/frantic-treasury-rally-sees-yield-curve-inside-1-for-first-time?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jerome-powell-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 9, 2020 10:45 AM EDT", "content": "The entire U.S. yield curve fell below 1 per cent for the first time in history as rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut policy rates to zero in the coming months drove investors to reach for longer-dated securities.Traders are pricing in about 80 basis points of cuts in March, and 100 basis points by July, which would drag borrowing costs down to zero.

Commodity-linked currencies weakened, with Norway\u2019s krone and Canada\u2019s dollar falling at least 1.9 per cent against the U.S. dollar. Italian bonds plunged, sending the yield on 10-year debt to 1.3 per cent.Meanwhile, the yen and the euro strengthened. And the dollar, which suffered its worst week in two years, was up 0.2 per cent, as soaring demand for U.S. Treasuries canceled out concerns that more Fed cuts would hurt the greenback\u2019s appeal. The dollar has an edge over its peers by being the world\u2019s reserve currency of choice.Treasuries, the world\u2019s deepest pool of haven assets, have been rallying in the past few weeks as the virus wreaked havoc across the globe. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell surprised markets last week with an emergency rate cut of 50 basis points, raising the specter that the virus fallout will be longer and worse than anticipated.The yield on 10-year bonds dropped as much as 45 basis points to 0.31 per cent, before settling at 0.4 per cent as of 11:43 a.m. in London. Most of the German curve is now trading under negative 0.55 per cent, which, together with the euro\u2019s advance, may give the European Central Bank food for thought when it decides on interest rates this week.\u201cWe know what the financial crisis looked like, the tech wreck, but this bond rally we\u2019re seeing is just unchartered waters,\u201d said Stephen Miller, adviser at GSFM, a unit of Canada\u2019s CI Financial Group. \u201cA global recession is now a probability, not a possibility.\u201dFederal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said Friday that policy makers should be allowed to buy a broader range of assets if they lack sufficient ammunition to fight off a recession with interest-rate cuts and bond purchases.And money managers are expecting the Reserve Bank of Australia to turn to QE as soon as the middle of the year, while bets are increasing for the Bank of Japan to ease this month.\u201cThe market is panicking,\u201d said Shinji Hiramatsu, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. \u201cPosition adjustment, loss-cut buying and all sorts of buying are emerging.

Stocks dropped while the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1 per cent.Bank of America has predicted that the global economy will see its weakest year since the financial crisis as the virus damages demand in China and beyond. Futures markets predict more rate cuts, with the Bank of Canada likely to lower its benchmark rate on Wednesday morning.But Picton sees higher rates down the road. He acknowledges that there will be a \u201csignificant interruption\u201d to the global economy, but is convinced it will end quickly and there will be a V-shaped recovery later in the year.The headwinds of the recent past \u2014 a trade war, tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and a lack of significant Chinese stimulus \u2014 have shifted as policy makers react to the virus threat, he said. When the outbreak subsides, there will be pent-up demand globally for goods and services, he added.That is likely to be a powerful recipe for a move higher in most risk assets, including global equities, Picton said.\u201cThe coronavirus might have just delayed a powerful recovery phase that was beginning to develop,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I think there will be a stimulus response that builds an even greater tailwind.\u201dPicton Mahoney was one of the earlier entrants into the hedge fund market in Canada. One of the firm\u2019s oldest funds, a long-short equity fund, returned 8.25 per cent annualized since inception as of Jan. 31, outpacing the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index by more than two percentage points.Picton sees parallels between the current environment and the late 1990s. Back then, a period of turmoil \u2014 the Asian crisis and Russian default of 1997-98 \u2014 forced central banks to reverse course on a round of tightening.After the Fed cut in 1998, interest rates began rising again in 1999 as the global economy regained speed. Picton thinks the same thing will happen again.That means interest-rate sensitive investments will underperform as the recovery takes hold, said Picton, whose firm has about $7.5 billion (US$5.6-billion) in assets under management. The firm is shorting some rate-sensitive securities and buying derivatives that will pay off if rates go back up.And if its is indeed the late 1990s all over again, how else should investors play it?\u201cThe very simple answer is, take risk across all asset classes, understanding that you\u2019re probably in a giant poker game against everybody else who\u2019s doing the exact same thing,\u201d he said.For Picton, the sharp gains in government bonds is overdone and the correction in risk assets, especially in high-yield debt, is reflecting a near-term outlook of negative economic data.There is \u201cso much of a narrative that rates will not go up again that the bond market is somewhat missing on the plain signals that would have been picked up in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the bond market\u2019s going to get it right this time, like they did back in 2008 in the last recessionary phase.\u201dOne of his top picks is First Quantum Minerals Ltd., which has started the world\u2019s largest copper mine in the Panamanian jungle, in an environment where supply is probably less than demand growth, according to Picton.\u201cInventory\u2019s already low and more importantly there\u2019s no new projects that you can see on the horizon,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Todd White", "title": "Dow futures are pointing to 700 point leap at market open today after yesterday's plunge", "description": "Hopes of more central bank easing and moderate Joe Biden's surprise comeback bolsters mood", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/u-s-futures-gain-after-primaries-treasuries-flat-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trader-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 4, 2020 8:05 AM EST", "content": "American stock-index futures jumped with European equities on Wednesday as investors took in surprises from the U.S. Presidential primary and expectations of global policy responses to the coronavirus after the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency rate cut.

Fed funds futures are pricing more than a percentage point of central bank rate reductions for 2020, including another quarter-point cut in the first half of the year.The central bank said in its statement that it was \u201cclosely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\u201dPowell, in response to a reporter question about the scope for further moves, said \u201cwe do like our current policy stance,\u201d before repeating the Fed\u2019s reference to taking action if needed.The Fed\u2019s decision could presage a wave of easing from other central banks around the world although those in the euro-area and Japan have less scope to follow with rates already in negative territory. It came hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would \u201cuse all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.\u201dThe vote for the emergency cut to a range of 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent was unanimous. The Fed also said in the statement that the \u201cfundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.\u201dThe decision came amid public pressure for a cut by President Donald Trump, whose stewardship of the economy is central to his reelection campaign this year. Following today\u2019s shift he called for more, demanding in a tweet that the Fed \u201cmust further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA.\u201dThe Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!U.S. central bankers were scheduled to gather March 17-18 in Washington. Tuesday\u2019s decision was the first time it had cut by more than 25 basis points since 2008.The reduction marks a stark shift for Powell and his colleagues. They had previously projected no change in rates during 2020, remaining on the sidelines during the election year, after lowering their benchmark three times in 2019 to a range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent.As recently as last week, some officials, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, had indicated they thought it was too soon to respond to the virus. They pledged to monitor the situation, but argued monetary policy was already easy and the fundamentals of the economy strong with unemployment near a 50-year low.But as the number of reported cases of the virus rose around the world in recent days and the U.S. reported its first fatality, traders increasingly bet the Fed would step in. Powell seemed to cement that view with a promise on Friday to \u201cact as appropriate,\u201d which lent some support to stocks.Lower rates do little for factories lacking needed materials from abroad and are unlikely to spur consumers to shop if they\u2019re scared of infection. But they should support consumer and business sentiment as well as ease financial conditions by making debt payments easier to manage and by calming market volatility.Powell has staked his chairmanship on sustaining the expansion, words he has used to describe the essential mission of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\u2019s rate-setting panel. Despite the limited ability of monetary policy to ease the impact of a public health emergency, the rate cut could support consumer and business sentiment. Lawmakers are working on a $7.5 billion virus response bill, another reminder that critical fiscal policy can take weeks to move through Congress.One lesson Fed officials will take away from this moment is how rapidly their policy space is used up in a crisis.Total cuts of one percentage point this year, which several Wall Street firms are forecasting, would bring the bottom range of the Fed policy rate down to 0.5 per cent. If the virus impact is worse than expected, or if the economy is hit by a separate shock, the policy rate could strike zero.At that point, Fed officials are left with unconventional tools, such as purchases of longer-dated Treasuries \u2014 known as quantitative easing. The effectiveness of such tools when longer-term rates are already low remains to be seen.The Fed is in the midst of a review of its tool kit to achieve its goal of maximum employment and stable prices. They are considering policies such as outcome-based forward guidance, where a policy change would be linked to some tangible metric such as achieving an inflation rate, and yield curve caps.Wherever the discussion lands, the virus has highlighted the need for better fiscal and monetary policy coordination in a time of exceptionally low interest rates, says Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives.The Fed is \u201ccarrying the domestic burden and the global burden\u201d because they are one of the few central banks in developed economies that still has rates to some degree above zero, Coronado said. \u201cThe fiscal policy response has been lacking. There are people that are going to be struggling to pay their bills and certain workers are going to lose incomes. This is the shock that needs to be insured and we are really behind the curve.\u201dWith assistance from Sophie Caronello, Alexandra Harris and Alister BullBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram and Michael Bellusci", "title": "TSX snaps six-day losing streak as global stocks rally on central bank hopes", "description": "Boost comes from news that finance ministers and bankers to hold teleconference on coronavirus response Tuesday", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/rate-cut-hopes-fuel-tentative-rebound-in-canadian-stocks?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tsx.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 2, 2020 1:52 PM EST", "content": "Canadian stocks clawed their way into the green, snapping a six-day losing streak as expectations mounted central banks would cut interest rates to flight the growing impact of the coronavirus.The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose about 0.8 per cent to 16,382.02 at 11:21 a.m. in Toronto, buoyed by gains in telcos, utilities and real estate.

The Paris-based OECD now expects the weakest global growth this year since the 2009 recession, and said a \u2018long lasting\u2019 epidemic would risk a worldwide recession.The prospect of central banks\u2019 action helped halt the worst rout in stocks since that crisis. Money markets now see the Fed lowering its main rate by 50 basis points this month, and give a 70 per cent chance the European Central Bank will pare its by 10 basis points.Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted the Fed will ultimately slash by 100 basis points in the first half of the year. The BOE will cut by 50 basis points and the ECB by 10 basis points, it said.There is even speculation that the Fed will move before its policy makers gather on March 17-18, and some economists see the potential for international policy makers to coordinate cuts for the first time since 2008. Investors increasingly bet the central banks of Australia, Canada and Malaysia will ease at meetings already scheduled for this week.\u201cGlobal central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report on Sunday. \u201cWe suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.\u201dWith interest rates already low, governments may also need to do more to support demand. The French government said on Monday that Group of Seven finance ministers will hold a conference call this week to coordinate their response. Italy is already seeking to widen its budget deficit to pay for at least 3.6 billion euros (US$4 billion) in proposed emergency economic measures.Just a week ago, key central bankers were saying it was too soon to respond to the outbreak, a reticence to act that may also reflect their reluctance to be seen as racing to rescue investors. The plunge in global stocks is forcing a change in stance.\u201cCentral banks will almost certainly all induce one form of easing or another, \u201d said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.The Bank of Japan backed up Monday\u2019s promise to help markets by offering to buy 500 billion yen (US$4.6 billion) of government bonds to provide liquidity. Indonesia\u2019s central bank lowered the amount lenders need to keep on reserve to shore up liquidity in its markets.By not alluding to monetary policy as Powell did, Japan\u2019s statement revealed the constraints the BOJ and many other central banks are under. Japan\u2019s key rate is already minus 0.1 per cent compared to the Fed\u2019s 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent range.The ECB is also limited by a deposit rate that stands at minus 0.5 per cent. Prior to the outbreak, policy makers were signalling a reluctance to reduce it even further given concern that banks, who are already seeing profit margins squeezed by negative rates, might pull back on lending.President Christine Lagarde said last week that the ECB didn\u2019t yet think the outbreak will have a lasting impact on inflation, its primary mandate.An ECB spokesman declined to comment on whether a statement would be issued on Monday, and referred back to Lagarde\u2019s comments of last week.\u201cWe are vigilant, we are mobilized, but we remain calm and proportional in the responses we need,\u201d Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on BFM Business television on Monday.Even before the latest crisis, economists were questioning the benefits of ultra-loose monetary policies given more than 700 interest-rate cuts and several rounds of bond-buying since the financial crisis. They boosted asset prices, but failed to generate substantial rebounds in economic growth.Lower rates won't help manufacturers whose factories are closedFor central bankers, whose prior stimulus moves have already greatly depleted their ammunition, the new challenge is that easier policy may be even less effective to combat the economic pain posed by a health emergency. That\u2019s because by shutting workplaces in China and increasingly abroad, the virus is dealing a blow to the world\u2019s capacity to produce goods. Lower rates won\u2019t help manufacturers whose factories are closed or which lack materials to make their own products. On the demand-side, they would likely also fail to spur consumers to shop or travel if they\u2019re worried about infection. But easier monetary policies should counter tighter financial conditions, support markets and maintain the supply of credit, thus helping to drive a rebound in demand once the virus is under control. Weak inflation also gives most central banks scope to act.Fresh evidence of the economic shock triggered by the virus came Monday as IHS Markit reported its Chinese factory index dropped to the lowest since the series began in 2004. Gauges for Japan and South Korea also slumped.\u201cRate cuts are not the silver bullet, although they can support markets somewhat,\u201d said Jerome Jean Haegeli, chief economist at the Swiss Re Institute in Zurich.Governments will likely have to help too. Economists at Morgan Stanley predict the combined fiscal deficit of the four largest advanced economies plus China will now run to at least 4.7 per cent of global gross domestic product this year, the biggest since 2011.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Canadian investors gripped by fear amid coronavirus, economic chill from rail blockades", "description": "Canada's stock market rally has cracked.

Volatility has spiked. And investors have been piling into government bonds, pushing yields to record lows.Anxiety is everywhere for investors in the nation\u2019s markets as the coronavirus outbreak and protests that hobbled rail traffic are magnifying concerns about an economic slowdown.The S&P/TSX Composite Index lost this year\u2019s gain in just four days of trading and plunged even further Thursday \u2014 leaving it down about 2 per cent in 2020. It had climbed 5.2 per cent as of Feb. 20.A technical indicator that measures buying strength versus selling strength \u2014 known as the Bloomberg Fear and Greed indicator \u2014 slumped to the lowest level since the global market rout in the fourth quarter of 2018.The coronavirus continued to spread across the world as new clusters of cases have emerged in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Ontario\u2019s Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams confirmed Wednesday a new positive case of the virus in Toronto, taking the number of infections in Canada to more than 10.Meanwhile, environmental and Indigenous-rights activists have obstructed rail lines across Canada for weeks to protest the construction of TC Energy Corp.\u2019s $6.6 billion (US$4.9 billion) Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia. That has paralyzed parts of the nation\u2019s rail network in recent weeks, bringing grain movement to a near halt.Now, analysts are expecting profits to slow for the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Almost a quarter of companies that have reported earnings results since Jan. 17 have cited or answered questions related to the virus or rail blockades and its potential impact on profits, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Bank of Montreal, said in a report published Wednesday.Belski isn\u2019t so worried. \u201cWhile the coronavirus Covid-19 and rail blockades suggest a double hit to the Canadian supply chain, our work shows the overall impact is likely to be relatively minor.\u201d Supply disruptions will present near-term earnings risks, but profit growth will rebound down the road, he added.Market turbulence has surged. Volatility on the S&P/TSX soared to its highest in about six months. For the loonie, three-month implied volatility rose to the highest in almost five months as fears sparked demand to hedge the Canadian dollar\u2019s weakness.Traders are abandoning the Canadian dollar as the viral outbreak confounded global markets, clouding the outlook for the commodity-linked currency. It was among the worst performers of Group-of-10 peers Thursday, pushing it to levels unseen since June.The loonie may continue to fall. Simon Harvey, a London-based market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. and Monex Canada Inc., said that \u201ccurrency markets may be lining up for another serving of a Poloz special \u2014 talking the currency down in order to do the bank\u2019s bidding in the short-run, thus buffering the Canadian economy from slowing global growth headwinds.\u201dGoldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends going long on the Japanese yen against the Canadian dollar as currency markets enter a \u201clonger period of virus-related uncertainty,\u201d strategist Zach Pandl said in a note to clients Wednesday.His view is based on the expectation that risk aversion will remain high, \u201cdollar bloc\u201d currencies will underperform, and that the Bank of Canada could turn more dovish. Markets are pricing in at least two interest rate cuts from the central bank this year.In fixed income, plunging bond yields boosted gains on government debt while spreads in the corporate bond market increased to their widest since mid-December. That\u2019s another indicator of economic concern. Canada\u2019s 30-year government bond yield fell to a record low after breaching the Aug. 15 floor.\u201cCanadian government bonds offer two important benefits at the moment that are increasingly hard to find in the world today: a AAA credit rating and positive nominal yields,\u201d said Kurt Reiman, chief Canadian investment strategist at Blackrock Inc. \u201cDuring the latest setback for risk assets, Canadian fixed income has provided important portfolio ballast as interest rates decline \u2014 even with interest rates at incredibly low levels.\u201dAn aggregate index of Canadian bonds in U.S. dollars returned 1 per cent year to date, compared with a 3 per cent increase for a comparable U.S. benchmark, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. Yet investors snapped up a Canadian issue by Hydro One Ltd. when first sold earlier this week. The notes are trading below their initial pricing as global credit markets grind to a virtual standstill amid the coronavirus outbreak.For Mark Stacey, times like this should remind investors about the advantage of having a balanced portfolio.\u201cWhile stocks have sold off aggressively, government bonds and many liquid alternative strategies have done just the opposite in recent days,\u201d said Stacey, head of portfolio management at AGF Investments Inc. \u201cBy allocating to a range of low and/or negatively correlated asset classes, investors are better able to limit losses from a market correction, and should also be rewarded with reduced portfolio volatility, leaving them positioned to recover any of the losses they do incur more quickly.\u201dBloomberg.com"}]
