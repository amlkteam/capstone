As its oil sector shrivelled in recent years, Canada\u2019s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis. Nearly one in three workers have applied for income support.What\u2019s more, its households are among the world\u2019s most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm.\u201cI think it is the Great Reckoning,\u201d says Douglas Hoyes, a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener, Ontario. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a period for so long where it didn\u2019t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were. Well, guess what? Now it matters.\u201dSince the economy began shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus, policy makers have raced to buttress the property market. Banks are offering mortgage holidays, including to landlords with multiple loans on investment properties.That has raised eyebrows even within the real estate industry. \u201cShould someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance?\u201d asks Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor. \u201cWhere exactly do we draw the line?\u201dThe country may not have much of a choice but to prop up housing. Real estate has become Canada\u2019s largest sector. Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent.If it collapses, there\u2019s not much that can pick up the slack \u2014 certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer. Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven\u2019t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiralled higher, homeowners felt richer \u2014 they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher.That virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it\u2019s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can\u2019t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year.It\u2019s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city\u2019s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents.Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t use your house like an ATM\u201d \u2014 as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties.This virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predictedToday, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 \u2014 a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis.Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt \u2014 an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country\u2019s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust.\u201cYou have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,\u201d says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. \u201cAnd this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only 2 per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas.That\u2019s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren\u2019t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September.For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That\u2019s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections.Then there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that\u2019s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada\u2019s Airbnb hosts \u2014 who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 \u2014 need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Economists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.\u201cIt\u2019s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter\u2019s grandchildren aren\u2019t even going to be able to pay this off,\u201d says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan after?\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Mortgage rates are rising in Canada even as central bank cuts", "description": "Canada\u2019s mortgage rates are creeping up \u2014 even though the country\u2019s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/mortgage-rates-rising-canada", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "March 30, 2020 4:01 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s mortgage rates are creeping up \u2014 even though the country\u2019s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.That\u2019s due to the \u201cenormous pressure\u201d Canadian banks face amid disruptions caused by the outbreak, said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centers.\u201cThe costs of funds for banks is skyrocketing and bank earnings are plunging,\u201d Cooper said Monday in a phone interview. \u201cEvery single business they have ever loaned to is subject to a massive decline in revenues, and therefore their own revenues are going down because nobody is taking out new business with banks except to extend debt.\u201dThe Bank of Canada has cut its overnight interest rate three times this month, bringing the benchmark to 0.25 per cent. The large Canadian banks matched those moves by cutting their prime rates, which influence borrowing rates for variable mortgages and credit lines, to 2.45 per cent from 3.95 per cent at the start of the month.As those rates have dropped, banks have been eliminating discounts off prime on variable mortgages. At the start of the month, qualified borrowers could get a rate of prime minus 1 per cent from HSBC Canada, for example, while Canada\u2019s large domestic lenders were also offering \u201cprime minus\u201d deals as well.But those discounts have shrunk by 75 to 85 basis points, said Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com.Typical five-year fixed rates at also rising. Rates at large Canadian bank are now at 2.99 per cent to 3.04 per cent versus around 2.49 per cent to 2.59 per cent at the end of February, McLister said.\u201cThe big banks are leading the charge higher here, on both the fixed side and the variable side,\u201d he said. Preferred borrowers can still get some prime minus deals at big banks, but they\u2019re more like prime minus 10 or 15 basis points.McLister said the rising cost of short-term funding, used for variable mortgages, explains the jump. Spreads are wide, fewer people want to lend big banks money at preferable pricing, so that gets passed through to the borrower, McLister said.Fixed-rate mortgages, which are tied more to swings in the bond market, are also creeping up after Canadian bond yields hit record lows earlier in the month, added Cooper.\u201cThe banks just can\u2019t afford to price their loans at what are de minimis bond yield levels,\u201d Cooper said.She expects banks to start charging prime plus a premium for variable loans, as well as higher rates for fixed mortgages than those seen earlier in the year.\u201cI believe mortgage rates will trend around current levels,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI don\u2019t think interest rates in general are going to be a lot higher in the next year.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Toronto home sales, prices surge as buyers stampede back into the market", "description": "Benchmark price for home climbs to $846,100 and realtors see it hitting $900,000 this year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-home-prices-roar-back-from-lows-as-demand-surges", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/toronto-housing-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 4, 2020 7:11 AM EST", "content": "Toronto home prices surged in February, and sales jumped from a 10-year low, as buyers stampeded back into the market.The benchmark price climbed 10.2 per cent in February to $846,100, the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board said Wednesday.

Most segments posted almost double-digit price growth with condos rising about 12 per cent over the year, the board said.The number of transactions jumped 46 per cent from February 2019, which was a 10-year sales low as the market struggled with tougher mortgage rules and higher interest rates.
