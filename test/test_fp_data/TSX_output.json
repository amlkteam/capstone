Treasuries surged with the dollar.The S&P 500 sank almost 6 per cent \u2014 approaching the 7 per cent threshold that would trigger an exchange-mandated trading pause. Only one company in the gauge \u2014 supermarket operator Kroger Co. \u2014 finished higher. Losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were even deeper, with the blue-chip gauge dropping as much as 7.1 per cent. Airlines, cruise and travel shares that soared in recent weeks bore the brunt of the selling. The KBW Bank Index of financial heavyweights plunged 9%, and energy shares joined a rout in oil.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,861.82 points, or 6.9 per cent, to 25,128.17. The S&P 500 lost 188.04 points, or 5.89 per cent, to 3,002.1 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 527.62 points, or 5.27 per cent, to 9,492.73.The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 650.41, or 4.14 per cent, to 15,050.92.While much of the equity selling owed to the frantic pace of the recent rally, sentiment did sour as signs mounted that a possible second wave of the pandemic could be taking hold in some states. U.S. jobless claims remained high, underscoring the longer-term challenges caused by the pandemic. The report came out a day after the Federal Reserve provided a dour economic outlook. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn\u2019t shut down the economy again even if there is another surge in coronavirus cases.\u201cThe move from the bottom in terms of the rally has been so mind boggling. Over the new few weeks, we could see some pullback,\u201d said Solita Marcelli, deputy Americas chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cThat\u2019s mostly the fears of second wave concerns going higher, also we had the Fed yesterday. Their assessment of the economy was a little bit weaker than what the market expected.\u201dAs restrictions are lifted across the country, signs of a second wave of cases have been raising alarms. More than 2 million people in the U.S. have been infected so far. The localized surges have raised concerns among experts even as the nation\u2019s overall case count early this week rose just under 1%, the smallest increase since March.\u201cSentiment has become much more cautious,\u201d said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade. \u201cWe actually started to get data that indicated reopenings are going extremely well, and now we\u2019re starting to get some of the headlines that maybe the reopenings are going to at least pause.\u201dThese are some of the main moves in markets:With a file from Reuters Bloomberg.com"}]
