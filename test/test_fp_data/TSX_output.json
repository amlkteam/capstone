Amid geopolitical tensions, market volatility and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, Sun Life\u2019s top executives remain on the hunt for acquisitions.\u201cWe came into COVID-19 with a pipeline of conversations underway, and those conversations continue,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Dean Connor said in a video interview. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to be actively out there talking to people about what\u2019s possible.\u201dAcquisitions have been a common refrain for Sun Life executives in recent years, and the Toronto-based company has about $5.8 billion (US$4.3 billion) available for deals. While Connor is seeking more tie-ups across the firm\u2019s key pillars of Canada, the U.S., Asia and global asset management, he sees the pandemic stifling activity in the near term.\u201cNot a lot of transactions take place because sellers are trying to figure out where they stand and are trying to consolidate their positions and they don\u2019t want to sell at depressed values, and buyers are trying to figure out where they stand,\u201d Connor said in the interview Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a lot of transactions in the next six months.\u201dSun Life shares have slumped 13 per cent this year, compared with a 21 per cent decline for the S&P/TSX insurance industry index.The company is interested in deals in the seven Asian markets where it operates, including increasing stakes in joint ventures and striking partnerships with banks to distribute its insurance products, known as bancassurance. The firm would like to strike a bancassurance deal in Hong Kong along with other opportunities, even amid growing tensions with China that have some observers questioning the city\u2019s future as an Asian financial hub.\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing Hong Kong as being an area that\u2019s going to have problems in terms of a Canadian company that\u2019s been there for a long time, that understands the market and understands the people and already has a business in China,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Kevin Strain said in the interview. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s finding your way through all the noise, but there\u2019s lots of business opportunities.\u201dSun Life sees Hong Kong as offering long-term growth opportunities and a springboard for additional business with mainland China in the Pearl River Delta \u2014 which includes China\u2019s tech center of Shenzhen and the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou \u2014 through greater business access and an opening up of immigration across the economic region, said Strain, who previously spent five years overseeing the Asia business out of Hong Kong, where Sun Life has operated for 128 years.Closer to home, Connor\u2019s interests include expanding in group benefits in the U.S. and building up its Canadian retail wealth management, though he said there isn\u2019t much to buy currently in an industry dominated by Canada\u2019s large banks. He also reiterated interest in rounding out Sun Life\u2019s alternative asset manager, SLC Management, with a deal in below-investment-grade private credit.\u201cIf you look at pension funds and institutional investors, generally speaking, the last decade has been one of moving up the risk curve in an ever-lower-return world,\u201d Connor said. \u201cWe think there will be demand there, just because of the economics, and we think COVID is actually going to accelerate that demand.\u201dSLC Management deepened its real estate exposure with last year\u2019s combination of Bentall Kennedy and GreenOak, creating a global real estate investment management adviser and services provider with US$48 billion of assets under management. Connor sees opportunities for smaller deals to add to BentallGreenOak, which has a presence in 24 cities across a dozen countries.\u201cThere might be some things we want to tuck in and add to maybe extra geographical diversification there,\u201d he said. Sun Life has \u201cgreat exposure\u201d in industrial real estate, which Connor described as the \u201crock star of the real estate world right now,\u201d and its apartment holdings are \u201cperforming very strongly.\u201dCoronavirus quarantines worldwide are raising questions about post-pandemic demand for office space, with some companies finding that its employees are performing well from home.\u201cThere will be some ebb and flows, but long term we think it\u2019ll be a great asset category for long-term investors,\u201d Strain said. \u201cThere will be demand for work in the office. The productivity, in being in the same place and working as a team, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to permanently go away.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Bombardier, once a Canadian champion, risks expulsion from the TSX", "description": "The company's market cap peaked at $36.2 billion in the summer of 2000.

For Bombardier, that average price is now sitting at about 53cents for the three months leading up to June.A departure from the index could hurt demand for Bombardier\u2019s shares as exchange-traded funds drop the stock. Other managers must also decide whether to keep the shares. \u201cA portfolio manager must determine how closely they want to track the index and make a call on number of shares,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson.Bombardier is aware of the guidelines for index inclusion but it won\u2019t speculate on whether it will be removed in the upcoming review, Jessica McDonald, a company representative said.S&P Dow Jones Indices releases its quarterly review within the first 10 days of the rebalancing month, which would be June 12, spokesman Raymond McConville said.Bombardier\u2019s shares have continued their downward spiral despite a corporate revamp initiated by former chief executive officer Alain Bellemare. The stock has lost almost all of its value in 20 years.The Montreal-based company was once seen as a Canadian champion of the industrial sector and a source of pride for Quebec. It made everything from snowmobiles to commercial aircraft but is now a shadow of its former self after ceding its marquee jet program, now known as the A220, to Airbus SE and agreeing to sell its rail business to French train maker Alstom SA in the face of more than $10 billion in debt.The company\u2019s market capitalization peaked at $36.2 billion in the summer of 2000. Today it\u2019s $1.4 billion.Bellemare\u2019s restructuring means Bombardier has made an all-in bet on the corporate jet market. That left the company, now led by Eric Martel, particularly exposed as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered travel globally and slashed corporate spending. Still, it\u2019s possible that sales of private jets, which allow for physical distancing among passengers, may come back faster than commercial travel.The company\u2019s shares jumped as much as 28 per cent Tuesday after Bank of Nova Scotia upgraded its stock rating to the equivalent of a hold. Analyst Konark Gupta said in a report he sees \u201csome green shoots\u201d in the macro and industry indicators he monitors. Bombardier\u2019s share price, which was at $0.64 as of 10:40 a.m. in Toronto, is still far from the criteria to stay included on the S&P/TSX Composite.Last week, the company announced that it plans to eliminate 2,500 jobs at its aviation division following a slump in demand for business jets. In quarterly financial results released May 7, Bombardier said it\u2019s bracing for a drop of at least 30 per cent in sales of private jets as the crisis pummels demand this year.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Never mind Shopify: These are the other tech companies propping up Canada's stock market", "description": "Investors are flocking to these tech stars \u2014 and keeping the rebound going on the TSX", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/meet-the-other-tech-companies-propping-up-canadas-stock-market?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/kinaxis.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 7, 2020 10:01 AM EDT", "content": "Shopify Inc. may be hogging all the headlines but there are other tech companies keeping the rebound going on Canada\u2019s stock market this year.Shopify\u2019s near 90 per cent surge this year has put it in the No. 1 spot on the S&P/TSX Composite Index but Kinaxis Inc. and Real Matters Inc. are close behind, up 70 per cent and 67 per cent respectively \u2014 making them the third and fourth largest gainers. Hydrogen fuel cell company Ballard Power Systems Inc. is second with a 75 per cent gain.These tech stars may not have a catchy acronym like FAANG in the U.S., BAT in Asia or even WAAAX in Australia but investors have flocked to these names due to their stronger growth outlook compared with other sectors during the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cThere\u2019s a view that the pandemic should actually help accelerate tech adoption in a bunch of different areas because ultimately technology is one of the only ways to mitigate some of the impact of the pandemic,\u201d Thanos Moschopoulos, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said by phone.Kinaxis has become \u201cespecially topical\u201d given its supply chain management software can help companies track global shipments amid the havoc caused by COVID-19, and to help mitigate the challenges, Moschopoulos said.Last month, the Ottawa-based company reported a 15 per cent increase in revenue and maintained its 2020 guidance, which included a sales forecast that\u2019s about 10 per cent to 12 per cent higher than 2019.With the bulk of its revenues coming from the U.S. mortgage industry, low interest rates are keeping things busy for Real Matters. The Markham, Ontario-based provider of network services for the mortgage and insurance industries has seen increased refinancing volumes as central banks cut rates to pump financial markets with liquidity during the global recession.Sky-high valuations suggest things may be moving too fast, too soon. The price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P/TSX Info Tech Index is about double the five-year average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u201cThere\u2019s an argument to be made that because interest rates are where they are, at record low levels, that dynamic justifies higher valuations. Tech on a relative basis is looking better than a lot of other sectors,\u201d Moschopoulos said.Still, recent price action in North American stock markets suggest investors are shifting away from tech and into more cyclical sectors as confidence in the recovery builds. Unexpectedly strong jobs data from Canada and the U.S. on Friday amplified this theme.At about 9 per cent of the Canadian benchmark, the tech sector\u2019s impact is still small compared to the nation\u2019s banks, miners and energy companies.So while their shares have surged this year, helping offset some of the losses on the S&P/TSX Composite, the benchmark remains in the red for the year \u2014 for now.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Canada's Big Banks Set Aside $7.9 Billion for Soured Loans", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce set aside record amounts for soured loans in the fiscal second quarter, bringing total provisions for Canada\u2019s six-biggest banks to ...", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/td-sets-aside-more-for-soured-loans-in-canada-than-in-the-u-s", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 28, 2020 7:15 AM EDT", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce set aside record amounts for soured loans in the fiscal second quarter, bringing total provisions for Canada\u2019s six-biggest banks to C$10.9 billion ($7.9 billion) as they brace for the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s economic aftermath.Toronto-Dominion reported the biggest set-asides among the country\u2019s large lenders, earmarking C$3.22 billion, while CIBC\u2019s figure was C$1.41 billion. The higher provisions for credit losses eroded net income in the three months through April, with both companies missing analysts\u2019 earnings estimates.The Canadian banks, like their U.S. counterparts, are building up reserves in anticipation of expected stresses to consumers and companies from the outbreak, which brought the North American economy to a virtual standstill and boosted unemployment on both sides of the border.

Adjusted per-share earnings of 94 cents fell short of the C$1.60 average estimate.CIBC\u2019s U.S. commercial banking and wealth management division showed the biggest earnings decline in the quarter, plunging 89% from a year earlier, followed by a 64% decline for Canadian personal and business banking, the Toronto-based lender\u2019s biggest operation.\u201cWhile economic headwinds are likely to be here for the near term, our client focus and our well-diversified business will allow us to get back to pre-Covid levels of profitability as the recovery takes hold,\u201d CIBC Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig said on a conference call with analysts Thursday.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Constantine Courcoulas and Katherine Greifeld", "title": "\u2018Glass half full\u2019 outlook pushes S&P 500 over 3,000", "description": "Stocks most punished by the coronavirus are surging", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/futures-climb-as-economic-recovery-hopes-outweigh-sino-u-s-tensions?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/nyse-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 27, 2020 10:23 AM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks rose for a third day as optimism mounts that the global economy is on the rebound from the pandemic hit.

That\u2019s up from 2.3 per cent at the beginning of this year \u2014 a level Sanderson describes as \u201cvery tight.\u201d\u201cMany retailers are in trouble,\u201d Roelof van Dijk, director of Canadian market analytics at CoStar Group Inc., a real estate research firm. \u201cI think when we get to the other side of this, there\u2019s a real reckoning to be had.\u201dI think when we get to the other side of this, there's a real reckoning to be hadMuch will depend on how long the isolation period lasts and the effectiveness of federal government relief programs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a government program on Friday that aims to reduce rents for the country\u2019s small businesses by 75 per cent. Commercial property owners will be eligible for loans to cover 50 per cent of the rent over three months beginning in April. The property owner is expected to kick in 25 per cent of the rent, and the tenant the other 25 per cent. The loans will be forgiven if the landlord agrees to lower rent by at least 75 per cent and agrees to not evict a tenant while the program is in place.REITS including Choice Properties and Crombie have already offered rent deferrals to troubled tenants. RioCan, one of the country\u2019s largest retail landlords, agreed to about $15 million (US$10.1 million) of deferrals for April, or about 17 per cent of total gross rents.RioCan received two-thirds of its gross rents for April, while First Capital REIT and SmartCentres REIT each collected about 70 per cent and H&R REIT got 56 per cent of its rents from retail tenants, according to company disclosures.The cloudy outlook has contributed to a 26 per cent plunge in the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index this year, lagging the 15 per cent decline of Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Big mall landlords, like pension funds and REITs, are better able to weather the downturn with rent deferrals and can woo shoppers back with retail experiences that can\u2019t be found online, according to van Dijk. Smaller property owners may not even have tenants to reopen storefronts when this ends, he said.That\u2019s a view echoed by RioCan CEO Ed Sonshine.\u201cTo be very blunt, some of these smaller tenants will probably not survive \u2014 I would guess that some of the ones that won\u2019t survive maybe weren\u2019t in such good shape when this started,\u201d he said in an April 21 interview. \u201cWhere we think the tenant should be able to survive, we\u2019re certainly open to discussing further help.\u201dStill he\u2019s optimistic the vast majority of the retail industry will be fine.\u201cOnce people feel safe and comfortable \u2014 and that may be a full year before we\u2019re 100 per cent back to normal, maybe longer \u2014 I think people will go back to their basic habits,\u201d Sonshine said. \u201cThey want to be with other people, they want to be at concerts, they want to eat in restaurants, they want to see movies in the theatre, they want to go to the gym \u2014 all of which nobody can do right now.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Maria Jose Valero", "title": "Shopify has become too hot to handle for some analysts after latest surge", "description": "One analyst says near-record valuation 'somewhat surprising' given uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/shopify-too-hot-to-handle-for-some-analysts-after-latest-surge?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/shopify-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 11:16 AM EDT", "content": "Shopify Inc.\u2019s $38-billion (US$27 billion) stock-market gain since the beginning of the year has some analysts calling a time out.The e-commerce services provider has surged 61 per cent to a market value of $97 billion.

Risk-reward is not attractive and it\u2019s hard to recommend a buy, he said. He has a hold call on the stock and a price target at US$400, below estimate consensus and well off US$585, its current price in New York.Brian Peterson, an analyst at Raymond James, noted the stock is trading at about 39 times his 2020 estimates.Its near-record valuation is \u201csomewhat surprising\u201d given the uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products, which Raymond James believes is the key driver behind the company\u2019s withdrawal of its 2020 revenue guidance earlier this month.Peterson sees Shopify\u2019s monster boom as good news for the future adoption of the platform though, as merchants are forced to migrate online, but its expansion may not \u201cnecessarily equate to sales volume.\u201dA likely recession, \u201cif we\u2019re not in one already,\u201d will inevitably see a downturn in sales as \u201cno one is immune\u201d to the pandemic, Samana said.

While sales decline, Shopify may still be able to get a piece of a smaller pie, Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian wrote in a note Monday. However, some merchants are also expected not to renew their subscriptions amid a tougher environment, Arounian noted.The excitement surrounding Shopify has not worn out, however, as the stock has 15 buys, 14 holds and three sells, according ratings compiled by Bloomberg.Shares on loan to short sellers are still relatively low at 3.8 per cent of Shopify\u2019s float, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.As Shopify inches closer to the top of Canada\u2019s stocks leader board, investors are also reminded of the so-called curse that has seen former Canadian technology behemoths like BlackBerry Ltd. and Nortel Networks Corp. plunge after reaching seemingly indestructible levels.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Vildana Hajric and Jeremy Herron", "title": "Stocks surge as investors snatch some hope from earnings and oil rallies on Iran tensions", "description": "Companies, however, warned of more pain in the coming months", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/asia-stocks-to-decline-oil-collapse-deepens-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/stocks-5.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 21, 2020 5:45 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks halted a two-day slide as investors digested the latest round of corporate earnings.

The market was about 1 per cent away from that as of noon on Wednesday.\u201cThe 2016 low is a key support level and one we are watching right now.

The loonie has weakened almost 6 per cent this year against the greenback and government bond yields have plumbed record lows.The stock index has tumbled 30 per cent in three weeks since its Feb. 20 peak, battered by concerns on the virus and plunging oil prices. That\u2019s about twice the 15 per cent slump in the three weeks after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.Before the market opened on Thursday, Bloomberg gathered with three top investors to discuss where we go from here. Around the table were Lesley Marks, chief investment strategist at BMO Private Wealth; Rob Vanderhooft, chief investment officer of TD Asset Management, which manages $394 billion (US$286 billion); and Kevin McCreadie, CEO and CIO of AGF Management Ltd., who sets the direction for about $37.4 billion in assets.Here\u2019s a synopsis of the discussion.Financial markets are experiencing extreme movements not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. But the structure of the market has changed since then and that\u2019s a factor in the volatility, said Marks.Exchange-traded funds are now an easier way for investors to move money quickly. \u201cHistorically, it may have taken a longer period of time to move money in and out of asset classes versus using an ETF,\u201d she said.ETF assets had grown to more than US$5 trillion globally this year compared with about US$700 billion when the financial crisis first started, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Program trading may be another reason that activity is frantic in the first and last 30 minutes of any trading day and quieter in between.Vanderhooft at TD said a dramatic drop in liquidity is also contributing to the downturn. \u201cLiquidity is a coward and it disappears at times of market disruptions and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re seeing right now.\u201dEither way the market is a different beast, the strategists said.\u201cThey are not traditional market makers any longer,\u201d said McCreadie. \u201cI think in this period of volatility, we will see how the market structure has evolved and will it hold up.\u201dThe hit to oil prices is compounding the damage from the virus pandemic in Canada, where 15 per cent of the TSX index is made up of energy stocks. The breakup of the OPEC+ alliance led to a swift price war on crude, with catastrophic consequence for the oil patch. The country\u2019s benchmark crude, Western Canadian Select, is at US$18.74 a barrel.\u201cIf you look at the impact on the oil market, it\u2019s very, very negative for Western Canada,\u201d Vanderhooft said. \u201cAs bad as US$31 WTI is, US$20 WCS is a lot worse. A lot of companies that were already teetering will go under.\u201dSmaller producers may have a harder time surviving the current crash in prices than during the 2014 crisis because banks are less inclined to prop them up, added McCreadie.\u201cThis time around a lot of these smaller players aren\u2019t going to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to be dealing with bankruptcies.\u201dThe increased focus on climate change and sustainability may be factoring into banks\u2019 thinking more now, said Marks. \u201cYou already had that major headwind without the latest crisis, without a price war, without the situation between the Saudis and the Russians. We think this will just fuel the fire.\u201dVanderhooft said that his firm has moved to a \u201cmore negative position\u201d on the Canadian dollar as a result of the oil-price hit. The loonie hit fresh four-year lows at one point on Thursday.All three strategists say the markets will come back. McCreadie and Vanderhooft see the current turmoil as different than 2008.\u201c2008 was a true credit crunch, people didn\u2019t trust each other, banks stopped lending, there was no repo. The world stopped,\u201d McCreadie said, adding there\u2019s unlikely to be \u201csystem failure\u201d now.As coronavirus cases start to ebb, as they have in China, that will likely be when the market begins to turn back up, especially if governments get their act together with fiscal stimulus to aid the economy.We're not playing this as a multi-year bear market\u201cWe\u2019re not playing this as a multi-year bear market,\u201d he said, though odds of a recession in North America have clearly risen. \u201cI think it could be the pause that resets the cycle.\u201dMarks said BMO hasn\u2019t seen any substantial fear when it comes to asset outflows, with much of the money shifting to bonds from equities. \u201cIn conversations with clients, we haven\u2019t seen that sense, that pervasive sense of panicking, that \u2018Get me out of the market\u2019 across the board.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe will get through this event,\u201d McCreadie said. \u201cWe always do.\u201d\u201cYou talk about fully balanced portfolios, that\u2019s where clients need to be,\u201d said Vanderhooft. \u201cAt times of stress like this, you kind of figure out why that\u2019s the case.\u201dMcCreadie\u2019s team at AGF will be looking at paring back investments that have generated double-digit returns and add some of its cash back into markets over the next few weeks.Marks said she is standing pat after BMO Private Wealth\u2019s Investment Counsel Business reduced its equity exposure in November.

Cases are continuing to grow across the world and restrictions on people and businesses are weighing on sentiment.

The company had net debt of two times its Ebitda at the end of last year, down from three times in 2015.Canadian energy companies \u201care better equipped today than their U.S. counterparts,\u201d Darrell Bishop, an analyst at Haywood Securities, said in a note. \u201cWhile in 2014, U.S. companies levered up with higher-yield debt for growth, Canadian companies cut spending and growth plans and focused on getting balance sheets in order.\u201dHowever, it remains to be seen how deep the current decline will go and how long it will last. Any severe, prolonged downturn in prices would hurt Canada, which depends on the energy industry for about 10 per cent of gross domestic product and a fifth of its exports.Oilsands producers will rarely shut in operations amid depressed prices because many of their costs are fixed and shutdowns can damage reservoirs. Some may try to prolong maintenance work on their facilities while prices are depressed but they have cut operating costs about as much as they can since the last downturn, Mark Oberstoetter, lead analyst for upstream research at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Calgary, said by phone.Oil prices this low will hurt other oil countries, including the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia, Randy Ollenberger, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg Television. About a third of U.S. exploration and production companies need WTI prices of US$55 a barrel to break even, and with prices at their current levels \u2014 WTI was trading at about US$33.50 at 11 a.m. Eastern time \u2014 some of those companies may go under, sowing the seeds of a price recovery, he said.\u201cThe industry simply doesn\u2019t work at these prices,\u201d Ollenberger said. \u201cI don\u2019t just mean U.S. shale or Canadian oilsands.

Stocks dropped while the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1 per cent.Bank of America has predicted that the global economy will see its weakest year since the financial crisis as the virus damages demand in China and beyond. Futures markets predict more rate cuts, with the Bank of Canada likely to lower its benchmark rate on Wednesday morning.But Picton sees higher rates down the road. He acknowledges that there will be a \u201csignificant interruption\u201d to the global economy, but is convinced it will end quickly and there will be a V-shaped recovery later in the year.The headwinds of the recent past \u2014 a trade war, tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and a lack of significant Chinese stimulus \u2014 have shifted as policy makers react to the virus threat, he said. When the outbreak subsides, there will be pent-up demand globally for goods and services, he added.That is likely to be a powerful recipe for a move higher in most risk assets, including global equities, Picton said.\u201cThe coronavirus might have just delayed a powerful recovery phase that was beginning to develop,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I think there will be a stimulus response that builds an even greater tailwind.\u201dPicton Mahoney was one of the earlier entrants into the hedge fund market in Canada. One of the firm\u2019s oldest funds, a long-short equity fund, returned 8.25 per cent annualized since inception as of Jan. 31, outpacing the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index by more than two percentage points.Picton sees parallels between the current environment and the late 1990s. Back then, a period of turmoil \u2014 the Asian crisis and Russian default of 1997-98 \u2014 forced central banks to reverse course on a round of tightening.After the Fed cut in 1998, interest rates began rising again in 1999 as the global economy regained speed. Picton thinks the same thing will happen again.That means interest-rate sensitive investments will underperform as the recovery takes hold, said Picton, whose firm has about $7.5 billion (US$5.6-billion) in assets under management. The firm is shorting some rate-sensitive securities and buying derivatives that will pay off if rates go back up.And if its is indeed the late 1990s all over again, how else should investors play it?\u201cThe very simple answer is, take risk across all asset classes, understanding that you\u2019re probably in a giant poker game against everybody else who\u2019s doing the exact same thing,\u201d he said.For Picton, the sharp gains in government bonds is overdone and the correction in risk assets, especially in high-yield debt, is reflecting a near-term outlook of negative economic data.There is \u201cso much of a narrative that rates will not go up again that the bond market is somewhat missing on the plain signals that would have been picked up in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the bond market\u2019s going to get it right this time, like they did back in 2008 in the last recessionary phase.\u201dOne of his top picks is First Quantum Minerals Ltd., which has started the world\u2019s largest copper mine in the Panamanian jungle, in an environment where supply is probably less than demand growth, according to Picton.\u201cInventory\u2019s already low and more importantly there\u2019s no new projects that you can see on the horizon,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Crystal Tse and Divya Balji", "title": "Trash hauler GFL falls after braving market roiled by coronavirus in $1.43-billion IPO", "description": "Shares of North America's fourth-biggest waste hauler fell 9.5 per cent in New York to US$17.19, down from its US$19 IPO price", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/trash-hauler-gfl-falls-after-braving-market-roiled-by-coronavirus-in-1-43-billion-ipo", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/gfl-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 3, 2020 2:19 PM EST", "content": "GFL Environmental Inc. fell in its trading debut after raising US$1.425 billion in the largest Canadian initial public offering in almost six years.Shares of North America\u2019s fourth-biggest waste hauler fell 9.5 per cent at 12:08 p.m. in New York to US$17.19, down from its US$19 IPO price.

For the loonie, three-month implied volatility rose to the highest in almost five months as fears sparked demand to hedge the Canadian dollar\u2019s weakness.Traders are abandoning the Canadian dollar as the viral outbreak confounded global markets, clouding the outlook for the commodity-linked currency. It was among the worst performers of Group-of-10 peers Thursday, pushing it to levels unseen since June.The loonie may continue to fall. Simon Harvey, a London-based market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. and Monex Canada Inc., said that \u201ccurrency markets may be lining up for another serving of a Poloz special \u2014 talking the currency down in order to do the bank\u2019s bidding in the short-run, thus buffering the Canadian economy from slowing global growth headwinds.\u201dGoldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends going long on the Japanese yen against the Canadian dollar as currency markets enter a \u201clonger period of virus-related uncertainty,\u201d strategist Zach Pandl said in a note to clients Wednesday.His view is based on the expectation that risk aversion will remain high, \u201cdollar bloc\u201d currencies will underperform, and that the Bank of Canada could turn more dovish. Markets are pricing in at least two interest rate cuts from the central bank this year.In fixed income, plunging bond yields boosted gains on government debt while spreads in the corporate bond market increased to their widest since mid-December. That\u2019s another indicator of economic concern. Canada\u2019s 30-year government bond yield fell to a record low after breaching the Aug. 15 floor.\u201cCanadian government bonds offer two important benefits at the moment that are increasingly hard to find in the world today: a AAA credit rating and positive nominal yields,\u201d said Kurt Reiman, chief Canadian investment strategist at Blackrock Inc. \u201cDuring the latest setback for risk assets, Canadian fixed income has provided important portfolio ballast as interest rates decline \u2014 even with interest rates at incredibly low levels.\u201dAn aggregate index of Canadian bonds in U.S. dollars returned 1 per cent year to date, compared with a 3 per cent increase for a comparable U.S. benchmark, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. Yet investors snapped up a Canadian issue by Hydro One Ltd. when first sold earlier this week. The notes are trading below their initial pricing as global credit markets grind to a virtual standstill amid the coronavirus outbreak.For Mark Stacey, times like this should remind investors about the advantage of having a balanced portfolio.\u201cWhile stocks have sold off aggressively, government bonds and many liquid alternative strategies have done just the opposite in recent days,\u201d said Stacey, head of portfolio management at AGF Investments Inc. \u201cBy allocating to a range of low and/or negatively correlated asset classes, investors are better able to limit losses from a market correction, and should also be rewarded with reduced portfolio volatility, leaving them positioned to recover any of the losses they do incur more quickly.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Vildana Hajric and Claire Ballentine", "title": "Stocks plunge after CDC warns Americans to prepare for coronavirus outbreak in U.S.", "description": "Dow down 880 points as virus spreads further around the world and officials describe it as 'a rapidly escalating epidemic'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/stock-drop-accelerates-after-cdc-warns-americans-to-prepare-for-coronavirus-outbreak?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/coronavirus-markets.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 25, 2020 4:17 PM EST", "content": "U.S. stocks tumbled to an almost 12-week low and bond yields plunged to records on rising concern the coronavirus will upend global supply chains critical to economic growth.The S&P 500\u2019s four-day rout reached almost 7.6 per cent, with losses accelerating Tuesday after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans to prepare for a coronavirus outbreak at home.
