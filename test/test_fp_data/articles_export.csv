The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who’s argued the extradition was politically motivated.“The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,” the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize “the highly political nature of the arrest,” the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn’t attend Meng’s arrest “in an effort to avoid perception of influence.”In filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of “coordinated state misconduct,” describing the handling of her arrest as “so serious” that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting “a political persecution” against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng’s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained“This planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,” the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng’s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — who’ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged. China-Canada relations are in their darkest period in decades after China also halted billions of dollars in Canadian imports and put two other Canadians on death row.Meng is seeking an unredacted version of the memo, along with further documents that Canada is withholding on national security grounds. She plans to appoint a lawyer with security clearance to argue on her behalf in closed proceedings at the Federal Court in Ottawa.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they’re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola’s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.“We had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, ‘You know what, it’s not worth people thinking that we’re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that’s using people’s money,’” Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.“People started bashing us because they said, ‘Oh you don’t have deposits.’ It’s like, good hell, you can’t win with these people,” Milton said. “No matter what you do, you can’t win.”Of course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola’s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model — bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront — has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola’s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola — a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week — says he doesn’t care.“It’s really part of the noise,” Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can’t sell any shares for the next 12 months. “I don’t really have any emotion to those numbers because they’re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.”Nikola’s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn’t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.’s pickup franchise that’s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn’t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola’s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.“You can’t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,” said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.”Milton, who’s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola’s listing, saw Citron’s post.“He never even bothered reaching out,” Milton said of Left. “He doesn’t give a s— about the facts.”Milton’s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit “laughable” and said the claims were “absurd” on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola’s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was “time to go all out” and put Tesla’s Semi into volume production.“He doesn’t like us, and that’s OK,” Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums “a humbling experience.”He then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture — an alarm-system company — for about $1.5 million. “I thought I was on top of the world,” he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that’s part of the billionaire Agnelli family’s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola’s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company’s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.“Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s done,” Milton said. “I’m an innovator, I’ll let the haters hate. I’m here to create, I’m not here to destroy.”Bloomberg.com"

Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.The car renter wants to take advantage of the quixotic rally in its stock by offering as many as 246.78 million common shares, according to a court filing. The proceeds would provide some much-needed working capital while Hertz tries to dig out from massive debts that forced it into court protection. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for later today to consider the idea.“This is what I love about bankruptcy — there’s never a dull moment,” said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with the law firm Otterbourg, who said she hasn’t seen a financing like this.Hertz gained 41 per cent to US$2.90 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and rose as high as US$3.47. Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.“The recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz’s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,” the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that “the common stock could ultimately be worthless” and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.“As odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,” said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University’s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there’s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That’s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt — including Hertz’ bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value — would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.“A lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?” Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling “given the volatile state of trading in Hertz’s stock.” Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.“It is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn’t buy those shares,” said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV’s William S. Boyd School of Law, who said she has never seen a bankruptcy funded this way. “I guess they’re trying to catch whatever the opposite of a falling knife is.”The case is The Hertz Corporation, 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.Bloomberg.com"

For a company that’s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale’s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first — and won’t be the last. Its self-inflicted wounds have sapped confidence across the entire industry, leaving many smaller operators teetering on the edge of catastrophe.As the remnants of shale’s turn-of-the-century heyday turn to dust, it’s unclear who — if anyone — will step into the void. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake’s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. “Extreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,” Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that’s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable — and therefore, worthless — by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company’s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon’s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC’s decades-long grip on the world’s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.“They were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,” said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Right now we’re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.”Gordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move — intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas — occurred just in time to expand the company’s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn’t find buyers.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

U.S. jobless claims remained high, underscoring the longer-term challenges caused by the pandemic. The report came out a day after the Federal Reserve provided a dour economic outlook. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn’t shut down the economy again even if there is another surge in coronavirus cases.“The move from the bottom in terms of the rally has been so mind boggling.

That could be extended past the planned June 21 expiry, the CBC and Reuters reported this week.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has enacted a mandatory 14-day quarantine on anyone returning to the country, even if they have no symptoms. Some provinces have even barred entry by Canadians living in other provinces.“These emergency measures need to be introduced with a certain sense of proportionality,” Rovinescu said Thursday on a webcast with Aviation Week.The growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths has slowed in most of Canada and provinces have lifted many pandemic restrictions on businesses.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world’s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU’s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the “buy box” on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer — whether from Amazon’s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant — is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It’s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products — prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon’s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants “expect the EU to clearly punish” Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.“All merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants’ data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,” he said in an email. “Amazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked” without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to “cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.” Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission’s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven’t always opened the way to more competition. Google’s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn’t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"

Tesla produced less than 103,000 cars in the first quarter to Toyota’s 2.4 million.On Thursday, another one of Musk’s followers referred to his May 1 tweet in which he wrote that Tesla’s stock price was, in his opinion, too high. The billionaire wrote back with a link to a web address he bought early last year, stankmemes.com.The website features a “stonks” meme image in which a character is standing in front of stock prices and next to an upward pointing arrow.Bloomberg.com"

The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who’s argued the extradition was politically motivated.“The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,” the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize “the highly political nature of the arrest,” the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn’t attend Meng’s arrest “in an effort to avoid perception of influence.”In filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of “coordinated state misconduct,” describing the handling of her arrest as “so serious” that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting “a political persecution” against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng’s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained“This planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,” the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng’s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — who’ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged. China-Canada relations are in their darkest period in decades after China also halted billions of dollars in Canadian imports and put two other Canadians on death row.Meng is seeking an unredacted version of the memo, along with further documents that Canada is withholding on national security grounds. She plans to appoint a lawyer with security clearance to argue on her behalf in closed proceedings at the Federal Court in Ottawa.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they’re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola’s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.“We had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, ‘You know what, it’s not worth people thinking that we’re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that’s using people’s money,’” Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.“People started bashing us because they said, ‘Oh you don’t have deposits.’ It’s like, good hell, you can’t win with these people,” Milton said. “No matter what you do, you can’t win.”Of course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola’s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model — bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront — has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola’s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola — a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week — says he doesn’t care.“It’s really part of the noise,” Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can’t sell any shares for the next 12 months. “I don’t really have any emotion to those numbers because they’re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.”Nikola’s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn’t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.’s pickup franchise that’s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn’t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola’s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.“You can’t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,” said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.”Milton, who’s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola’s listing, saw Citron’s post.“He never even bothered reaching out,” Milton said of Left. “He doesn’t give a s— about the facts.”Milton’s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit “laughable” and said the claims were “absurd” on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola’s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was “time to go all out” and put Tesla’s Semi into volume production.“He doesn’t like us, and that’s OK,” Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums “a humbling experience.”He then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture — an alarm-system company — for about $1.5 million. “I thought I was on top of the world,” he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that’s part of the billionaire Agnelli family’s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola’s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company’s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.“Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s done,” Milton said. “I’m an innovator, I’ll let the haters hate. I’m here to create, I’m not here to destroy.”Bloomberg.com"

Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.The car renter wants to take advantage of the quixotic rally in its stock by offering as many as 246.78 million common shares, according to a court filing. The proceeds would provide some much-needed working capital while Hertz tries to dig out from massive debts that forced it into court protection. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for later today to consider the idea.“This is what I love about bankruptcy — there’s never a dull moment,” said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with the law firm Otterbourg, who said she hasn’t seen a financing like this.Hertz gained 41 per cent to US$2.90 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and rose as high as US$3.47. Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.“The recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz’s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,” the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that “the common stock could ultimately be worthless” and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.“As odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,” said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University’s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there’s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That’s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt — including Hertz’ bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value — would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.“A lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?” Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling “given the volatile state of trading in Hertz’s stock.” Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.“It is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn’t buy those shares,” said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV’s William S. Boyd School of Law, who said she has never seen a bankruptcy funded this way. “I guess they’re trying to catch whatever the opposite of a falling knife is.”The case is The Hertz Corporation, 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.Bloomberg.com"

For a company that’s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale’s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first — and won’t be the last. Its self-inflicted wounds have sapped confidence across the entire industry, leaving many smaller operators teetering on the edge of catastrophe.As the remnants of shale’s turn-of-the-century heyday turn to dust, it’s unclear who — if anyone — will step into the void. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake’s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. “Extreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,” Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that’s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable — and therefore, worthless — by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company’s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon’s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC’s decades-long grip on the world’s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.“They were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,” said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Right now we’re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.”Gordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move — intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas — occurred just in time to expand the company’s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn’t find buyers.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

U.S. jobless claims remained high, underscoring the longer-term challenges caused by the pandemic. The report came out a day after the Federal Reserve provided a dour economic outlook.

That could be extended past the planned June 21 expiry, the CBC and Reuters reported this week.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has enacted a mandatory 14-day quarantine on anyone returning to the country, even if they have no symptoms. Some provinces have even barred entry by Canadians living in other provinces.“These emergency measures need to be introduced with a certain sense of proportionality,” Rovinescu said Thursday on a webcast with Aviation Week.The growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths has slowed in most of Canada and provinces have lifted many pandemic restrictions on businesses.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world’s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU’s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the “buy box” on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer — whether from Amazon’s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant — is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It’s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products — prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon’s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants “expect the EU to clearly punish” Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.“All merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants’ data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,” he said in an email. “Amazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked” without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to “cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.” Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission’s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven’t always opened the way to more competition. Google’s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn’t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"

The Treasury curve steepened sharply after the central bank said it will at least maintain the current rate of bond purchases.Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 282.86 points, or 1.04 per cent, to 26,989.44, the S&P 500 lost 17.12 points, or 0.53 per cent, to 3,190.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.59 points, or 0.67 per cent, to 10,020.35.“It seems like profit-taking is underway after the Fed didn’t deliver any new measures,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “It’s not as easy to take risk at this point.”U.S. equities have rallied more than 40 per cent from their March lows as central-bank asset purchases and unprecedented stimulus sparked demand for risk assets. Earlier Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the U.S. “definitely” needs additional fiscal stimulus.Stocks may be the ultimate beneficiary of trillions of dollars in economic stimulus from the Fed, according to Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Corp.’s chief U.S. equity strategist. “Liquidity looking for a home” is bolstering the FANG stocks — Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google’s owner, Alphabet Inc. — along with their technology-driven peers, she wrote in a report this week.The danger, though, is that any complication in the economic recovery could see market gains swiftly reverse — at a time when there’s less room for additional support. The pandemic is splintering the world economy, and policy makers can’t risk a premature withdrawal of lifelines to businesses and the most vulnerable people, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned.

Operating income will decline as much as US$2.2 billion in the period, the company said in a statement.The guidance underscores the depth of the challenges for consumer-facing businesses from the coronavirus outbreak and worldwide lockdowns. The coffee seller, which is exploring new store formats to stimulate demand, is being closely watched as a barometer of customers’ willingness to leave their homes and open their wallets as the pandemic subsides.“These numbers are a lot worse than the Street was expecting,” said Michael Halen, senior restaurant analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “People expect some sort of crazy snapback but it’s not going to materialize in restaurants.”Starbucks plans to accelerate the rollout of its “pickup” store concept, with smaller-format locations that don’t have customer seating. “While we had originally planned to execute this strategy over a three- to five-year timeframe, rapidly evolving customer preferences hasten the need for this concept.”The pandemic has forced Starbucks to rethink its central concept of being a “third place” away from work and home for customers to relax, it said.The company expects to open 300 net new stores this fiscal year in the Americas, half of its earlier estimate. That includes the closure of 400 company-operated ones over the next 18 months alongside the opening of a “greater number of new, repositioned stores in different locations and with innovative store formats.”Starbucks is also examining its Canada operations and plans to restructure its business there over the next two years. The company said it will potentially close 200 additional stores there, with some of these changing locations.In China, the company says it is on track to add at least 500 net new stores this fiscal year, despite the virus impact.Chains dependent on breakfast sales, like Starbucks, have gotten hit disproportionately hard because there are so many fewer commuters on the road these days. Starbucks’ price point is also higher than rivals like Dunkin’, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Halen said, making it less well positioned heading into a pandemic-related recession.On top of that, a smaller share of its stores have drive-thrus than rivals. Lingering in the café enjoying a coffee was a key part of the “third place” experience, but that concept is “toast right now,” Halen said.“They’re really behind here. I don’t blame the management team, the management team is excellent — it’s just the impact of coronavirus is going to hurt them that much more because it’s a café,” he said.The shares fell as much as 4.7 per cent on Wednesday, the most intraday in more than a month. Starbucks had declined 6.3 per cent this year through Tuesday’s close.The company’s comments also dragged down peers, with an S&P index of restaurant stocks falling as much as 2.7 per cent, the most in almost a month. Starbucks, due to its size and propensity to give regular updates, is seen as a proxy for the industry.In the U.S., its critical home market, comparable sales were down 43 per cent in May, though things have been improving with each passing week, Starbucks said. About 95 per cent of the company’s U.S. stores are operating currently, even as many New York City sites remain shuttered. That’s a contrast to China, its other key market and a country further along the road to post-pandemic recovery, where 99 per cent of stores are open and same-store sales were down just 21 per cent in May.While sales have fallen, customers that do go to Starbucks are spending more during the pandemic, with the average order including more items, the company said. This is expected to normalize over time.Bloomberg.com"

Ives maintained his neutral rating but boosted his price target to US$1,000 from US$800 and said his new bull case implies shares could be worth US$1,500 from US$1,350 previously.Further demand for electric vehicles in China paired with the easing of lockdowns in both the U.S. and much of Europe and the potential for “game-changing” battery developments at a company event planned for this month signal shares can move higher, Ives wrote.Shares of the Palo Alto, California-based electric-vehicle maker rallied as much as 6.8 per cent Wednesday to touch a record US$1,005.

With the pandemic ebbing, the exhibitor has begun reopening in Europe and is planning to restart at home, too.AMC on Tuesday recorded an adjusted first-quarter loss of US$2.22 a share, after announcing preliminary results announced on June 3. Revenue slumped to US$941.5 million. The outlook this period looks worse: The chain has been closed since March 17, meaning most of the second quarter has been lost. While California is allowing theatres to reopen this weekend, AMC has said it expects to be fully open globally next month.During the quarter, AMC also wrote down the value of its assets, including acquisitions, leading to a charge of US$1.85 billion and the large net loss.All of AMC’s thousands of screens around the world have been dark for months amid the coronavirus lockdowns, and they will reopen under severe restrictions. In California, where AMC has more than 50 locations, cinemas can reopen June 12, but may only fill a quarter of the seats in order to maintain social distancing.The chain is also embroiled in a dispute with Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures after the studio, one of Hollywood’s largest, released “Trolls World Tour” to online audiences the same day the picture opened in theatres. AMC said it would stop showing Universal movies, and demanded the studio respect theatre owners’ traditional exclusive rights to show new movies for about 90 days.The Leawood, Kansas-based chain warned last week it won’t be able to stay in business if theatres can’t reopen, and is negotiating with lenders, asking them to accept a steep haircut on existing debt.

The number of users holding Whiting Petroleum Corp. grew roughly 10,000 in the last 24 hours.Two things the companies have in common: They’ve filed for bankruptcy protection. And each saw their shares double to start the week.It’s the same thing for Chesapeake Energy, as it prepares a potential filing. In the past, the court process usually wiped out equity shareholders. In this day and age, as small day traders salivate at any opportunity to get rich quick, a filing has apparently become a buy signal for many of them. There’s evidence retail investor actions have become a decisive driver of price.“Retail has a lot to do with it and I don’t think you’ve seen institutional investors buying those kinds of stocks,” said Christopher Grisanti, chief equity strategist at MAI Capital Management. “It’s too much risk. I would call it catching a falling knife.”The 2020 stock market has been full of peculiarities that nobody saw coming. The fastest drop for the S&P 500 into a bear market, followed by the fastest 50-day rebound in nine decades. Mom and pop scrambling to the right side of the recovery trade, while the advice of Wall Street legends falls flat. A health-care crisis forcing one of the deepest recessions, and in the midst of it, equities emerging unscathed.In a market as bizarre as this, it seems only fitting that the next step would be a growing affinity for companies that can’t pay their debts.According to website Robintrack, which uses Robinhood’s data to show trends in positioning but isn’t affiliated with it, individual investors on the app have been flocking to bankruptcy-protected companies in droves. (The site says it downloads popularity data each hour for every stock directly from Robinhood via a public application programming interface, or API. A Robinhood spokesperson declined to comment for this story.)Of course, interest in these stocks isn’t flowing solely from Robinhood clients. But the app is a lens into retail interest, particularly among younger investors, because unlike other popular brokerages, it’s possible to see holdings of its users in real-time. Some of the rallies in these shares may also be due to short covering.Robintrack’s data show 159,000 users now hold Hertz stock in some form. That’s a record high, and up from 37,000 users a month ago. Over the last three days, the car rental firm has seen the largest surge in popularity on the platform. Right now, more users on the investing app hold bankrupt Hertz than do Netflix Inc.Call it crazy, but don’t call it dumb. In the three sessions through Monday, Hertz shares surged 577%, just weeks after the company filed for bankruptcy. Trading volume in the stock has surged to an average of 197 million shares a day in June — more than 60 times what was typical in 2019.Chesapeake Energy has seen a similar turn. The oil company jumped 182 per cent on Monday, and after markets closed, news broke that the firm was said to be preparing to file for bankruptcy. More than 20 million shares changed hands, the most turnover on record for the stock in a single day, Bloomberg data show. In recent days, Chesapeake’s popularity with users of Robinhood ballooned to 38,000 — a gain of 9,000.Same with Whiting Petroleum, a shale driller that went bankrupt in April. The number of users holding shares of the company rose to a record 50,000 this week. On Monday, the stock surged 152 per cent, and more than 104 million shares traded.“It’s great that Vegas is open again, but who needs it when you have the stock market instead,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer for Bleakley Financial Group. “After an incredible run since March, we now have clear froth in parts of the market. We know this level of speculation has coincided with a sharp increase in the activity of retail investors.”Boockvar added the activity has been encouraged by a “zero rate” and “unlimited QE” environment, referring to the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing measures. Ahead of the central bank’s decision Wednesday, he’s not the only one laying blame.“In this tape, bankruptcies have become the flavour of the day,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “At what point will Jay Powell and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve realize they have broken the market’s pricing mechanism? The bankruptcies are only a small part of the story.”Bloomberg.com"

That compares with US$31 billion during the 2008-2009 recession.The grim forecast comes as airlines seek to gradually restart operations with the pandemic beginning to recede. Industry debt has jumped by about US$120 billion, a level many carriers will be unable to sustain without governments stepping in to convert borrowing into equity, the trade body said. The alternative to a rise in state ownership would be mass bankruptcies, it said.“Losses this year will be the biggest in aviation history,” IATA Chief Executive Officer Alexandre de Juniac said on a call with reporters. “There is no comparison for the dimensions of this crisis.”While IATA hasn’t previously estimated losses, it said the anticipated decline in passenger revenue this year has widened to US$371 billion from the US$314 billion forecast in April. The drop including non-passenger sales may be US$419 billion.Losses will amount to between 15 per cent and 30 per cent of revenue depending on the region, with no prospect of a return to profitability until 2022 at the earliest even if there’s no second wave of coronavirus infections.Airlines are set to end the year with about US$550 billion in total debt, IATA forecast. That means the sector’s borrowings next year will be 16 times earnings even on an Ebitdar basis, stretching from 4.6 times in 2019.There is no comparison for the dimensions of this crisisWhile some carriers may be able to cope by raising fresh equity themselves, stretched balance sheets are likely to lead to many states buying stakes, it said. Only US$11 billion of the US$123 billion in various forms of aid provided so far has been in the form of direct investment.Global connectivity will also be reduced, with the number of city-pair links down by about 25 per cent by the end of the year even after operations resume, the trade body said. Yields, a measure of fares, are likely to be down by around 20 per cent as airlines cut prices to attract passengers back to travel.Bloomberg.com"

The 42 per cent surge from a March low is the best advance over an equivalent time-frame since 2009 for the MSCI ACWI Index that includes stocks in both the emerging and developed world. The gauge is now trading at 20 times next year’s profits, the most expensive since 2002.“This rally is a function of government support being thrown behind the economy,” said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions and client advisory for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “There are key risks that could lead to more volatility ahead over the short term, which is why we continue to hedge our portfolios on the downside while still looking for opportunities to add risk for the medium to long term.”So far bulls are in charge. U.S. stocks just crossed an important psychological milestone of recouping this year’s losses. Asia’s equity benchmark just posted its seventh straight day of gains, the longest streak in more than two years. And euro-area shares are on course for their best monthly gain since 2015.Factors including a wall of money from the guardians of global economies, the easing of lockdowns and the shockingly positive employment numbers in the U.S. are drawing more buyers to participate, picking up cheaper sectors and adding more fuel to the rally. Yet caution still abounds with some investors increasing hedges for potential volatility ahead.“The risk of a correction will rise if investors continue to price in a rapid recovery, especially for sectors that are vulnerable to another wave of infections or an escalation of tensions between the U.S. and China,” said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.In another sign that the rally is stretched, global share-price gains in the past month have purely come from multiple expansion as earnings forecasts have barely budged since May. Adding to that is the fact the MSCI world measure has been in overbought territory since the start of the month, with the relative strength gauge on the index reaching the highest since January, which is considered a bearish signal by some.Meanwhile, speculative excess has surged to the highest in at least 20 years among U.S. options traders, a negative for stocks over the medium term, according to Sundial Capital Research Inc. And a time-honored strategy of hedging stocks with government bonds has become questionable now that bond yields have plummeted thanks to policy easing across the world.“If everyone is holding stocks just to pass on to the next greater fool, and if the greatest fool is a central bank with infinite liquidity to buy them, then, yes, prices will keep going up,” according to a note from Rabobank on Tuesday.With files from ReutersBloomberg.com"

Bobo’s, a Boulder, Colorado-based producer of snack bars and toaster pastries, has stocked up on organic oats, sugar and coconut oil, Chief Executive Officer TJ McIntyre said in an interview.“We just wanted to have an insurance plan for our business. If we ran out of oats, we’d be in trouble,” he said. “In a first-time situation like this pandemic, there’s a lot of questions we can’t answer.”His company is currently buying about 50 per cent more of its main ingredients. This affords it an extra 90 days to solve any potential supply-chain hiccups.This is a striking shift in strategy for food companies that for years built up just-in-time inventories, which minimize storage costs. It also underscores the lessons that were learned after the coronavirus pandemic upended supply chains and sparked concerns over shortages of some ingredients.Robert Moskow, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said that food companies are bringing in more raw materials and packaging to help guarantee they can meet demand from retailers, where stocks of goods have fallen.“Retail has below average inventory, they’re trying to get as much as they can from producers,” Moskow said.More money tied up in physical goods may also mean fewer new products — referred to as “innovation” in the industry. Saffron Road, for example, recently cut two ramen bowls because they didn’t sell as well as other items and it’s cheaper to focus on core offerings. This represents another big change for food companies, which had prior to COVID-19 resorted to new, experimental products — like Kraft Heinz Co.’s mayochup — to create buzz.One of the things weighing on the minds’ of consumers and scientists alike is whether cooler weather will cause coronavirus infections to spike again — potentially creating another boom in grocery demand. Second waves of the virus have been reported in China, South Korea and Hong Kong.Saffron Road, which makes frozen beef bulgogi meals and chickpea masala meal pouches, is buying 50 per cent more inventory than before — and has plans to boost purchases even more later in the year, CEO Adnan Durrani said. It’s a risk to cash flow, he said, but one that’s worth taking amid a surge in demand.The company will double its inventory heading into September, in case there’s another spike in demand tied to rising COVID-19 cases again. He hopes, of course, this isn’t the case.“We saw frozen foods go up dramatically during COVID,” Durrani said. “Hopefully we flatten the curve.”Taika, a canned coffee startup in San Francisco, has loaded up on ashwagandha powder — a plant-derived ingredient used in its coffee that’s seen limited supply recently because it’s sourced from India. With lockdowns there limiting the producer’s ability to ship, Taika is now holding about six months of supply instead of just three months before the pandemic hit, founder Kal Freese said.“For small business, you end up having more capital tied up in inventory,” he said.Campbell, which has seen a surge in demand for pantry staples including Prego pasta sauce and Kettle potato chips, has stocked up on certain ingredients to make sure it doesn’t run out, CEO Mark Clouse said in an interview on June 3. The company is betting consumer demand will remain high — it now sees sales from continuing operations rising as much as 6.5 per cent this year, a big jump from its previous range.“Demand has remained very elevated,” Clouse said. “So our production and supply chain is really running flat out. We are working non-stop in a way that’s practical and safe to create some cushion as it relates to inventory.”Gokhan Egilmez, an associate professor at the University of New Haven, agrees that higher demand is likely to persist. He predicted the pandemic will “continue to cause radical transformations” across industries until a vaccine or treatment is found.“As we all know, the pandemic already shifted consumption habits,” Egilmez said. “People may still find it not appealing to dine out or order from outside.”Bloomberg.com"

The county, a hub of agricultural activity where workers jam into often crowded factories to package apples and other foods, has the highest per capita infection rate on the West Coast.It’s a grim reality that’s playing out across the country as COVID-19 spreads beyond the meat plants that have captured the national spotlight. At least 60 food-processing facilities outside the meatpacking industry have seen outbreaks, with more than 1,000 workers diagnosed with the virus, according to a new study from Environmental Working Group.These are the first national numbers of their kind. The advocacy group compiled its figures using local media reports because there are no federal agencies reporting the data. The true total is almost certainly higher. Fruit and vegetable packers, bakers and dairy workers are risking infection as the virus spreads through processing plants where employees deemed essential have mostly remained on the job during the pandemic, sometimes labouring in close quarters.“At our workplace, we were not ready for this virus. We didn’t talk about it. We didn’t know about it,” said Paula Zambrano, a 61-year-old who works part time as a fruit sorter for Borton & Sons in Yakima. She was so concerned by an outbreak at the plant in April that the she didn’t come in for three weeks, but then she had to return to support herself.“People are infected and they come to work. They keep quiet about it,” she said. “We live from our work. We are surviving from our wages. If we have children, how will we feed them?”Borton & Sons didn’t respond to voicemail messages left for John Borton, an owner and director of business operation, and Eric Borton, director of business development.People are infected and they come to work. They keep quiet about itAmerica’s food suppliers have seen some of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks of any industry outside health care. Dozens of meatpacking workers have died, with thousands falling sick. The virus has also spread among employees at farms, where in all likelihood cases will keep climbing as more than half a million seasonal migrants spread out across the nation as the summer harvesting season ramps up.In addition to the human tragedy, the outbreaks also expose the vulnerability of America’s food supply. The meat industry was already plunged into crisis with plant shutdowns that sparked grocery-store shortages. Even as that situation eases, more shortfalls of individual food items and ingredients are likely in the months ahead unless the virus’s spread is slowed at food-processing plants, said Kevin Kenny, chief operating officer of Decernis, an expert in global food safety and supply chains.There are about 1.7 million workers at food and beverage manufacturing facilities, of which roughly 500,000 are at meat processors, according to a 2018 U.S. Census Bureau survey.Unions, advocacy groups and experts have said that employers haven’t done enough to keep workers safe, with protective gear including face masks and gloves not being widely distributed until infections had already started to spread. Conditions inside plants can be crowded, and fast-moving processing lines may not allow enough space for social distancing. The largely immigrant labour-force also faces tough living conditions, with cramped housing — sometimes in employer provided bunkhouse-style dormitories that can sleep four to 10 to a room.About 35 per cent of food processing and dairy facilities have had at least one confirmed COVID-19 case, according to an International Brotherhood of Teamsters survey in May of union locals representing 79 plants. Roughly 80 per cent of employers weren’t testing for the virus and more than a quarter of the workplaces didn’t allow employees to physically distance themselves 6 feet apart, the survey showed.The Teamsters union is planning a national “call to action” on Wednesday with demonstrations in almost 30 cities for better protection of food supply-chain workers.Still, the Teamsters have seen a “marked decline” in reports of outbreaks at union-represented food processing facilities in the past several weeks as employers have established more robust safety procedures, said Rome Aloise, director of the union’s dairy and food processing divisions. Union-represented employers are doing more no-touch temperature testing, strict adherence to safety protocols, including use of protective gear, and placing portable sanitation stations in workspaces, Aloise said.“Non-union counterparts aren’t doing the same things,” he said.Zambrano, the fruit worker in Washington, said her employer was initially slow to implement measures but now takes temperatures as employees enter work, provides masks and maintains social distancing.Industry trade groups say that employers have invested heavily in measures to protect workers against infection risk while continuing to operate to maintain the nation’s food supply.But employers have also run into issues because of shifting direction from authorities on proper protective measures. For example, fruit packers were initially told masks were unnecessary and were encouraged to donate inventories for use by health care workers, said Jon DeVaney, president of the Washington State Tree Fruit Association. Employers were then confronted with short supplies of protective equipment when the advice changed, he said.“We have to stay open to supply essential goods for the American people,” said Geoff Freeman, president of the Consumer Brands Association. Companies have taken many steps to protect workers, including providing protective equipment and by implementing “aggressive” measures to make sure sick employees who stay home are compensated, he said.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration included food-processing facilities in jointly issued industry-specific guidance for manufacturing. Freeman said more protocols are needed, including, as one example, direction on what portion of positive cases in a workforce should trigger a plant shutdown.“Make no mistake: We cannot eliminate the risk. The challenge for us is to mitigate the risk,” Freeman said. “You have different companies approaching this in different ways. The more we have federal clarity, the more we can have consistency.”Labour advocates are pressing for stronger action to protect workers. Scott Faber, the Environmental Working Group’s senior vice president for government affairs, called on the Trump administration to impose mandatory safety standards to protect food industry workers, help procure protective equipment and provide federal aid to help retrofit plants to protect workers.“Food processing workers, who are disproportionately people of colour, are taking enormous and largely avoidable risks to keep the rest of us fed, but the Trump Administration has failed to ensure they are safe,” Faber said.Food processing workers, who are disproportionately people of colour, are taking enormous and largely avoidable risks to keep the rest of us fedIn Washington, workers at the company where Cruz had worked, Allan Bros. Inc., held a strike starting on May 7 to demand better protections. Cruz participated in a demonstration May 8, but was sick by the next day, according to Edgar Franks, political director of Familias Unidas por la Justicia, the local union.After three weeks, a deal was reached between workers and Allan Bros. The company — located in Naches, just outside of Yakima — agreed to provide masks to employees and to follow CDC guidance on coronavirus. It also said it would, where possible, require social distancing of at least 6 feet, and where not, it would provide face shields and plexiglass barriers, according to Franks. The company also pledged a temporary US$1 an hour raise through June 26, he said.The strike ended May 28. Cruz died on May 31.Allan Bros. confirmed it received a request for comment through its outside public relations firm but didn’t immediately respond further.Cases in Yakima help to illustrate why the figures from Environmental Working Group are almost certainly an undercount.Columbia Legal Services, a non-profit legal aid program in Washington state, filed a public records law request for confirmed COVID cases by employer from Yakima County health authorities. It showed 470 cases at 23 fruit facilities as of June 2. The Environmental Working Group’s list shows only 31 cases at one facility from the county. At one Yakima facility, 19% of the workforce had a confirmed coronavirus diagnosis, according to the county list.“Workers at these packing houses started to get sick in large numbers,” said Franks, whose group helped to organize the memorial caravan for Cruz. “It’s always on the minds of people, that it could be one of them or their friends of family. That’s a real concern.”Bloomberg.com"

Hertz Global Holdings Inc.’s are well above where they were before the company went bankrupt. But no stock in the automotive sector is a better indication of equity-market exuberance than Nikola Corp.The aspiring battery-electric and hydrogen fuel-cell truck maker debuted on the Nasdaq last week following a reverse merger with a blank-cheque company headed by a former General Motors Co. executive and board director. It’s forecasting zero revenue for 2020 and its first US$1 billion year won’t be until 2023.Ford Motor Co., by comparison, is expected to report about US$115 billion of revenue for this year. And yet Nikola, whose stock more than doubled Monday, traded up another 24 per cent to as high as US$90.71 in early trading Tuesday, giving the company a richer market capitalization than the almost 117-year-old maker of the F-150.Skeptics have long questioned the market’s valuation of Tesla, which has yet to post an annual profit. But by pushing Nikola’s market cap to US$26 billion at Monday’s close, investors have taken appraisals of zero-emission vehicle manufacturers named after a celebrated Serbian-American inventor to another stratosphere.“Nikola’s No. 1 goal is stable growth over time,” Trevor Milton, Nikola’s executive chairman, said in an emailed statement. The 38-year-old said several factors could be behind the stock’s gain and cited examples including his tweeted announcement that the company will start taking reservations for its Badger pickup.Starting five years ago, when Milton founded Nikola, through the end of last year, the Phoenix-based company has lost about US$188.5 million. It’s planning to start delivering the Tre battery-electric semi truck next year, followed by two fuel cell-electric models in 2023.The Badger model that Milton said may have gotten the market excited on Monday might not actually make it into production. In Nikola’s public-offering filing, the company said it is focused on making Class 8 heavy-duty vehicles and doesn’t expect to build the Badger unless it finds an established manufacturer to partner with.A spokesperson for the company said Nikola will announce a partner in the near future, without giving more specifics.Last week, Milton ceded the chief executive officer job to Mark Russell, a former COO of metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. who has been president of Nikola since February 2019. VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., the company Nikola merged with, is led by Steve Girsky, a former GM vice chairman who helped lead the carmaker out of bankruptcy.Nikola had about US$86 million in cash at the end of last year. Prior to the stock listing, it had raised more than US$500 million of private capital, though that includes a US$150 million in-kind contribution from CNH Industrial NV, the truck maker linked to Italy’s billionaire Agnelli family. CNH also invested US$100 million cash in Nikola last year.The partnership with CNH includes a 50-50 venture in Europe that aims to start producing battery-electric trucks in Germany in the first half of next year and a North American alliance that Nikola will fully own.Nikola is planning to build a 1-million-square-foot facility south of Phoenix and start making trucks in 2021. It’s expecting to reach full production of about 30,000 fuel cell-electric vehicles in 2027 and 15,000 battery-electric vehicles the following year.Although Nikola touts reservations for 14,000 fuel cell-electric trucks that it says are worth about US$10 billion of sales, those are far from done deals. The company told prospective investors in April that it was negotiating with strategic fleet partners to convert pre-orders into binding contracts with deposits.While times are good for Milton — his fortune now stands at US$9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index— he still covets something Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk has: a blue check mark on Twitter.Then again, Milton may want to be careful about seeking notoriety on Musk’s favourite social-media platform. The account @TESLACharts, which has accumulated roughly 26,400 followers by incessantly trolling Musk, has taken notice of Nikola’s rise.Bloomberg.com"

Amid geopolitical tensions, market volatility and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, Sun Life’s top executives remain on the hunt for acquisitions.“We came into COVID-19 with a pipeline of conversations underway, and those conversations continue,” Chief Executive Officer Dean Connor said in a video interview. “We’re continuing to be actively out there talking to people about what’s possible.”Acquisitions have been a common refrain for Sun Life executives in recent years, and the Toronto-based company has about $5.8 billion (US$4.3 billion) available for deals. While Connor is seeking more tie-ups across the firm’s key pillars of Canada, the U.S., Asia and global asset management, he sees the pandemic stifling activity in the near term.“Not a lot of transactions take place because sellers are trying to figure out where they stand and are trying to consolidate their positions and they don’t want to sell at depressed values, and buyers are trying to figure out where they stand,” Connor said in the interview Monday. “We don’t think you’ll see a lot of transactions in the next six months.”Sun Life shares have slumped 13 per cent this year, compared with a 21 per cent decline for the S&P/TSX insurance industry index.The company is interested in deals in the seven Asian markets where it operates, including increasing stakes in joint ventures and striking partnerships with banks to distribute its insurance products, known as bancassurance. The firm would like to strike a bancassurance deal in Hong Kong along with other opportunities, even amid growing tensions with China that have some observers questioning the city’s future as an Asian financial hub.“We’re not seeing Hong Kong as being an area that’s going to have problems in terms of a Canadian company that’s been there for a long time, that understands the market and understands the people and already has a business in China,” Chief Financial Officer Kevin Strain said in the interview. “So I think it’s finding your way through all the noise, but there’s lots of business opportunities.”Sun Life sees Hong Kong as offering long-term growth opportunities and a springboard for additional business with mainland China in the Pearl River Delta — which includes China’s tech center of Shenzhen and the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou — through greater business access and an opening up of immigration across the economic region, said Strain, who previously spent five years overseeing the Asia business out of Hong Kong, where Sun Life has operated for 128 years.Closer to home, Connor’s interests include expanding in group benefits in the U.S. and building up its Canadian retail wealth management, though he said there isn’t much to buy currently in an industry dominated by Canada’s large banks. He also reiterated interest in rounding out Sun Life’s alternative asset manager, SLC Management, with a deal in below-investment-grade private credit.“If you look at pension funds and institutional investors, generally speaking, the last decade has been one of moving up the risk curve in an ever-lower-return world,” Connor said. “We think there will be demand there, just because of the economics, and we think COVID is actually going to accelerate that demand.”SLC Management deepened its real estate exposure with last year’s combination of Bentall Kennedy and GreenOak, creating a global real estate investment management adviser and services provider with US$48 billion of assets under management. Connor sees opportunities for smaller deals to add to BentallGreenOak, which has a presence in 24 cities across a dozen countries.“There might be some things we want to tuck in and add to maybe extra geographical diversification there,” he said. Sun Life has “great exposure” in industrial real estate, which Connor described as the “rock star of the real estate world right now,” and its apartment holdings are “performing very strongly.”Coronavirus quarantines worldwide are raising questions about post-pandemic demand for office space, with some companies finding that its employees are performing well from home.“There will be some ebb and flows, but long term we think it’ll be a great asset category for long-term investors,” Strain said. “There will be demand for work in the office. The productivity, in being in the same place and working as a team, I don’t think that’s going to permanently go away.”Bloomberg.com"

For Bombardier, that average price is now sitting at about 53cents for the three months leading up to June.A departure from the index could hurt demand for Bombardier’s shares as exchange-traded funds drop the stock. Other managers must also decide whether to keep the shares. “A portfolio manager must determine how closely they want to track the index and make a call on number of shares,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson.Bombardier is aware of the guidelines for index inclusion but it won’t speculate on whether it will be removed in the upcoming review, Jessica McDonald, a company representative said.S&P Dow Jones Indices releases its quarterly review within the first 10 days of the rebalancing month, which would be June 12, spokesman Raymond McConville said.Bombardier’s shares have continued their downward spiral despite a corporate revamp initiated by former chief executive officer Alain Bellemare. The stock has lost almost all of its value in 20 years.The Montreal-based company was once seen as a Canadian champion of the industrial sector and a source of pride for Quebec. It made everything from snowmobiles to commercial aircraft but is now a shadow of its former self after ceding its marquee jet program, now known as the A220, to Airbus SE and agreeing to sell its rail business to French train maker Alstom SA in the face of more than $10 billion in debt.The company’s market capitalization peaked at $36.2 billion in the summer of 2000. Today it’s $1.4 billion.Bellemare’s restructuring means Bombardier has made an all-in bet on the corporate jet market. That left the company, now led by Eric Martel, particularly exposed as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered travel globally and slashed corporate spending. Still, it’s possible that sales of private jets, which allow for physical distancing among passengers, may come back faster than commercial travel.The company’s shares jumped as much as 28 per cent Tuesday after Bank of Nova Scotia upgraded its stock rating to the equivalent of a hold. Analyst Konark Gupta said in a report he sees “some green shoots” in the macro and industry indicators he monitors. Bombardier’s share price, which was at $0.64 as of 10:40 a.m. in Toronto, is still far from the criteria to stay included on the S&P/TSX Composite.Last week, the company announced that it plans to eliminate 2,500 jobs at its aviation division following a slump in demand for business jets. In quarterly financial results released May 7, Bombardier said it’s bracing for a drop of at least 30 per cent in sales of private jets as the crisis pummels demand this year.Bloomberg.com"

The talks with lenders come almost seven years to the date that Lawler assumed the helm at the Oklahoma City-based company at the behest of Carl Icahn and O. Mason Hawkins, at the time two of the driller’s biggest investors.Chesapeake is negotiating a restructuring support agreement that could see holders of its so-called FILO term loan take a majority of the equity in bankruptcy, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters. The support agreement remains fluid and the terms could change, the people said.Chesapeake, which owes about US$9 billion, is debating whether to skip interest payments due on June 15 and invoke a grace period while it talks with creditors, the people said. No final decision has been made. The company has also begun soliciting lenders to provide debtor-in-possession financing to fund its operations during bankruptcy, according to one of the people.A bankruptcy filing by Chesapeake would reverberate well beyond its investors and employees because it will put millions of dollars in pipeline, fracking and other contracts at risk.The stock, whose shrunken price was boosted by a 1-for-200 reverse stock split earlier this year, more than tripled at one point Monday to US$84.75, then plunged to US$52.05 after Bloomberg reported the potential Chapter 11 filing. A bankruptcy typically wipes out existing shareholders.Chesapeake, the brainchild of McClendon and co-founder Tom Ward, was one of the first to aggressively combine breakthroughs in horizontal drilling and high-intensity hydraulic fracturing to shale rock long ignored by geologists looking for gas or oil.That gamble provided trailblazers like Chesapeake, Continental Resources Inc. and EOG Resources Inc. a head start over industry titans like Exxon and Chevron Corp. in dominating the burgeoning shale sector. Years later, companies like Exxon would pay dearly to gain footholds in shale.Lawler’s efforts to rescue Chesapeake have included across-the-board belt-tightening at the company’s once-lavish corporate headquarters, along with tens of thousands of job cuts. A years-long campaign to transform the gas giant into an oil company never gained traction.The driller recorded US$8.5 billion in impairments for the first three months of the year as the value of its fields, a sand mine and other assets plunged along with commodity prices.Chesapeake was already in a precarious position before the COVID-19 outbreak sent crude demand plummeting. At its height more than a decade ago, the producer was a US$37.5-billion juggernaut commanded by McClendon, an outspoken advocate for the gas industry.

The company said the drop in pollution could embolden governments that already have been making plans to eventually ban vehicles that run on fossil fuels.“It is not hard to imagine that many cities could become electric-only in the near future as they begin to witness the impact that ICE vehicles have on air quality,” Tesla said in the report.Tesla’s rosy view is consistent with the Energy Information Agency’s forecast in April that emissions from cars, power plants and other sources may fall 7.5 per cent this year as a result of people sheltering at home. But it’s a 180-degree turn from comments its chief executive officer made while feuding with California officials over reopening the company’s lone U.S. car plant.“This is fascist. This is not democratic, this is not freedom,” Musk said on Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April.

Per-capita output will contract in more than 90 per cent of countries, the biggest share since 1870. The economy will rebound in 2021, growing 4.2 per cent, it said.This is the first recession since 1870 triggered solely by a pandemic, and it continues to manifest itself“This is the first recession since 1870 triggered solely by a pandemic, and it continues to manifest itself,” Ceyla Pazarbazioglu, the World Bank’s vice president of equitable growth, finance and institutions, told reporters by phone. “Given this uncertainty, further downgrades to the outlook are very likely.”The decline in per-capita income may push 70 million to 100 million people into extreme poverty, she said.Advanced economies will shrink 7 per cent, led by a 9.1 per cent contraction in the euro area, the lender said. Emerging and developing economies will shrink 2.5 per cent, their worst performance in data that starts in 1960, it said. Those with limited health-care capacity, deeply integrated global value chains, heavy dependence on foreign financing and extensive reliance on international trade, commodity exports and tourism are likely to be the hardest hit.While the World Bank sees China’s economy eking out 1 per cent growth this year, the lowest rate since 1976, it forecasts India’s will shrink 3.2 per cent. U.S. GDP may contract 6.1 per cent.The World Bank presents two alternative scenarios. In one, where the COVID-19 outbreak persists for longer than expected, requiring the continuation or reintroduction of restrictions on movement, the global economy would shrink almost 8 per cent this year. If control measures can be largely lifted in the near term, the contraction would be 4 per cent — still more than twice as deep as the global financial crisis of 2009.“The global recession would be deeper if bringing the pandemic under control took longer than expected, or if financial stress triggered cascading defaults,” the World Bank said.The International Monetary Fund will update its World Economic Outlook on June 24. In April, the fund forecast a 3 per cent contraction for this year, though chief economist Gita Gopinath has since said that the outlook has worsened. The methodologies are different because IMF aggregate forecasts are based on purchasing-power parity, which gives more weight to developing economies, while the World Bank uses market exchange rates.Most central banks have cut interest rates to about or below zero to buffer the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve starting an unprecedented range of emergency programs providing as much as US$2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal-stimulus packages have varied. The U.S. is providing about 15 per cent of GDP in support and Germany about 4.7 per cent, while Japan’s program is worth about 42 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.Bloomberg.com"

That’s the first gain since June 2019.The government added stimulus measures such as tax rebates to attract consumers back to showrooms, while automakers that shuttered operations amid the coronavirus outbreak now offer generous discounts. The pandemic exacerbated a sales slump that’s in its third year, with an economic slowdown, trade tensions and stricter emission standards weighing on demand.Global automakers spent billions of dollars expanding in China in recent decades, and manufacturers such as Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG remain undeterred in their effort to tap the market’s long-term growth potential, including for electric vehicles. The German manufacturer said this month it will become the biggest shareholder of battery company Guoxuan High-Tech Co., and it seeks a 50 per cent stake in a Chinese EV partner.A decline in sales of new-energy vehicles, including electric cars, also slowed, PCA said. NEV sales fell 26 per cent, following a drop of 30 per cent in April and 49 per cent in March.Tesla was the top-selling NEV brand with 11,095 vehicles, PCA said. The U.S. company started deliveries from its massive new Shanghai factory around the start of the year. Monthly registrations of new Tesla vehicles in China have fluctuated this year amid the virus, from a low of 2,314 in February to a high of 12,710 in March, according to data from state-backed China Automotive Information Net.After growing rapidly for several years, electric-car sales have lost momentum since the government moved to limit subsidies in mid-2019. The pandemic also hurt demand, and slumping oil prices have made gas guzzlers more competitive. The government still considers electric cars a priority, and has added a slew of fresh stimulus measures to help the industry recover.Full-year car sales in China may fall about 10 per cent following big declines at the height of the virus crisis earlier this year, PCA Secretary General Cui Dongshu said on a media call. His view is more optimistic than that of China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, another industry group, which forecast a decline of 15 per cent to 25 per cent.Bloomberg.com"

Saudi Arabia — which had curtailed production by more than its agreed quota — said Monday that those extra reductions will last just one month as planned, as the measures have served their purpose. The wider OPEC+ group agreed over the weekend to extend its record output curbs.The extension of the existing limits is a victory for Saudi Arabia and Russia, which were deadlocked in a brutal price war just two months ago. OPEC+’s de-facto leaders showed their commitment to shore up oil markets globally, and even cajoled Iraq, Nigeria and other laggards to fulfill their promises to reduce production.Still, hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil could return to the market with Saudi Arabia, together with allies Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, unwinding their additional cutbacks.“Crude oil has run out of steam with the market concluding that all the news and action from OPEC+ was already priced in,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank. Saudi Arabia’s comments on voluntary cuts “added to the turnaround” seen in the market, he said.The OPEC+ cuts and rebounding demand have helped double oil prices since April. China’s crude imports surged to a record high last month, while consumption in other major economies such as India is improving.Following the extension deal on Saturday, Saudi Arabia pressed on by increasing some crude prices by the most in at least two decades. The hikes erased almost all of the discounts the kingdom made during its brief price war with Russia, with the steepest increases hitting July exports to Asia.But, a sustained rebound in prices may be hampered by deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing, or returning supplies in the U.S. and Libya.Libya’s biggest oil fields are gradually resuming production after a five-month shutdown due to civil war. Output will start at an initial 30,000 barrels a day at Sharara and it will take three months to return to full capacity, according to National Oil Corp. Supply from El-Feel also restarted on Sunday, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation.Meanwhile, as OPEC met virtually over the weekend, Tropical Storm Cristobal was swirling over the Gulf of Mexico.

Hydrogen fuel cell company Ballard Power Systems Inc. is second with a 75 per cent gain.These tech stars may not have a catchy acronym like FAANG in the U.S., BAT in Asia or even WAAAX in Australia but investors have flocked to these names due to their stronger growth outlook compared with other sectors during the coronavirus pandemic.“There’s a view that the pandemic should actually help accelerate tech adoption in a bunch of different areas because ultimately technology is one of the only ways to mitigate some of the impact of the pandemic,” Thanos Moschopoulos, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said by phone.Kinaxis has become “especially topical” given its supply chain management software can help companies track global shipments amid the havoc caused by COVID-19, and to help mitigate the challenges, Moschopoulos said.Last month, the Ottawa-based company reported a 15 per cent increase in revenue and maintained its 2020 guidance, which included a sales forecast that’s about 10 per cent to 12 per cent higher than 2019.With the bulk of its revenues coming from the U.S. mortgage industry, low interest rates are keeping things busy for Real Matters. The Markham, Ontario-based provider of network services for the mortgage and insurance industries has seen increased refinancing volumes as central banks cut rates to pump financial markets with liquidity during the global recession.Sky-high valuations suggest things may be moving too fast, too soon. The price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P/TSX Info Tech Index is about double the five-year average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“There’s an argument to be made that because interest rates are where they are, at record low levels, that dynamic justifies higher valuations. Tech on a relative basis is looking better than a lot of other sectors,” Moschopoulos said.Still, recent price action in North American stock markets suggest investors are shifting away from tech and into more cyclical sectors as confidence in the recovery builds. Unexpectedly strong jobs data from Canada and the U.S. on Friday amplified this theme.At about 9 per cent of the Canadian benchmark, the tech sector’s impact is still small compared to the nation’s banks, miners and energy companies.So while their shares have surged this year, helping offset some of the losses on the S&P/TSX Composite, the benchmark remains in the red for the year — for now.Bloomberg.com"

Can its crown prince fix his mistakes?,Bloomberg Opinion: The combination of Mohammed bin Salman's war with COVID-19 crisis has left kingdom facing steepest contraction in a generation,https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/can-saudi-arabias-crown-prince-fix-his-mistakes,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mbs.jpg,"June 7, 2020 2:02 AM EDT","By Bobby GhoshHis hand over his heart — a gesture as common to the Middle East’s princes as to its paupers — Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman might admit that he bears at least as much responsibility as the coronavirus pandemic for the state of Saudi Arabia’s economy. It is, after all, the combination of his ill-timed oil war against Russia with the COVID-19 crisis that has left the kingdom facing the steepest contraction in a generation.Although relatively few Saudis have contracted the virus, the substantial economic damage will likely force the crown prince to make deep cuts to his “Vision 2030” plan.The centrepiece for an ambitious agenda of economic and social reforms, that plan was conceived in the throes of the last oil slump. Its goal was to wean Saudi Arabia from its dependence on hydrocarbons and create more opportunity for private enterprise. But four years on, more than 60 per cent of government revenue still comes from oil, and low prices have halved the take.MBS, as the crown prince is commonly known, has ordered austerity measures — most prominently, the tripling of the value-added tax and cuts to bureaucrats’ allowances. But these will sharpen the economic downturn by reducing consumption and inhibiting private-sector investment. In turn, this will compound the frustrations of unemployed Saudis, the majority of them women, who had been promised a shot at prosperity in the prince’s vision of the country’s economic future.The harsh realities facing Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler come on top of problems that have bedevilled him since he emerged from relative obscurity five years ago, when his father’s coronation gave him his first taste of real power. They will compound the challenges of ruling a petrostate with a growing population and diminishing wealth. As he prepares to guide his country through the post-pandemic period, his chances of a prosperous and peaceful reign depend on his ability to undo some of the damage he has himself wrought, and to avoid repeating his mistakes.The portents allow for little optimism: As headstrong as he is young, MBS has demonstrated little interest in, much less capacity for, changing his ways. But the past few months have served up important lessons he’d do well to heed.Perhaps the most sobering of these is that he can no longer take for granted the Saudi-American relationship. A bullying April phone call from President Donald Trump forced him to end the oil war. It also revealed the limitations of MBS’s strategy of courting America’s First Family while disregarding growing hostility in Congress. If that wasn’t the mug of cold water in the face he needed, the removal of two Patriot missile batteries one month later should have been a bucket: Only seven months had passed since a missile and drone attack, most likely by Iranian proxies in Yemen, cut the kingdom’s oil output by half.Scarier still, the withdrawal of American defences comes just as Iran hopes to buy more sophisticated weapons, with other world powers eager to sell. MBS might reflect that this was hardly an opportune moment to pick a fight with Russia, which is determined to block U.S. efforts to extend an arms embargo on the Islamic Republic.Nor can he hold out much hope of a change of heart in Washington with a change of occupant in the White House. Democratic candidate Joseph Biden seems inclined to mend fences with Iran.The corollary to the loss of unstinting American support is the need for friends closer to home. Of the eight countries with which Saudi Arabia has land borders, relations with two — Yemen and Qatar — are hostile; with two others, Oman and Iraq, they are cool to frosty. If much of this is MBS’s doing, much is also within his power to fix.The embargo on Qatar, possibly the crown prince’s most egregious foreign-policy misstep, is easily lifted. MBS should be able to overcome any resistance from the other prime mover in that feud, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi. After all, their close friendship didn’t stop the latter from extricating himself from the war in Yemen. In Oman, the crowning of a new sultan offers the prospect of warmer ties, if MBS is willing.Relations with Yemen and Iraq are fraught, not least because of Iran’s malevolent pot-stirring. But the pandemic has allowed for a ceasefire in Yemen, and the new prime minister in Baghdad is no Tehran puppet.Beyond the Arabian Peninsula, Saudi Arabia’s relations with developing countries hinge on its ability to hand out loans or largesse, which its reduced economic circumstances will now constrain. Chancy investments by the Saudi wealth fund don’t buy much goodwill — or economic soft power, come to that.In much of the developed world, MBS will struggle to shake off the ghost of Jamal Khashoggi, the murdered Washington Post columnist. Even in the middle of a pandemic, a fresh European chorus of condemnation greeted efforts by the Saudi wealth fund to buy an English soccer club, and again when Khashoggi’s family in Riyadh announced that it was forgiving his killers. The lesson for the crown prince is that, in the social-media age, efforts to move on from a controversy — by, say, a Saudi court’s exoneration of MBS’s close associate — can often have the opposite effect.Such backfires may not matter much within Saudi Arabia, where the media is tame and criticism easily cowed. But even there MBS faces a new challenge: How to preserve his popularity with ordinary Saudis while imposing the harshest austerity measures they have ever endured.Citizens asked to moderate their lifestyles might look askance at the extravagance of their leaders — especially those who keep a US$450-million Leonardo da Vinci painting in their US$320-million superyacht. Businessmen struggling with high taxes and lower consumption might ask why the state wealth fund is trying to buy Newcastle United, instead of pumping life-saving investments into the Saudi private sector.Nor can MBS count on civil-society organizations to serve as a salve — or a pressure valve — for the public. He has jailed many of the country’s best-known social activists, and allows few outlets for free discourse. In addition to the traditional means of stifling dissent, new methods like social-media harassment have been brought to bear against critics.Public dissatisfaction with economic conditions can also feed dissent in high places, and embolden foreign critics. European lawmakers, for instance, are pressuring the Saudi government to release one of MBS’s cousins, Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz; along with his father, he has been held without charge for two years. A lobbying firm in Washington has started a campaign for the prince’s release.There’s also a quieter effort on behalf of Saad Aljabri, a former top intelligence official in self-imposed exile since 2017. Saudi security forces have reportedly arrested two of his children and one of his brothers, hoping to coerce him to return home. Aljabri is highly regarded in Western intelligence circles, and especially in Washington.Under MBS, Riyadh has responded disproportionally to such pressure. Two summers ago, when Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland expressed concern over the arrests of Saudi activists, MBS suspended diplomatic ties and new trade deals with Canada. Under the current economic circumstances, he is unlikely to impose trade restrictions on Europe.Domestic resentments won’t yet lead to anything like a revolution. MBS’s control over the state’s security apparatus makes his position virtually impregnable. But as the austerity regime drags on, his image as a popular prince at home will be hard to sustain. The same goes for any lingering hope he may have of being seen as a great reformer abroad.That this should happen in 2020 must be especially galling: This was to be a year of international triumph for MBS, culminating with the leaders’ gathering of the Group of 20 nations in Riyadh for their annual summit in November. Although King Salman is nominally the host, it was expected to be the crown prince’s show.At the G20 summit in Osaka last summer, President Donald Trump spared Mohammed bin Salman’s blushes by praising his “spectacular” leadership, and ignoring calls to hold Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler accountable for Khashoggi’s murder. Relations between the president and the prince may have turned sour since then, but MBS likely hopes that Trump will again save him from embarrassment as he did in Osaka. In Riyadh, the assist will be indirect: The result of the U.S. presidential election will dominate all discussions at the margins of the gathering, saving the prince from unwelcome attention.But as the Arab world’s most important leader, the crown prince can’t evade the spotlight for long. Saudis adjusting to post-pandemic realities will be looking to MBS to guide them through the most difficult period in their country’s recent history, and the wider world will be watching to see if he can redeem himself.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Bobby Ghosh is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

While overall unemployment improved in May, the rate for African Americans ticked up to 16.8 per cent.His comments came as the president spoke extemporaneously, heralding a jobs rebound amid the coronavirus pandemic, with payrolls rising 2.5 million in May after falling 20.5 million in April in the largest drop on record.Trump has grappled with how to respond to Floyd’s death — he’s condemned it and the officers involved, but also tried to snuff out protests demanding justice, police accountability and action to address racial inequality. Trump has no plans to attend Floyd’s funeral Tuesday in Houston.Really Big Jobs Report. Great going President Trump (kidding but true)!Trump has threatened to deploy active-duty forces to combat protesters in U.S. cities, drawing rebukes from political leaders in both parties. He later faced a direct challenge to his leadership from his current and former defence secretaries, who issued a pair of rare public dissents questioning the president’s threat to use military force.Religious leaders and politicians in both parties condemned Trump for allowing protesters to be violently dispersed from Lafayette Square in front of the White House on Monday before he walked to a historic church to hold a Bible in front of cameras.Trump’s approval rating has slipped 2.5 points in the week and a half since Floyd died in the custody of a Minneapolis police officer who knelt into his neck for nine minutes.The president’s average approval rating in the RealClearPolitics average fell to 42.8 per cent Thursday, its lowest point since November, when damning revelations of his involvement in the Ukraine scandal emerged. His impeachment by the House and eventual acquittal in the Senate gave his approval a temporary bump.Before the pandemic, the job losses it triggered and the death of Floyd, Trump had been ramping up appeals to black voters. He frequently claimed he’d driven black unemployment rates to the lowest levels in U.S. history.The president has long struggled with addressing issues of race. In 2017, he said there were “very fine people” on both sides of a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that erupted in violence and left one person dead.

Google Search is free for users, but the company’s lead helps it charge thousands of businesses high prices for ads that run above the free web listings in results. Last year, that business generated almost US$100 billion in revenue.“We continue to engage with the ongoing investigations led by the Department of Justice and Attorney General Paxton, and we don’t have any updates or comments on speculation,” a Google spokeswoman said. In the past, the company has said that online competition is just a click away.The Federal Trade Commission previously investigated whether Google stifled competition in the market for online search advertising, but it closed the probe in 2013 after the company agreed to relatively minor changes. However, portions of communications between FTC commissioners and staff later showed that staffers recommended bringing an antitrust lawsuit against Google.Weinberg said the questions he has fielded recently about requiring Google to present users of its tech alternatives to its own search engine suggest that’s something the government could include in a possible future settlement.“That’s one direction we think has a decent probability,” he added. The Justice Department declined to comment. Attorneys general in Utah and Iowa didn’t respond to requests for comment.In Europe, Google was fined a record US$5 billion for antitrust violations in 2018. As part of that ruling, the company is required to give consumers using phones that run its Android operating system a choice of different search engines and web browsers. Competing services must bid in an auction to be included in a “choice screen.”“Could this be a precursor to similar changes in the U.S.?” Mark Shmulik, Toni Sacconaghi and other analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note to investors earlier this week.Europe’s remedy has gone through various iterations and some rivals have argued that having to pay to be included in the choice screen is unfair.Ecosia, a not-for-profit search engine based in Germany, boycotted the auction. DuckDuckGo participated in the most recent auction, but said it may not be able to compete if prices rise.“This auction remedy, proposed by Google, was constructed to make Google money, not to provide meaningful consumer choice,” DuckDuckGo said in a blog post last week.It suggested scrapping the auction and said that an unpaid “search preference menu” has increased competition already in Russia. In 2010, Microsoft created a successful browser preference menu without an auction where the top five web browsers by market share appeared randomly, DuckDuckGo said.“While our view is that users are unlikely to switch search engines, Yandex grew their search engine share by 2,000 basis points to 58% in three years following a similar ruling in Russia,” Bernstein’s Shmulik wrote in the recent Bernstein note to investors.If the U.S. incorporates these suggestions, it could bypass Europe as the most successful regulator of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Weinberg said.”The U.S. gets criticized for being behind Europe but in reality what’s happened in Europe hasn’t worked,” the CEO added. “The U.S. not only can do it right from the start but has the opportunity to leapfrog the EU.”Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Bloomberg News,Costco and Warren Buffett were made for each other — he should buy it,Costco’s market value right now is $137 billion — precisely the amount of cash in Buffett’s war chest,https://business.financialpost.com/investing/costco-should-be-warren-buffetts-next-bulk-purchase-2,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/buffett.jpg,"June 5, 2020 11:20 AM EDT","Warren Buffett says “nothing can stop America.” To put his money where his mouth is and spend some of his US$137 billion stash before this crisis is over, he wouldn’t have to look far. If there’s one company that warrants the dealmaker’s attention, it may be Costco Wholesale Corp., a retailer in which Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. already owns a stake.At Berkshire’s virtual shareholder meeting last month, Buffett signalled that the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t afforded him deal opportunities at bargain-basement prices the way past economic meltdowns have. Despite the nationwide shutdowns that are just starting to lift and a soaring unemployment rate, the S&P 500 Index is only 8 per cent off its February all-time high. That’s partly due to aggressive actions taken by the Federal Reserve to mitigate the crisis, though one can’t deny that there exists an astonishing disconnect between stock prices and the economic realities of many Americans right now.Costco wouldn’t be a typical crisis-era bet for Buffett in this regard. The shares are up, not down, this year and its operations have carried on throughout the pandemic. Zoom, Netflix, TikTok, Costco — the retailer is right up there with those services that have become centerpieces of the stay-at-home recession.But in so many other ways a Costco deal would still be classic Buffett. For starters, Buffett already likes Costco. Berkshire has owned the stock for two decades; its 1 per cent stake is valued at about US$1.3 billion currently. Buffett’s business partner Charlie Munger, the 96-year-old vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, also sits on Costco’s board. Last year, Buffett even publicly marvelled at Costco’s in-house Kirkland brand, which at that point had US$39 billion of annual sales. “Here’s somebody like Costco, establishes a brand called Kirkland and it’s doing US$39 billion — more than virtually any food company,” including Kraft Heinz Co., he said. Berkshire is Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholder.Costco has proven during this crisis that it has a durable brand and a wide competitive moat, two of the key attributes Buffett looks for. More than 90 per cent of Costco’s U.S. club members renew, and globally the rate is nearly as high at 88 per cent. Those warehouse memberships are a predictable source of cash flow, almost akin to Berkshire’s insurance float that Buffett uses to invest. While the majority of Costco’s 787 warehouse clubs are in the U.S. and Canada, it does have locations in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Australia. It’s also expanding in China, offering Buffett exposure to the country’s growing middle class.Costco’s same-store sales have risen 6.5 per cent on average for the last 10 quarters, topping other U.S. mass retailers including Walmart Inc., the parent of Sam’s Club. Costco also generated more than US$1,300 of sales per square foot in fiscal 2019 — more than any of its peers.The share price has gotten a bump from all the panic-shopping, and at 34 times earnings, Costco’s valuation certainly isn’t what Buffett would call cheap. But Costco should continue to fare well in a post-virus America, especially if it leads some residents to ditch cities for suburbs and spend more time at home. After the meat and toilet paper shortages, more shoppers may even turn to bulk-buying to be better prepared for future lockdowns or shortages.The biggest hurdle to a takeover is that Costco’s market value is US$137 billion — precisely the amount of cash Berkshire has available. Berkshire’s last major acquisition was Precision Castparts, a maker of airplane engine parts, for US$37 billion in 2016. After years spent searching for his next target, Buffett signalled recently that his hunt is on hold, suggesting that he thinks the crisis could still get worse before it gets better. “The cash position isn’t that huge when I look at the worst-case possibilities,” he told a stunned audience last month that tuned into the live-streamed annual meeting expecting to hear something a little more upbeat or at least hopeful from the Oracle of Omaha. (1)Berkshire could simply increase its stake in Costco, a stable holding that pays a 70-cent quarterly dividend. But it wasn’t all that long ago that Buffett spoke of the possibility of an acquisition Costco’s size. “If a US$100 billion deal came along that Charlie [Munger] and I really liked, we’d get it done,” he said in May 2018. With Buffett set to turn 90 in August, it would be uncharacteristic to not want to do one last splashy transaction.It also wouldn’t be the first time Berkshire acquired one of its stock holdings. Berkshire owned shares in Precision Castparts before that deal. It also took a stake in the BNSF railroad in 2007 and kept adding to that position until it eventually purchased the whole company. Berkshire’s ownership of Geico even dates back to the 1950s when Buffett first bought shares and as a curious young investor began a serendipitous friendship with the insurer’s former CEO, Lorimer Davidson, as Buffett often retells it.Whether as a takeover candidate or stock pick, Buffett’s best option may be right under his nose.(1)One well-known shareholder, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, even exited its Berkshire position, deciding it can find worthwhile investing opportunities faster than Berkshire can at this rate.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

Manufacturing operations in Canada will bear the brunt of the cutbacks, to be carried out this year, Bombardier said in a release Friday. Overall, the group employs nearly 60,000.Bombardier shares slipped 2.1 per cent at 9:58 a.m. to trade at 47.5 cents. They have fallen more than 75 per cent this year.Two years of selling assets has left Bombardier particularly exposed to the vagaries of the private-jet market amid a wide-reaching recession. Demand in that market is forecast to drop 30 per cent because to the pandemic, Bombardier said. The Montreal-based company said it would give an update on its outlook Aug. 6.“Bombardier must adjust its operations and workforce to ensure that it emerges from the current crisis on solid footing,” the release said.Weakening markets are raising the pressure on recently installed Chief Executive Officer Eric Martel as the company exits its operations in commercial planes and rail equipment.Bombardier burned through US$1.6 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter, with as much as half of that coming from slow orders for planes and trains, temporary factory shutdowns and the inability to deliver aircraft amid government travel restrictions.Bombardier, which got its start building snowmobiles in Quebec in the 1930s, announced the sale of its train unit to Alstom SA in February in the face of more than US$10 billion in debt. The company is seeking to reduce debt to about US$4 billion by the end of this year, it said at the time.The decision to sell its transportation unit to Alstom, valuing the business at US$8.2 billion, remains a key underpinning for its financial risk profile amid the uncertainty of coronavirus, which has disrupted operations and contributes to cash burn that may approach US$3 billion this year, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Geudtner wrote in a note last week.The company saw its junk bonds rise to their highest levels in about six weeks amid a wider market rebound. Bombardier’s bonds have returned 20 per cent this week and are among the top performers in the Bloomberg Barclays high-yield index, which is up about 2 per cent. Bombardier notes are still down 24 per cent this year.The company’s 6 per cent bonds due 2022 dropped 1 per cent this morning to 77.2 cents on the dollar, trimming the gain this week to 16 cents.

The gains were across most industries and provinces, though largely driven by higher employment in Quebec, the province hardest hit by the pandemic.The numbers echo recent high-frequency data, which had signalled a recovery is underway, with job postings increasing and more Canadians reporting an increase in work at the end of May. They will be a relief to policy makers who had been scrambling to inject hundreds of billions in cash into the economy to keep it afloat. Still, just under 5 million remain without work or substantially reduced hours with the jobless rate at postwar records.“The surprisingly positive readings on employment paint a more optimistic picture of the early part of the recovery, but there’s still a long road back,” Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a research report. “The increase in May only represents 10 per cent of the COVID-19-related job losses and absences that occurred over the prior two months.”The pick up in May follows an unprecedented loss of about 3 million jobs in March and April. More than 2 million employed Canadians continue to experience much lower hours worked than pre-crisis.The unemployment rate ticked up to 13.7 per cent in May, from 13 per cent in April, as people returned to the labour force.Economists in a Bloomberg survey expected a loss of 500,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate rising to 15 per cent.Canada’s currency extended gains on the result, appreciating 0.7 per cent to C$1.3406 against its U.S. counterpart at 9:46 a.m. Toronto time. Yields on two-year government bonds rose 2 basis points to 0.35 per cent.The better-than-expected report suggests the governments programs to cushion the blow to the labour market are working. By mid-May, 179,000 businesses had applied for the government’s 75 per cent wage subsidy program. The pace of applications to Canada’s emergency income benefit program has also decelerated in recent weeks, suggesting the worst of the layoffs and job losses is over.In addition to the employment pick up, Statistics Canada said the number of people who worked less than half their usual hours dropped by 292,000. That means the number of Canadians who have either lost their job or worked substantially fewer hours has fallen to just under 5 million, from about 5.5 million in April. Hours worked rose 6.3 per cent in May from the prior month but were still 23 per cent below February’s levels.The surprise jump reflects the cautious reopening of the economy across provinces. By the time the employment survey was taken from May 10 to May 16, some provinces including B.C., Saskatchewan and Quebec allowed some non-essential businesses to reopen.Quebec accounted for nearly 80 per cent of May’s gains, the statistics agency said. In contrast, Ontario -– where the economy remained largely shut until May 19 –- saw more losses.In the early days of the reopening, employment rebounded more strongly among goods producers, the data show. The goods-producing sector added 165,000 jobs versus 125,000 in services. Lower-wage jobs also rebounded more, particularly in retail trade, accommodation and food services.Demographically, male employment increased more than twice as fast as that for women, consistent with the more rapid increase in the goods-producing industry. Women were among the earliest victims of the COVID-19 related job losses in March and the latest data suggest they are slower to recover as well.“The kinds of jobs that reopened earlier tend to be more male dominated in employment and also that more women don’t know how to get back to work because they don’t know what to do with their kids because schools aren’t open,” said Armine Yalnizyan, a research fellow at the Atkinson Foundation.Women with at least one child under age 6 showed a slower return to work than women with older children. Statistics Canada said it will continue to monitor labourmarket outcomes for men and women with children in the months to come. Youth are still suffering heavily from the COVID-19 economic shutdown. While employment recovered by 30,000 for those aged 15-24, the cumulative job losses for this age cohort are still a whopping 843,000 from February to May.Bloomberg.com"

Support programs meanwhile seem to be in line with the scale of the labor income lost during the crisis.“Naturally, my colleagues on Governing Council and I talked a lot about where we think the economy will go from here,” Gravelle said in a speech that reaffirmed the optimistic tone from the rate decision Wednesday. “And we saw some reasons to be hopeful that the worst can be avoided.”At its decision this week, the central bank pared back estimates of the scale of the downturn, prompting policy makers to wind down some market operations. The central bank also left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.25 per cent, which Gravelle said is “as low as we think we can reduce it without causing problems for the financial system.”The Ottawa-based central bank however has recommitted to maintaining its planned purchases of government bonds until a recovery is “well underway,” with Gravelle reiterating that risks remain and much will depend on how quickly lockdowns are lifted and whether there are any future disruptive waves of COVID-19.“The Bank is prepared to augment the scale of any of its programs if needed to support market functioning,” Gravelle said. “And if further monetary stimulus is required to meet our inflation target, the Bank has tools available to deliver that stimulus.”Ultimately, the future stance of monetary policy will depend on the balance between the demand and supply responses during the recovery — which will determine the outlook for inflation, said Gravelle, while adding the central bank is more worried about deflationary forces.In the lead up to the July rate decision and monetary policy report and beyond, “it will be key for us to understand how the pandemic has affected demand, employment and the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services,” Gravelle said.“Governing Council will continue to ensure we use the right tools for the right job, and that our response is proportional to the level of financial system or economic risk we see,” he said.The bank also said it will be keeping a close eye on what the demand for key Canadian exports will look like in the recovery. “We will be paying close attention to how the pandemic is affecting growth and demand in key markets for Canadian exports.”Bloomberg.com"

The steepening phenomenon is typically a signal of improving growth prospects, and riskier assets such as stocks are certainly rallying. Yet some investors are more wary about what it says about inflation expectations, with U.S. activity merely giving a hint of bottoming out from what’s likely the deepest slump in living memory.The risk that the market is starting to grapple with is that in the pandemic’s wake, stagflation — a troublesome combination of tepid growth and accelerating inflation — takes hold in the years ahead and vexes markets as it did in the 1970s. Cash is flooding into funds that invest in inflation-protected securities, and breakeven rates, another gauge of consumer-price expectations, are ticking back higher.Not that this is all bad, necessarily. The Fed would actually welcome a move away from the deflationary angst that took hold at the peak of the market turmoil in March, as its unprecedented monetary easing is aimed at doing just that. Yet the prospect that inflation will quicken at the same time that job creation sputters is far from ideal. With most bond investors braced for low rates for years to come, the spectre of yields finally taking flight could prove perilous.“The COVID-19 crisis will be remembered for many things, and among them will be the long-awaited return of inflation in developed markets,” said Oliver Harvey, a macro strategist at Deutsche Bank AG.In a world of zero rates, inflation may seem like a distant threat — and those who worry about it are a minority in the market, with inflation prognosticators having been proven wrong time and time again over the past decade. But it may be the side effect of the pandemic cure being administered by central banks and governments.The Fed’s balance sheet alone has swelled above US$7 trillion from about US$4 trillion in early March, and more steps may be coming, such as yield-curve control. Expectations for such a move are contributing to the steepening push.For Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Investments, the Fed’s programs propping up the corporate bond market will lead companies to become even more leveraged, reducing productivity and crimping growth.Corporations’ reliance on Fed support means the central bank will “have to continue providing liquidity to the system until inflation rates pick up to levels that probably would be viewed as unacceptable by most participants of the Fed today,” Minerd said on Bloomberg TV Wednesday. The long-run implication is “a period of stagflation.”The steepening yield curve, coming as equities are surging, looms large on the radar of Kathryn Kaminski, chief research strategist and portfolio manager at AlphaSimplex Group. For her, it warns of growing concern about inflation, a topic she says she’s hearing more buzz about.“My apocalypse scenario — whether or not it can happen — in terms of where we are positioned now is clearly stagflation,” she said. “That would be a reversal of all the trends we’ve been following. I don’t think it’s a short-term scenario, but that’s the scary long-term one.”My apocalypse scenario — whether or not it can happen — in terms of where we are positioned now is clearly stagflationThe result would be equities remaining on the front foot initially as the economy reflates, then heading lower, bond prices falling, commodities rising and dollar weakness, she said.The last time stagflation gripped the U.S. in the late 1970s, 30-year yields eventually doubled in a matter of years, on their way to a record high above 15 per cent in the early 1980s. The long bond yields about 1.55 per cent now, up from a historic low of just under 0.7 per cent reached in March.Others are more sanguine about growth, but still see the makings of inflation as global supply chains get clogged.Telltale signs can be seen in the latest data. Alongside the record decline in a key measure of U.S. consumer prices in April, the cost of food at home surged 2.6 per cent from the prior month, the most since 1974, as Americans stocked up at grocery stores. In the U.K., pet food at one point jumped 26 per cent on an annualized basis, according to Deutsche Bank calculations.Fiscal and monetary policy stimulus “in and of itself has a very, very important inflationary dynamic to it,” said Jeffrey Rosenberg, a portfolio manager of BlackRock’s Systematic Multi-Strategy Fund. He sees inflation as a risk starting in about six months, and one that will be marked by a steepening curve.“The COVID crisis is first and foremost a massive, massive supply shock” which then “had morphed into a massive, massive demand shock,” he said.Even as the curve steepens, market proxies for inflation projections show investors foresee U.S. consumer prices below 2 per cent for decades, although they’re well above their March lows. Forward inflation swap rates in the U.S. and the eurozone, favoured by policy makers for long-run inflation expectations, have also rebounded yet remain below long-term averages.BlackRock Inc.’s US$20 billion iShares TIPS ETF added more than US$700 million last month, the most in more than two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.U.S. inflation markets are too pessimistic, says Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Corp.“The market’s view should be intolerable at the Fed,” Cabana said. “They will have to be credible in keeping rates low to generate upside inflation risk premium. That could be highly inflationary.”He’s advising clients to wager that the gap between five- and 30-year yields will widen as a way to hedge that risk.Structurally, decades of globalized supply chains that stifled inflation may be at an impasse, with economists buzzing about the potential for what’s known as re-shoring and the resulting depressed global economy. For Yale University economist Stephen Roach, this backdrop combined with the growing debt pile bodes for higher inflation in the years ahead.“When you couple the trend of offshoring to re-shoring with a likely resurgence of pent-up consumer demand if we get a vaccine, you have a lethal combination of higher costs,”‘ said Roach, who famously warned about the U.S. housing bubble more than a decade ago at Morgan Stanley, among other bearish predictions.“And the job destruction occurring is set to be a lasting feature of this post-COVID world,” he said. “Without labour income from employment, the recovery is going to fall short and that is the stag part of the stagflation scenario.”Bloomberg.com"

It didn’t say how long the freeze would last to “avoid building unrealistic expectations.” Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corp. have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases in March, according to people familiar with the matter.Bloomberg.com"

Toronto-Dominion Bank had the largest increase at 29 per cent, while Bank of Nova Scotia remained the biggest lender with $21.6 billion in loans.The banks’ rising exposure comes as impaired energy loans almost doubled, topping $2 billion. Energy firms have been hard hit this year as global oil prices plummeted, with some grades even briefly turning negative in April as measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus hammered worldwide demand.“We’re clearly seeing the impact of price wars and supply-demand considerations, storage considerations beginning to play havoc on some producers,” Toronto-Dominion Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said in a May 28 interview. “In the last few weeks we’re watching prices recover with some degree of hope that things will continue to get better here.”With the price plunge making much of their output unprofitable, Canadian oil and gas producers have taken steps to conserve cash. They’ve reduced production, cut operating costs, slashed at least $8.5 billion in planned capital spending and tapped credit lines to help them weather the downturn.Those drawdowns were the main reason for the 22 per cent increase in energy lending at Royal Bank of Canada, according to CFO Rod Bolger.“The growth was driven by higher draws on existing facilities and we did make select new lending facilities to existing investment-grade clients where the risk-return was appropriate given the low oil prices,” Bolger said in a May 27 interview.Most of Royal Bank’s exposure is to exploration and production companies and loans are secured by the value of proven and producing reserves, Bolger said. Still, the Toronto-based lender had the highest gross impaired loans among the Canadian banks, at $664 million.Bank of Montreal posted the second-highest total for impaired energy loans, at $616 million.“In our oil and gas portfolio we do have some signs of stress just given the weaker price of oil that we’ve seen over the last few months — it’s not totally new and we’re managing through it,” CFO Tom Flynn said in an interview. “We’ve done this before as a bank and we’re confident in our ability to manage through this stress that the industry is in.”Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CFO Hratch Panossian said he is seeing more downgrades and impairments in the oil-and-gas sector, reflecting price weakness, but called the bank’s energy portfolio “relatively stable.”“Only about half of it is in the exploration and production space and our clients do have some hedging as well that protects them in the short term,” Panossian said in a May 28 interview. “We remain comfortable with the space. Our clients are strong and managing through this and we’re committed to continuing to support them.”While bank figures show increased borrowing, many producers are seeing the total amount of credit available reduced. That’s particularly true of producers’ reserve-based credit lines, which are tied to the value of their oil-and-gas reserves and are adjusted regularly to account for current prices.This year’s first adjustment period, known as redetermination, is going on now, and early results show banks have been shrinking those credit lines in response to falling prices.At least five Canadian oil-and-gas producers have announced results of their redeterminations, and all have had their credit lines cut. Notably, oilsands producer Athabasca Oil Corp. had its credit facility reduced by 65 per cent to $42 million, while natural gas driller NuVista Energy Ltd. saw its line cut by 14 per cent to $475 million.At least seven producers have extended the date on their redetermination processes to June 30 because of volatile prices. Five of those have had their available credit reduced on an interim basis before the final evaluation is competed.“The best-case scenario for our junior E&P companies this year is likely a small reduction in credit capacity, a slightly higher cost to borrow, and the ability to continue to act autonomously from the influence of its banks,” Stifel FirstEnergy analyst Cody Kwong said in a note.Bloomberg.com"

From a year ago, prices rose 3 per cent in May to an average $863,599 from a year ago, the data show.“While the public health and economic concerns surrounding COVID-19 continue to impact the housing market, the May sales result represented a marked improvement over April,” TRREB President Michael Collins said in a statement. “Providing we continue to see a gradual reopening of the economy, it is very possible that home sales will continue to improve in the coming months.”Greater Vancouver’s real estate board reported on Tuesday that homes sales jumped an unadjusted 34 per cent in May from April, with prices little changed on the month. The benchmark price rose 2.9 per cent to $1.03 million from a year ago.The pandemic brought Canada’s real estate industry to a virtual standstill from mid-March through the end of April as public health authorities restricted activity and open houses were curtailed.The impacts of COVID-19 could still be seen in Greater Toronto in May. Sales fell almost 54 per cent from a year ago. Still, that was an improvement from the 67 per cent plunge in April from a year ago.Benchmark home prices were unchanged from April to May on an unadjusted basis, at $870,000, according to TRREB data. The average selling price of a detached home fell 0.9 per cent to C$1.03 million from a year ago, while condos jumped 6 per cent to $625,445.“The housing sector will be a key driver of growth as consumer confidence increases and more households look to take advantage of very low borrowing costs,” TRREB Chief Executive Officer John DiMichele said in the statement.Bloomberg.com"

The suit includes claims for invasion of privacy and violations of federal wiretapping law.Google is up front with consumers that whenever they opt for private browsing, other websites may still collect information, spokesman Jose Castaneda said.“We strongly dispute these claims and we will defend ourselves vigorously against them,” Castaneda said in an email.The case was filed by Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, a high-profile litigation firm that previously defended Uber Technologies Inc. when the ride-hailing firm was accused three years ago by Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving unit of stealing trade secrets.According to the suit, the company collects information, including IP addresses and browsing histories, whenever users visit web pages or use an app tied to common Google services, such as Google Analytics and Google Ad Manager. This has helped Google amass a nearly unending trove of data that could be stolen or hacked by governments and criminals, the consumers allege.A consumer suit accusing Google of illegally tracking and storing geolocation data with its mobile apps and operating system was thrown out by a California federal judge in December. Arizona’s attorney general filed a similar complaint last month. Google disputed the claim and said it’s looking forward to setting the record straight.Tuesday’s case is Brown v.

Treasury yields edged higher and the dollar slumped.The S&P 500 Index eked out a small gain, with advances for automakers and banks. The gauge had dipped earlier after Chinese government officials told agricultural companies to pause purchases of some American farm goods including soybeans, threatening a hard won trade deal. Gilead Sciences Inc. fell after its drug remdesivir showed only a limited benefit in a large trial.Other risk assets showed signs of resilience, with metals and emerging-market equities advancing along with shares in Europe and Asia.Investors mostly looked past the weekend of violent protests across major U.S. cities, highlighting what many see as the disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street.

Chinese buyers have also canceled an unspecified number of U.S. pork orders, one of the people said. Private companies haven’t been told to halt imports, according to one of the people.The halt is the latest sign that the hard-won phase-one trade deal between the world’s two biggest economies is in jeopardy. While Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last month reiterated a pledge to implement the agreement that was inked in January, tensions have continued to escalate since then amid a standoff over Beijing’s move to tighten its grip on Hong Kong.Beijing’s move eroded the risk-on sentiment that had been prevailing over markets. S&P 500 Index futures gave up gains to trade 0.6 per cent lower, while U.S. 10-year bonds erased declines. The onshore yuan reversed its advance, while soybean futures in Chicago, which had been as much as 1 per cent higher, were little changed.The measures to halt imports come after President Donald Trump on Friday lobbed a barrage of criticism at Beijing after it moved to impose controversial new national security legislation on Hong Kong. Critics say it will crack down on dissent and undermine the “one country, two systems” principle that has kept Hong Kong autonomous of the mainland since the 1997 handover from the British.Cofco and Sinograin are China’s key importers of farm goods. They had been making pricing inquiries for 20 to 30 cargoes of U.S. soybeans on Friday but held off on going through with purchases after Trump indicated he would punish Chinese officials, one of the people said. Beijing is waiting to see what steps Trump takes before deciding its next move, one of the people said.Nobody from the commerce ministry responded to a fax seeking comment. Officials from Sinograin and Cofco also didn’t respond to calls.Trump said the U.S. would begin the process of stripping some of Hong Kong’s privileged trade status, without detailing how many changes would take effect and how many exemptions would apply. He also promised sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials “directly or indirectly involved” in eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy, though stopped short of giving specifics.Equity investors had reacted positively to Trump’s remarks, as he didn’t provide any details or time-frame for what actions might come next. It’s unclear how soon the U.S. would move on a range of options, from sanctioning Chinese officials to imposing tariffs on Hong Kong to attacking the territory’s financial stability.While Trump has periodically threatened to call off the “phase one” trade deal, his top economic advisers have suggested it would continue. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Thursday that the trade agreement “does continue to go on for the moment and we may be making progress there.”The two sides have traded blows over a range of issues from the coronavirus to Taiwan in recent weeks, and China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned during high-profile legislative meetings in Beijing that some in America were pushing relations to a “new Cold War,” and urged the U.S. to give up its “wishful thinking” of changing China.China had agreed to buy U.S. farm goods worth about $36.5 billion for 2020 as part of the phase-one trade deal signed in January. However, the coronavirus outbreak roiled those plans, with China only managing to import $3.35 billion in American agricultural products in the first three months of the year, the lowest for that period since 2007, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Still, as China started to gradually reopen its economy from the virus-led lockdown, it had increased its pace of imports, including a more-than 1-million ton cargo of American soybeans in just two weeks in May, and rare purchases of U.S. soybean oil and ethanol.But then tensions between the U.S. and China began escalating, with Trump blaming the Asian nation for misleading the world about the scale and risk of the coronavirus outbreak. The fallout filtered through to the commodities markets, with China opting to buy Brazilian soy instead of American beans.Bloomberg.com"

We want to do whatever we can to minimize any second or third wave of this virus.”At least 24 companies will tell their employees to work remotely including all of Canada’s six biggest banks, Manulife Financial Corp., Sun Life Financial Inc., Rogers Communications Inc., PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Ryerson University.Big banks and other companies in financial centers across the world are making plans for some employees to return to the office as the pandemic eases. JPMorgan Chase & Co. expects to keep its offices half full at the most for the “foreseeable future” and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is reopening its Paris office with a maximum of 20 per cent of staff allowed in on any given day. Citigroup Inc. is considering leasing offices in New Jersey and New York suburbs. Its chief executive said the bank plans to bring workers back to the office when the pandemic ends.The Toronto region has been one of Canada’s trouble spots for the virus, but the situation has been improving of late. The city has reported 10,901 cases with 810 fatalities since the start of the outbreak. To date, 8,086 have recovered which is an increase of 142 since Thursday.“Telecommuting, phasing in employees return to work, and staggering start times where possible, will help businesses to maintain physical distancing,” Tory said, in particular by reducing the risk of crowding on the city’s subway system. Ridership on the Toronto Transit Commission has plunged 80 per cent since the lockdown began, he said. Prior to this, the system saw 1.8 million trips per weekday.Toronto-Dominion Bank, which has operations on both sides of the border, sent out a memo to Canadian and U.S. employees Friday afternoon with return-to-work guidance.“Given the fluid situation, the majority of you who currently work from home will continue to for some time — at least until September, and possibly longer,” Kenn Lalonde, executive vice-president of human resources, said in the memo.Bank of Nova Scotia Chief Human Resources Officer Barb Mason told Canadian employees in a memo earlier Friday that governments across Canada are asking major employers for support in a gradual and proactive approach to reopening.“By staggering the flow of people back into city centers, this will help maintain physical distancing and reduce pressure on public transit as more businesses resume operations,” she said in the memo. “As such, for those employees in head office and regional offices currently working remotely, you will continue to do so until September at the earliest.”Downtown Toronto has become a ghost town since shutdowns to stem the spread of the virus were put in place in early March. Tory said in mid-April that a three-month shutdown and six-month recovery period will cost the city about $1.5 billion in a “best-case” scenario.“This economic restart cannot stall. It must not stall for the benefit of Torontonians and our city and our country,” Tory said.Bloomberg.com"

Economists had anticipated a 10 per cent decline. The agency also released preliminary estimates for April that show an 11 per cent plunge in output, versus the 7.2 per cent drop in March when coronavirus restrictions were first imposed halfway through the month.As bad as the numbers are, the better-than-expected data suggest the country may be able to avoid the most dire scenarios, helped by a flood of government transfers into the economy.“Overall, the economy has likely troughed at least for now, with businesses beginning to reopen,” Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a report to investors. “Look for the economic data to begin showing signs of revival over the summer months, even if it only represents the low-hanging fruit of eased restrictions.”The second quarter likely won’t be worse than the 40 per cent annualized decline that CIBC is forecasting, Mendes said.According to Bank of Montreal’s Doug Porter, Canada’s first quarter contraction is right in the middle of the pack among Group of Seven countries, better than all three eurozone countries but worse than the U.S., Japan and the U.K.“The new news here is that the figures were a little less dire than feared,” Porter said in a report.The historic decline in the first half of 2020 has been anticipated. The focus is shifting to how quickly and to what extent the economy will recover. Most economists expect a slow recovery as long as consumers remain hesitant to resume normal activities, at least until a vaccine is available.The Canadian dollar was little changed after the report, trading at C$1.3768 against the U.S. dollar at 9:12 a.m. in Toronto trading. Two-year government bond yields dropped 2 basis points to 0.29 per cent.Friday’s report showed the downturn was broad-based, with household spending falling 9 per cent annualized, the most on record. The drop in consumption accounted for 5 percentage points of the 8.2 per cent annualized drop. Businesses scaling back inventories accounted for another 2 percentage points.The pullback from the consumer was also evident in a surge in the savings rate to 6.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. That’s the highest since 2001.Even though hundreds of thousands of Canadians lost jobs in the first quarter, household disposable income was up, reflecting an increase in government transfers. Canadians didn’t spend those transfers however, putting them toward savings.Non-residential business investment came in much stronger than expected, recording just a 2.7 per cent annualized drop in the first quarter — a better performance than the previous three months when it dropped 4.8 per cent. There was little impact on housing investment, which was little changed in the first quarter.Government spending was weaker, posting a 3.8 per cent annualized drop, the most since 2013, from school closures and curtailed government administration. Exports were also hit considerably in the first quarter, recording an 11.3 per cent annualized drop. But the impact of trade on growth was largely offset by a 10.7 per cent drop in imports.Bloomberg.com"

The higher provisions for credit losses eroded net income in the three months through April, with both companies missing analysts’ earnings estimates.The Canadian banks, like their U.S. counterparts, are building up reserves in anticipation of expected stresses to consumers and companies from the outbreak, which brought the North American economy to a virtual standstill and boosted unemployment on both sides of the border. Loan-loss provisions topped analysts’ expectations of C$8.9 billion for Canada’s six biggest banks.“What we’re living through here is an unprecedented shutdown of large segments of the economy, which is impacting consumers and businesses and customer activity in unprecedented ways,” Toronto-Dominion Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said in an interview Thursday. “We’ve looked at our provisions and applied a good measure of prudence to make sure that we are prepared to weather this pandemic.”Shares of Toronto-Dominion fell 3.1% at 9:40 a.m. in Toronto, and CIBC was down 1.7%. Both lenders have dropped 17% this year, compared with an 18% decrease for the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index.Toronto-Dominion, which has a U.S. branch network that stretches from Maine to Florida, set aside C$1.14 billion for souring loans in the country, compared with C$1.15 billion for its Canadian operations. The higher provisions contributed to a 52% drop in net income, to C$1.52 billion, led by a decline in its U.S. retail division.Investors’ Expectations“TD’s larger-than-expected provision is something most investors want/expect to see at this point,” National Bank of Canada analyst Gabriel Dechaine said in a note to investors Thursday.Adjusted earnings totaled 85 cents a share, missing the 88-cent average estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.CIBC, which has a U.S. banking operation based out of Chicago, set aside more than five times the level of provisions it did a year earlier in the quarter, resulting in a 71% decline in profit, to C$392 million. Adjusted per-share earnings of 94 cents fell short of the C$1.60 average estimate.CIBC’s U.S. commercial banking and wealth management division showed the biggest earnings decline in the quarter, plunging 89% from a year earlier, followed by a 64% decline for Canadian personal and business banking, the Toronto-based lender’s biggest operation.“While economic headwinds are likely to be here for the near term, our client focus and our well-diversified business will allow us to get back to pre-Covid levels of profitability as the recovery takes hold,” CIBC Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig said on a conference call with analysts Thursday.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,” he said Wednesday. In a second tweet, he added: “Just like we can’t let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country.”He didn’t cite any platforms by name, but it was plainly a response after Twitter added a fact-check label to earlier Trump tweets that made unsubstantiated claims about mail-in voting. It’s the first time Twitter has taken action on Trump’s posts for being misleading.Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can’t let a more sophisticated version of that….That move came after a widower asked Twitter to delete Trump’s tweets alleging, without evidence, a conspiracy theory that his late wife had been killed by cable news host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough. Twitter hasn’t taken action on those tweets.Twitter shares fell 1.65 per cent in early trading in New York after Trump’s tweet. Twitter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning.Social media companies such as Twitter, Facebook Inc. and Google’s YouTube have been swept up in recent years in a broader backlash against tech in Washington, state capitals and even Europe.Trump has little authority to shut the businesses, which are also central to his re-election campaign and communications strategy with the public. But they already face a range of potential regulations.Twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them (and their other compatriots) is correct. Big action to follow!White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, side-stepped questions of what measures in particular Trump may take. She said social media helps conservatives skirt the mainstream news media.“The president’s saying please stop suppressing conservative voices,” she said, before criticizing Twitter’s fact check. “I thought using outlets that are decisively and proudly anti-Trump to fact-check the president was maybe the richest piece of the whole thing.”Congress is looking to develop a privacy law that would create more limits around how the companies can use data and what responsibilities they have to consumers regarding that information. The companies are already being regulated under California’s strict new statute on data privacy.Lawmakers from both parties in Washington and the Justice Department are also weighing proposed changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which is prized by online platforms because it protects them from lawsuits for content posted by third parties. Some conservatives have attacked the provision for enabling what they see as the silencing of users’ statements by the companies. The allegations have ramped up during the Trump administration, as the president and his supporters have occasionally clashed with platforms that they nonetheless rely on to spread their messages and grow their following.While the companies largely deny that they are biased and say they have focused on shutting down posts and users engaged egregious conduct such as threats or spreading harmful misinformation, Americans’ constitutional rights to free speech mean that the companies are generally able to set the rules for how their private platforms are run and publish views without government pressure.In addition to questions about privacy and content, Facebook and Google are also the targets of wide-ranging antitrust probes by federal and state law enforcers. Under Trump, the Justice Department, which is among those investigating both companies, has faced allegations that its actions have been politically motivated. The most significant outcome of an investigation, however, such as proposed breakup of the companies, would have to be approved by a court.A congressional panel is also probing competition issues in the tech sector, focusing Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., but not Twitter. It aims to recommend new laws.Bloomberg.com"

The Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book” survey due for release later Wednesday may provide clues on the inflection point for the economy and near-term outlook for jobs. The recent equity rally “is an indication that investors are getting optimistic about the reopening of the economy and the drug-treatment development,” Katerina Simonetti, senior portfolio manager at UBS Private Wealth, said on Bloomberg TV. “We hope that it will eventually lead to a normalization in the market, but we have to keep an eye on the re-emergence of virus cases.”Elsewhere, Japanese equities advanced after Bloomberg reported that the Abe administration is compiling a new 117 trillion yen (US$1.1 trillion) stimulus package.

That represented growth of $17.6 billion, consisting of $12.1 billion in net income from investments and $5.5 billion in new contributions, CPPIB said in a statement Tuesday.The numbers mean Canada’s largest pension find suffered about $15.8 billion in investment losses in the first three months of 2020. The fund had reported $27.9 billion in investment gains for the nine months ended Dec. 31.“Despite severe downward pressure in our final quarter, the fund’s 12.6 per cent return on a 2019 calendar-year basis, combined with the relative resilience of our diversified portfolio, helped cushion the impact,” chief executive Mark Machin said in the statement.The fund’s 10-year and five-year annualized net nominal returns were 9.9 per cent and 7.7 per cent, respectively, which “should give Canadians comfort that, even with periodic shocks, their pensions ultimately draw from decades of steady performance,” Machin said.The fund’s 3.1 per cent investment gain outperformed its benchmark portfolio’s 3.1 per cent loss, which equates to a value-added return of $23.4 billion for the year, after deducting all costs, the fund said.CPPIB is designed to serve contributors and beneficiaries for decades, so long-term results are a more appropriate measure of performance than quarterly or annual cycles, the fund said.“The COVID-19 pandemic poses a massive challenge for health, societies and economies globally. Amid the significant number of concerns many Canadians have today, the sustainability of the fund is one thing they shouldn’t worry about,” Machin said.The fund’s holdings of Canadian public equities lost 12.2 per cent for the year and emerging markets stocks dropped 9.1 per cent, while foreign stocks generated a return of 1.6 per cent.All credit investments returned 0.5 per cent and real estate returned 5.1 per cent, while infrastructure dropped 1 per cent.

He also criticized the U.S. for slowing its nuclear negotiations with North Korea and warned it not to cross Beijing’s “red line” on Taiwan.The U.S.-China relationship has worsened dramatically in the past few months as America became one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which was first discovered in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The world’s two biggest economies have clashed on a range of issues from trade to human rights, with Beijing’s latest move to tighten its grip on Hong Kong setting up another showdown between U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping.“Some U.S. political forces are taking hostage of China-U.S. relations, attempting to push the ties to the brink of so-called ‘new Cold War,’” Wang said. “This is dangerous and will endanger global peace.”Wang cautioned the U.S. “not to challenge China’s red line” on Taiwan, after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo broke with tradition last week and congratulated the island’s President Tsai Ing-wen on her second-term inauguration. Beijing considers Taiwan a province.“Reunification between the two sides of the Strait is an inevitable trend of history, no one and no force can stop it,” Wang said. China’s defence ministry blasted a U.S. plan to sell torpedoes to Taiwan.And he blamed Washington for the stall in historic negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea, saying China hoped to see continued interaction between the two sides. The comments came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un — who has faced questions about his health — made his first public statement in three weeks, ordering military leaders to increase the country’s “nuclear war deterrence.”“We have seen some positive steps taken by the DPRK in the last few years towards de-escalation and denuclearization,” Wang said. “Regrettably, these steps have not been reciprocated in a substantive way by the U.S. side. This is the main reason for the ongoing stalemate in the DPRK-U.S. dialogue.”Tensions spiked last week after China announced the NPC would write sweeping legislation into Hong Kong law to criminalize the harshest criticism of China and the ruling party. The move drew swift condemnation from pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, who defied virus-related social-distancing measures and rallied in the city center even as Wang spoke.Pompeo called the measure a “disastrous proposal” and indicated that it could lead the U.S. to reconsider Hong Kong’s special trade status.Wang on Sunday repeated China’s stance that Hong Kong affairs were an internal matter and said the principle of non-interference must be upheld by all countries. He didn’t directly address potential U.S. retaliation over the legislation.He also argued that the coronavirus pandemic showed how the world was a “global village” and needed to work together, while repeatedly rejecting foreign criticism of China’s internal affairs.U.S. lawmakers have advanced several pieces of legislation targeting China in recent weeks with bipartisan support amid mounting calls for Beijing to be punished for its alleged failure to disclose information early on about the spread of COVID-19. The virus has cost almost 100,000 American lives and tens of millions of jobs.Xi said Saturday he won’t let China return to its days as a planned economy, pushing back against U.S. criticism that the nation has failed to deliver on promised reforms.“We’ve come to the understanding that we should not ignore the blindness of the market, nor should we return to the old path of a planned economy,” he told political advisers gathered in Beijing, the official Xinhua news agency said.Bloomberg.com"

Their hypothesis is that the coronavirus outbreak will trigger changes, like widespread working-from-home and less overseas travel, reducing consumption permanently.“Could it be peak oil? Possibly. Possibly. I would not write that off,” the head of British oil major BP Plc, Bernard Looney, told the Financial Times.If true, that would have huge implications for climate change as burning less oil would permanently reduce greenhouse emissions, easing the way to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. But Birol warned governments that the coronavirus will only reduce oil demand briefly, with consumption dipping in 2020 to about 91 million barrels a day, before rebounding in 2021 and beyond.“Behavioral changes in response to the pandemic are visible but not all of them are negative for oil use. People are working from home more, but when they do travel, they are more likely to be in cars than public transport,” he told Bloomberg News from Paris. “Videoconferencing will not solve our energy and climate challenges, good government policies might.”Birol is urging governments to use their economic recovery packages to fight climate change, spending on green energy to help to achieve the goals set in the 2016 Paris accord.The more ambitious target set under the Paris climate agreement — limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius — will require annual global emissions to be reduced by about half by 2030 and to hit net-zero around the middle of the century. Without deep structural changes, emissions are expected to rise again when economies recover.The oil industry is making sweeping changes in an effort to adapt itself to the Paris climate goals, with major companies including BP, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA promising to cut emissions significantly and investing more into renewable energy as they come under pressure from more ecologically conscious shareholders. Still campaigners warn the cuts are unlikely to be enough to keep temperatures from raising to dangerous levels.“If there’s a strong economic recovery, American business consultants using Zoom will not compensate for 150 million new urban residents in India and Africa traveling, working in factories and buying products transported by trucks,” Birol said.Birol drew parallels with the 2008-09 crisis, when oil demand also suffered a major annual drop, before consumption increased again. The economic recovery packages didn’t focus back then on green energy and savings, missing an opportunity to tackle the challenge of climate change.The IEA, which advises the world’s richest countries on energy policy, is sticking to its view that global oil demand will continue to increase over the next decade or so, before reaching a plateau around 2030. In a report published in November 2019, the agency said global petroleum consumption was likely to reach about 105 million barrels a day by 2030 and about 106 million by 2040 in the absence of new government policies.In its 2019 long-term analysis, the IEA assumed significant oil savings from the sale of new vehicles over the next two decades. The use of more fuel-efficient engines would knock out 9 million barrels a day of demand, while the growth of electric cars would displace about 4 million a day. But the current economic crisis is likely to reduce car sales for a while, keeping less efficient clunkers on the road.“Fewer car sales means older cars stay on the road,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Ltd. is pursuing as the commercial property firm prepares for a “measured” return of workers to downtown buildings. The company is landlord to some of Canada’s largest banks as the owner of office towers such as TD Centre and RBC Centre.“It’s going to be a gradual but steady climb back to normalcy,” Sal Iacono, Cadillac Fairview’s executive vice-president of operations, said in an interview.Ontario has been easing restrictions on business as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed nearly 2,000 people in the province, finally eases.Office workers should brace for dramatic changes, with numerous precautions to protect them and the public. Cadillac Fairview, owned by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan which oversees 70 properties in Canada including the Toronto Eaton Centre shopping mall, is just one of the city’s large landlords adopting new measures to make returning to work safe.Elevators will have limits of four people and Cadillac Fairview plans to add thin anti-microbial film over the buttons. It’s looking to introduce digital apps so people can schedule their elevator rides instead of waiting in line, Iacono said, “so that you know with certainty that you’re not going to have to wait a long time in order to be able to access your floors.”The company is also working with tenants on ways to stagger start and end times for employees to avoid crowding in lobbies and common areas.“In order to be able to allow the maximum number of people to come into those office buildings, we’re going to have to change our behaviours for a period of time,” Iacono said.Building occupants at Cadillac Fairview office properties will be required to wear non-medical face masks or coverings in elevators and they’ll be “strongly encouraged” to wear them in common areas, including the underground PATH network that links downtown office buildings in Canada’s largest city.Commercial landlords including Brookfield Properties and Oxford Properties Group have already put down social distance markings and signage throughout downtown. But the many bankers, investment managers, accountants and lawyers who typically populate Toronto’s cluster of skyscrapers likely haven’t seen them yet due to weeks of working from home.In the depths of the pandemic shutdown the number of people in office buildings were no more than 5 per cent to 10 per cent of normal levels, Iacono estimated. He got a first-hand look at how the city’s core has become a ghost town a couple weeks ago during a visit to his office by the shuttered Eaton Centre to sign some paperwork.“The mall under normal circumstances has 53 million people a year going through it, so to see Toronto Eaton Centre as empty as it was on the day that I was there was a little dystopian,” he said. “I took the elevator up to my office and we had two people on our floor.”Even with restrictions easing, Iacono doesn’t anticipate a rush back to the office. Ontario has kept schools and daycares closed, which means a slow return for many workers.In markets that have reopened, Iacono is seeing between 15 per cent and 30 per cent of office workers returning at first, with that percentage increasing over time.“I try to dispel the notion that on the first day that the government lifts restrictions in the market that everybody shows up back at the office all at the same time like any normal day pre-COVID,” he said. “That’s not going to be the case.”Bloomberg.com"

The damage will only worsen in April, when strict social distancing measures and the closing of nonessential businesses were in effect for the entire month.Only a limited number of retailers like supermarkets and pharmacies have been allowed to stay open during the crisis, but provinces across Canada have been implementing various phases of reopening this month which should help the sector rebound.“Despite the terrible showings for March and April, the easing of restrictions should lead to some ground being regained from this point on for retailers,” Royce Mendes, an economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a report to clients.Canada’s retail weakness in March was similar to that experienced in the U.S. and other countries. Like Canada, declines in U.S. retail sales were led by motor vehicle and parts dealers and clothing and accessories stores, the report said.Stores that remained open saw a surge in sales, particularly supermarkets. Food and beverage retailers recorded a 23 per cent jump in March. Based on respondent feedback, about 40 per cent of retailers closed their doors during March, Statistics Canada said.In volume terms, which strip out the effects of price changes, March sales fell 8.2 per cent.E-commerce was a bright spot with many Canadian retailers opening or expanded their online platforms in March. Online sales were up 40.4 per cent in March from a year earlier, the agency said.Bloomberg.com"

Riley FBR’s Susan Anderson. “Casual, active, and lounge-wear is what’s selling; pretty much everyone has said that,” she said in a phone interview Thursday.Before the pandemic, Lululemon’s online sales rose 35 per cent in its last full year, and Anderson expects the growth to have accelerated further this quarter. Meanwhile, many of the company’s physical stores remain closed in North America, with some markets beginning to reopen in accordance with local government mandates.BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel agreed Lululemon is an “at-home COVID winner.” But he questioned what that will mean longer term and said the potential risks are not being priced into the stock currently.Stock prices today are dominated by themes, he said in an interview. And right now, people are making purchases in athleisure wear to “recalibrate to their current new norm.” But, do people need to buy more or less fashionable athleisure? Is there a need to have multiple outfits to sit at your desk, home alone? These are among the things Siegel wonders. “When people are working in groups, fashion plays a stronger role, but at home comfort is king.”“It remains to be seen what the financial implications of the pandemic will be, but it seems reasonable to assume the audience of people willing to buy high-priced clothing is not going to get larger,” Siegel said. “The question is: does it stabilize or shrink?”As for the company’s upcoming earnings report, Siegel too is expecting a “strong” online performance. Colour around digital performance and initial store reopenings will be what moves the stock, he said.Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih also told clients in a note that “with core customers working from home, we believe ‘work-at-home wear’ consists of comfortable and casual apparel, and Lulu fits the bill.” Based on her view that there will be an increase in people working from home after COVID-19, she boosted her estimates for next year.Anderson and Yih have buy-equivalent ratings on the stock. Siegel rates it a market perform.Lululemon will host an annual meeting on June 3. Fiscal first-quarter results are expected to be reported in the first half of June.Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Kait Bolongaro and Shelly Hagan,Farmers increasingly desperate as Canada struggles to attract migrant workers,Government measures to lure workers aren't working very well as labourers stay home for fear of contracting COVID-19,https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/migrant-friendly-canada-struggles-to-attract-migrant-farm-staff?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/migrant-workers-1.jpg,"May 21, 2020 5:16 AM EDT","Canada traditionally rolls out the welcome mat for seasonal workers to help on the country’s farms. Now it can’t find enough willing to make the journey.There is scant local interest in farmwork, so Canada’s agriculture sector relies on nearly 60,000 foreign workers to make the journey north each year from countries like Mexico, Jamaica and Guatemala. This year, however, some migrant labourers are deciding to stay home to protect themselves from the coronavirus, resulting in a dearth in essential foreign labour.That leaves Canadian farmers desperate to fill a shortage of workers, despite facing the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. It’s an issue that’s quickly become politicized, with the federal government forced to step in and opposition politicians calling for coronavirus aid programs intended for students and the unemployed to be tied to working in the fields.The government is “exploring additional ways to shore up our domestic labour supply,” said Marielle Hossack, spokeswoman for Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough. “We continue to encourage employers to hire Canadians, and jobs are posted — and continue to be available — for Canadians who are interested.”Even as the COVID-19 fallout forces Canada to reduce its new arrivals targets for immigration, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has implemented measures to try and lure seasonal workers north. They include rolling out exemptions from border closures, easing visa renewals for agriculture workers and providing $50 million (US$36 million) to cover mandatory quarantine costs.It’s still not enough to convince more people to come. Political pressure is mounting to find an alternative labour source locally as Ottawa estimates the shortage at several thousands already with the growing season just beginning.For the four months to the end of April, 22,000 agricultural workers had arrived to take up jobs from the fruit orchards and vegetable fields of British Columbia to the wine-growing region of Niagara in Ontario. Of the 13,000 projected arrivals for the month of April, only 11,000 workers came.Syed Hussan, director at Migrant Workers Alliance for Change in Toronto, said the shortage is being compounded by travel difficulties and public health fears. In many cases the workers’ countries of origin have fewer COVID-19 cases than Canada, and Canadian farms and facilities staffed by migrant workers have witnessed some of the largest workplace outbreaks.Foreign workers say that not all employers are following the government’s health guidelines and they are worried about their health. One worker from Jamaica, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said this time was unlike the previous 12 years he made the journey. Instead of a commercial plane, he took a crammed chartered flight in April without quarantining for the mandatory 14-day period.Foreign workers say that not all employers are following the government's health guidelines and they are worried about their health“This year is very very different from previous because when we arrive this year, we have been told to keep safe of this COVID-19, but complying with all rules and regulations is difficult,” he said.He lives in a house with six other men, sharing a kitchen and bathroom. He says the house doesn’t meet health standards and the men have been relying on a local church to provide food donations. A fruit picker, he says he knows people in Jamaica who decided not to come to Canada out of fear of contracting COVID-19.Stringent workplace health and safety rules need to be in place and enforced to protect workers, according to economist Armine Yalnizyan, who said that they also need the right to refuse work if they feel they may get sick from unsafe practices.“Migrant workers are not allowed to not work — if they don’t work, they get deported,” she said. “But they’re getting sick and they’re not allowed access to care or any kind of income support when they are not working because they are sick.”Twenty-three foreign workers tested positive for COVID-19 at a plant nursery in British Columbia this month, and migrant workers at meat plants in Alberta have been among the confirmed cases.A Mexican worker on a mushroom farm in Ontario said he’s been under more pressure this season due to a shortage of labour both as a result of those not arriving and others who have gotten sick on the job. The farm has reported a number of COVID-19 cases over the past few weeks.The man, who also asked not to be named, lives with five others in a three-bedroom house on the farm. He says the company has given them masks to use for two weeks at a time and has recently implemented temperature testing. If the workers get sick, they have to quarantine at home and do not get paid. He makes $500 a week and uses that income to support his mother, wife and daughter back in Mexico.Migrants rights groups are calling for increased protections for workers, including stricter physical distancing and guaranteed pay if they fall ill. The government says it has already strengthened requirements and will punish employers who don’t comply with new COVID-19 regulations with penalties of up to $1 million and a permanent ban on hiring foreign workers.With some provinces closing their borders to migrant labour entirely, the labour shortage shows no sign of abating. Instead, opposition politicians are pressing the government to tie part of its $9-billion student aid program to agricultural work.Shifting even some of that money away from direct payments to students and on to employers including farms would “provide relief for many of the front-line essential services and jobs for students in return for the money,” said lawmaker Erin O’Toole, who is vying for the leadership of the main opposition Conservative Party.Trudeau’s Liberal government says it encourages unemployed Canadians to work in essential sectors including agriculture. But Nicole Brayiannis, deputy chairperson from the Canadian Federation of Students, says that’s impractical.“A lot of folks take years of training to work up into the positions that they’re in and now just turning to students and saying this is essential work that is available doesn’t make sense,” she said.Meanwhile, the Jamaican fruit picker is dreading harvest season without more support to ease the workload. He earns around $900 every two weeks and works six days per week, sending his pay home to support six family members.“When its reaping time in September, I’m worried,” he said. Fewer workers means more pressure and longer hours to bring in the harvest. “I wouldn’t like this to happen again.”Bloomberg.com"

It kept its outlook negative.Revenue at the Montreal-based carrier is expected to fall 50 per cent to 60 per cent  and it could lose as much as $800 million (US$575 million) in earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization this year. Air Canada said last week it will cut 20,000 jobs.About 70 per cent of the airline’s passenger revenue comes from routes to the U.S. and overseas.WestJet is more focused on domestic travel, which will likely recover before international routes, the agency said. But the Calgary-based airline has a different problem: its exposure to the depressed economy of Western Canada.“Beyond the pandemic, sharply weaker oil prices could have a disproportionate effect on the company’s air traffic,” S&P said in a statement. “This stems from approximately 40 per cent of WestJet’s available seat miles touching down in the province of Alberta, where economic conditions are underpinned by the petroleum industry.”WestJet, which was investment grade before it was taken private in December in a leveraged buyout led by Onex Corp., was downgraded for the second time this year by S&P and is now B- with a negative outlook.Bloomberg.com"

Aside from locking in repeat customers by helping them accumulate trips, airlines sell miles to credit-card companies, banks, hotels and other businesses for billions of dollars. This revenue source is crucial now that the pandemic has thrown aviation into crisis, and airlines are piling in with new offers such as bonus points and lowering thresholds to qualify for more perks.Some are also increasing the number of points members earn from shopping, as well as expanding partnerships so there are more opportunities to rack up miles. That means it should take less effort to secure reward flights or upgrade to business class. Delta Air Lines Inc. is providing four times the usual amount of miles for purchases with American Express cards at U.S. supermarkets, while Etihad Airways PJSC is offering up to US$400 and 5,000 miles for passengers who postpone flights scheduled before July 31 and has points deals for online shopping and cash-back offers with brands including KFC and Pizza Hut.“These programs appeal to a carrier’s very best revenue-producing customers, so there is abundant need to keep these consumers happy,” said Jay Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive who is now president of consultancy IdeaWorksCompany. “In the near term, consumers will see a windfall of cheap travel for redeeming points or miles.”According to a 2017 study by Stifel Financial Corp., airlines can get up to 2.5 cents for every mile, so they are a rich source of liquidity. Banks then benefit from annual charges on credit cards and merchant fees when cards are used.JetBlue Airways Corp. this month sold loyalty points to Barclays Plc for US$150 million. The airline received US$475 million from such deals in 2019, according to Stifel analyst Joe DeNardi. American Airlines Group Inc. got US$4.3 billion and Delta reaped US$4.2 billion last year, he said.American Airlines said Tuesday its AAdvantage loyalty program — “the biggest asset we have in the company” — has a value of as much US$30 billion, and that it is negotiating with the U.S. Treasury Department to use at least part of it as collateral for a multibillion dollar loan. Bloomberg News reported in April that the Treasury Department was in talks with some carriers about accepting loyalty programs as collateral as they rushed to raise funds.Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., which flew just 458 passengers a day in April, is extending Marco Polo memberships and unused mid-tier benefits — access to business-class lounges, for example — by 12 months. United Airlines Holdings Inc. has extended Premier memberships through 2022 and made it easier to qualify for reward flights and earn points. Emirates Airline is letting elite Skywards members maintain their statuses by fulfilling just 70 per cent of their tier travel requirements, as well as giving 20 per cent bonus tier miles. This comes as the world’s biggest long-haul carrier considers thousands of job cuts.“It’s a good thing for consumers and for the airlines,” said Steve Saxon, a Shanghai-based partner at McKinsey & Co. “Being able to earn miles for everyday spending makes flight redemptions much more accessible” and carriers can get revenue for seats that might otherwise go empty, he said.Emirates’ members account for almost 45 per cent of the carrier’s commercial revenue, according to Nejib Ben Khedher, divisional senior vice president of Emirates Skywards. Abu Dhabi’s Etihad says loyalty programs help it “obtain valuable data on each guest which allows us to tailor their experience,” while Singapore Airlines Ltd. does “not take their loyalty for granted.” Singapore Airlines last week reported a record loss. Qatar Airways is offering a so-called status-match with some airlines, and planning new banking and hotel partners.Cheap offers will extend until the end of 2020 for domestic routes and through next spring for longer-haul international routes, Sorensen said. Some airlines may cut down non-travel awards to save cash, or offer discounted business-class seats to loyalty members as companies reduce premium travel, he said.“Loyalty programs will play an essential role in the industry’s recovery by creating incentives for customers to restart travelling,” said Renato Ramos, director for loyalty at Star Alliance, a grouping of airlines that includes the likes of Air China Ltd., Deutsche Lufthansa AG and United. “In addition to the existing perks for frequent fliers, we are looking at ways to find new benefits.”One risk is there’s little value left in miles or co-branded credit cards if the issuing airline collapses, which is a very real threat as the likes of Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd., Avianca Holdings SA and others show.“The airline industry itself, among them the legacy airlines, will be transformed after this earthquake-like shock,” said Pankaj Pandit, an independent consultant based in the Indian city of Bengaluru, formerly known as Bangalore. “Many legacy airlines may simply vanish, so naturally their appendage, the loyalty programs, will also wither away,” he said in an email.Some are trying to incentivize members to spend on associated credit cards and transfer points in from other partners such as hotels, according to Gary Leff, co-founder of InsideFlyer.com who writes on loyalty programs.“There will be empty seats to fill and airlines will need to rely on their programs to make generous offers in order to bring back consumers,” Leff said. “Expect loyalty programs to run aggressive promotions, travel businesses to spend heavily marketing to their frequent fliers and frequent stay guests. In addition, with all of this excess inventory it’ll be easier for consumers to use their points. This will last as long as the downturn lasts.”Bloomberg.com"

Gains were broad, with energy, financials and technology leading all 11 sector groups higher.

The euro posted its fourth straight advance versus the dollar, as expectations built for the approval of a region-wide stimulus plan. Gilts climbed as the U.K. sold bonds at a negative yield for the first time.Yields were steady as the U.S. Treasury resumed sales of 20-year bonds for the first time since 1986.

The euro’s gains coincided with progress on a 500 billion-euro (US$550 billion) fiscal-stimulus plan by the European Union, though critics say the package may be too little, too late to counter the devastating effect on the region’s economies and bolster the outlook for corporate profits.“We’re driven by the headlines and we should expect to see some volatility when it comes to markets,” said Nela Richardson, an investment strategist at Edward Jones & Co. “The volatility is to be expected.”Elsewhere, equity benchmarks in Japan and India saw the bulk of gains in a mixed Asian session, with Shanghai and Hong Kong in the red.

All existing inventory will continue to be sold through retailers until supplies run out, she said.J&J has faced lawsuits accusing it of hiding the cancer risks tied its talc-based version of baby powder since 2014. Juries across the U.S. have hit the company with billions of dollars in actual and punishment damages over their handling of the product. J&J has been successful in getting many of those verdicts reduced or wiped out on appeal.J&J’s cornstarch-based baby powder, which has been on the market since 1980, will continue to be sold in the U.S. and Canada. Widmer said 75 per cent of its U.S. baby-powder customers use the cornstach product, while 25 per cent rely on the talc-based product. Outside the U.S. those numbers are reversed, Widmer said, and the talc-based product will continue to be distributed abroad.Johnson’s Baby Powder currently accounts for less than 1 per cent of the company’s U.S. consumer-health revenue. It has seen a decline in sales over the past few years as consumer habits have changed, Widmer said. The company blames “misinformation around the safety of the product and a constant barrage of litigation advertising” for the drop in demand, according to a statement.Talcum powder has long been a mainstay of baby products because the mineral keeps skin dry and prevents diaper rash. Talc mines, however, can also yield asbestos, a mineral once used in products such as building insulation. Some companies have found corn starch can offer the same benefits of talc without the asbestos risk.Yanking its talc-based baby powder off the market could limit the number of cancer lawsuits the 127-year-old product generates each year. J&J officials said last month they’d had a 15 per cent increase in the number of suits alleging baby powder causes different kinds of cancer.Still, J&J “remains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson’s Baby Powder,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue to vigorously defend the product, its safety, and the unfounded allegations against it and the company in the courtroom.”The statement noted that all verdicts against it have been overturned through the appeals process.Bloomberg.com"

Now, he’s bailing out just as the pandemic throws the U.S. economy onto uncertain terrain.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold 84 per cent of its Goldman Sachs stock in the first quarter, marking a reversal for an investor who generally holds large stakes in the banking sector. It was one of the most notable changes in Berkshire’s more-than US$180-billion portfolio in the period, as the bank underperforms the broader U.S. market.Buffett traces his relationship with Goldman Sachs back to a meeting with the bank’s longtime head, Sidney Weinberg, in 1940. The billionaire investor routinely praised former Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein as he led the Wall Street firm through the last financial crisis. Then Berkshire started paring its stake during the last few months of 2019 — after David Solomon had succeeded Blankfein as CEO — and deepened that cut in the first quarter, nearly bringing the investment to an end.“He has this historical relationship with Goldman, so maybe there’s some sentimental value,” said David Kass, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business. “But of course, Buffett’s primary concern is efficient allocation of capital.”Buffett’s set-up is different this time around. During the 2008 crisis, Goldman Sachs tapped Berkshire to invest in preferred stock, offering a 10 per cent annual dividend and warrants. Buffett said in 2009 that, while he had a good relationship with the bank, it was primarily the terms that attracted him.Those preferred shares are long gone. Berkshire now holds only common stock in the lender, a stake that dwindled to 1.92 million shares at the end of the first quarter, from a high of more than 18 million shares. It’s not known if or how the stake may have changed since then.Buffett’s retreat followed Solomon’s rise to the top job in October 2018. An investment banker by trade, Solomon has been pushing the firm deeper into less-familiar terrain with transaction banking and deposit gathering, making it look more like its rivals. Buffett has rarely discussed Solomon in public.Solomon’s style may clash with that of the famously frugal CEO of Berkshire. The bank ordered a pair of Gulfstream private jets late in 2019 to ferry executives around the globe, after years of using Berkshire’s own NetJets business.Berkshire didn’t respond to a message seeking comment and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Buffett’s dealings with investment banks in general may make him more cautious toward the sector. He had a tumultuous ride with a bet on Salomon Inc., where he had to step in as interim chairman in 1991 and appear before Congress after the company admitted to violating Treasury auction rules. Buffett’s longtime business partner, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, put it more succinctly around four years ago: The pair tends to fear investment-banking business more than they love it.“He’s always been a little skittish about investing in investment banks after getting somewhat burned in the Salomon experience,” Kass said.Still, Buffett has been willing to praise investment bankers he admires. He frequently turned to Byron Trott, a former Goldman Sachs banker who later founded BDT Capital Partners, for acquisitions, noting that Trott “earns his fee.”Buffett, 89, has been bullish on the banking sector. He’s the largest investor in Bank of America Corp. and has praised its CEO, Brian Moynihan. Berkshire has continued to be the biggest shareholder in Wells Fargo & Co. as it worked through the fallout from a sales scandal. And while Berkshire trimmed its stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co. in the first quarter, it boosted a holding of PNC Financial Services Group Inc.Berkshire and Goldman Sachs are gearing up for the worst economic landscape in recent years. Buffett signalled caution at his annual meeting earlier in May, saying that his record cash pile of US$137 billion wasn’t that huge when he looked at worst-case possibilities. He even dumped Berkshire’s stakes in four major U.S. airlines.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs suffered an almost US$900-million hit on its investment portfolio in the first quarter, normally a lucrative business in better economic conditions.“Historically, the banks have been a bellwether for the good and the ill of external events, because ultimately it’s kind of the choke point for the financial system,” Blankfein said Monday in a Bloomberg TV interview.Investors, at least “since the financial crisis have had an arched eyebrow when approaching investments in banks,” Blankfein said.Bloomberg.com"

How much they’ll fall is the key question.Sellers are currently willing to concede discounts of around 5 per cent, while bidders are hoping for about 20 per cent off pre-pandemic prices, said Charles Hewlett, managing director at Rclco Real Estate Advisors. That estimated gap, which is likely wider in specific cases, has put a freeze on deals.“The mantra for anything that hasn’t gotten started is: delay, defer and, in many cases, renegotiate,” Hewlett said. “If I’m going to have vintage May 2020 on my books, I want to be able to demonstrate to my investors that I got an exceptionally good deal.”Private equity firms across the globe hold an estimated US$328 billion in dry powder for real estate deployment, according to the data firm Preqin Ltd. Prior to the crisis, asset prices had been pushed up as investors chased yield in riskier corners of the property market. Now, Blackstone Group Inc. and Brookfield Asset Management Inc., the largest real estate investing companies, are expected to hunt for bargains among the fallout from the pandemic.For now, social distancing rules and a virtual travel halt have stalled transactions and led to speculation that prices will drop in coming months.“The physical restrictions taking place are mostly preventing new deals from happening,” Tom Leahy, a London-based senior director at Real Capital Analytics Inc. said. “Far fewer active buyers, far fewer deals, an increase of deals falling out of contract — those are the preludes to seeing prices fall when the market does come back.”Far fewer active buyers, far fewer deals, an increase of deals falling out of contract — those are the preludes to seeing prices fall when the market does come backThe volume of deals in Europe plunged 65 per cent in April from a year earlier, according to Leahy. U.S. and Asian markets faced similar drops.Asia, where the pandemic began, is likely to recover faster than Europe or America, as Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and parts of China reopen for business, according to Richard Barkham, chief economist for CBRE Group Inc. Transactions in the Americas will fall an estimated 35 per cent this year, compared with a roughly 25 per cent decline in the Asia-Pacific region, he said.Still, New York-based Blackstone, which had US$538 billion in assets under management at the end of March, is “starting to see some rescue situations,” President Jonathan Gray said during an earnings call last month. He added that “distress takes time to play out.”Brookfield, meanwhile, has US$60 billion “ready to be deployed globally as opportunities arise,” Chief Executive Officer Bruce Flatt said last week.“In reflecting on what really matters to our business, it is liquidity, liquidity and liquidity, in that order,” he wrote in a letter to shareholders.The firms with money to spend first have to figure out what do do with some of their more vulnerable recent investments. Blackstone said last month that its real estate portfolio, which represents about 30 per cent of its assets under management, is concentrated in “sectors that have shown greater resilience to COVID-related headwinds.”Still, not all its bets look like winners. In late February, Blackstone announced a deal to buy a US$6-billion portfolio of university dormitories in the U.K. popular with international students.“Are they scratching their heads about having put money into the student business?” Chris Grigg, CEO of British Land Co., one of the U.K.’s largest commercial landlords, said. “You’d guess they probably are a bit.”Blackstone said in a statement that U.K. student housing will benefit from “incredible long-term demand trends that are not going away.”Brookfield made waves with a US$15-billion bet on malls in 2018. But with retail stores shuttered and more consumers shopping online, the company recently announced a US$5-billion retail revitalization program.Until shopping, commuting and travel become routine again, it will be hard for investors to agree on what malls, hotels, offices and other properties are worth.“Proof is really going to be when the markets start to reopen when buyers and sellers find a middle ground with what’s going to happen with pricing,” Real Capital’s Leahy said. “It’s going to be asymmetrical. Different sectors and different geographies are going to be factors. There’s not going to be a uniform recovery.”Bloomberg.com"

That’s the fastest pace of growth in almost two decades. Profit in the quarter also beat expectations.Walmart comparable-store sales in Canada were up 8.5 per cent.Walmart’s results reinforce how North Americans’ spending priorities rapidly shifted to staples and away from discretionary items with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, before pivoting back to items like office equipment, sporting goods and toys as the quarter wore on. The report for the three-month period ended April 30 sparked stock advances from peers such as Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp.Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said the quarter was a roller-coaster ride that started strong in February before a flurry of stockpiling in mid-March. Growth slowed in early April but then re-accelerated after government stimulus checks arrived.“It really was unprecedented,” Biggs said in an interview. “It was several quarters within a quarter.”The shares rose as much as 3.4 per cent to US$131.99 on Tuesday. The stock had gained 7.4 per cent this year before Tuesday, compared to a drop of 8.6 per cent for the S&P 500 Index.Walmart’s move to build up its e-commerce capacity paid off, with online sales in the U.S. rising 74 per cent in the quarter. That outpaces the average analyst estimate of 51 per cent. To counter rival Amazon.com Inc.’s popular Prime service, the company is rolling out a subscription-based grocery delivery offering and recently introduced a two-hour home delivery service in some markets.The online pickup and delivery business increased fourfold at times during the March peak period, Biggs said, bringing in many new customers. This included older Americans who may not have shopped much online before.Despite the dramatic sales growth, there’s concern that higher sales of everyday items like food and toilet paper, instead of higher-margin discretionary items, will reduce margins. Fulfillment costs also erode the profitability of online orders.Walmart said gross profit margins narrowed due to a shift to lower-margin categories and web sales along with markdowns and other investments to lower prices. But the e-commerce business still lost less money than it did in the year-ago quarter.“The results were clearly positive, particularly on the profitability side,” John Tomlinson, an analyst at M Science, said by phone. “There were not too many holes to pick in the quarter. The question is, where do we go from here after the initial stock-up activity?”Investors will be tuning in closely to see whether the boom in spending will hold up or lose steam. Walmart said there’s “significant uncertainty” surrounding the length and intensity of the coronavirus’s impact, prompting the retailer to withdraw its full-year guidance, which was given just three months ago.Still, the company said its “business fundamentals are strong.” Walmart incurred incremental costs of nearly $900 million related to its response to Covid-19.It listed the measures it has put in place to help protect shoppers and consumers, from reduced hours and enhanced cleaning procedures to plexiglass sneeze guards and face masks and gloves for employees.The safety of Walmart’s massive U.S. workforce is also under scrutiny amid reports that some employees have died from Covid-19. That workforce is growing, with the company hiring 235,000 new employees during the period.Walmart also said it will shutter the Jet.com online business, which it acquired four years ago — an unsurprising move as Walmart has been integrating Jet into its broader web unit over the past year.Bloomberg.com"

Gilts climbed as traders bet the Bank of England will take its benchmark interest rate below zero in December.Investors begin a new week more positive on risk assets and looking past data that paints a dismal picture of the coronavirus’s damage. While Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy’s recovery could stretch to the end of 2021, he added that policy makers are “not out of ammunition by a long shot.” Several European countries ended bans on short selling, as they continued to report the lowest number of daily deaths from the virus since March.“With the worst of the pandemic likely behind us, central bank supported equity markets are unlikely to re-test their lows,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “Yet, while reopening momentum may well carry risk assets a bit higher over the near term, the tepid economic recovery and deep uncertainty over the virus outlook argue against a pivot to more risk-on positioning.”Elsewhere, industrial metals climbed after China announced guidelines to revive large infrastructure projects.

The acquisition price was about US$400 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Axios earlier reported the deal and its price. Facebook didn’t disclose terms.Facebook already offers Giphy’s library of clips in its messaging products, and said owning the service outright will make it “easier for people to find the perfect GIFs and stickers” in Stories and direct messages. About 50 per cent of Giphy’s traffic already comes from the Facebook family of apps, and half of that from Instagram alone, the company said. The talks started after money-losing Giphy reached out to Facebook a few months ago in hopes of landing an investment, then shifted to talking about an acquisition instead, according to a person familiar with the conversations, who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations.Giphy provides GIF search functions for other apps, like Twitter and TikTok, and it will keep up those integrations — potentially giving Facebook insight into activity on competitors’ platforms. That could mean additional scrutiny from regulators for Facebook, which is currently under antitrust investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and 47 state attorneys general.Giphy could also help increase sharing on Facebook’s apps. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has made private messaging a priority in recent years, and eventually plans to enable messaging between all of Facebook’s services, including WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram.

Druckenmiller on Tuesday called a V-shaped recovery — the idea the economy will quickly snap back as the coronavirus pandemic eases — a “fantasy.” Tepper said Wednesday that next to 1999, equities are overvalued the most he’s ever seen.It’s a notion catching on among Wall Street money managers. And it’s coming as investors start to suspect that the Federal Reserve’s support, as well as US$3 trillion in Treasury stimulus, may not be enough to compensate for soaring unemployment, a wave of bankruptcies and no end in sight to the pandemic. Managers including Bill Miller, Paul Singer and Paul Tudor Jones have all voiced doubts about markets or the economy.Such bearishness starkly contrasts with the optimism that pushed the S&P 500 Index up 26 per cent from its March low. And the warnings have caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who’s facing re-election and has seen his plans to run on a booming economy shredded by the virus. Trump attacked “so-called ‘rich guys’” in a tweet Wednesday.“You must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down,” Trump wrote about the stock market. “Then they go positive, get big publicity, and make it going up. They get you both ways.”When the so-called “rich guys” speak negatively about the market, you must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down. Then they go positive, get big publicity, and make it going up. They get you both ways. Barely legal?His criticism is unlikely to sway Wall Street professionals. The S&P 500 Index is down 3.8 per cent this week, and investors and economists are forecasting further declines amid a prolonged struggle to right the economy.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Trump’s pick for the job, outlined a doom-laden scenario with mass bankruptcies and unemployment in a speech delivered around the same time as the president’s tweet. Powell said policymakers may have to do more to prevent long-term damage to the economy.Tepper’s comments were a change from late March, when he said he was “nibbling” at stocks, buying into companies focused on technology or hospitals and health care. Tepper, who runs the US$13-billion Appaloosa hedge fund, told CNBC on Wednesday that valuations are “nuts” for some individual stocks on the Nasdaq. He also highlighted banks and airlines as difficult areas in which to invest right now.Druckenmiller said Tuesday at the Economic Club of New York that his analysis showed liquidity that drove markets higher will soon shrink as Treasury borrowing crowds out the private economy and even overwhelms Fed purchases. The 66-year-old said he’s never seen a time when the risk of owning stocks so outweighed the potential gain.When reached by phone on Wednesday, billionaire Leon Cooperman pointed to an email he wrote in late April that predicted the government’s actions to combat the pandemic will lead to higher taxes and more regulation. He estimated the S&P 500 should be trading lower — somewhere between 2,200 to 2,800 — which suggests stocks could fall as much as 22 per cent.“I’m 77 years old and I’ve never seen this level of uncertainty,” Cooperman said in the phone interview. “This cycle is different than the other seven bear market cycles I lived through because this is the only one where we had a broad scale shut down of the economy, which I view as a mistake.”I'm 77 years old and I've never seen this level of uncertaintyCooperman warned that the longer the economy remains shut, the greater the risk of a depression.Other marquee investors also have taken more defensive stances recently. Tudor Jones, who runs Tudor Investment Corp., told clients in early May he was investing in gold and had even put a small percentage of his firm’s assets in Bitcoin as he looked for havens. Meanwhile, Carl Icahn said in late April that he wasn’t buying stocks. Instead, he was hoarding cash and shorting commercial real estate.Stock-picker Miller said in an email he’s changed his mind about the market’s prospects for the near future.“The buying opportunity I talked about on CNBC on March 18 did not last as long as I thought it would,” Miller said. “After being up about 30 per cent from the low on March 23, I would think a pause and some consolidation is in order.” He predicted the S&P 500 could fall 4 per cent or 5 per cent from its current level.A few of the more bearish hedge fund managers already sounded the alarm earlier this year. Crispin Odey told clients in a March update that “nothing is immune from the slowdown.”“By all means buy your favourite shares, I am not going to put you off,” he wrote. “But know that from here on you are now on the wrong side of history.”Singer, the founder of Elliott Management, who on Feb. 1 told his staff to prepare for quarantines, told clients in mid-April — while stocks were soaring — that the outlook for equities was dire. Global stock markets could fall 50 per cent or more from their February top, he said.It’s not just fund managers. Billionaire Mark Cuban, who is part of a group chosen by Trump last month to help advise on reopening the economy, said he agreed with Druckenmiller about equities.“Stocks are overvalued and the risk-reward isn’t there till we see a cohesive plan for testing from the government,” Cuban said in an email.Bloomberg.com"

They’re questioning, privately and publicly, how the prime minister’s avowedly feminist government could have passed over Carolyn Wilkins for Bank of Canada governor.Wilkins, the central bank’s second-in-command, was the most qualified woman ever to compete for the position. The government’s decision to name Tiff Macklem was a disappointment to those who say it underscores slow progress in advancing women to executive roles in economics and finance. Canada may have a reputation as a progressive country, but no woman has ever been finance minister, central bank governor, chief executive of one of its six biggest banks, or head of a large public pension fund.“Based on the feedback I’ve had, this has been a very big blow to women in financial services and the overarching question is, ‘What else do we possibly need to do?’” said Tanya Van Biesen, executive director of Catalyst Canada, a group that advocates for women’s leadership in the workplace. “When is it clear the system is broken? The women are not broken.”When is it clear the system is broken? The women are not brokenBloomberg interviewed eight Canadian women in senior roles in finance and economics. Most spoke on condition they not be identified, as their employers didn’t want them expressing public views about the politically sensitive appointment of the central bank governor.All were careful to point out they respect Macklem, who takes up the Bank of Canada’s top job on June 3. But several said when it comes to getting the top jobs in finance, an old-boys’ network still exists.“Not to take anything away from Tiff,” said Margaret Franklin, chief executive officer of the Charlottesville, Virginia-based CFA Institute and former president of BNY Mellon Wealth Management in Canada. “I think it’s a disappointing missed opportunity, particularly for a government that’s been very clear on the agenda of putting very well-qualified, very credible women in leadership positions.”Some say the decision highlights a lack of transparency in the process. The Bank of Canada governor is selected entirely in secret and there is no confirmation hearing, unlike the chair of the Federal Reserve. The world finds out who got the job when the finance minister and the new governor walk into an introductory news conference.That Wilkins and Macklem were both qualified for the role was evident. They were the only people on the final shortlist. Wilkins had backers within Trudeau’s office but Finance Minister Bill Morneau championed Macklem, according to three people familiar with the discussions. Wilkins had the support of the current governor, Stephen Poloz, who had been grooming his top deputy for years.An official in the prime minister’s office, speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity, said the government had several conversations and took time to make the right decision, describing the candidates as excellent. The official said there was no division within the government about Macklem as the consensus choice.Macklem, 58, spent two decades at the bank, helping to lead Canada through the 2008-09 financial crisis in the No. 2 role she now holds. Wilkins, 56, has been at the bank almost as long, becoming senior deputy governor in 2014. She’s the bank’s Group of 20 and Group of Seven deputy and has represented it at global institutions including the International Monetary Fund.Wilkins has also been front and centrein the bank’s efforts to loosen up credit markets and buffer the country’s economy from the coronavirus pandemic, the biggest shock since the Great Depression.She doesn’t have a Ph.D. in economics like Macklem, Poloz or Mark Carney, who was governor from 2008 to 2013. On the other hand, neither do Fed Chairman Jerome Powell or European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.Macklem does have one other thing Wilkins doesn’t: senior management experience outside the bank. Given the government hasn’t chosen an insider as governor since 1994 — including Macklem, who was passed over in 2013 for Poloz — that may have mattered.Macklem is dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. He also also ran an expert government panel on sustainable finance and was a director of the Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada’s third-largest bank, where he was chairman of the risk committee.Requiring outside experience is another way of disqualifying women, several of the women interviewed said. There are few in the upper echelons of Canada’s financial industry to choose from. There are even fewer with experience in both monetary policy and finance. If outside experience is a must-have, that should be made clear in the selection process, said one woman who works in a senior role at a large Canadian bank.Canada’s financial industry does better than many sectors in advancing women, particularly at the biggest firms, but the rate of improvement has been slow, according to law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, LLP, which does an annual study. Last year, an average of 21 per cent of executive officers were women, up from 19 per cent in 2016, the law firm said.Wilkins “has done the hard work, put in the hard yard, proven herself, and yet this job was still not available to her,” Van Biesen said.The senior deputy governor declined an interview request on the topic. “I have deep respect for Tiff as an economist, and as a public servant. I look forward to working closely with him in his new role as governor and as a colleague on the governing council as we carry out the important work of the Bank,” Wilkins said in an email.Some of the those interviewed see the personal relationship between Morneau and Macklem as central to the decision. The finance minister had been considering Macklem for the job for two years, according to a person familiar with the minister’s thinking.Macklem was part of the “in crowd” of Canadian finance, said one woman with a long history on Bay Street. In 2018, Morneau appointed Macklem to chair an expert panel on sustainable finance, which laid out ways markets can push the transition to a green economy, a priority for the Trudeau government.Armine Yalnizyan, a Canadian economist and research fellow at the progressive Atkinson Foundation, speculated Wilkins may end up as deputy finance minister to further her credentials. A switch to the powerful finance department, in the midst of a crisis in which fiscal policy will be centre stage, might put Wilkins in an even more influential role than running the Bank of Canada, she said.Bloomberg.com"

The company invested roughly US$2 billion in public equity markets, including repurchasing its own shares and those of its publicly traded subsidiaries, Flatt said.“We have also built up toehold positions in the shares of several companies that we feel, like ours, are being significantly undervalued in the current market environment,” he said.Also on Thursday, Brookfield reported a first-quarter net loss of US$157 million, or 20 US cents a share, compared with earnings of US$1.26 billion, or 39 US cents, a year earlier. Funds from operations, a measure of cash flow, fell to US$884 million, or 55 US cents a share, from US$1.05 billion, or 69 US cents, a year earlier.The company also said it plans to nominate former Royal Bank of Canada Chief Financial Officer Janice Fukakusa to its board at this year’s annual general meeting.The coronavirus has had an impact on Brookfield’s various businesses, Flatt said, but they remain in “good shape,” with its Oaktree business continuing to find opportunities in distressed debt. Brookfield’s retail real estate business will be stronger than in the past over the medium term, benefiting from premier locations and consolidation in the retail environment, he said. The focus now is shifting to reopening.“We are also working hard to ensure that in those businesses that have been affected, we are able to not only withstand the downturn, but also use our capital position to enhance operations through this period of stress,” Flatt said. “While a large portion of our businesses have operated throughout this crisis as they are critical infrastructure, we have now moved our focus to the reopening phase for all of our remaining operations and offices.”Bloomberg.com"

A similar wave of outbreaks at meat plants in the U.S. has already withered available supplies at grocery stores and driven up retail prices for beef and pork.“We have plenty of food that will continue to reach grocery stores on a regular basis. But it is clear that COVID-19 is causing significant disruptions in our food supply chains,” Bibeau said by email. “As a result, Canadians could see less variety in grocery stores or a fluctuation in food prices.”Canadians could see less variety in grocery stores or a fluctuation in food pricesAn outbreak at Cargill Inc.’s beef plant in High River, Alberta sickened nearly half of the facility’s 2,000 workers. Virus outbreaks at JBS SA’s plant in Brooks, Alberta have also prompted slowdowns and the supply squeeze is already forcing companies such as McDonald’s Corp.’s Canadian unit to import beef to supplement their needs.The two Alberta plants account for roughly 85 per cent of Canada’s beef slaughter capacity. “We will continue to use imported beef until there is a continuous and consistent supply of Canadian raw material,” McDonald’s Canada said Wednesday in an email.In Canada, there’s also a huge dependency on temporary foreign workers to plant, tend and harvest fruit and vegetable crops. More than 60,000 workers help do everything from prune apple trees to plant asparagus and farmers are struggling to get enough labour to do the work. So far, only about half the workers have arrived.Some Ontario vegetable growers are worried yields will drop 30 per cent as farms struggle to fill roles, feeding through to consumer costs, according to the Arrell Food Institute at the University of Guelph.Disruptions to labour mean Canada could face food supply problems as early as June, according to economist Armine Yalnizyan.“It’s completely foreseeable if you don’t bring in migrant workers or if they start getting really sick and they are used so heavily in the food production industries, that our food security will be imperilled at some level,” she said. “This isn’t a for-sure thing at all, but it’s not beyond the realm of possibility.”The federal government said it is working with provinces and territories to ensure the country’s food supply remains strong and that farmers and food businesses receive the support they need.In early May, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced $252 million (US$179 million) in funding for farmers and food companies. This includes money to help the agriculture industry get access to personal protective equipment, extra storage to help avoid food waste and other costs resulting from the virus.Bloomberg.com"

Add in provincial deficits, and the shortfall rises to about $500 billion, or net debt of 90 per cent of the nation’s output in 2020-21, the analysts estimate.“These figures may catch the eye of rating agencies and could jeopardize Canada’s AAA rating particularly if the economy continues to underperform in 2021 and beyond,” they wrote. They expect that is likely, “given how growth has come almost exclusively from housing and energy over the last decade,” they said.The budget deficit of Ontario, the world’s largest sub-sovereign debt issuer, will be more than double the latest official government projections as its economy contracts 9 per cent in 2020 from the coronavirus shock, the Financial Accountability Office of Ontario, a provincial fiscal watchdog, said earlier this week.Quebec, which was running surpluses before the COVID-19 crisis, said it is on track to post a budget deficit between $12 billion and $15 billion and it will need as long as five years to balance its book again, the province’s Finance Minister Eric Girard said Wednesday.Bloomberg.com"

Employees at the plant, who declined to be identified citing company policy, say they’ve been recalled to work and have resumed vehicle-assembly operations.Tesla has roughly 20,000 employees in the San Francisco Bay area and 10,000 at the factory, which makes the Model S, X, 3 and Y. The county warned earlier this week that Tesla appeared to be in violation of its work-stoppage order.“If the reports we have received are true, Tesla is engaging in work beyond Minimum Basic Operations, and is in violation of the health officer order,” Colleen Chawla, the county Health Care Services Agency director, said in a letter Monday. “We hope that Tesla — like other businesses who have been notified of noncompliance — comes into compliance with the order without the need for additional enforcement measures.”Shares of the company pared a decline of as much as 4.7 per cent on Wednesday, falling 4.3 per cent to US$774.25 as of 12:17 p.m. in New York. California’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said in an interview on CNBC Wednesday morning that the state is prepared to enforce its stay-at-home rules if needed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.County health officers issued an unusual statement late Tuesday after reviewing the company’s latest safety plan. It said Tesla can prepare “for a possible reopening as soon as next week” if it follows some additional safety recommendations, and public health indicators remain stable or improve. The officials said they would work with local police “to verify Tesla is adhering to physical distancing, and agreed-upon health and safety measures are in place for the safety of their workers as they prepare for full production.”Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer and largest shareholder, said Monday that Tesla was restarting production at the plant in Fremont and would defy the county officials who had ordered the company to keep the factory closed. He got support from President Donald Trump.The county and six municipalities in the densely-populated region decided in late April to extend their restrictions on businesses through the end of May to battle the spread of the coronavirus. While California Governor Gavin Newsom announced last week he would let some manufacturers in parts of the state reopen starting May 8, he also said local authorities had the ability to keep stricter measures in place. The Bay area was the first region in the country to lock down via shelter in place orders and has been the most cautious about reopening, citing the need to ramp up testing capacity, contact tracing and making sure that there is an ample supply of PPE, or personal protective equipment.Musk sent an email to employees early Tuesday: “Just wanted to send you a note of appreciation for working hard to make Tesla successful. It is so cool seeing the factory come back to life and you are making it happen!!” he wrote in the message seen by Bloomberg News.Two workers who have returned to the plant said they were required to watch a safety-training video. One said the company handed out masks and had put up plexiglass stations in the break room. Another said plastic curtains hang from the ceiling as barriers to keep workers separated from one another, and that the carmaker is taking employees’ temperature using thermal scanners.The work in Fremont comes as Tesla is actively seeking a new location to build its second gigafactory. Musk has also said that Tesla would move its headquarters and future programs to Nevada or Texas. He wrote Saturday that Tesla would decide whether to keep manufacturing in Fremont based on how Tesla is treated in the future.After prevailing in a defamation suit and emerging mostly unscathed from a court fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, Musk was not shy about suing Alameda County. Tesla filed suit against the county on Saturday.Musk has claimed COVID-19 isn’t all that viral a disease, called panic about it “dumb” and theorized fatality rates are overstated. He’s also promoted the antimalarial drugs President Donald Trump embraced that haven’t proved effective and wrongly predicted that new cases would be close to zero by the end of April.Tesla’s standoff with California has come to represent the tense debate playing out in states and counties across America over how fast businesses should be allowed to reopen.

But companies are also considering how best to redesign their operations to prevent infections, including by automating some lines altogether. The likely result: higher costs for an industry dominated by the likes of Tyson Foods Inc. and JBS SA that’s been very efficient at pumping out cheap meat.The changes are arriving as concerns mount over mega-plants staffed with low-paid workers operating elbow-to-elbow. More than 10,000 meat workers have been infected by the coronavirus, and at least 30 have died, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.“Americans want to buy cheaper and cheaper and cheaper food,” said Matthew Wadiak, founder of Cooks Venture, a small chicken producer selling directly to consumers. “We need to figure out how to pay a little bit more, because what’s the cost of a human life? It’s a lot more than 25 cents at the checkout.”Workers at meatpacking plants continue to fall ill, even with barriers placed between them, more protective equipment and enhanced social-distancing measures in common areas including cafeterias and locker rooms.While President Donald Trump has ordered plants to reopen, many are running at slower-than-usual rates to try to reduce the spread. Reducing plants to a third of their capacity and distributing the adequate protective equipment could boost chicken prices at grocery stores by 25 per cent to 30 per cent, according to Sanchoy Das, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.We need to figure out how to pay a little bit more, because what's the cost of a human life? It's a lot more than 25 cents at the checkout“The 99-cents per pound chicken could be in short supply very quickly,” said Das, whose research focuses primarily on supply chain modelling and analysis.Tyson’s operating costs are sharply higher due to the novel coronavirus and running into the hundreds of millions of dollars, Chief Executive Officer Noel White and Chief Financial Officer Stewart Glendinning said at the BMO Farm to Market virtual conference on Wednesday. That includes US$120 million in bonus for employees, personal protection equipment as well as factory shutdowns and slowdowns.The bulk of America’s beef and pork are processed in a few dozen giant plants that handle thousands of animals in lines that have been allowed to run faster and faster. Tyson, JBS and Cargill Inc. control about two-thirds of America’s beef. Pork and chicken production is similarly concentrated.The outbreak could also help accelerate automation plans companies have already in the works. Tyson has said it is investing “aggressively” in automating the most difficult tasks within its plants. The company is installing robots in the deboning areas of its poultry plants, and also has initiatives in beef and pork.“You are going to see a bifurcation where the larger, more profitable facilities are going to move toward a vastly more automated meat processing facility,” said Decker Walker, an agribusiness expert at Boston Consulting Group. “Incentives for automation have never been higher.”Incentives for automation have never been higherPilgrim’s Pride Corp. was increasing its use of automation and robotics even before the pandemic. The company invested more than US$30 million in automation last year, projects that are helping plants to run efficiently in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.“We believe in automation, we believe in robotics, and we’re going to continue to move down that path,” Chief Executive Officer Jayson Penn said in an April 30 call with analysts.Meat processing is usually a low-margin business, meaning companies will be wary of overspending. While there’s probably going to be a lot of change in the way packers do business, consumers will pay for it in the long run, said Steve Meyer, an economist at consultancy Kerns & Associates.“This whole system was designed to produce quality products at the most reasonable cost possible, so you don’t go and add a lot of extra cost to go handle a once-in-a-100-year situation,” Meyer said. “But you also don’t turn a blind eye to the fact that people are sick and some people died. So I think there will be some changes made.”Another way to reduce infections, especially in poultry plants, would be to produce more whole chickens, as cutting up birds into legs and thighs requires more labor, said Das of the New Jersey Institute of Technology.Consumers in the U.S. can afford to pay a bit more for their meat, said Wadiak of Cooks Venture. That would increase wages and help avoid shared living accommodation, which has been a challenge for meat plant workers looking to adhere to social-distancing practices.“When the budget is tight, it’s hard to put food on the table, it’s hard to feed your family, I really, really get that,” he said. “But if that means you are putting food on your table at the cost of someone else’s life, it’s not worth it.”Bloomberg.com"

Earlier this month, an Australian hedge fund, Tribeca Investment Partners, also called for Lindsay’s replacement and said the company should divest its energy and coal businesses.Both investors are critical of Teck’s dual-class share structure, which allows the Keevil family — which has been involved with the firm for more than six decades — to control the company.Most of Teck’s A-shares are held by Temagami Mining Co., which is owned by the Keevil family and Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Speaking at a Bank of America conference on Tuesday, Lindsay said that only Temagami has the power to dismantle the dual-class structure, which he believes will stay in place “for the foreseeable future.”Thus far, Lindsay has refrained from commenting directly on the shareholder activism, although the company has issued statements saying he has widespread shareholder support. The miner also says the stock’s decline — 59 per cent in the past year in Toronto — is mostly due to falling commodity prices.Lindsay reiterated that point at the virtual conference and also defended his strategy for the company.“We know that investors tend to be cautious during these phases,” he said, referring to Teck’s “investment cycle” in which it’s ramping up its copper business and trying to boost its steelmaking-coal margins. “We’ve seen something very similar before during financing and construction of another high-altitude copper mine — Antamina — which also coincided with a significant downturn in the market.”Lindsay was referring to construction of the Antamina mine in Peru which was completed in 2001, spokesman Chris Stannell said in an email following the speech.Throughout that period, Teck’s share price was in the “penalty box,” Lindsay reminded analysts. “But our then-CEO and now chairman emeritus Dr. Keevil, he had the vision and the tenacity to see it through.”Since then, Teck has weathered other commodity downturns. In 2015, the company was stripped of its investment grade rating amid the collapse of the commodities supercycle.“By contrast with the last downcycle which ended in 2016 we are in a much stronger position with a reduced debt profile; strong liquidity; and secured QB2 funding,” Lindsay said Tuesday, referring to the Quebrada Blanca expansion project in Chile.Bob Bishop, the CEO of Impala, said he began buying Teck shares in December 2015 with most of the fund’s position purchased in January 2016, the only saving grace for the investment.“If you are smart enough to buy Teck once every seven years when people think Teck may go broke, then you can make a great return because the commodity markets usually bail them out,” he said by email Tuesday. “I was that buyer in 2016.”Teck began that year at $5.34 a share in Toronto and rose to nearly $39 by early 2018. The stock was at $12.12 at the end of trade in Toronto on Tuesday.Bloomberg.com"

They have cut their benchmark interest rate to nearly zero, engaged in open-ended bond buying and begun rolling out emergency lending programs as U.S. unemployment has soared to levels not seen since the 1930s Great Depression.Treasury yields and the Bloomberg dollar index fell to their lows of the day following the release of Powell’s prepared remarks, while S&P 500 futures pared their gains.Almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in MarchThe Fed chair in his speech outlined the worrying scenario posed by mass bankruptcies and unemployment while asserting that policy makers may have to do more to prevent it from coming to pass. He said the Fed would publish a survey Thursday showing almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in March.“Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers’ careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt,” Powell said. “The loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life’s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes.”While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risksCongressional lawmakers and President Donald Trump’s administration have passed almost US$3 trillion in economic relief measures, including US$454 billion to serve as a backstop for the central bank’s emergency programs. Democrats and Republicans are currently talking about another round of aid, including measures to shore up state and local governments whose tax revenues have been decimated by stay-at-home orders that have shuttered entire sectors of the economy.“While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks,” Powell said.In an unprecedented step, the Fed this week also began buying exchange-traded funds invested in corporate debt to support liquidity in the market where large companies borrow.Powell added that the central bank would “continue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way,” but cautioned that it could only make loans and not spend money.“When this crisis is behind us, we will put these emergency tools away,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

It far exceeded the maximum loss anticipated by HSBC’s value-at-risk models.HSBC’s loss highlights the extreme nature of the disruption to the gold market in late March, as lockdowns closed refineries and grounded planes, strangling the supply routes that allow physical bullion to move around the globe.The price of gold futures in New York and spot gold in London, which usually trade within a few dollars an ounce of one another, diverged by as much as US$70 — the most in four decades. The divergence hit banks that are active in trading the so-called EFP, or Exchange for Physical, the mechanism by which traders switch positions between the New York and London markets.HSBC, which had disclosed in a previous filing that it was hit by the gold market disruption, revealed the scale of the loss in a chart this week showing its daily trading profits for the first quarter.The bank described the loss as a “mark-to-market loss mainly associated with gold refining and transportation challenges.” It highlighted the “unprecedented widening of the gold exchange-for-physical basis,” which “affected HSBC’s gold leasing and financing business and other gold hedging activity leading to mark-to-market losses.”HSBC declined to comment.In the past week, the price difference between the New York and London markets has returned to more normal levels of less than US$5 an ounce.Still, HSBC is not the only one struggling with the unusual moves in the gold market. Banks often sell gold futures in New York to hedge their positions in the London market, exposing them to significant losses should the two markets diverge.As a result, some banks have stepped back from trading the EFP in recent weeks.

Oanh Ha and Jonathan Levin,Nightmare at sea ends in death for some cruise ship workers — but not from coronavirus,"Recent deaths of crew have underscored concern about the mental health of more than 90,000 cruise workers stranded on ships for two months",https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/nightmare-at-sea-ends-in-death-for-some-cruise-ship-workers?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/cruise.jpg,"May 12, 2020 1:03 PM EDT","Lauren Carrick and fiance Joe Harrison haven’t had a good night’s sleep in weeks. The two dancers on Celebrity Cruises’s Infinity say being held aboard ships for almost two months has left them emotionally drained.“I cried all day,” said Carrick, 29. “We need to have alcohol to sleep — that’s how bad it is. We’re worried, tense, stressed out. We just want to get home.”Carrick and Harrison are among the more than 90,000 cruise workers in U.S. waters stranded on ships two months after the coronavirus pandemic began forcing cruise lines to halt operations and repatriate crew. While companies work through a thicket of shifting rules on returning workers to their home countries, recent deaths of crew have shook the industry and underscored concern about mental health.“It’s a very stressful situation,” said Fabrizio Barcellona, assistant secretary for seafarers at the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which represents local unions. “The prolonged periods they have to stay on board can create a situation of unrest. People can become distressed and that can create flash points.”Carnival Corp.’s Princess Cruises said Sunday a 39-year-old crew member from the Ukraine was killed after leaping off its Regal Princess in the port of Rotterdam. The ship’s crew was in the process of being repatriated, the company said in an emailed statement.Another worker was found dead in his cabin on the Carnival Breeze, unrelated to Covid-19, the company said. Carnival, the world’s largest operator, said it was not providing details of the death out of respect for the worker’s family.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the No. 2 line and owner of Celebrity Cruises, said a crew member went overboard from its Jewel of the Seas about two weeks ago.Crew members have said the reported deaths have rattled them and dampened morale, said Krista Thomas, a former Norwegian Cruise Line guest manager who’s operating two Facebook pages for stranded crew and their families. In recent days, several workers have told her in direct messages that they are suicidal, she said.“Many of these people have been isolated in their small cabins for 21 hours a day and they’re breaking down from the loneliness and stress,” said Thomas, who operates the pages from Vancouver, Canada. “Many have been told to pack quickly to leave, and then their charter flights get canceled. Those highs and lows are taking their toll.”The cruise line operators say government policy changes and travel restrictions have complicated efforts to get crew home. More than 124 cruise ships with 94,600 workers aboard are underway or at anchor in U.S. waters, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday.“That one simple question – how do we get you home? – turns out to be incredibly complex to answer,” Michael Bayley, chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean International, wrote in a letter to crew members this month. “Each country has rules and regulations for who can travel home, and how, and when. But in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, those rules have gone in all different directions – and they frequently change without notice.”About 15 countries won’t allow their citizens to return home at all amid the pandemic, said Bayley.About 7,100 Filipino crew on 20 ships were anchored in Manila bay as of last week, awaiting government testing and clearance to return home, the Philippine Coast Guard said. Many have been confined to their cabins for at least two weeks, according to crew and some operators. They will be quarantined 14 more days before leaving the vessel, the Coast Guard said in an email.Royal Caribbean International has said all 25,000 crew members on its ships have completed 14 days of in-room quarantine and are now practicing social distancing. While the company has repatriated about 9,100 seafarers, plans are still being made for the others, who come from 60 different countries, Bayley said in the letter.Carnival has also cited port closures and travel restrictions as roadblocks to getting crew back on land. The operator repatriated 20,000 workers last month, leaving 52,500 waiting to go home as of Friday, according to Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Carnival, which employs about 90,000 crew on 105 cruise ships.The business shutdown for many cruise operators began in earnest March 14, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first-ever no sail order for all cruise ships in U.S. waters.The order banned passengers from boarding and required lines to come up with plans to contain COVID-19 infections. Since February, more than 30 cruise voyages have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks, according to the CDC website.Last month, the CDC updated requirements that called for cruise company executives to guarantee that seafarers would be flown home on charter flights and other private transport. Under the rules, crew should not use public airport terminals or transportation to avoid the risk of spreading infections.Travel restrictions have also meant that in some cases, workers are shuffled from one ship to another before they can set foot on land again.Carrick and Harrison, both from the U.K., were moved to another Celebrity ship, the Reflection, a few days ago. They were told to pack to transfer to yet another ship Monday, but were given a last-minute option to remain on their current ship and then get on a charter flight to the U.K. next week.They chose the flight and have also made another important decision. After dancing on ships for more than 6 years, this will be their last voyage.“This whole experience has been a nightmare,” said Carrick. “I can’t even think of coming back to a ship.”Bloomberg.com"

To stem the spread of Covid-19, it will implement temperature checks, require masks and prohibit lines for toilets, with lavatories made available on request.The carrier’s push to get planes back in the air clashes with comments from U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who said Britons were unlikely to be vacationing abroad this summer. O’Leary said practical measures to resume travel should be worked out over the next several weeks.“By the time we get to the first of July, we think masks and temperature checks will become the norm in train stations, on board trains and undergrounds, on buses, in public transport across Europe,” O’Leary said at a Financial Times conference Tuesday. “It would be a reasonably modest extension to add those to airport terminals and on board aircraft.”Ryanair gained as much as 3.8 per cent in Dublin trading. The stock has tumbled 38 per cent this year.Trouble is, within the European Union, each nation sets its own rules on entry. Britain, which just left the bloc but remains a major hub for flights in the region, plans a two-week quarantine on incoming travellers that executives have decried as tantamount to a ban.“The U.K. 14-day isolation is nonsense,” O’Leary said. “There’s no scientific basis for it whatsoever.”While the European Commission is preparing recommendations for removing border controls, the Ryanair tussle highlights the conflicting priorities that could make the resumption of air travel a bumpy one.O’Leary said the airline has seen a surge in bookings since announcing its resumption of service early Tuesday, adding that there’s pent-up demand, especially from families, who want to take their typical two-week summer vacations abroad. That’s after Hancock told ITV it’s “unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to be possible this summer.”Spain’s tourism industry, a key driver of the economy, was also dealt a potential blow when the government decreed this week that all people arriving from abroad will be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine in “their homes or lodgings.” The measure will stay in force until the current state of emergency is lifted.Ryanair said it would restart flights from most of its bases, and will offer seats starting from 20 euros (US$21.60) one-way. Service will feature fewer checked bags, online check-ins and boarding passes that can be downloaded to smart phones, the airline said.The U.K. quarantine cast doubt on the reopening plans of other grounded European airlines as well. British Airways owner IAG SA has said it will have to review its goal to gear back up starting in July.The International Air Transport Association has called for governments to take a coordinated approach to reopening in Europe, while acknowledging the challenges.“What it needs is a degree of synchronization, especially in regions, of what the criteria are for inbound and outbound,” said Peter Morris, chief economist at Cirium. “The problem is that different countries across Europe are in different parts of the cycle.”The EU recommendations, expected Wednesday, are part of a “tourism package” of non-binding guidelines covering everything from health measures to travel vouchers. The EU’s digital chief, Margrethe Vestager, told lawmakers last week that digital contact-tracing apps might “enable at least some traveling during the summer.”Bloomberg.com"

In 2019, Lindsay’s total compensation was $9.2 million (US$6.6 million), including $1.64 million in salary.Doug Brown, Teck’s director of public affairs, said Monday that Lindsay has shareholder backing and that the company’s shares are down largely because underlying commodity prices have fallen.“At our recent annual meeting, shareholders voted 98 per cent in support of Don and the board, indicating the strong level of support of Teck’s shareholders for the company’s strategy,” Brown said by phone.Impala’s letter alleges four projects — the 2008 acquisition of Fording Canadian Coal Trust, the Neptune terminal expansion in British Columbia, and two ventures in Canada’s oilsands — have destroyed over $12 billion in value.“It’s been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 years,” Bishop said in a phone interview Monday. “The company’s paying top dollar for underperformance.”It's been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 yearsImpala’s letter was accompanied by a slide deck that referred to Lindsay’s strategy as lacking “clear direction or coherence,” and echoed many of the valuation concerns recently made public by Tribeca Investment Partners earlier this month.Impala faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Vancouver-based Teck, Canada’s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades.As for Teck’s investment in the Fort Hills oilsands project in Alberta, Brown said: “We have been very clear that if we can’t see the value reflected in our share price, we will not hesitate to pursue other options for realizing value, including divestment at the appropriate time.”Impala owned 1.9 per cent of Class B shares outstanding at the end of 2019, making it a top-10 shareholder, according to Bloomberg data.The share structure is a major impediment to change, Bishop said.“The dual-class share structure was originally meant to protect the Class B shareholders if there was a low-ball bid for the company,” Bishop said. Instead, “it has allowed bad decision-making to occur without any repercussions.”In March, Bishop says he and another Impala representative met with Teck’s chairwoman, Sheila Murray, and vice chairman Norman Keevil III, to follow up on their letter but came away with little conviction things will change. “These have been poor investment decisions by this CEO, approved by mostly this board, and we’re expecting the same people who got us into this mess to get us out of this mess.”Bishop, who worked as chief investment officer at Soros Fund Management before founding Impala, said his views are broadly aligned with those of Tribeca, although he puts more value on Teck’s zinc and copper assets. He also said he’s less optimistic about how much the miner could get from the sale of its metallurgical coal division.Both investors think the stock is dramatically undervalued, with Bishop estimating they could at least triple under the right management.“If they did the right thing tomorrow I think the stock price would go up 40 per cent in one day,” he said.Tribeca Investments partner Ben Cleary sent a letter to Teck this month demanding the mining giant overhaul its management team while divesting its coal and oil operations to attract green-conscious investors.He said Impala was just one of many peers with similar views on how to change Teck and boost its share price. Sydney-based Tribeca has spoken to investors representing over 20 per cent of the Class B shares since the campaign began, with all being broadly supportive of its goals, he added.Cleary expects Teck’s directors to split the demands into one of two buckets: the deliverable and undeliverable.“If you were an independent director then management change, divestment of assets, dividend policies and ESG are all in the deliverable camp,” he said. “The shareholding structure is probably in the ‘undeliverable’ so the focus to me is on the first few in the short term.”Bloomberg.com"

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned of a “gradual, muted recovery” from the outbreak, while Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the economy will need more fiscal stimulus if the jobless rate continues to rise.Wall Street’s three major averages closed around their session lows.

The TSX was down 222 points at 14,881.The disastrous fallout of business closures and stay-at-home orders caused an unprecedented 20.5 million job losses in April, tripling the unemployment rate to 14.7 per cent, the highest since the Great Depression era of the 1930s.

Newsom, who allowed manufacturing in parts of the state to restart May 8, said Monday that the county decided to enforce stricter rules around reopening.When asked about Tesla reopening its Fremont plant regardless of Alameda’s order, Newsom said he was unaware.“It was my understanding when I walked up to the podium today that that wasn’t the case,” he said.Alameda’s public health department declined to comment.Musk, 48, tweeted over the weekend that Alameda’s refusal to let Tesla reopen the Fremont factory was “the final straw” and that he’d immediately move Tesla’s headquarters to Nevada or Texas.Newsom said Monday the state has a strong relationship with Tesla, calling it “a company that this state has substantively supported for now many, many years.” Musk then thanked the governor in a tweet.Bloomberg.com"

Amazon doesn’t comment on speculation, a spokeswoman said Monday. AMC didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The trade publication Deadline reported Monday morning that “there are no talks,” citing unidentified sources.AMC shares rose as much as US$2.31 to US$6.41 in New York trading. They were up as little as 19 per cent minutes after the Deadline report and were up 36 per cent to US$5.58 at 11:28 a.m. The stock was down 43 per cent this year through last week, battered along with the rest of the cinema industry by a worldwide shutdown for the coronavirus pandemic.AMC’s bonds surged on reports of the talks with Amazon, and were among the top gainers in the U.S. high-yield market on Monday, according to Trace bond-trading data. AMC’s senior subordinated bonds due 2026 were up as much as 10 cents on the dollar to 32 cents, data shows.The reported talks are unlikely to spark a price war for AMC, Bloomberg Intelligence media analyst Amine Bensaid said in a note. “Movie-going is unlikely to fully bounce back in a post-COVID-19 world and may create risks for an acquirer,” he said. “AMC’s elevated debt load and unavoidable fixed costs mean the company’s near-term financial flexibility will be severely challenged.”AMC showed its concern about existential threats with its reaction to last month’s straight-to-streaming release of the kids movie “Trolls World Tour,” which Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures crowed about as a high-grossing success. AMC said it would no longer show Universal’s movies.Chinese real estate tycoon Wang Jianlin, who spent billions of dollars building one of the world’s biggest cinema operators, controls AMC through his closely held Wanda Group.

The decline took place ahead of a closely watched, technical event known as halving.“It’s likely that we’re going to see increased volatility through May, with the pandemic, ongoing stimulus measures and the halving,” Rich Rosenblum, co-head of trading at crypto market maker GSR, said in an email. “The record open interest for futures and options at multiple exchanges adds to this. The market is in a state of information and position overload, exacerbating the potential for volatile moves.”A halving happens about every four years and slows down the rate at which new tokens are created — an intentional feature designed to control inflation. Bitcoin has historically bottomed 459 days prior to the halving, risen into the event and jumped after, according to research from Pantera Capital. Post-halving rallies averaged 446 days.Here’s a QuickTake on what Bitcoin’s “halving” means.“So far, Bitcoin’s third halving looks different to prior events and there doesn’t appear to have been such a sustained price run-up,” said Payal Lakhani, director of equity research and product development at CME Group, in a blog post Friday. “Given the reward change has been known since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, and having already seen two such events, investors may have already incorporated the supply adjustment into their models and taken positions accordingly.”The impact of COVID-19 has resulted in lower volumes as some participants focused on non-crypto markets, and some mining operations being affected by these difficult market conditions, Lakhani said.Bloomberg.com"

As a marching band welcomed visitors to the Shanghai park on Monday, authorities around the world were facing rising pressure to end lockdowns and revive economies slammed by the global outbreak.Disney is struggling to recoup earnings at its theme park and film businesses pummelled by the virus crisis, while China’s government is grappling with the challenges of incrementally reopening the country. Parks, factories and restaurants in cities and countries around the world are reopening under rules to keep customers and workers apart amid the threat of second waves and flare-ups of the virus.To reach the gates of Shanghai Disneyland, guests had to pass through body temperature checks and show that their health status has been confirmed using a smartphone app for tracking infected persons. Masks were mandatory, despite the muggy 23 degree Celsius (73 degrees Fahrenheit) weather.Yao Yao, a 37-year-old kindergarten teacher wearing a Minnie Mouse costume, arrived at 8:30 a.m. and was among people waiting for entry.“Simply walking in the park will make me forget anything unhappy,” said Yao, who has an annual pass.Disney said it is limiting access to the Shanghai park on Monday to a fifth of normal capacity, below the government-mandated 30 per cent, during the initial reopening phase. Tickets for May 11 sold out in minutes, a sign consumers are prepared to spend and mingle in public as China cautiously moves beyond the virus.Simply walking in the park will make me forget anything unhappyNew cases in the country where the pathogen first emerged have dwindled, and China has reported no deaths since April 14, according to the National Health Commission.Visitors to the US$5.5 -billion theme park had relatively short waits for rides. The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train attraction, for example, had a maximum of five minutes standing in line mid-morning, according to an app that tracks waits at the park. The longest line for a ride at the time was 20 minutes, according to the app.In the afternoon, some lines started to stretch to 30 minutes, maximum.On a typical spring day under normal conditions, visitors might wait more than one hour for the most popular attractions.The Disney World shop, which sells toys and T-shirts, required use of hand sanitizer to enter, and had few shoppers. Popcorn and chicken wing stands were open, though fewer than on a normal day.Live theatre shows, areas where children would come into close contact, such as water play spots, and parades have been suspended during the initial reopening to avoid raising infection risks.“The real test will come as those capacity limits are eased and the calendar moves into what is typically the critical peak summer season,” said Ron Merriman, managing director of theme park consultants MR ProFun China. “But I am very optimistic about the park’s prospects for passing that test.”Shanghai Disneyland was the first of the entertainment giant’s parks to close on Jan. 25 as the coronavirus began to spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan, 520 miles (840 kilometres) west of the country’s business capital.Disney blamed the pandemic for lopping US$1.4 billion off profit last quarter, largely by forcing it to shut resorts around the world. While Disney is keeping its U.S., Hong Kong and Paris parks closed, the company said last week it would open a limited number of shops and restaurants in its Disney Springs mall outside its resorts in Orlando, Florida, on May 20.Tickets to Shanghai Disneyland during the initial reopening phase are 399 yuan (US$56) for regular days, and 499 yuan for weekends.Disney’s theme parks division contributed about 46 per cent of operating income in the 12 months ended September 2019, more than double the earnings from its studio entertainment business, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Bloomberg.com"

Musk, who has called government shutdown orders to contain the coronavirus “fascist,” said Tesla will decide whether to keep producing cars in Fremont, California, based on how it’s treated going forward.Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.The tweets raise pressure on California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Bay area officials who were among the first in the U.S. to implement shelter-in-place orders and have been cautious about lifting them. Musk, 48, has arguably been the tech sector’s loudest voice advocating for the reopening of the economy, which has drawn criticism from some of his peers in the business community and cheers from conservative political circles.Tesla has roughly 20,000 employees in the region, including its headquarters in Palo Alto. Moving the headquarters and future programs to Texas and Nevada, where Tesla has its massive battery plant, is a threat that would be relatively easier for Musk to follow through on.I’m not messing around. Absurd & medically irrational behavior in violation of constitutional civil liberties, moreover by *unelected* county officials with no accountability, needs to stop.But the Fremont plant is the only place in the world where Tesla makes the Model S, X and Y, and the company has sunk billions of dollars into the facility over the years.“Picking up and leaving isn’t really an option right now,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., said by phone. “I don’t know if you can quickly say ‘I’m leaving.’”Musk has been scouting locations for a new U.S. factory to build the Cybertruck and has hinted it could be constructed in Texas, where part of Tesla’s chip team is based. His rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp. also has operations in the state.Local officials in Fremont and Alameda County did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday morning.Bloomberg.com"

In total, more than $10 billion of mergers, acquisitions and investments have been terminated in the past seven days, the data show, with many more under threat as acquirers try to back out of agreements or renegotiate terms.Real Estate CrumblesReal estate deals have been particularly hard hit, with deals falling apart across the residential and travel sectors as millions of Americans face unemployment and tourists stay home.South Korea’s Mirae Asset Global Investments Co. on Sunday terminated its $5.8 billion purchase of 15 luxury hotels from an affiliate of Anbang Insurance Group Co. The portfolio included the JW Marriott Essex House, overlooking Central Park in New York City, and the Four Seasons in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The Anbang unit is suing Mirae to try to force the deal through, joining more than half a dozen virus-related deal challenges that are before Delaware judges.A lawsuit was also filed this week over SoftBank Group Corp.’s withdrawal of a $3 billion investment in WeWork. Co-founder Adam Neumann is suing the Japanese conglomerate over the deal, which was part of a rescue package after the workplace provider’s initial public offering was called off last year.Amherst Holdings on Monday called off its $2.3 billion deal to buy Front Yard Residential, less than three months after the real estate investment trusts inked a deal. Executives said that the global health crisis would make integrating the businesses, which include a portfolio of more than 15,000 homes, too complex.Just two months after announcing the sale of seven U.S. Kimpton hotels for $483 million, Xenia Hotels & Resorts Inc. said the transaction had been canceled. When the deal was announced, corporate travel restrictions were already in place in the U.S. and some hotel companies had pulled earnings forecasts.Retail RampageRetail transactions are also getting scuttled as international lockdowns keep customers inside and threaten brick-and-mortar retailers.The owner of lingerie chain Victoria’s Secret on Monday agreed to end a deal to sell the beleaguered business to private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Instead, L Brands will split Victoria’s Secret from its Bath & Body Works stores and attempt to turn around the brand as a separate entity. Sycamore had sued to get out of the $525 million deal, claiming the coronavirus pandemic was not an excuse for the company failing to pay rent and furloughing thousands of workers.Activist investor Dan Loeb wants to back out of a $2.5 billion deal for Global Blue SA, which processes tax refunds for international luxury shoppers. Loeb’s Far Point Acquisition Corp. wants its shareholders to vote against the transaction, setting itself up for a fight with Global Blue’s owner, private equity firm Silver Lake.An IPO of clothing brand Madewell looks unlikely after parent company J. Crew Group Inc. filed for bankruptcy — the first major retailer to go bankrupt during the shutdown. J. Crew was relying on the IPO to raise capital and ease its heavy debt load.Renegotiated DealsAuto-parts makers BorgWarner Inc. and Delphi Technologies Inc. managed to salvage their January tie-up, which had been under threat after BorgWarner said Delphi had used up a credit line without permission. Investors cheered as the companies said they’d agreed to new terms, which reduced the share ratio that was initially proposed by 5%.Devon Energy Corp. and a unit of Banpu Pcl agreed to amend the terms of a deal struck in December for Devon’s Barnett Shale assets. Instead of $770 million upfront, Banpu will pay $570 million in cash plus an extra $260 million in contingent payments based on future commodity prices. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude has fallen more than 60% since the deal was signed.Megadeals Fall DownTwo of the biggest U.S. deals to fall apart hit a wall in late March and early April, just a couple of weeks after the first states went into lockdown.Rivals Woodward Inc. and Hexcel Corp. on April 6 called off a $6.4 billion merger agreement that would have created one of the world’s biggest aerospace and defense suppliers. The companies noted the pandemic’s effect on the aviation industry, which has so far been promised more than $85 billion in government funds after the crisis wiped out travel demand.Xerox Holdings Corp. decided to back off of its $35 billion hostile bid for HP Inc., saying the Covid-19 pandemic made the macroeconomic and market outlook too uncertain.Slow IPOsSoftware maker Procore Technologies Inc., Warner Music Group Corp. and retailer Cole Haan all pushed back plans for IPOs as the pandemic hit, Bloomberg News has reported.At least three companies that got as far as picking dates for their share sales have delayed their listings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The largest of those would have been an offering of as much as $253 million by SHE Beverage Co., with smaller offerings by Avadim Health Inc. and F5 Finishes Inc.Fifteen companies filed to withdraw their IPOs this year, the data show. That includes industrial software maker Vontier Corp. It said in April that it was pulling its listing “due to recent market and economic disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.”Some companies are still managing to get deals done.

This week its private equity unit, Brookfield Business Partners LP, said it had invested about $500 million in public companies with the goal of potentially taking some of them private.Its real estate arm, Brookfield Property Partners, said it too had shifted its focus to the public markets, with $8 billion in dry power sitting on its books and dearth of large deals to be had.“We began investing in the capital markets aggressively in March but have pulled back somewhat in April as the markets quickly recovered,” Sam Pollock, Brookfield Infrastructure’s Chief Executive Officer, said in a letter. “We would describe our current investment posture as optimistically patient.”Brookfield Infrastructure said on a conference call Friday it is focused on 10 to 15 names, primarily in North America and Europe. It didn’t disclose its targets. While it managed to invest in some of them during the sell-off, the list of attractive companies has narrowed as the market recovered, the firm said.Ports, Rail Take HitWhile Brookfield’s infrastructure assets have been affected by the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent social distancing measures, it remains well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that arise, Pollock said. Brookfield Infrastructure has roughly $4.3 billion in liquidity after a bond issuance in April and a $1 billion increase to its revolving credit facility.Brookfield tends to be a counter-cyclical investor, searching for investments in countries and sectors that are out of favor. Pollock said the current situation reminded him of the financial crisis, when turmoil in markets led Brookfield to a major deal with Australia’s Babcock & Brown Infrastructure about a year after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.Roughly 70% of Brookfield Infrastructure’s funds from operations is from its utilities, energy and data infrastructure segments, which are expected to see little impact from Covid-19, he said. Other parts of its business, including railways, ports, and toll roads, are more exposed to a downturn.April volumes in its rail segment fell 7% below planned levels. It saw declines of about 15% in container volumes in the first quarter, with volumes from Asia down because of the lockdowns.Those numbers rebounded quickly as China reopened its economy but are still 10% below expected volumes. Its toll roads business has also seen a 40% decline in volumes due the coronavirus.“Our outlook for the balance of the year is guided by the current state of affairs and the cautious approach most governments are taking towards opening up their economies,” Pollock said, adding that he expects non-essential businesses to largely remain closed through the second quarter.Pollock said he expected the recovery to be more a ‘swoosh’ shape than ‘U’ or a ‘V’ with the aid of government stimulus. He said he expects most sectors and businesses to return to a more normal environment by the end of 2020 or first half of 2021, assuming there is not significant second wave of the virus.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The achievement comes with a dubious distinction, however: those that leapfrogged the value of Canada’s largest bank in the past have faltered.Royal Bank, incorporated in 1869, has been Canada’s most valuable company for years, but has been been eclipsed on a few occasions. Shopify closed with a market value of $121.3 billion ($85.6 billion), surpassing Royal Bank’s $120.5 billion.The last company to surpass Royal Bank’s market capitalization was drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. in July 2015. Months later, the value of the Quebec-based company plunged amid controversies over business practices, accounting and drug pricing. Valeant has since been renamed Bausch Health Companies Inc. and has new management and a different ticker symbol.Before that, BlackBerry Ltd. — the inventor of the smartphone and then known as Research in Motion Ltd. — crossed Royal Bank briefly in 2007. It held the top spot for about five months in 2008, before Apple Inc.’s iPhone and other handset makers rose up to steal its market away.Further back, Nortel Networks Corp. became the biggest Canadian company in 2000, swelling to a market value of $366 billion and accounting for as much as 35 per cent of Canada’s benchmark index, before crashing in the tech wreck. The telecommunications-equipment maker ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and was liquidated.The dramatic collapse of two Canadian tech giants in a country more known for being hewers of wood and drawers of water has hung over the country’s corporate psyche for years. So Shopify’s rise has been cheered on by many.“I think it’s obvious in hindsight the leadership of both those companies got disconnected from their underlying markets,” said Eric Jackson, founder of a Toronto-based tech-focused hedge fund EMJ Capital Ltd., referring to BlackBerry and Nortel.Jackson believes Shopify “should be held up as a poster child for what Canada should be trying to encourage in it’s tech sector because it’s been remarkable what they’ve done,” he said. Jackson had owned the company’s stock but doesn’t currently have a position. Its U.S.-listed shares have risen by 43 times since the initial public offering at US$17 in 2015.This year’s rally, which has seen the stock double, has drawn its doubters.“On just about any valuation metric, this is one of the most expensive stocks in Techland,” Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco told clients in a note Wednesday. Shopify also holds the highest sales multiple, though has the largest sales growth outlook, RBC added. The bank rates Shopify with the equivalent of a buy.The rally has made founder and chief executive officer Tobi Lutke, Canada’s fourth-richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The 39-year-old has added US$2.8 billion to his wealth this year, and is now worth US$6.3 billion. The billionaire has about 7 per cent of Shopify, according to its 2019 proxy circular.Lutke, a German immigrant with vivid blue eyes and a penchant for tweed caps, began building software to launch an online snowboard store in 2004. It became obvious that the software was more valuable than the snowboards, according to his website profile, and he went on to launch the Shopify platform in 2006. RBC was incorporated in 1869.Shopify sells tools to help companies set up an online store, a business model seen flourishing during the coronavirus pandemic that has shuttered bricks and mortar stores. In April, the company’s chief technology officer tweeted Shopify was handling “Black Friday-level traffic every day” to bring thousands of businesses online.At Bloomberg’s Sooner Than You Think conference in New York last year, Lutke said Shopify isn’t competing with Amazon.com Inc. but helping other people do so.“They’ve obviously become the anti-Amazon, they’re all about empowering everybody else except Amazon on the online e-commerce world to be successful and they’ve expanded and expanded their suite of services,” Jackson said.He believes Shopify has the opportunity to keep rising and have a market value of several hundred billion dollars in the years ahead.“They are still just getting going. People who complain they are ‘too expensive’ don’t understand how much revenue and profits they’ll drive in the years ahead,” Jackson said.Bloomberg.com"

The regulator must work with the CME to determine whether the price moves were a one-time occurrence or a reflection of dynamics in the contract that could recur, Berkovitz said in a statement.A rapid plunge in the final minutes of trading on April 20 that pushed prices to below zero thrust one of the world’s most-traded futures into the spotlight. CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert has said the agency is “conducting a deep dive” to understand the move, but that the negative prices appeared to have been a result of supply and demand related to storage capacity and the global economic slowdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.“The WTI contract is a key benchmark in the energy and financial markets,” Berkovitz said in his statement, which was prepared for a meeting of a CFTC advisory committee that he leads. “A futures contract that is disconnected from the physical market cannot serve as a means to discover prices or manage price risks arising from the use of the commodity.”Berkovitz said he’s concerned that many of the same dynamics that drove the move in the May contract haven’t been resolved. The WTI June contract, the next futures to come due, expires on May 19.“There is a high probability that the supply, demand and storage conditions that were present during trading in the May spot month will persist through the upcoming weeks and into the spot month for the June WTI futures contract,” Berkovitz said.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

Macquarie Infrastructure & Real Assets last year paid Bayer AG and Lanxess AG more than $3.5 billion to take over their chemical park operations, gaining a steady income from long-term service and supply contracts with the companies on site.Dow’s marine and storage operations, known as its Mars unit, includes 136 chemical and liquid hyrdocarbon tanks with 200 million gallons (760 million liters) of capacity, as well as 11 marine docks, according to one of the people. The terminals — including ones in Freeport, Texas, and St. Charles and Plaquemine in Louisiana — are located near railway lines operated by Union Pacific Corp. Open land and unused tank capacity may also be included in a transaction, the person said.More than 70% of Mars revenue last year came from Dow, and the company would seek a 25-year contract with the buyer for marine and terminal services, one of the people said. The business also has third-party customers, most which have a minimum of 15 years remaining on their leases.For the potential rail divestiture, Dow wants a similar long-term partner for infrastructure critical to its manufacturing operations at six sites in North America, another person briefed on the matter said. The plants in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana; in Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas; and in Alberta, Canada, at Calgary and Edmonton, represent the bulk of Dow’s olefins and polyethlene production capacity.Dow has accounted for more than 75% of its rail business’s revenue, which had a compound annual growth rate of about 7% over the last three years, the person said. The company has offered to sign a 25-year agreement with potential suitors. Other existing contracts have roughly 12 years remaining, on average.The company, led by Chief Executive Officer James Fitterling, has seen its stock tumble 42% this year through Wednesday, compared with a 12% drop for the S&P 500 Index. That left Dow with a market capitalization of about $24 billion.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

A separate proposal, which was coordinated by the investor activist group ShareAction and backed by money managers at Amundi SA and Jupiter Asset Management, called for the phase-out of financing activities to the most carbon-intensive energy companies. It received 23.95% support.The vote could go down as a milestone event because it’s the first climate change resolution at a European bank, and demonstrates how banks’ contribution to global warming remains a top priority for investors. It also showed how shareholders can force banks and other large corporations to use their vast resources to combat climate change and other social ills.“Today’s result shows the value of shareholder engagement with banks on climate change,” said Faith Ward, the Bristol-based chief responsible investment officer at Brunel Pension Partnership. “This resolution came about as a direct result of intensive shareholder engagement over the past year, including the first-ever shareholder climate resolution at a major European bank.”While Brunel was among firms that filed the shareholder resolution and had hoped to see both proposals pass, Ward said the shareholder resolution got more than 20% support, which means it surpassed a threshold that requires Barclays to consult with shareholders and explain the views received and actions taken publicly within six months.The shareholder resolution was put forward in January and urged Barclays to say how it will phase out financing for energy companies that don’t align with the Paris Agreement’s climate goals. As a growing number of investors pledged to support the resolution, Barclays in March put forward its own net- zero alternative, which ShareAction criticized for leaving unanswered questions about the bank’s financing activities in the short term.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said today’s votes send “an unequivocal signal not just to the board of Barclays but to the entire global banking sector that all banks must start to phase out” fossil-fuel financing.“Today’s voting results will send shock waves through the banking industry,” Howarth said. “While Barclays is Europe’s largest fossil-fuel financier, it is far from being the only bank to prop up companies that are driving the climate crisis.”Barclays provided more than 100 billion pounds ($123 billion) of funds to fossil-fuel companies since the Paris climate accord was signed, according to data compiled by Rainforest Action Network, which includes information gathered from Bloomberg.For some, London-based Barclays hasn’t gone far enough to change its trajectory.“Rather than backing a resolution that set out a clear pathway for Barclays to finally end its vast contribution to the climate emergency, the bank chose to hoodwink both shareholders and the public with an alternative option — one with distant targets and no substance,”said Rosie Rogers, Greenpeace U.K.’s head of climate finance. “There is nothing wrong with a net-zero target but, without details of how it will get there, Barclays’s ambition is all show and no go.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

While the order book for the marquee Global 7500 is “largely intact,” the manufacturer is cutting spending and deferring discretionary investments to shore up profitability at lower production levels.The weak demand outlook is raising the pressure on new Chief Executive Officer Eric Martel as the company exits its operations in commercial planes and rail equipment. Bombardier burned through US$1.6 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter, with as much as half of that coming from slow orders for planes and trains, temporary factory shutdowns and the inability to deliver aircraft amid government travel restrictions.Bombardier tumbled 6.6 per cent to 50 cents at 11:51 a.m. in Toronto. The shares fell 73 per cent this year through Wednesday, the fourth-worst drop on Canada’s S&P/TSX Composite Index.Business activity will hit a low point in the current quarter “before gradually recovering in the second half,” Bombardier said.The company’s rail division, which is being sold to France’s Alstom SA, received a first-quarter equity injection of US$386 million from the Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, a longtime investor. The sale to Alstom is proceeding well and is still expected to close in the first half of next year, Bombardier executives said on a call with analysts.The sale of the CRJ regional-jet line to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. will close June 1, Bombardier said, echoing a statement by the Japanese company. Bombardier already sold its stake in Airbus SE’s A220 jetliner program to the European planemaker. Bombardier invested more than US$6 billion in developing the A220, which was originally known as the C Series.Bombardier’s adjusted loss widened to 10 US cents a share, worse than the 7-cent average shortfall expected by analysts. Sales climbed 5 per centto US$3.69 billion.Bombardier is in talks with countries where it has operations in case temporary liquidity needs arise, Martel said on the call. His first weeks on the job have been focused on managing costs and cash flow while talking to customers and suppliers to confirm orders and reset delivery schedules.He outlined a set of priorities that include completing asset sales, becoming a more predictable company and aligning production with market demand to generate a steadier cash flow. He also pledged to define a “clear vision” for the company.Martel, who used to head the business jets division before leaving Bombardier for a few years to head Canada’s biggest electric utility, Hydro-Quebec, said he hasn’t seen many order cancellations so far. That’s a contrast with December 2014, when cancellations started piling up after oil prices collapsed, he said.“It is moving at a slow pace, there’s no decision being made,” Martel said, adding that customers have asked for information on plane availability and timing as they assess the duration and impact of the pandemic. “We think that when we have more visibility on the pandemic that the activity level will be restarting.”Demand for bigger private jets seems more solid than for smaller aircraft, Martel said.The Montreal-based company, which suspended its financial forecast in March, said it would offer updated projections when it has greater visibility on the pandemic’s impact.“We have limited exposure today on the light jet versus either 2008 or even 2014,” he said. “We always felt going into those crises that the large-segment market was much more robust. And today, as you know, we are much more dependent on that segment, which makes me believe that our backlog will remain much more solid.”Bloomberg.com"

April numbers are today and economists are expecting the cuts to be even worse.“It will be far more widespread and we will see more industries that are connected to men’s jobs affected,” according to Armine Yalnizyan, a research fellow at the Atkinson Foundation focusing on the changing nature of work.The closing of schools and childcare centers — where many women work — is one reason why female employment took such a hit in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Yalnizyan said in an interview.While economists have started to call the sharp downturn a “she-cession,” April’s numbers may not accentuate female employment losses as much given huge swathes of the economy are now suffering.Canada probably lost more than 4 million jobs on the month, representing a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decrease in monthly employment on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Brendon Bernard, an economist at job-search platform Indeed Canada, will be watching the construction sector closely in Friday’s report, due at 8:30 a.m. from Statistics Canada in Ottawa. The field didn’t suffer much in March but since then companies in the industry reported significant layoffs, according to a separate survey by the agency.Indeed data suggest job postings for construction have fallen in line with overall labor-market losses. “The hit might not have been too great in March but we could see more troubling numbers in April,” Bernard said by phone.While Friday’s jobs report is likely to show a more even split between female and male employment losses, it’s still out of the ordinary, according to Mike Moffatt, an assistant professor at Western University’s Ivey School of Business in London, Ontario.“That’s very different than your typical recession which tends to be an 80/20 split,” Moffatt said. “The job losses are experienced 80 per cent by men just because goods producing sectors like construction and manufacturing tend to be more sensitive to the business cycle or at least have been historically.”That suggests the recovery will be different as well. Both Moffatt and Yalnizyan agree service-sector jobs won’t bounce back as fast, therefore female employment will have a tougher time rebounding.“Once things start to return to normal, it’s probably going to be a female-dominated recession again just because the sectors that should be able to come back quickly tend to be a little-more male dominated,” Moffatt said.Discussions around the reopening of the economy already suggest more male centric businesses will open up first such as golf courses, marinas and lawn care.“We are looking at initially, in Ontario, a he-covery and that will not be captured by the April data,” Yalnizyan said.Schools and childcare centers are likely to be some of the last places to recover amid the public-health crisis. Without childcare, women may opt to stay at home to take care of their kids and out of work for longer.Bloomberg.com"

Yet Bitcoin is once again staging a comeback reminiscent of the token’s glory days, with evangelists pegging their hopes on a technical event as the new catalyst.True believers say the gains are driven by Bitcoin’s upcoming halving, when the rewards miners receive for processing transactions will be cut in half as soon as May 12. The internet is glutted with second-by-second countdown clocks and the mania is even spurring a hike in hiring by crypto firms worldwide. Bitcoin has rallied to more than US$9,000 in anticipation from around US$6,000 just a month ago.“Narratives in the world of blockchain act like the Force in Star Wars — they mysteriously move and shape the market,” said George McDonaugh, co-founder of crypto and blockchain investment firm KR1. “You couldn’t be blamed for getting a little excited about what’s to come.”Bitcoin halvings, which slow down the rate at which new tokens are created, happen once every four years or so. Its third such event is set to occur next week. Skeptics argue crypto prices are notoriously volatile and often difficult to pin explanations to, positing that any appreciation should be priced in ahead of time. But crypto fans cite historical precedent.Bitcoin’s undergone two prior halvings — or halvenings, as they’re sometimes called — which saw its price appreciate in the aftermath. The world’s largest token rose from around US$12 to over US$1,000 in the year following its 2012 cut in rewards, and advanced about 1,000 per cent in the wake of the 2016 halving, though that reduction happened at a time when the coin was gaining greater mainstream recognition.The frenzy around digital currencies took it to near US$20,000 the following year before it crashed, with the coin still trading about 50 per cent below 2017’s all-time highs.But Bitcoin has historically bottomed 459 days prior to the halving, risen leading into the event and exploded to the upside afterward, according to research from Pantera Capital. Post-halving rallies have averaged 446 days — should history repeat itself, Bitcoin could peak around August 2021.Wallet growth has also spiked, rising 2 per cent in April, the largest monthly increase since at least November. To Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research, there’s two possible explanations: bored, locked-down gamblers and sports betters are finding their way into cryptocurrencies amid the coronavirus shutdown, while many are also getting excited about Bitcoin’s halving, he wrote in a recent note.To be sure, many crypto fans also point to unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus unleashed by central banks around the world as a catalyst for prices to advance. Whatever the reason, the recent bull-run hype has ushered in the return of sky-high price targets.Global Macro Investor’s Raoul Pal projects Bitcoin could reach US$1 million in the next three- to five years. Though the halving isn’t the key driver behind his prediction, it could be a potential accelerant.“It is already the best performing asset in all recorded history,” Pal wrote in a recent presentation. “It was born out of the financial crisis for exactly what is about to come in this crisis. This is literally what Bitcoin was invented for.”Jefferies LLC analyst Christopher Wood in his weekly “Greed & Fear” newsletter recommended investors — including institutions — buy Bitcoin ahead of the halving, citing the token’s prior price surges around the event.“To invest in Bitcoin it is necessary to believe the system has integrity in the sense that the supply is truly limited,” he wrote. The digital token should be a source of diversification “precisely because of its truly decentralized nature,” he said.Critics can disparage Bitcoin as much as they like, but it's by far the best performing asset of the past decadeVenture capitalist Tim Draper predicts Bitcoin could hit US$250,000 by 2022 or the first quarter of 2023. “Bitcoin adoption will spread because Bitcoin is simply a better currency than any of the political currencies that are tied to governments and political whims,” he said, citing fiscal and monetary stimulus as possible accelerators for adoption.To Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing director of crypto-lender Nexo, Bitcoin could reach US$50,000 by the end of the year, implying a 470 per cent surge from current levels. Though the halving may already be priced in, it will lead to huge appreciation over time, he said.“Critics can disparage Bitcoin as much as they like, but it’s by far the best performing asset of the past decade,” he said. “We’re bullish about its future.”Trenchev is seeing “huge” demand for his firm’s products ahead of the coin’s halving. “We’re not hiring because of the halving per se. We’re hiring because the halving has been lifting Bitcoin and will continue to do so,” he said.A number of crypto exchanges have also embarked on hiring sprees. Kraken LLC and Binance Holdings Ltd. are expanding their workforces, as are OkEx and Coinbase Inc.David Janczewski, the chief executive officer and founder of Cardiff, Wales-based Coincover, said any market event that impacts adoption is a positive for his business.“That’s part of what we see — when the last spike happened, we know that an awful lot of people moved into the market because they felt they ought to get in on the action,” said Janczewski, whose firm offers insurance against crypto thefts and scams. “Ultimately, anything that causes the market to be aware, or wider investment markets to be aware of crypto, tends to be a good thing from our perspective.”Bloomberg.com"

Ridership is down significantly, and the company is maintaining a freeze on hiring, Khosrowshahi wrote in the email, which was reviewed by Bloomberg.Of the more than 450 driver centers Uber operates worldwide, 40% will shut down. The locations, called Greenlight Hubs, are used to sign people up to drive for Uber, teach them how to use the app and address issues that arise on the job. In March, as the virus was spreading in North America, Uber said it was temporarily closing all hubs in the U.S. and Canada.Khosrowshahi signaled that more “difficult adjustments” would be put forth in the next two weeks. “Days like this are brutal,” he wrote.This sort of painful day is becoming commonplace. Tech companies have eliminated more than 38,000 jobs in the past two months, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks the job market. Lyft Inc., the main alternative to Uber in North America, said last week it was dismissing 17% of staff, furloughing more and reducing salaries. Their longtime peer in the sharing economy, Airbnb Inc., said Tuesday the company was cutting a quarter of its workforce.The job losses are sudden for many, but at Uber, they may seem drawn out. After a disappointing initial public offering a year ago, Uber dismissed more than 1,000 employees over multiple rounds of cuts that extended from July to what Khosrowshahi described as a “last wave” in October. They were part of a drive toward profitability, which was expected to arrive by the end of this year.Uber has seen its landscape shift considerably since then. It instituted a hiring freeze in March, withdrew its financial forecast and wrote down some $2 billion worth of investments in April and said Monday it would shutter food delivery operations in seven countries.As of May 2, Khosrowshahi waived his salary for the remainder of the year, the company said. In 2019, he was eligible for a salary of $1 million and a bonus of $2 million, according to a securities filing. Uber is scheduled to report first-quarter financial results Thursday.The challenges posed by the virus could be matched by a new one this week from Uber’s home state. California sued Uber and Lyft Tuesday for allegedly flouting a state law designed to give gig-economy workers the benefits of employees. If the case is successful, the companies could be on the hook for substantial new costs that further jeopardize their business models.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

HSBC said that the gold market “became highly illiquid on news of refinery closings,” contributing to its unusual swings in trading profits in March.The price difference between the New York and London markets, usually no more than a few dollars an ounce, blew out to as much as $70. The divergence hit banks that are active in trading the so-called EFP, or Exchange for Physical, the mechanism by which traders switch positions between the New York and London markets.Read More: Nervous Bankers Leave Gold Market Stuck in DisconnectHSBC said that its trading revenue from metals had decreased due to “market volatility and unfavorable valuation adjustments on exchange for physical transactions.” It reported a $1 million loss in metals trading revenue for the quarter, compared with a $38 million profit for the same period a year earlier. The bank has reported metals trading revenues averaging $215 million a year in the past three years.Gold was not the only reason why HSBC’s trading models breached its daily expected profit-and-loss threshold so many times in the first quarter. The bank also cited volatility in credit spreads and interest rates in March, and said there were two unusual profits and one unusual loss in January because of volatility in palladium.

Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soonAs governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work, Trump said he’s pivoting to “phase two” of the nation’s response to the pandemic, a step that will include disbanding the White House coronavirus task force, a group of public health experts that has been advising the administration on how to confront the outbreak.The president has for more than a month clamored for a return to normal, stuck between the devastating human cost of the pandemic and the calamity that has befallen the economy as social-distancing measures pushed more than 30 million people into unemployment in a matter of weeks.Tuesday marked the first time he clearly and unreservedly laid out his own cost-benefit analysis of the situation.“Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,” Trump said. “But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.”On his visit to a Phoenix Honeywell International Inc. factory producing medical masks, Trump encouraged Americans to think of themselves as “warriors” as they consider leaving their homes, a tacit acknowledgment of deep public reservations about reopening the country too soon.The U.S. continues to endure the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world, with about 1.2 million people infected and more than 70,000 killed so far.Speaking separately in an ABC News interview broadcast on Tuesday evening, Trump said closing down the nation was “the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.”And while as recently as April 22, he criticized Georgia Governor Brian Kemp for reopening salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors and gyms, on Tuesday he was resolute about getting people back to work.“There’ll be more death,” he said. “The virus will pass, with or without a vaccine. And I think we’re doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, it’s going to pass, and we’re going to be back to normal.”“But it’s been a rough process. There is no question about it,” Trump said. “I think our economy is going to be raging” next year, he added.While in Phoenix, Trump encouraged states to ease social-distancing measures and allow businesses to reopen, though he cautioned that it should be done “safely.”Yet the president declined to set an example for the nation by engaging in one government-recommended safety protocol himself: wearing a face mask. As he toured the Honeywell plant, Trump wore only safety goggles. Music from his standard campaign rally soundtrack played over loudspeakers, including Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA” and Guns N’ Roses’s version of “Live and Let Die.”Senior White House officials also did not don the masks, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend when social distancing isn’t possible. Factory workers, members of the press and other support staff did. Trump also lamented that he had to stand six feet apart from two supporters during his speech, including one who was wearing a sequined denim vest with his campaign slogan.Trump said that “doctors” he didn’t name had advised him to close the economy “for a couple of years.”“I created, with a lot of other very talented people and the people of our country, the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest that we’ve ever had,” Trump said, referring to what had been the key argument of his re-election campaign. “And then one day they said, ‘we have to close our country.’ Well, now it’s time to open up.”Public-health experts have repeatedly warned the country risks a second wave of infections if restrictions are lifted too early, which could lead to another round of shutdowns and economic damage.But even as Trump said a full-scale reopening could lead to more deaths, he expressed optimism the virus would go away. And he added that if cases do rebound, it would be like a “fire” that could be extinguished “fast.”He also dismissed two new projections that painted a gruesome picture of what could happen if the country lifts shutdown orders too quickly: a Johns Hopkins University model showing deaths could reach 3,000 per day by June 1 and a University of Washington analysis showing the U.S. death toll could reach 135,000 by the beginning of August.The people of our country are warriors“These models have been so wrong from day one. Both on the low side and the upside. They’ve been so wrong, they’ve been so out of whack. And they keep making new models, new models and they’re wrong,” the president said.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said earlier Tuesday the Johns Hopkins model, included in a government document obtained Monday by the New York Times, relied on “faulty assumptions” about mitigation efforts and didn’t represent federal government projections.“The people of our country are warriors,” Trump said of Americans, some 69 per cent of whom are “somewhat” or “very” worried about contracting Covid-19, according to an analysis of polls by fivethirtyeight.com.Vice President Mike Pence said earlier Tuesday the White House has begun discussing disbanding the coronavirus task force, which could happen as soon as later this month.“Mike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but we’re now looking at a little bit of a different form and that form is safety and opening. And we’ll have a different group, probably, set up for that,” Trump said in Phoenix.When asked if the move meant he considers the mission of combating the virus to be accomplished, Trump replied: “No.”Bloomberg.com"

From buying bonds to paying wages, authorities are playing a role in the economy that was unimaginable even a few months ago.To be clear, it’s not like they had much choice. The alternative would have been to stand back and watch as companies fell and workers were left stranded, ultimately digging an even bigger economic hole to fill once the crisis passes.The challenge is how and when to unwind all of this support without setting off the kind of political and ideological bushfires that will burn for years. The longer authorities remain in the market — whether it’s a controlling stake in an airline or backstopping loans to energy companies — the greater the risk of collateral damage.The dilemma is real and will play out in legislatures and policy meetings for years to come. Cutting and running too soon risks stripping away a vital safety net that both companies and workers may still need. Staying too long risks crowding out private players.Big government may be back, but how long it’s welcome is another story.Global HeadlinesPhase two | President Donald Trump fixed his course on reopening the nation for business, acknowledging that the move would cause more illness and death from the pandemic but insisting it’s a cost he’s willing to pay to get the economy back on track. Trump presented the imminent easing of stay-at-home rules as a fait accompli, as governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work.Trump said White House officials are discussing disbanding the task force that has helmed the federal virus response efforts so far.Blame game | China’s ambassador to the U.S. said allegations faulting Beijing for the spread of the coronavirus risked a “decoupling” of the world’s two largest economies. In a column published in the Washington Post, Ambassador Cui Tiankai called for an end to the “blame game,” saying that increased suspicions threatened to hurt U.S.-China cooperation to fight the pandemic and restart the global economy. “It’s time to focus on the disease and rebuild trust between our two countries,” he said.Spreading charges | Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wanted to replace the chief of the federal police in Rio de Janeiro, where he built his political career, former Justice Minister Sergio Moro told investigators. The accusation adds to his previous one that Bolsonaro tried to meddle in police work by naming a family friend as top cop at the institution akin to the U.S.’s Federal Bureau of Investigation.Abandoning caution | The unusual unity that has permeated Germany since the pandemic arrived is starting to fray as pressure grows on Chancellor Angela Merkel to speed up the country’s exit from lockdown. With Europe’s biggest economy forecast to shrink 6.3% this year, business and industry lobbies are clamoring for Merkel to throw off her caution and allow more commerce. Merkel meets with state leaders today to forge a consensus on reopening.Getting closer | With a Friday deadline looming, Argentina and its biggest creditors are suggesting possible revisions to the country’s $65 billion debt restructuring proposal that could help break an impasse. While both sides are uncompromising in public, behind closed doors they are showing some willingness to improve the terms of the exchange and continue talks, Bloomberg reports. The pressure is still on, however: crucial bond payments come due May 22.What to WatchThe EU warned today that the 27-nation bloc is facing the deepest economic downturn in its history, threatening the future of the euro if the crisis is badly handled. Trump supports Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposal for a summit of the five UN Security Council permanent members and sent him a message describing the initiative as a “good idea,” the American ambassador to Moscow told the Interfax news service. Russian mercenaries are engaged in a large-scale effort in Libya to bolster eastern commander Khalifa Haftar providing technical support, direct involvement in combat operations and sophisticated influence campaigns, according to United Nations experts.

Try UraniumBy Clara Ferreira Marques(Bloomberg Opinion) — Uranium is having a moment in 2020, climbing a third in six weeks while much of the commodities universe melts down. Years of poor economics and weak investment, combined with the impact of pandemic-related mine closures, are adding up to a supply squeeze, despite demand softened by industrial lockdowns. There will be no swift return to lofty levels last seen over a decade ago, but the metal may still be the only one to end the year with a record shortage and higher prices.The start of the last bull run had plenty of similarities to today. Supply was suffering the effect of a long run of unimpressive prices. Thanks to revived interest in nuclear power, the spot market price for uranium surged by a factor of 13 between 2003 and 2007. That hastened a production splurge that put the industry into a steady downward slide, worsened by the Fukushima disaster in 2011. It then bumped along at levels that, adjusted for inflation, were near historic lows.With little incentive to explore or produce more at depressed prices, the supply-demand balance was still delicate even in 2019. Then the coronavirus epidemic struck, triggering even more curtailments at top producers Kazatomprom and Cameco Corp., among others. Canada’s Cameco has suspended production at its giant Cigar Lake mine in Saskatchewan. Kazakhstan’s behemoth, meanwhile, expects a deficit for 2020 and quoted third-party estimates Monday that primary uranium supply could decrease over 10% from a year earlier. Chinese operations in Nambia have been impacted.It’s true that almost all metals have seen a blow to supply from Covid-19, yet for the most part that’s dwarfed by the drop in demand from customers, whose own factories have been shut down. For uranium, despite some reactor closures and longer stretches of maintenance, appetite is a lot less flexible. Production has taken a worse hit. Analysts at BMO estimate that 2020 production expectations are already down by a fifth compared to earlier forecasts. Copper, despite stark headlines, has fallen a fraction of that. Only platinum, dented by restrictions in South Africa, has tumbled by anything like the same magnitude.The shock has been sharply felt. Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange are trading at around $34 per pound, up from $24 in mid-March. Shares in Cameco have almost doubled from March lows. Others have climbed, too: London-listed Yellow Cake Plc, which purchases and stores physical uranium, is up by roughly half. Exchange-traded funds like North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF and Horizons Global Uranium Index ETF have recovered from their 2020 nadirs.The real question is what happens next. Even $34 is far below the price required to encourage digging. A significant proportion of producers still don’t make money at those levels, once expenditures to maintain production are included. Meanwhile, utilities are sitting on a still-substantial four years or so of inventory and can afford to wait a little longer before piling in to buy, even if there is already anecdotal evidence of activity. It could take until almost the middle of the decade for them to get back to, say, three years of material.Yet a market now firmly in deficit will keep upward pressure on. Analysts at BMO estimate that the long-term incentive price for miners is close to $55, though existing idled assets could come back at above $40. Even an approval today won’t ease the squeeze fast: A new uranium operation takes years.Then there’s demand. Nuclear power is still growing despite fading enthusiasm in developed markets. It remains a key source of low-carbon energy, and that matters as traditional users find their reactors are aging, and need to be either decommissioned or replaced. Without nuclear energy, energy transition is tougher: The International Energy Agency estimates that over the past 50 years, nuclear power has avoided carbon dioxide emissions almost equivalent to two years of those related to global energy. Meanwhile, the U.S. has a renewed preoccupation with its reactors and reserves.There is always the risk of a return to past supply excesses when it comes to a metal that isn’t rare, in geological terms, and the potential exists for more recycling, too. For now, uranium has some rare radiance.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

The fund is managed by chief investment officer Francois Bourdon and two others.The fund invests in the residential and commercial construction sector through limited partnerships (LPs) with various partners that specialize in lending solutions. The fund also puts money into partnerships that offer private loans to companies and other types of loans.Nearly 64% of the fund’s loans are for housing projects, as of the end of February; 91% are in Canada or the U.S.“The Diversified Lending strategy has been progressively positioned for a cycle that was getting longer in the tooth, but not for a recession,” the company said in a fund document on its website. “The social distancing measures will have a negative impact on certain borrowers in the strategy; interest payments may be postponed and depending on the length of the measures, more workouts than expected may occur.”The fund was created in 2008 and has generated net annualized returns of 6.55% since inception, according to the company’s website. This year the fund was up 1.69% in the first quarter.The firm is telling clients the fund is well-diversified and could use its liquidity sources to satisfy investors in a fair manner, said one person who spoke on condition they not be named.A Fiera Capital spokesperson declined to comment.Montreal-based Fiera, which has 750 employees in North America and Europe, managed C$170 billion at the end of 2019. Its largest revenue line comes from handling institutional money. About 45% of its assets under management are in fixed income.‘Pandemic Effects’The coronavirus pandemic is buffeting Canada’s alternative lenders. Last month, Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors that it had gated its funds indefinitely “to maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.” The non-bank lender has C$1.6 billion in assets under management. Most of its direct lending funds are invested in collateral-based bridge loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn’t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported in March.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately C$2.6 billion. It didn’t say how long the freeze would last to “avoid building unrealistic expectations”.Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corp. have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to sources.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The board also cut the company’s quarterly dividend to 21 cents a share, from 46.5 cents.Suncor is joining a parade of global oil producers that are hunkering down as record low crude prices cause steep losses. In the first quarter, Suncor was able to shift output to higher priced light crude and its refined-product mix to higher-value distillate. The moves helped the company post a better-than-expected loss, excluding some items, of 20 cents a share.

He promised employees that the McLean, Virginia-based firm will give them at least six weeks’ notice once it decides to reopen those sites.That’s one of the strongest signs yet that legions of industry employees using makeshift work stations at home may have to wait much longer to return to their offices, even as many states begin lifting restrictions on public life. Capital One, which earns most of its revenue from its massive credit card business, said in late March that it had more than 40,000 people doing their jobs remotely online — accounting for more than three-quarters of its workforce.Many major financial firms have yet to publicly set dates for reopening offices as they grapple with numerous challenges, such as how to help employees safely commute, ascend elevators and navigate shared workspaces. And those that have weighed in on the topic have expressed caution. At Citigroup Inc., for example, President Jane Fraser said last month that the firm will conduct its own analyses of risks and won’t necessarily reopen offices just because local authorities issue all-clears.Capital One has spent years investing in technology and was among the first U.S. banks to announce it would transition to cloud computing. Those moves have helped the firm operate more effectively during this crisis, Fairbank said in the memo.Decisions to return will vary by location, dependent on local conditions, he said. Meanwhile, most of the lender’s branches have remained open, serving customers with drive-thru or from behind glass.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

She said the lender expects that 30 per cent to 80 per cent of employees may continue to work from home at least some of the time. The Toronto-based bank employed about 45,000 people as of Jan. 31.“We’ve been able to maintain continuity of banking services with far more people working outside the office than we ever thought possible,” Malone said Monday in an interview. “We thought it was critical that we were in the office to make something happen, and what we’ve proven through this is that’s actually not the case.”Chief Executive Officer Darryl White has said “a 2.0 version” of the workplace may include the blended home-and-office arrangements, as big employers worldwide reconfigure offices and routines. Malone said Canadian and U.S. branch employees have “by and large” been going into work during the crisis along with a “small amount” of technology and operations employees, while 95 per cent of those in office towers have been working from home.About two-thirds of the firm’s employees are in Canada, while 13,408 are in the U.S. and 1,578 overseas. The post-COVID plan involves more workers at home including “a ton” of employees with hybrid office-and-home roles, and fewer people working solely at company locations, Malone said.“It’s a blended approach of thinking about productivity and flexibility and for us not a return to the way it used to be,” she said. “It’s about an evolution in the way that we work.”We thought it was critical that we were in the office to make something happen, and what we've proven through this is that's actually not the caseAs with many companies worldwide, COVID-19 has already upended much of the workforce of Canada’s fourth-largest bank. For example, call-centre agents initially went into offices at the start of the outbreak. Then in the past month, the bank shifted half of its Canadian call-centre staff and 80 per cent of its U.S. agents to home offices.“That’s not a temporary thing,” Malone said. “We don’t have to think about contact centres as just these geographical hubs, and we can use this remote way of working.”The work-from-anywhere trend helps keep employees safe, Malone said. Crowding workers into office towers while dealing with mass transit, elevators and social distancing is “problematic.” She added that the new approach can also present recruitment possibilities.“It allows us to look for new talent in locations where maybe we haven’t before, and tap into talent pools across the country,” she said.The bank has already seen unexpected benefits in deal-making, as investment bankers use time once spent on commuting to communicate with clients. One investment banker in New York expressed surprise that “doing pitches virtually” has been a success, Malone said.“It’s causing this person who’s 25 years an investment banker to rethink what’s possible,” she said.Bloomberg.com"

Just over 5 per cent of respondents expect their purchases to increase and 54 per cent think they’ll spend the same amount on non-essential items.The data suggest damage from the crisis on consumer behaviour and confidence could be long lived, undermining the nation’s ability to recover quickly despite tens of billions of dollars in income support from the federal government.“Even with the eventual reopening of businesses, sales of non-essential items could be thin gruel compared to the pre-COVID-19 world,” pollster Nik Nanos said by email.There are notable regional differences in the numbers. Residents of Quebec, the French-speaking province with the highest number of cases in Canada, are much more likely to say their spending will decline once the economy reopens, with 41 per cent anticipating a drop in purchases.

That would be the smallest weekly gain since mid-March if confirmed by official data due Wednesday. Meanwhile, the discount on oil for June delivery relative to July narrowed to the least in a month, signalling that concerns of oversupply may be abating.The American oil benchmark has doubled from an intraday low near US$10 a barrel last week as OPEC and its allies start reducing production.

European oil major Total SA said Tuesday that demand remains well below supply, even with widespread output cuts. But Norwegian bank DNB ASA sees change coming.“We are currently seeing accelerating oil-production curtailments outside the OPEC+ countries,” said DNB analyst Helge Andre Martinsen. “Even though the oil-market balance still looks quite oversupplied in the very short-term, we believe this is about to change quite quickly.”In a sign of the mammoth task ahead, crude supplies from the Middle East soared to their highest level since at least January 2017 last month.

Last week he said the city’s retail outlets would be allowed to open May 11; the new date is May 18.Next door in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford indicated he would continue to take a slow approach to restarting Canada’s biggest provincial economy. Ford said the province is getting close to allowing more retail stores to open for curbside pickup — as long as virus cases continue to decline. He didn’t give a date.Getting back to business is proving to be no easy task, even as the Canadian economy continues to buckle under the strain of shutdowns. The two neighbouring provinces account for more than 55 per cent of the country’s GDP but have been the epicentre of its virus cases, with 93 per cent of Canada’s deaths as of Monday.The next dilemma for Quebec is whether to stick to a planned May 19 reopening of primary schools and daycares in Montreal. “It’s out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitals, while we have very little room for maneuver in Montreal,” Legault told reporters in Quebec City.Most of Quebec’s 1,772 hospitalized COVID-19 patients are in the Montreal region, which has enough beds for now but where the situation is “very tight,” he said.Quebec’s death tally rose to 2,280 Monday, with 32,623 confirmed cases. Deaths now register 267 per million people, higher than the U.S. at 208 and more than double Canada at 101, according to Quebec’s public health institute. The problem for both Quebec and Ontario has been severe outbreaks at long-term care facilities, which account for about 80 per cent of fatalities.It's out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitalsMeanwhile, fresh evidence arrived Monday that the economic strain continues to build. Figures showed companies took out loans at the fastest pace since 1981 in March. Employment data due on Friday may show the economy lost more than 4 million jobs in April, a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decline on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Still, stores outside of Montreal were allowed to reopen Tuesday with manufacturing and construction still planned to restart everywhere in Quebec on May 11.In Ontario, only a handful of businesses were allowed to get back to business on Monday, including garden centres offering curbside pickup, automatic car washes and a few more essential construction projects. Ontario has 17,923 cases and 1,300 deaths.However, the province is getting close to relaxing restrictions on retail if infection numbers continue to improve, Ford said.“It’s inevitable. The numbers keep going down. We’re going to get the economy going based on health and science,” he said at a news conference in Toronto. “Just because we open up these stores it doesn’t mean it’s a free-for-all.”Bloomberg.com"

That follows the record 1-million decline in March, when the Canadian economy was essentially shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.April is the first full month that strict social distancing measures and the closing of non essential business were in effect. Several provinces in Canada are starting to slowly reopen, which may allow workers to get rehired in May and beyond.Of the 18 economists surveyed, 12 predicted a drop of 4 million or more. Estimates ranged between 1.2 million to 5.5 million, with the median forecast at 4.3 million lost jobs. Economists expect the unemployment rate to hit about 18%, more than double the 7.8% rate in March.The Canadian government has softened the blow by introducing an emergency wage benefit to cover workers who have lost work as the nation aims to halt the spread of the virus. A total of 6.7 million people had applied for compensation as of April 19, a day after Statistics Canada had completed its survey.It’s a different picture this time around for the composition of the job losses. In previous Canadian recessions, it was men and those employed in manufacturing and construction who bore the brunt of the downturn. This time, it’s part-time workers and women who have been most affected, the March data show.Job posting data suggest the labor market carnage may be hitting a plateau. While postings have been down significantly on a year-over-year basis, they started to level off toward the end of April, figures from Indeed Canada show. The services sector has been hardest hit particularly within tourism, education and food services.Labor market destruction isn’t unique to Canada. In the U.S., the median forecast of economists calls for an eye-popping 21 million plunge in payrolls, the most in records back to 1939.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

Yet the number of open positions has dwindled as layoffs become more common and many of the jobs that do exist are temporary.Vangst, which runs the Gigs site for temporary pot jobs and recently launched a platform for full-time positions, is filling about 600 jobs a week. That’s a slight decrease from pre-COVID-19 levels earlier this year, mostly because companies are employing fewer in-store staff as they switch to delivery or curbside pickup. Meanwhile, the number of job candidates on the platform surged by 300 per cent between March and April, according to Karson Humiston, founder and chief executive officer of Vangst.“We’ve seen a huge uptick in candidates, and we’re seeing a large number of candidates coming from hospitality and retail,” Humiston said in a phone interview. “When our clients do pick up hiring again, they’re going to have access to a really strong talent pool.”Of the temporary jobs that are being filled on Vangst’s Gigs platform, about half are replacements for employees who are unable to work and the other half are for normal seasonal work related to harvests or packaging, she said.The cannabis sector employed 243,700 people at the beginning of 2020, up 15 per cent from the prior year and nearly double the number of jobs in 2017, according to data from cannabis information firm Leafly. However, that number has been shrinking as companies that grew too fast and are now dealing with pandemic-related disruptions cut back.Canopy Growth Corp. said Wednesday that it’s cutting 200 jobs in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K., about 5 per cent of its total workforce. That’s on top of 500 positions that were eliminated in early March when it closed two facilities in British Columbia.“When you have the largest cannabis company in the world laying off 700 people, that’s a signal of what’s going on in the broader market,” Humiston said. “We were already seeing that on the full-time side of our business and then COVID-19 came and exacerbated it.”Not everyone is cutting back, however. Trulieve Cannabis Corp., one of the largest U.S. cannabis companies by market value, has hired around 250 people since the pandemic started and still has about 150 open positions.The Florida-based company has doubled the number of vehicles in its delivery fleet and saw its call centre volume spike from 25,000 calls a week to 65,000 as customers adapted to the new realities of pandemic shopping. It’s been hiring employees for both segments of the business, as well as for its dispensaries, said CEO Kim Rivers.At first Trulieve was hiring to replace people who had to take time off, but “at this point it really is actual hiring, adding to the workforce,” Rivers said in a phone interview. Despite the pandemic, Trulieve opened a new dispensary in Titusville, Florida on April 18 and plans to open another one in the next week or so.Rivers said it remains to be seen whether the pandemic-related expansion remains in place once things return to normal, but she’s hopeful Trulieve will be able to keep the employees it’s hired.“We prefer to not lose folks who have experience within the company, and there may be other roles that folks could shift into as well because we are continuing to grow,” she said.Bloomberg.com"

The gauge remains near all-time lows after plummeting as millions of Canadians lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The results suggest income support programs have helped put a floor under consumer confidence amid economy-wide shutdowns.

Both are for sale by owner.Musk, 48, posted more than a dozen tweets in less than 75 minutes on Friday, including one in which he said he’s selling “almost all” of his physical possessions. In another, he said he believed Tesla’s stock price was too high, prompting a 10 per cent plunge on the day.As for high-end Los Angeles real estate, it’s not exactly a seller’s market at the moment. Sales of luxury homes already were suffering from a supply glut and weak demand before the coronavirus pandemic stopped most showings. Fewer buyers were coming from China, Russia and the Middle East amid international tensions, and limits on state and local tax deductions dampened the appeal of owning California homes for wealthy U.S. buyers.With demand slowing, more and more would-be sellers are taking their homes off the market, said Beverly Hills real estate agent Jade Mills. But shrinking inventory means some homes will still find buyers.“People are still having to move and relocate, even within California,” she said. “I’m seeing people still having to buy and sell. This isn’t necessarily bad timing.”Even with Friday’s stock swoon and the pandemic, Musk and Tesla are having a pretty good 2020.The shares surged 68 per cent this year through Friday, helping to boost his net worth by US$8.3 billion, the second-most of anyone in the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person.

The decision will likely cost him more than $1 million in loss of salary and unvested Amazon stock, “not to mention the best job I ever had,” he said. Amazon has been fighting the spread of coronavirus cases in its logistics network and a public-relations battle against critics who say the company hasn’t done enough to make warehouses safe. Small groups of workers at facilities around the U.S. have walked off the job in protest, and an employee activist group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, called for corporate employees to call in sick after two of its members were fired.Amazon has said the workers were fired for violating corporate policy forbidding them from speaking publicly about internal matters. The company declined to comment on Bray’s resignation.Bray, who last year signed the employee group’s open letter urging Amazon to do more to fight climate change, said he raised concerns about the firings internally. Having done that, he said, “remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised. So I resigned.” He said he believed both that Amazon was making massive investments to keep workers safe during the pandemic, and that workers who have spoken out have legitimate concerns. In the essay, Bray said the company was treating warehouse workers like “fungible units of pick-and-pack potential.” He chalked up some of what he sees as Amazon’s failings to its success in a capitalist system not set up incentivize good treatment of workers.“Amazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them. It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power. If we don’t like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things. We don’t need to invent anything new; a combination of antitrust and living-wage and worker-empowerment legislation, rigorously enforced, offers a clear path forward, Bray wrote.Don’t say it can’t be done, because France is doing it.”“Firing whistleblowers isn’t just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets,” Bray wrote. “It’s evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison.”Bray, whose last day was Friday, said that Amazon Web Services, the division he worked for, treated workers humanely and “is by and large an ethical organization.”Bloomberg.com"

That was only two weeks” of the economic shutdown.Companies still need to get through July and into winter. When they do open up it won’t be easy for them to “make enough money in their restaurants or elsewhere to cover their variable costs, let alone their rent,” he said.Canada’s federal and provincial governments crafted a plan to help companies with rent for April, May and June. The program offers forgivable loans to commercial landlords, while business tenants pay no more than 25 per cent of their usual rent.But only firms with less than $20 million (US$14 million) in gross annual revenue can apply for the subsidy. And those who are eligible must show at least a 70 per cent drop in revenue compared with pre-virus times.Cooper said his companies would try to use the program. “But in the meantime, people have paid April’s rent, tomorrow’s May 1, so there’s a lot of confusion,” he said. “Hopefully it will work out over time, but it won’t be working out smoothly.”Dream Office REIT holds a portfolio of office buildings with about 6 million square feet of space, the majority of it in downtown Toronto. His group also runs Dream Industrial REIT, which owns industrial property in Canada, the U.S. and Europe.The commercial real estate market won’t return to normal for a couple of years, Cooper said.“Really, 2022 is going to be a time frame where you can look at what the value of a building is and deal with it with confidence — you know what the rental rates are, what the demand is,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

It’s a time when Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders converge on Nebraska to eat Dairy Queen ice cream, sample See’s Candies and, most importantly, hear the wit and wisdom of one of the world’s most successful investors.The booths offering sweet treats will be missing on Saturday, as will the tens of thousands of attendees. Even the location is being kept under wraps. But Buffett and a top deputy, Greg Abel, will be there, doing their best in a virtual meeting to make sense of an economy upended by the coronavirus pandemic.Even without the event’s usual trappings, interest is, if anything, even more intense than usual. Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, has been relatively quiet over the past month as the global response to the pandemic escalated, drawing questions about his view of what might be in store for the markets, Berkshire’s businesses and the global economy.“The tone will be different,” said Richard Cook, a shareholder who has missed just two meetings since attending his first in 1997. “I’ll certainly miss all these chances to see all those friends.”Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said this year’s event will likely lack “the celebratory feel that it had in the past.”There’s clearly very little to celebrate with the world in lockdown. In one of Buffett’s only public comments since the outbreak caused companies and communities to shut down across the U.S., the CEO in March called oil volatility and the panic hitting markets a “big one-two punch.”His Berkshire Hathaway has likewise stayed in the shadows, a contrast to the financial crisis in 2008, when the Omaha-based company dipped into its vast cash reserves to gain lucrative preferred shares and rescue businesses teetering on the edge of collapse.Buffett, now with roughly $128 billion in cash, hasn’t announced any large public deals even as the S&P 500 tumbled 20% in the first quarter.Charlie Munger, a Berkshire vice chairman who in normal years fields questions at the meeting with Buffett, offered one explanation in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in early April. The conglomerate wants to come out of the coronavirus “typhoon” with lots of liquidity, Munger said, adding that many corporate executives are frozen in place as they try to figure out how to handle the crisis.Berkshire’s phone isn’t ringing off the hook, he told the newspaper.Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, said it’s possible Berkshire will still make a move. “But the other thing is, when you have the government becoming the lender of last resort, you don’t necessarily need Berkshire to be the lender of last resort,” she said.Berkshire plans to start its event at 3:45 p.m. Omaha time on Saturday, with Buffett and Abel fielding questions shareholders sent to three hand-picked journalists. The company is set to release first-quarter results earlier that day.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysThe decline in Berkshire's equity portfolio was about $66 billion at quarter end, and a steep drop in Berkshire's stock increases the potential for buybacksThe company warned that the pair would steer clear of political questions and discussions about specific holdings at the meeting, which has morphed from a small gathering in the lunchroom of one of Buffett’s insurers into a sprawling event the billionaire has called a “Woodstock for Capitalists.”Here are some of the topics that might come up:The company’s first-quarter earnings report will give investors a better sense of whether Buffett and his investing deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, found opportunities in the turmoil caused by the virus.Berkshire’s quarterly filing usually discloses how much in stocks the company purchased during the quarter and the total size of the investment portfolio, including its largest holdings. Berkshire recently disclosed that it pared back stakes in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co.Buffett’s bet on Occidental Petroleum Corp., made just before his annual meeting last year, may draw questions. The oil producer slashed its common stock dividend in March for the first time in three decades as the plunge in oil prices weighed on the company.As part of Buffett’s investment, Berkshire obtained preferred stock that helped finance Occidental’s US$37 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. That investment pays a hefty 8 per cent annual dividend. But Occidental recently opted to pay Berkshire’s quarterly dividend in shares rather than cash as the company looks for ways to conserve funds. In some ways, the Berkshire dividend that Occidental has to meet has ended up leaving others worse off, according to KBW’s Shields.“I certainly don’t think that was the intention, but I think it may be a bit of a discouragement from some people looking at Berkshire capital and saying, ‘Hey, this is expensive, but it’s got this great ringing endorsement,’ because that’s not how it’s working out,” Shields said.Berkshire’s also been building a common stock investment in Occidental, a stake that was valued at about US$780 million at the end of 2019.Chubb Ltd. CEO Evan Greenberg had a stark warning about the effect of the pandemic and shutdowns: It will likely be the largest event in insurance-industry history because it affects both sides of the balance sheet.Berkshire owns a collection of companies in the industry, with some that offer commercial-property insurance, workers’ compensation coverage and health-care liability policies. And some of its companies are reinsurers, which essentially write policies for other insurers.Auto insurers, such as Berkshire’s Geico, have actually returned some funds or offered premium credits to consumers as driving decreases, which could translate into fewer accidents. The industry may also see potential claims from canceled events and workers’ compensation insurance.“It’s so different based on the insurance product line,” Shields said. “There are some lines that have major questions,” especially with business-interruption coverage.Buffett, 89, and Munger, 96, routinely field questions about succession at the conglomerate. Berkshire’s decision in early 2018 to appoint Abel and Ajit Jain to the board was part of a movement to address succession, Buffett said at the time.Still, both Abel and Jain have remained behind the scenes to some extent, tending to Berkshire’s collection of businesses. Buffett told investors in this year’s annual letter that the pair would field more questions at this year’s annual meeting. But now only Abel, who lives closer to Omaha, will join Buffett at the event.“It’s really, really important,” Shields said. While there’s no indication that any change would happen now, “at some point in time, it’s not just that one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett, it’s that maybe one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett in a period of unprecedented change.”Coronavirus fallout will hit Berkshire in varying ways. See’s Candies began furloughing workers in early April due to the shutdown of its stores. On the other hand, analysts at UBS Group AG expect an improvement in BNSF’s margins in the first quarter.Munger told the Wall Street Journal that Berkshire will probably have to shut some small businesses, though the story didn’t name any specific units.Still, Berkshire’s breadth — with businesses in energy and retail and industrial operations — gives the conglomerate a sense of the broader economy, especially through units such as the railroad, BNSF.“Buffett has access to a set of data about the U.S. economy through all of his subsidiaries,” Cook said.Bloomberg.com"

The company should also scrap its dual-class shares to boost returns, the Australian fund with US$1.6 billion in assets said in a letter to the board.“There’s been a very steady de-rating of the company versus its peers over the last five years and if they continue to do nothing they can only see that continue,” said Tribeca partner Ben Cleary, citing overhauls at Teck rivals Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group as examples of a better way forward.A spokesman for Vancouver-based Teck said the company hasn’t received the letter. “I can point out though that Don received 98 per cent votes in favour of appointment at our recent AGM,” Doug Brown, director of public affairs, said by phone.“The Board has full confidence in Don Lindsay and the rest of Teck’s management,” Sheila Murray, Teck’s chairwoman, said in an emailed statement.Tribeca faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Teck, Canada’s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades. Tribeca holds a 1.8 per cent stake, worth about US$85 million at the current share price.The activist pressure comes at a difficult time for Teck, whose stock has tumbled about 60 per cent in the last 12 months amid the oil rout and the plunge in prices for its copper, zinc and steel-making coal. The company’s market value has dropped below US$5 billion, after touching a four-year low last month.The miner has been forced to temporarily suspend its Quebrada Blanca copper expansion in Chile because of the coronavirus pandemic, while its metallurgical coal and energy divisions have been beset with problems this year. The miner is considering halting production at the Fort Hills oil sands mine in Alberta, and pulled the plug on a planned multi-billion oil project in February.Tribeca, a Teck holder for three years, is launching its campaign now because “enough is enough,” Cleary said in a phone interview from Singapore, where he works for the Sydney-based firm.Tribeca’s previous activist campaign against BHP, which coincided with a similar push by Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp., helped prompt the world’s biggest miner to sell a suite of U.S. shale assets and reshuffle its board, resulting in billions of dollars returned to investors, the fund says.Cleary said Tribeca had held informal discussions with other major Teck investors about its complaints. He declined to name them and said Tribeca wasn’t working with other investors. Teck’s biggest institutional shareholders include China Investment Corp., the sovereign wealth fund, according to Bloomberg data.While Lindsay has previously said the zinc and copper division could be twice the size of its coal arm once the Quebrada Blanca mine is fully developed, and has raised the possibility of spinning off oil assets, the changes would require a fundamental shift for the company.Last year the coal and metals segments each accounted for roughly 46 per cent of revenue, with energy making up the rest. Tribeca is calling for Teck to sell or spin off its 21 per cent stake in the Fort Hills oil project and unload its coal business to focus on copper, zinc and possibly nickel.The fund also expressed frustration with the board and questioned why it hasn’t sought to oust Lindsay, who has been in charge since 2005, making him one of the longest-serving CEOs in the sector. Over that time, Teck’s shares have dropped more than a quarter including dividends, lagging gains by Rio Tinto and BHP.“There is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 years,” the fund says in its letter.There is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 yearsTeck shares would also get a boost from scrapping the dual-class shares, making the company a take-over target, the fund argues in its letter dated April 30.Family patriach Norman Keevil stepped down as chairman in 2018, though his son Norman Keevil III remains on the board as vice chairman. Former Chairman Dominic Barton, now Canada’s ambassador to China, said two years ago that neither family control nor the dual-class shares are going anywhere.“I don’t see this as a ‘Keevils or nothing’ issue because the Keevils want to make money as much as the minority shareholders want to maximize their investment,” Cleary said, adding Tribeca has expressed its concerns to the family. Even if the share structure were left alone, Teck could undertake the other measures and enjoy a substantial boost, he said.The hedge fund’s campaign to push Teck out of the fossil-fuels business isn’t driven by green ideology. A good portion of the fund’s investments are in oil transportation and service providers. The metallurgical coal produced by Teck is used mainly for steel making and not for burning in power plants.Even so, it believes that cutting off oil and coal would attract the rising pool of pension funds and family offices that are restricting their investments in companies based on their environmental impact.“You can either do something now and see a material upside or you can continue to de-rate and be an orphan stock in the global materials universe,” Cleary said.Bloomberg.com"

This is not democratic, this is not freedom,” the chief executive officer said after reporting Tesla’s first-ever profit to start a year. “Give people back their goddamn freedom.”Tesla is worried about being able to resume production in the San Francisco Bay area, where authorities have extended a stay-home order to the end of May. The Model 3 maker’s only assembly plant in the U.S. still produces the majority of the company’s cars and has been idle since March 23.Investors shrugged off the outburst, with Tesla shares finishing the late trading session up 8.7 per cent. The company’s third straight quarterly profit and revenue of almost US$6 billion both beat analysts’ estimates, extending an advance for a stock that’s already the biggest gainer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index this year.“It was vintage Elon. I wish he hadn’t done it,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said by phone. “But most investors don’t care. It doesn’t change the reality, which is that Tesla is making meaningful progress toward being a major player in the auto industry.”The stock surge Musk, 48, has engineered by producing and delivering more cars than expected early this year has positioned him to receive the first set of stock options from a pay package that set moonshot goals two years ago.By continuing to build up the shares, bulls are overlooking uncertainty about how soon the company will be able to resume production at its sole U.S. vehicle-assembly plant in Fremont, California, or how eager consumers will be to purchase Tesla cars once health orders are loosened and lifted.“It is difficult to predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and its global supply chain will return to prior levels,” Tesla said in its quarterly update. “Due to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance of net income and free cash flow would likely be inaccurate. We will again revisit our 2020 guidance in our Q2 update.”During the debut quarter for the new Model Y crossover, automotive gross margin improved to 25.5 per cent, the highest in a year and a half.While Tesla stopped short of restating its January forecast for deliveries to “comfortably” exceed 500,000 vehicles this year, the company said it believes it can achieve industry-leading operating margins and profitability.“Gross margin was mostly the thing that sticks out to me on the positive side,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla, said by phone. “On the question-mark side, I have to wonder why they didn’t talk about demand at all.”Tesla managed to build about 14,000 more vehicles than it handed over to customers in the quarter, despite being forced to suspend production at its factory in California late last month. Inventory build-up led the company to burn through about US$895 million in cash during the period. Tesla still ended March with US$8.1 billion on its balance sheet after raising money through a stock offering in February.Musk will postpone initial deliveries of Tesla’s semi truck again to 2021 — roughly two years later than initially planned — as the company prioritizes starting output of the Model Y crossover in Shanghai and building a factory in Germany from which it aims to begin shipping cars in the middle of next year.“Tesla investors are looking past the June quarter,” Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who rates the stock a hold, said by phone. “The bulls could take this and run.”Bloomberg.com"

Sales rose 15 per cent to US$35 billion. That compares with average Wall Street estimates for US$1.28 a share in profit and US$34 billion in sales, according to Bloomberg data.

The statement repeated language from March 15 saying the committee would keep the benchmark target range near zero “until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.”U.S. stocks held gains after the Fed’s statement while yields on 10-year Treasury notes edged up slightly to 0.62 per cent.Regarding asset purchases, the FOMC used wording similar to last month, saying the buying of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities will continue “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.”Wednesday’s statement acknowledged the extent and breadth of the damage being wraught by the ongoing contagion.“The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world,” the committee said. “The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.”It made specific mention of lower oil prices and their role in holding down inflation.Policy makers also began to extend cautiously the time frame within which they see the economic blow from the virus lasting, though they are still offering no precise forecast.“The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,” the committee said.The central bank has mounted an unprecedented push to limit the economic harm of the virus, which has plunged the global economy into recession and likely sent U.S. unemployment well above 10% after businesses shuttered to slow the contagion.Government data released earlier on Wednesday showed U.S. gross domestic product shrank at an annualized 4.8 per cent rate in the first quarter, the largest drop since 2008. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep rates near zero for three or more years.Policy makers last month slashed their benchmark rate and launched a massive bond-buying campaign to stabilize markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities that had become dangerously unsettled amid the pandemic. The federal funds rate has stood in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent since mid-March.The central bank’s Board of Governors has also responded to the crisis by announcing nine extraordinary lending programs, pledging to make funds available to banks, money market funds, companies, cities and states in an unprecedented use of the Fed’s emergency powers.Bloomberg.com"

Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.That will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Despite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus’s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn’t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what’s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP — the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 — compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Consumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn’t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"

Oanh Ha,Legal jargon on cruise tickets may foil class-action suits,"‘If you print out one of these tickets, it's like 20 pages of gobbledygook. Most people have no idea the limitations they're presented with’",https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/legal-jargon-on-cruise-tickets-may-foil-virus-class-action-suits,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/cruise.jpg,"April 29, 2020 5:01 AM EDT","After two passengers on their luxury cruise tested positive for Covid-19 in March, Emilio and Barbara Hernandez were so frantic to get off the ship, they wrote a note to the captain.The Costa Luminosa sailed on with them still onboard, and they ended up with the virus. Now recovering, the Hernandezes and 98 fellow passengers have sued Costa Cruise Lines Inc., a brand owned by Carnival Corp., alleging the firm endangered passengers’ lives through negligence and bad decision-making.A Costa spokeswoman said the company stepped up its sanitation of ships and then took action, including quarantining passengers, after it learned of the positive test results.The Hernandezes and their fellow plaintiffs are seeking class-action status. They may have rough sailing ahead.The tickets that cruise passengers buy resemble legal contracts, and they generally contain language barring customers from filing class-action suits – lawsuits that allow one or more plaintiffs to act on behalf of a larger group. That’s just one of several built-in legal protections in cruise tickets meant to safeguard companies against a rash of litigation that’s already arising from the coronavirus pandemic.“These claims are enormous – nothing the industry’s seen before with so many passengers fallen sick and bringing suit,” said Martin Davies, director of the Tulane Maritime Law Center at Tulane University Law School. Any judgments would be paid out of an insurance pool that the cruise lines have formed, Davies said.Currently, no cruise company faces more claims related to the virus than Carnival, the industry’s largest operator. At least 22 lawsuits have been filed against Carnival-owned companies, seeking millions of dollars in damages. The company said it doesn’t comment on active litigation.By comparison, Celebrity Cruises, owned by the second-largest company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., faces just one U.S. lawsuit so far: a proposed class-action filed by crew members who allege Celebrity failed to protect them from the virus. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., the third largest, faces a shareholder lawsuit that alleges the company failed to disclose adverse facts that affected it due to COVID-19. Lawyers say passenger suits against other cruise companies are probably coming.Some of the virus-related claims, including the Hernandezes’ case, seek class-action status and involve multiple plaintiffs, totaling almost 200 so far.But suits seeking class-action certifications face an “uphill battle,” Davies said, because of language contained in the passengers’ tickets. “Provided that’s what the contract says, generally the courts will find that enforceable.”It’s not uncommon for big businesses of all sorts to insist on class-action waivers in their contracts, but cruise operators have a range of other legal protections as well. Some of them stem from byzantine maritime laws that date to the 19th Century, when policy makers wanted to encourage investment in the shipping industry.“If you print out one of these tickets, it’s like 20 pages of gobbledygook,” said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer. Hickey, who spent almost two decades defending cruise operators in court, now represents plaintiffs against them. “Most people have no idea the limitations they’re presented with.”For example, judgments for deaths that occur far from U.S. ports are limited by the Death on the High Seas Act, enacted in 1920. Most ticket contracts limit any legal actions to select federal courts, predominantly in Florida or Los Angeles, no matter where the customers live. And most of them require passengers to notify a cruise operator within six months that they intend to sue.In general, cruise industry representatives say it’s unfair to single out cruise operators, who they say implemented more aggressive screening and prevention measures related to COVID-19 than other travel sectors did.Cruise lines “took immediate and aggressive action based on the information that was available when it was available every step of the way,” said Bari Golin-Blaugrund, a spokeswoman for the Cruise Lines International Association. “Importantly, all decisions were based upon the expertise and guidance of prevailing health authorities.”The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 14 ordered cruise ships in U.S. waters to suspend operations after travellers on more than 30 voyages were infected with COVID-19.The Hernandezes’ tickets for the Costa Luminosa contained a “patently unfair” prohibition on class actions, said their lawyer, Michael Winkleman of Florida. He acknowledged “significant hurdles” for their lawsuit, which alleges that the bar on class actions should be voided because Costa Cruise Lines acted “intentionally by exposing passengers to a highly contagious virus” for which there’s no vaccine.If the case isn’t certified as a class action, Winkleman said, he intends to file cases for the plaintiffs individually or in smaller groups. Class-action lawsuits, which can result in larger judgments or settlements, can help to move cases more swiftly for plaintiffs. Most plaintiffs’ law firms that pursue them do so on a “no win, no fee” basis, banking on bigger payouts, said Davies, the maritime-law professor.“The ship never should have sailed,” Emilio Hernandez, 51, said in an interview. “They put profit over the safety of passengers and crew.”He and his wife almost canceled their March 5 sailing on the Costa Luminosa to Antigua and Europe, but Costa assured them precautions would be taken, he said. Their lawsuit alleges that the operator proceeded with the trip despite knowing that at least one passenger from the ship’s previous voyage, who disembarked Feb. 29, had coronavirus symptoms.That passenger left for a medical emergency that was “not even connected to any flu-like symptoms,” said Rossella Carrara, a spokeswoman for the cruise operator’s Italian parent company, Costa Crociere Group, which is also owned by Carnival.Sanitation procedures on the ship were stepped up ahead of the Hernandezes’ cruise, Carrara said, and a quarantine of all passengers and other measures, such as daily temperature checks, were adopted after the company learned of positive test results.Costa has said previously that the company passed information to Costa Luminosa passengers as soon as it received it and that it suspended new cruises on March 13, the day it learned that a passenger on its cruise had tested positive.Many of the coronavirus lawsuits filed thus far argue that the companies should have known how infectious the pathogen was after an outbreak in late February on the Diamond Princess, which is operated by Carnival’s Princess Cruise Lines Ltd. What began as fewer than a dozen infections quickly spread to more than 700 passengers and eventually killed at least 13 despite a quarantine of the vessel off Yokohama, Japan.Lawsuits filed by passengers of another Princess vessel, the Grand Princess, allege that the cruise line knew some people aboard had Covid-19 symptoms when the ship docked and boarded new passengers in San Francisco on Feb. 21 for a cruise to Hawaii. The two symptomatic passengers disembarked that day; one tested positive shortly afterward and died, prompting California officials to refuse to let the ship dock.The Grand Princess suits, filed by lawyer Debi Chalik, claim that the cruise operator alerted passengers of the ship’s previous cruise about potential Covid-19 exposure in a Feb. 25 email, but didn’t warn passengers on its Hawaii cruise. Chalik’s office said it’s representing dozens of plaintiffs.A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises said the company’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak “has focused on the well-being of our guests and crew within the parameters dictated to us by the government agencies involved and the evolving medical understanding of this new illness.” She said the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation.On March 4, Carnival’s Chief Medical Officer, Grant Tarling, notified passengers and crew on the Grand Princess that the CDC was investigating a cluster of coronavirus cases connected to the previous voyage, according to the Princess website. It warned the 60 or so guests who also had sailed on that trip that they “may have been exposed.” It was then – two weeks after the voyage began – that testing started, the suits allege.When the ship was finally permitted to dock, 21 people tested positive. All American travelers were quarantined on U.S. military bases.Carnival’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Arnold Donald, told Bloomberg Businessweek in an April 16 article that his company’s response was reasonable under the circumstances. “This is a generational global event — it’s unprecedented,” he said.Before the new coronavirus, the cruise industry had generally avoided large-scale litigation over infectious disease outbreaks at sea. Since 2006, there’d been fewer than 10 lawsuits filed over norovirus, the notorious gastrointestinal ailment that for years has ruined some passengers’ experiences.Yet many of the Covid-19 lawsuits raise questions about the inspections that U.S. officials instituted in response to norovirus outbreaks. Plaintiffs in the Grand Princess suits claim the cruise operator didn’t adequately sanitize the vessel between voyages. And Winkleman, the Hernandezes’ lawyer, said he plans to focus part of his cases on Carnival’s record of ship inspections and history of outbreaks at sea.The Costa Luminosa and the Grand Princess both have unremarkable inspection records. Ships need an 86 or higher to pass under the CDC’s Vessel Sanitation Program. The Costa Luminosa was last inspected on Jan. 5 and received a 94. The Grand Princess passed its last inspection in June with a 93.The program subjects ships that dock at U.S. ports to surprise inspections twice a year. Since 2016, ships owned by Carnival fail about 3% of their inspections. Norwegian Cruise Line has the worst failure rate at 4% and Royal Caribbean’s rate is about 1%.Carnival spokesman Roger Frizzell noted that the company makes up about half the industry, and said its ships “typically perform extremely well” during inspections. He said Carnival-owned ships have received the highest number of perfect scores as well.For now, with cruises canceled and the industry in a kind of suspended animation, the lawsuits and their claims represent a potential challenge that cruise operators haven’t seen before, said Ross Klein, an associate dean at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada who has studied the cruise industry for more than two decades. “There are still a lot of ifs” about the success of the legal claims, he said, but the risk for the companies is there.“The industry hasn’t had any calamitous losses – nothing that would be potentially as large as this if the cases proceed in court,” Klein said.  Bloomberg.com"

Outbreaks have shut down almost a third of U.S. pork capacity and the growing wave of disruptions has spurred plans by President Donald Trump to order meat-processing plants to remain open. In Canada, Cargill Inc. has idled its beef plant in High River, Alberta, which accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada’s processing capacity while JBS SA’s beef plant in Brooks, Alberta, is running at about half capacity.Quebec-based Goodfood Market Corp., which delivers meals on a subscription basis, said it will be substituting its regular boneless chicken for bone-in thighs, legs and drumsticks as the poultry industry shifts away from de-boning to ramp up production.“Poultry suppliers are still facing labour shortages and many of them are operating with less than 50 per cent of their regular workforce,” Goodfood Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Ferrari wrote in an email to customers. “To ensure the essential supply of chicken for Canadians across the country, the poultry industry as a whole is shifting away from de-boning chicken legs to increase their production capacity.”Ferrari also wrote that the company is working to secure a frozen beef supply in case shutdowns at Alberta’s beef suppliers disrupt the supply chain.Grocers generally are accepting cuts of meat that require more cutting by their in-house butchers to keep their meat counters as full as possible, said Michael Young, president of Canada Beef.Meat such as sirloin and strip loins that would have typically been sent to restaurants before the pandemic shuttered businesses are now increasingly sold by retailers who are offering them in different sizes to get the price point down, he said. Companies are taking products that would have been used by the food service industry and redirecting it for retail sale. That means forgoing thin-cut meats that would require more time to process.Grocers are also trying to find a way to sell so-called “end cuts” from the leg or trunk that consumers may be unfamiliar with. That includes promoting the idea of grilling marinated round steaks — from the leg of a cow — on the barbecue to make it more tender, Young said.Consumers in grocery stores around the world might notice larger packages of meat instead of individual steaks or smaller portions, said Brian Sikes, head of Cargill’s protein and salt businesses. While the company’s plants primarily produce the same products for retail and food-service, they might cut or package them slightly differently, he said.“We know they’re buying cuts that they’ve never bought before,” Young said Wednesday by telephone.Even in Europe, where supply disruptions have not been as severe, grocers are trying to get retail customers to eat cuts of meat that restaurants usually buy. In the U.K., there’s been an uptick in sales of steaks and other cuts of meat less popular with retail customers, according to Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors’ Association. Big retailers have been putting these cuts on sale to encourage shoppers to buy, Allen said. A lot more ground meat is typically sold by comparison, which causes an imbalance.“We’re just waiting to see if enough has changed to eat our way out of the problem,” Allen said.Bloomberg.com"

The video is followed by an explanation in English and Spanish. Nearby, televisions broadcast messages of thanks from employees and customers.So goes the new normal at the world’s largest online retailer. A vital lifeline for Americans sheltering at home during the coronavirus pandemic, Amazon is trying to limit the disease’s spread within its workforce. At the same time, the company is waging a public-relations campaign to reassure the employees picking, packing and shipping products that it’s safe to show up even as some of their colleagues continue to get sick and others complain about working conditions.A test of Amazon’s progress arrives on Friday, when the company ends a pandemic perk of sorts that offered employees unlimited, unpaid time off — no questions asked. Amazon last week told employees who had stayed home that they would have to start reporting for work or seek a formal leave of absence beginning May 1. In a sense, Amazon’s efforts echo what’s happening at the state level, where some governors are trying to get people back to work without worsening the pandemic.Amazon hasn’t said how many of its workers took unpaid time off. But in interviews, dozens of employees at warehouses around the country suggest a significant portion of their colleagues have stopped coming or dropped shifts. Those workers, many of whom rely on Amazon for health benefits, now face the choice of applying for an extended unpaid leave or testing Amazon’s new safety procedures firsthand. Employees who feel they can’t return because they’re looking after school-age children or have health problems, worry that they could be replaced by the tens of thousands of new people Amazon has hired in recent weeks.One worker at the Pennsylvania warehouse where the disinfecting team video plays on a loop said she stopped going to work briefly after an outbreak of COVID-19 cases there began late last month. She’s since returned. “I would have stayed home again if they didn’t make the changes they have,” she said. Still, the worker said that some of her colleagues remain skeptical and afraid.Amazon is “providing flexibility with leave-of-absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures,” a spokeswoman said in an email. “We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community.” The company said it doesn’t plan to cut people once the unlimited leave expires.The coronavirus first struck Amazon’s facilities in northern Italy in February. When cases began to spread across the U.S. in the following weeks, Amazon announced the offer of unpaid time off, as well as a temporary US$2-an-hour raise. While these measures were welcomed by many workers, they said the virus’s spread and a sometimes haphazard rollout of social-distancing measures amplified a prevailing distrust of management in many warehouses.When cases were reported at a returns facility in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, last month, one employee said she expressed concerns to human resources that the company’s cleaning measures were inadequate. The on-site manager referred questions to a corporate call centre, where an employee read a script back to her about enhanced cleaning. A follow-up note to the building’s top manager wasn’t returned. The woman, who said she was then bringing her own hand sanitizer to work, started taking unpaid time off. She has applied for COVID-19 leave to care for young children and hasn’t heard back. Kentucky, which hasn’t set a date for reopening schools or day-care centres, had one of its worst days for new COVID-19 cases on Friday, the same day Amazon announced the end of the unpaid time-off policy.Amazon has unquestionably made its warehouses safer, according to workers around the country. Metal detectors set up to deter theft have been turned off, since employees tend to bunch up waiting to go through. Cleaning supplies are more abundant; in places where it’s still hard to find these products in local stores, bottles of disinfectant and hand sanitizer are tied to breakroom tables. Packaging stations have been spread out. When unloading trailers or lifting heavy items, two-person teams have been split up. And in hundreds of facilities, the company has hired contractors to spray the same disinfecting fog used by hospitals and airlines. Since March, employees have been able to bring cell phones onto the floor — ostensibly for emergency calls.Some workers once bristled when admonished for bringing soft drinks to their workstations or clocking in a minute late after breaks; now they said they’re being lectured about proper face mask technique or passing someone too closely in a hallway.Despite the new safety measures, many workers have chosen to cut shifts short or take a spontaneous half-day, complicating Amazon’s effort to ensure there are enough people to meet demand. As absenteeism reached 50 per cent in some warehouses, according to people briefed on attendance data, Amazon went on a hiring binge. On April 13, the company reached its goal of recruiting 100,000 people and said it was looking for an additional 75,000. Workers said those reinforcements are largely responsible for keeping operations going amid the pandemic. Amazon said the new hires have been brought on to meet increased demand.Employees at warehouses in South Carolina and Michigan estimated temps and new hires outnumber veterans by 10 to 1 on some teams. “We have full shifts in all departments, but it’s seasonal workers,” said Jaylen Camp, who works at a facility in Romulus, Michigan, and earlier this month participated in a walkout calling for the warehouse to be closed for cleaning. “It’s all new people surrounding me daily,” said another worker at a nearby facility, who, like most people who spoke for this story, requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from their employer.Sporadic protests continue at Amazon warehouses. The company has fired employees involved in walkouts or organizing in New York and Minnesota for what it says are violations of corporate policy. Several politicians have accused Amazon of retribution, and this week New York’s attorney general announced an investigation into the firing of a Staten Island worker. The company has countered internal and external critics with employee testimonials and a PR campaign. Workers who took unpaid time off have received emails listing cleaning practices and inviting them to return to work. Social-media sites have been blanketed with Amazon advertisements thanking workers for their bravery and showing them wearing protective gear. Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, wearing a mask and trailed by a camera, swung through a Dallas-area warehouse. Today's visits by our founder and CEO @JeffBezos to say thank you to Amazon fulfillment center and @WholeFoods employees. We're all incredibly proud of the thousands of our colleagues working on the front lines to get critical goods to people everywhere during this crisis.A post shared by  Amazon (@amazon) on Apr 8, 2020 at 9:05pm PDTSome employees wonder how Amazon will safely accommodate returnees in buildings rearranged to separate workstations and keep people from congregating. Others said they will have a hard time returning because they have kids at home. The company said both full-time and part-time employees are eligible for COVID-19-related leave, either to care for children home from school, or because of health issues they or household members face. Those who want to avoid a penalty for missing shifts had to apply by Wednesday, Amazon told workers. (Amazon has promised two weeks of sick pay for employees who actually catch the disease).The rollout of the new leave policy has had some challenges. One part-time employee, who applied to take May off to avoid exposing elderly parents, was quickly denied by human resources, which told the person, incorrectly, that part-time employees weren’t eligible. An Amazon spokeswoman later said the decision had been reversed.Other employees plan to return to work. One worker at a warehouse in Connecticut, who decided to work part-time as cases spread nearby, said she can’t afford to lose the paycheque. “Everyone thinks it’s just about sick people staying home, but it’s more than that,” she said. “My kids aren’t in school. The unpaid time basically meant that I’ve had a flexible schedule which has allowed me to do what I need to for my girls.”Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Jennifer Jacobs,Trump to order U.S. meat-packing plants to remain open despite coronavirus outbreaks,The White House decided to make the move amid estimates that as much as 80 per cent of the U.S. production capacity could shut down,https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/trump-to-order-u-s-meat-packing-plants-to-remain-open-despite-coronavirus-outbreaks?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/meat-2.jpg,"April 28, 2020 2:20 PM EDT","President Donald Trump plans to order meat-processing plants to remain open, declaring them critical infrastructure as the nation confronts growing disruptions to the food supply from the coronavirus outbreak, a person familiar with the matter said.Trump plans to use the Defense Production Act to order the companies to stay open during the pandemic, and the government will provide additional protective gear for employees as well as guidance, according to the person.Trump signalled the executive action at the White House on Tuesday, saying he planned to sign an order aimed at Tyson Foods Inc.’s liability, which had become “a road block” for the company. He didn’t elaborate.The order, though, will not be limited to Tyson, the person said. It will affect many processing plants supplying beef, chicken, eggs and pork.Trump’s order sets the stage for a showdown between America’s meat giants, who’ve been pressing to reopen plants hit by mass outbreaks, and local officials and labor unions who’ve called for closures and are trying to prevent the virus from spreading. The president himself has long agitated for Americans to return to work and restore a U.S. economy crippled by social distancing measures.We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry productsThe White House decided to make the move amid estimates that as much as 80% of U.S. meat production capacity could shut down. Meat stocks rose on the news.But a union representing plant workers accused the administration of failing to develop meaningful safety requirements that would have helped contain the disruptions.“We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry products,” said Stuart Appelbaum, President of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.Tyson Foods extended gains, jumping as much as 5.6 per cent for the biggest intraday advance in three weeks. Hormel Foods Corp. rose 1 per cent, while JBS SA’s American depositary receipts climbed 4.6 per cent.On Sunday, Tyson Foods Chairman John Tyson said in a blog post that the U.S. food supply chain “is breaking,” with millions of pounds of meat set to “disappear” as plants close.Illnesses in the meat-processing industry and shifts in demand after restaurants closed have disrupted the supply chain. Dairy farmers are dumping milk that can’t be sold to processors, broiler operations have been breaking eggs to reduce supplies and some fruit and vegetables are rotting in fields amid labor and distribution disruptions.Many low-income Americans, meanwhile, have been waiting in long lines at food banks, which have reported shortages.Asked about the country’s food supply, Trump said: “There’s plenty of supply.”The Defense Production Act allows the government broad power to direct industrial production in crises. Trump has previously invoked the law — or threatened to invoke it — in order to increase the supply of medical gear including ventilators, masks and swabs to test for coronavirus infection.The White House has been discussing the order with meatpacking executives to determine what they need to operate safely and stay open, in order to prevent shortages, the person said. White House General Counsel Pat Cipollone worked with private companies to design a federal mandate to keep the plants open and to provide them additional virus testing capacity as well as protective gear.Trump acted one day after Iowa’s two U.S. senators and its governor urged the administration to invoke the DPA to keep meatpackers open and reopen closed facilities “as soon as it is possible to do so safely.” Iowa produces one-third of the nation’s pork supply, according to the state officials.The officials also asked for federal assistance in euthanizing pigs and reimbursing hog farmers for their losses due to closures of processing facilities.Across the country, at least 6,500 meat processing employees have been impacted by the virus, meaning they either tested positive for the disease or had to go into self-quarantine, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the largest private-sector union. Twenty workers have died.At least 22 meat plants have closed within the past two months, reducing pork processing capacity by 25 per cent and beef processing capacity by 10 per cent, according to UFCW. Farmers have animals with nowhere to go as a result, and the situation is so dire that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is setting up a centre to help growers with “depopulation and disposal methods” for animals.Experts have warned the U.S. could be just weeks away from fresh meat shortages. While inventories can provide some cushion, stockpiles are limited.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.And the shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight. China, the world’s top hog producer, has been battling an outbreak of African swine fever, which destroyed millions of the country’s pigs.Bloomberg.com"

The next chapter in the oil crisis is now inevitable: great swathes of the petroleum industry are about to start shutting down.The economic impact of the coronavirus has ripped through the oil industry in dramatic phases. First it destroyed demand as lockdowns shut factories and kept drivers at home. Then storage started filling up and traders resorted to ocean-going tankers to store crude in the hope of better prices ahead.Now shipping prices are surging to stratospheric levels as the industry runs out of tankers — a sign of just how distorted the market has become.The spectre of production shut-downs — and the impact they will have on jobs, companies, their banks, and local economies — was one of the reasons that spurred world leaders to join forces to cut production in an orderly way. But as the scale of the crisis dwarfed their efforts, failing to stop prices diving below zero last week, shut-downs are now a reality. It’s the worst-case scenario for producers and refiners.“We are moving into the end-game,” Torbjorn Tornqvist, head of commodity trading giant Gunvor Group Ltd., said in an interview. “Early-to-mid May could be the peak. We are weeks, not months, away from it.”In theory, the first oil output cuts should have come from the OPEC+ alliance, which earlier this month agreed to reduce production from May 1. Yet after the catastrophic price plunge on Monday, when West Texas Intermediate fell to -US$40 a barrel, it’s the U.S. shale patch that is leading.We are moving into the end-gameThe best indicator of how the U.S. industry is reacting is the rapid drop in the number of oil rigs in operation, which last week fell to a four-year low. Before the coronavirus crisis hit, oil companies ran about 650 rigs in the U.S. By Friday, more than 40 per cent of them had stopped working, with only 378 left.“Monday really focused people’s minds that production needs to slow down,” Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at commodity merchant Trafigura Group, said. “It’s the smack in the face the market needed to realize this is serious.”Trafigura, one of the largest exporters of U.S. crude from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, believes that output in Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota and other states will now fall much faster than expected as companies react to negative prices, which have persisted for several days last week in the physical market.Until prices collapsed on Monday, the consensus was that output would drop by about 1.5m barrels a day by December. Now market watchers now see that loss by late June. “The severity of the price pressure is likely to act as a catalyst for the immediate turndown in activity and shut-ins,” said Roger Diwan, oil analyst at consultant IHS Markit Ltd.The price shock has been particularly intense in the physical market: producers of crude streams such as South Texas Sour and Eastern Kansas Common had to pay more than US$50 a barrel to offload their output last week. ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources Inc. have all announced plans to shut in output. Regulators in Oklahoma voted to allow oil drillers to shut wells without losing leases; New Mexico made a similar decision.North Dakota, which for years was synonymous with the U.S. shale revolution, is witnessing a rapid retrenchment. Oil producers have already closed more than 6,000 wells, curtailing about 405,000 barrels a day in production, or about 30 per cent of the state’s total.The output cuts won’t be limited to the U.S. From Chad, a poor and landlocked country in Africa, to Vietnam and Brazil, producers are now either reducing output or making plans to do so.“I wouldn’t want to get sensational about it but yes, clearly there must be a risk of shut-ins,” Mitch Flegg, the head of North Sea oil company Serica Energy, said in an interview. “In certain parts of the world it is a real and present risk.”In emergency board meetings last week, oil companies small and large discussed an outlook that’s the most somber any oil executive has ever witnessed. For the small firms, the next few weeks will be all about staying afloat. But even for the bigger ones, like Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, it’s a challenge. Big Oil will offer an insight into the crisis when companies report earnings this week.Saudi Arabia, Russia and the rest of the OPEC+ alliance will join the output cuts on Friday, slashing their output by more than 20 per cent, or 9.7 million barrels a day. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned company, is already trimming to reach the target. And Russian oil companies have announced exports of their flagship Urals crude would drop in May to a 10-year low.Even so, it may not be enough. Every week, 50 million barrels of crude are going into storage, enough to fuel Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. combined. At that rate, the world will run out of storage by June. What’s not stored onshore, is stashed in tankers. The U.S. Coast Guard on Friday said there were so many tankers at anchor off California that it was keeping an eye on the situation.Before the crisis hit, the world was consuming about 100 million barrels a day. Demand now, however, is somewhere between 65 and 70 million barrels. So, in a worst-case scenario, about a third of global output needs to be shut.The reality is likely to be less severe as storage would continue to bridge the gap between supply and demand. Plus, oil traders say consumption has probably hit a bottom, and will start a very gentle recovery.But before that takes hold, the great shutdown will spread through oil refining too.Over the past week, Marathon Petroleum Corp., one of the biggest U.S. refiners, announced it would stop production at a plant near San Francisco. Royal Dutch Shell Plc has idled several units in three U.S. refineries in Alabama and Louisiana. And across Europe and Asia, many refineries are running at half rate. U.S. oil refiners processed just 12.45 million barrels a day on the week to April 17, the lowest amount in at least 30 years, except for hurricane-related closures.More refinery shutdowns are coming, oil traders and consultants said, particularly in the U.S. where lockdowns started later than in Europe and demand is still contracting. Steve Sawyer, director of refining at Facts Global Energy, said that global refineries could halt as much as 25 per cent of total capacity in May.“No one is going to be able to dodge this bullet.”Bloomberg.com"

Analysts have estimated Canada may need to shut-in about 1 million to 1.5 million barrels of oil per day, from an average daily production in 2019 of about 4 million.Given the lack of crude demand coupled with low Canadian pricing and little in the way of extra storage capacity, “it is hard for us to fathom how Western Canadian crude production can avoid a ~1 million+ bbl/d drop in output in the coming weeks,” Stifel FirstEnergy analyst Michael Dunn told clients in a note.The virus has disrupted the industry’s operations as well. Imperial Oil Ltd.’s Kearl oilsands mine has been struck by an outbreak of the virus that has sickened at least 32 workers. TC Energy Corp. has said social-distancing measures may slow construction on projects such as its Coastal GasLink pipeline.Here’s what analysts are saying ahead of earnings:Energy firms will further trim capital spending, update their efforts at cost reductions and potentially adjust dividend levels.“Liquidity measures appear sufficient for most companies to bridge the gap in 2020, but next year could be another story,” Pardy said.“Expect the market to look past anticipated weak 1Q prints and focus on liquidity and ability to cut, store, & place production.”Wong sees integrated firms carrying an advantage in navigating storage woes. He sees the highest negative cash flow revision risk for Cenovus and Husky heading into earnings results.“Shut-ins and the residual impact of strong Q4 diluent pricing could further weigh on oil sands cash costs (in addition to significantly lower realized pricing).”Suncor remains Canaccord’s top pick among large-cap producers.Bloomberg.com"

The fund said it’s moving its money to contracts spread between July 2020 and June 2021 due to new limits imposed upon it by regulators and its broker.As the U.S. Oil Fund sold its June position, the contract plunged more than 25 per cent, significantly widening the June-July spread, which has become a target for speculators. The fund appears to have come under heavy pressure from its broker, which it didn’t name, disclosing that in the future it will hold “significant portions of its portfolio in cash beyond what it has historically held in order to satisfy potential margin requirements.”The ETF has changed its investment policy five times in the last two weeks. It also warned investors its valuation may deviate significantly from the underlying oil price, in effect acknowledging that it’s momentarily less focused on the price of WTI crude.“While it is USO’s expectation that at some point in the future it will be able to return to primarily investing in the Benchmark Futures Contract or other similar futures contracts of the same tenor based on light, sweet crude oil, there can be no guarantee of when, if ever, that will occur,” it said in the filing, adding that USO investors “should expect that there will be continued deviations between the performance of USO’s investments and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, and that USO may not be able to track the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract or meet its investment objective.”The US$3.6 billion exchange-traded fund, run by United States Commodity Funds LLC, will move its June position from Monday through April 30, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, each day roughly selling and buying one-third of its position. It also announced that it will move its contracts forward over a 10-day period beginning May 1, but didn’t disclose which will be affected. Previously, the fund typically rolled the contracts over four days.In response to risk mitigation measures taken by its futures broker, the fund will invest approximately 30% of its portfolio in July contracts, 15 per cent in August, 15 per cent in September, 15 per cent in October, 15 per cent in December and 10 per cent in June 2021.The fund listed factors including “a change in regulator accountability levels and position limits” as part of its reasons for the shift. As a result it will now struggle to meet its own investment objectives, it said.The discount between June WTI and the contract for December deepened sharply after the filing, reaching as low as US$15.17 a barrel.The long-only oil fund has in recent weeks become a magnet for retail investors looking for a bottom to the historic price rout that’s pushed oil futures in New York into negative territory for the first time in history. The knock-on effects have impacted retail investors everywhere. While USO was not holding the May contract when it plunged below zero, traders pointed to retail money as having caused large gyrations in the market.But USO has quickly become a rich target for speculators that are able to take advantage of the moves by trading ahead of it, thanks to its detailed regulatory disclosures. By offering a detailed calendar and the exact contracts that’s selling and buying, it allows others to place financial bets ahead, profiting from time-spreads movements.On Friday, the fund disclosed for the first time that it was ordered by CME Group Inc. to make changes to its position.Bloomberg.com"

Big box shopping centres and community strip malls took in only a little over half their expected rent.“I’ve been in this business over 30 years and I have never seen anything as catastrophic or as impactful in a negative way in our business,” Tim Sanderson, who heads retail at JLL Canada, said in an interview. “It’s the mid-tier smaller-scale landlord that cannot make their mortgage payments to their lender that are going to be in trouble.”Malls and main-street shops, bastions of community commerce, were already under pressure after two years of weak retail sales, rising property taxes and the shift to e-commerce. Nationwide shutdowns of all but essential stores during the pandemic have added further strain, with landlords facing lost rental income and tenant closures. Longer term, fear of new outbreaks may only accelerate the shift online — even for movies and restaurants, which had been touted as potential buffers for malls.JLL Canada, which uses third-party data to monitor the market, sees the retail commercial vacancy rate rising into the 6 per cent to 8 per cent range in Canada by the end of the year. That’s up from 2.3 per cent at the beginning of this year — a level Sanderson describes as “very tight.”“Many retailers are in trouble,” Roelof van Dijk, director of Canadian market analytics at CoStar Group Inc., a real estate research firm. “I think when we get to the other side of this, there’s a real reckoning to be had.”I think when we get to the other side of this, there's a real reckoning to be hadMuch will depend on how long the isolation period lasts and the effectiveness of federal government relief programs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a government program on Friday that aims to reduce rents for the country’s small businesses by 75 per cent. Commercial property owners will be eligible for loans to cover 50 per cent of the rent over three months beginning in April. The property owner is expected to kick in 25 per cent of the rent, and the tenant the other 25 per cent. The loans will be forgiven if the landlord agrees to lower rent by at least 75 per cent and agrees to not evict a tenant while the program is in place.REITS including Choice Properties and Crombie have already offered rent deferrals to troubled tenants. RioCan, one of the country’s largest retail landlords, agreed to about $15 million (US$10.1 million) of deferrals for April, or about 17 per cent of total gross rents.RioCan received two-thirds of its gross rents for April, while First Capital REIT and SmartCentres REIT each collected about 70 per cent and H&R REIT got 56 per cent of its rents from retail tenants, according to company disclosures.The cloudy outlook has contributed to a 26 per cent plunge in the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index this year, lagging the 15 per cent decline of Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Big mall landlords, like pension funds and REITs, are better able to weather the downturn with rent deferrals and can woo shoppers back with retail experiences that can’t be found online, according to van Dijk. Smaller property owners may not even have tenants to reopen storefronts when this ends, he said.That’s a view echoed by RioCan CEO Ed Sonshine.“To be very blunt, some of these smaller tenants will probably not survive — I would guess that some of the ones that won’t survive maybe weren’t in such good shape when this started,” he said in an April 21 interview. “Where we think the tenant should be able to survive, we’re certainly open to discussing further help.”Still he’s optimistic the vast majority of the retail industry will be fine.“Once people feel safe and comfortable — and that may be a full year before we’re 100 per cent back to normal, maybe longer — I think people will go back to their basic habits,” Sonshine said. “They want to be with other people, they want to be at concerts, they want to eat in restaurants, they want to see movies in the theatre, they want to go to the gym — all of which nobody can do right now.”Bloomberg.com"

While the second name has yet to emerge in public, BlackRock Inc.’s Jean Boivin is no longer in contention. Tiff Macklem, dean of the University of Toronto’s management school and a former central bank official, regularly features in speculation, though it’s unclear whether he has sought the position.Whoever gets the nod will inherit a tough assignment, one that’s dramatically different even from when candidates were formally interviewed in February and early March. In an effort to stabilize an economy grappling with a pandemic and tumbling oil prices, Poloz has cut the benchmark interest rate to near zero, injected tens of billions in cash into the banking sector and started purchasing government debt.On the one hand, the Bank of Canada’s role in the crisis is a secondary one, as monetary policy plays second fiddle to emergency government spending. On the other, the stakes have never been higher for the governor of a central bank that must fund an unprecedented level of government borrowing.The situation is fraught with risk for the next governor, as the central bank’s deficit-financing role threatens to politicize the institution and erode its independence. The job will require some backbone.“You need someone forceful,” Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a telephone interview. “There does have to be some push back.”The outright government bond purchases are without precedent in Canada, but far from unique in today’s world. All major central banks are doing it for the same reasons — the government debt needed to tackle the crisis is too large to be absorbed by the private sector.The Bank of Canada’s government bond purchase program is still in its infancy. Much of the central bank’s activity so far has been in shorter-term money market operations aimed at providing the financial system with liquidity on a temporary basis.Holdings of federal government debt rose by more $30 billion (US$21 billion) over the past three weeks, but that’s expected to expand rapidly, given a budget deficit set to easily surpass $200 billion — a gap that’s about 10 per cent of economic output.The central bank also plans to acquire provincial and corporate bonds, sending it deeper into politics and increasing its exposure to credit risk.You need someone forcefulWith the central bank still in the thick of its emergency response, Wilkins would offer the most continuity. Her leadership role in keeping financial markets functioning has given her an opportunity to build credibility with key players such as the heads of Canada’s commercial banks, a group that has plenty of sway over who becomes governor.Perhaps more importantly, the crisis has allowed Wilkins, 56, to work closely with Morneau, whose ability to get along with the next governor will be key to the job. The growing importance of fiscal policy means one of the Bank of Canada’s biggest challenges will be to find a way to deepen coordination with government without giving up control of monetary policy.Poloz has expressed optimism these extraordinary measures will eventually be scaled back. “Someday the tensions will ease back and we won’t need as much liquidity in the markets in order to keep them functioning,” the outgoing governor said at a March 27 press conference.But there are worries the Bank of Canada could face pressure to fund more and more spending, even after the emergency response. How easy will it be to turn off the taps just as the federal government becomes increasingly reliant on the lender of last resort to finance its debts. It’s one thing for the central bank to finance income support measures, another for it to fund agendas.In the short term, it’s all academic. With the economy in crisis and inflation nowhere in sight, keeping the taps open is the only option.Bloomberg.com"

They also want to eat their way to stronger immune systems. They’re stress baking, but they’re also eating healthier than they would have at restaurants. Avocados are in. Pork belly out. Frozen pizzas and instant noodles are selling out.And these seemingly conflicting and converging buying patterns are upending agricultural markets, sending prices for avocados surging 60 per cent from early March, while butter is tumbling because of the loss of restaurant demand.Any way you cut it, the coronavirus has “completely changed everything,” said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor and senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.“People are more concerned about putting food on the table than anything else,” he said. “That really changes the mindset of a consumer.”Some of these trends could be here to stay, experts say. Now that some people have gone back to packaged foods, they may be surprised to see the quality improvements for these products and keep buying them even in the post-quarantine world. Cooking more at home might also continue well after the lockdowns end.Avocados are one of the foods that have seen a surprising price surge in the last few weeks. When lockdown measures first went into effect, farmers in Mexico, the world’s top producer, started slowing harvest activities, anticipating a demand drop-off.But it turns out avocado toast and guacamole are proving to be stay-at-home favourites. Demand has been much higher than the growers were expecting, and that’s sent prices surging. A box of Hass avocados from the state of Michoacan, Mexico’s biggest producer, cost about 480 pesos (US$19) on April 24, according to the government. That’s up about 60 per cent from 300 in early March.Other produce items have been flying off grocery shelves. U.S. retail sales of citrus were a standout, gaining about 50 per cent from year-earlier levels in March, according to data from researcher IRI.“There is a general health-halo over all fresh produce items,” said Roland Fumasi, analyst for RaboResearch, in Fresno California.It might be the vitamin C content in citrus that prompted the buying as consumers look to boost their immune systems. Orange juice, once a breakfast staple that had fallen out of favour because of its high sugar content, also got a boost. Futures traded in New York are up about 13 per cent since the end of February.In Asia, consumers are turning to traditional remedies to safeguard themselves from the virus, according to Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. In Vietnam, people are eating more black garlic and Indonesians are stocking up on jamu, a traditional medicine made from natural ingredients.For a lot of people, eating has become an escape from boredom and stress these days. Consumers are picking up items at the grocery store they had been shunning just a few months ago — packaged foods in particular have been given new life.“Traditionally, food has a comforting role,” Tan of Mintel said.Nestle SA, the world’s largest food and beverage company, is seeing very strong demand for essential food and drink items, Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said earlier this month. The company makes DiGiorno frozen pizzas and Maggi instant noodles.Conagra Brands Inc., which includes Duncan Hines, Chef Boyardee and Birds Eye in its portfolio, is seeing a lift across all the categories, Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said late last month.“It moved in waves, but everything is moving,” he said.Snack consumption is also going up. That’s partly because people are stuck at home, but also because they’re spending more time doing activities that lend to munching, like binge-watching “Tiger King” on Netflix.The case of South Korea is instructive for other markets, according to researcher Euromonitor International Ltd. Snack sales at a popular convenience store in the country were up 9% from a year earlier in the first part of March.Even with the huge spike for grocery store buying, the blow from the closure of restaurants is just too big to overcome in some markets. That’s why there’s been things like milk dumping. Farmers are being forced to dispose of excess supplies because demand from cheese and butter makers has dried up.Price moves illuminate that pain. Butter futures in Chicago have tumbled to the lowest in a decade, and cheese has also crashed.Belgium’s storied pomme frite purveyors are another victim. The country is the world’s top shipper of frozen potato products, hawking fries, crisps and mash to more than 160 countries, said Romain Cools, secretary general of industry group Belgapom. The vast majority is exported and demand dried up as the food-service industry grinds to a halt. European processing-potato futures are down almost 90 per cent this year, trading at an all-time low.Even if restaurants are still doing take-away orders, many have reduced their menu offerings while home cooks in general are not using as many ingredients as they might eat at a sit-down meal.But consumers will also be pleased to see that US$20 goes a lot more at the grocery store than it does at a fine-dining or quick-serve restaurant, said Nicholas Fereday, a consumer goods senior analyst at RaboResearch in New York. And the revival of packaged foods might have some longer-term impacts on buying habits.“There’s a simplification going on,” Fereday said. Packaged foods are “certainly more available because there’s more output, and people will remember that. When there was nothing left to eat, these companies delivered.”Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Sandrine Rastello,A fight against Amazon becomes a state matter in Quebec,Quebec is urging its population to buy from local firms through an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu,https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/a-fight-against-amazon-becomes-a-state-matter-in-quebec,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/amazon-3.jpg,"April 25, 2020 8:02 AM EDT","The coronavirus crisis is giving Quebec’s nationalist government an excuse to attempt what may be impossible.The Canadian province is embarking on an uphill battle to chip away at Amazon.com Inc.’s position. Reckoning that weeks of confinement will permanently accelerate the growth of online shopping, Premier Francois Legault wants to boost Quebec retailers’ digital sales, and is urging the population of 8.5 million to buy from local firms.His government took a first step by building an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu — or Blue Basket, a reference to the colour of the French-speaking province’s flag. To run it, the government recruited a board including the former president of Lowe’s Cos. Inc. in Canada and Alexandre Taillefer, a private equity partner who years ago floated the idea of a Quebec response to Amazon’s dominance.“People will be able to see what’s available in their region,” Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said in an interview. “There’s a solidarity developing, I want to capitalize on that.”Quebec’s nationalism, which is rooted in the 1960s economic and political emancipation of its French-speaking majority, predisposes the population to close ranks behind local businesses, according to Andre Lecours, a professor in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa. The province has a number of sizable homegrown retailers, such as Simons department stores, and has produced a few international players.Amazon is fighting stronger opponents in other countries, including France, where last week it lost a court fight to sell the whole range of its products. France has restricted the company’s deliveries to food, health items and computer products to protect workers from the coronavirus.The track record of Canadian-made alternatives to Amazon is not good. One of most famous failures was a site called Shop.ca, backed by several big names in business and former hockey star Eric Lindros. It flopped and wound up in bankruptcy court in 2016.Few Quebec companies are known for their online retailing success. According to a survey by CEFRIO, a digital research and innovation group backed by the government, more than a third of Quebec adults make at least one purchase per month on Amazon. Yet in another report published in 2018, only 14 per cent of the Quebec firms surveyed said they sold products online.“There’s probably a greater mobilization potential in Quebec than in the rest of Canada because of nationalism,” Lecours said. “Still, let’s be honest, Quebecers too shop at Costco and Walmart, because it’s cheaper. If a Quebec purchase is 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent more expensive, at what point do they give up?”Efforts to drive money from national sentiment were already in underway before the Blue Basket launch — including an online store called Ma Zone Quebec, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Amazon. Local media also joined in, suggesting Quebec substitutes for groceries such as Kraft Heinz Co.’s barbecue sauce or Heineken NV’s beer.When Legault and Fitzgibbon unveiled the Blue Basket during an April 5 press conference, they described it as a non-for-profit organization that aims to make both merchants and Quebec richer — an overarching goal for the premier, who often says he wants to close the wealth gap with other provinces.“An initiative to promote local commerce isn’t an initiative against free trade,” Fitzgibbon said then. “It’s a unified communication approach to enable our small retailers to do well against companies that have huge marketing resources.”The Blue Basket website, put together in two weeks, doesn’t do transactions yet and was derided by critics for being too basic. The team running it says it’s in its early stages and will become more sophisticated. About 13,000 businesses were referenced as of April 24.Andree-Anne Julien, who runs online bedding and decoration store Espace Deco + Idees Cadeaux, said being listed initially drove more than 1,000 Blue Basket visitors to her site, giving an additional boost to a business that has thrived since brick-and-mortar competitors were forced to close a month ago. The flow has reduced to a trickle since, though she still credits the government for the effort and expects the “Buy Quebec” movement to stay.“No one can compete with Amazon,” she said. Yet because her Quebec suppliers don’t sell on the behemoth’s platform, “we have some exclusivity they don’t have.”Online shopping has been slowly taking off in Canada and accounted for 6.8 per cent of retail sales last year, compared with 11 per cent in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer.The pandemic may accelerate the conversion. In a Deloitte survey conducted March 16-18, early on in the crisis, about half of Canadians said they were more likely to buy online. This month, Shopify Inc.’s chief technology officer tweeted that the e-commerce software company is handling “Black Friday level traffic every day” to bring thousands of businesses online.Logistics are a major hurdle to Legault’s plans. Louis Corriveau, who specializes in work and hunting clothes on his e-commerce site CoriBouTik, said that even though he will register on Blue Basket, shipping costs in a vast country are a problem for small businesses like his. He recently sold a cap for $12 (US$8.50) that cost $14 to mail to a remote region of Quebec. He charged his client $8.75 in shipping fees to make it palatable.“I made no money,” he said. Shipping costs “is what’s hurting everyone.”Taillefer, the entrepreneur on Blue Basket’s board, has been mulling solutions for retailers to lower their operating costs, mostly by combining forces on warehousing or delivery to save money. For now, the focus is on getting shoppers’ attention.“Our goal is to shift some of the searches Quebeckers do on Amazon or Google to a search engine presenting essentially 100 per cent Quebec content,” he said during a webcast of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. If just 1 per cent get diverted, “it will have been worth it.”Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Michael Hirtzer and Tatiana Freitas,America could be weeks from meat shortages with shutdowns spreading,"Plant shutdowns in U.S., Canada and Brazil, which produce 65% of world meat trade, threaten supply",https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/meat-supply-threats-grow-with-first-brazil-shutdown-u-s-turkey-halt?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/meat-1.jpg,"April 24, 2020 2:58 PM EDT","Plant shutdowns are leaving the U.S. dangerously close to meat shortages as coronavirus outbreaks spread to suppliers across the nation and the Americas.Almost a third of U.S. pork capacity is down, the first big poultry plants closed on Friday and experts are warning that domestic shortages are just weeks away. Brazil, the world’s No. 1 shipper of chicken and beef, saw its first major closure with the halt of a poultry plant owned by JBS SA, the world’s biggest meat company. Key operations are also down in Canada, the latest being a British Columbia poultry plant.While hundreds of plants in the Americas are still running, the staggering acceleration of supply disruptions is now raising questions over global shortfalls. Taken together, the U.S., Brazil and Canada account for about 65 per cent of world meat trade.“It’s absolutely unprecedented,” said Brett Stuart, president of Denver-based consulting firm Global AgriTrends. “It’s a lose-lose situation where we have producers at the risk of losing everything and consumers at the risk of paying higher prices. Restaurants in a week could be out of fresh ground beef.” New U.S. shutdowns are hitting at a dizzying rate. Smithfield Foods Inc., the world’s No. 1 pork producer, said Friday it was closing another operation, this one in Illinois. That news hit less than an hour after Hormel Foods Corp. said it was idling two of its Jennie-O turkey plants in Minnesota. JBS said Sunday it will shutter a beef production facility in Wisconsin.The most-recent news added to a flurry of other halts announced in the space of just a few weeks.“During this pandemic, our entire industry is faced with an impossible choice: continue to operate to sustain our nation’s food supply or shutter in an attempt to entirely insulate our employees from risk,” Smithfield said in a statement Friday. “It’s an awful choice; it’s not one we wish on anyone.”Prices are surging. U.S. wholesale beef touched a record in the week ended April 24, and wholesale pork soared 29 per cent, the biggest weekly gain since 2012.Jersey Mike’s Franchise Systems Inc., which has 1,750 stores across the U.S., is working with its ham supplier Clemens Food Group to ensure its supply of pork, something they sell quite a bit of in their sub sandwiches.“We’re backing it up already because of the coming — we feel — the coming shortages,” said Peter Cancro, chief executive officer.To be sure, some plants have restarted after testing workers and improving conditions, and most Brazilian facilities are still operating. Another point to consider: There haven’t yet been big shutdowns in Europe. The European Union accounts for about a fifth of global meat exports, U.S. government data show.Still, executives from Tyson Foods Inc., JBS and Smithfield have all warned that consumers are likely to see impact at the grocery store.It should be noted that the output from a plant where infection pops up doesn’t pose health concerns because by all accounts COVID-19 isn’t a food-borne illness. Products from a farm or a production plant with a confirmed case can still be sent out for distribution. But a production halt means that there’s no new supplies.And these shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight. China, the world’s top hog producer, has been battling an outbreak of African Swine Fever, which destroyed millions of the country’s pigs. Plus the virus is hitting production after some meat companies had already taken steps to slow output because of the closure of restaurants around the world.Inventories can provide some cushion, though they may not last long.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.Meanwhile, with slaughterhouses closing, farmers don’t have a place to sell their animals. That’s forcing some livestock producers to dispose of them. Plants are also facing a labour crunch as employees fall ill. It’s been reported that a large chicken-processing company was forced to kill 2 million of its birds earlier this month because of worker shortages.That’s the latest cruel blow to supply chains, with food being wasted en masse at the same time that grocery store shelves are running empty.The situation for U.S. farms is so severe that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is setting up a center to help identify potential alternative markets and assist on “depopulation and disposal methods.”It’s hard to say exactly why the virus is spreading so fast among meat-plant employees. Some analysts have cited the fact that these are usually low-paying jobs that are often filled by immigrants and migrants. That means workers can live in cramped quarters, with sometimes more than one family sharing the same dwelling — so if one person gets sick, the disease can spread quickly.Employees are also in close proximity on the job, with the work on some processing lines being described as “elbow-to-elbow.” Even if line speeds are slowed, workers spread out and shifts are staggered, there’s still the chance of mingling in break rooms and hallways. These plants see thousands of people coming in and out every day — it’s basically the opposite of social distancing.At the same time, U.S. federal employees responsible for inspecting meat plants are falling ill. More than 100 inspection-service employees have tested positive for COVID-19, the government confirmed. At least two deaths of inspectors have been reported.U.S. inspectors travel among facilities. That’s adding to fears that shutdowns will keep occurring if a sick federal employee brings the infection to plants where there’s not yet an outbreak.In Brazil, JBS’s Passo Fundo poultry plant in Rio Grande do Sul state was ordered to close, according to Priscila Schvarcz, a labour prosecutor in the municipality. There have been about 48 cases among employees, with 27 positive tests and others confirmed through epidemiological criteria, according to the latest data from Passo Fundo and neighbouring municipalities.JBS said measures implemented at the plant “are fully supported by reports and technical recommendations from health agencies and medical specialists.” The company said it trusts operations would resume shortly and that “employee protection has always been the first JBS goal since the pandemic started.”The closure comes amid a jump in COVID-19 cases in Brazil.“Brazilian meat companies have been taking a lot of preventative measures, but we don’t see progress in agglomeration of people,” said Jose Modelski Junior, a spokesperson for Contac, which represents food-industry workers. “They are not willing to change the number of workers in the same shift, and we are worried about that.”Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Esteban Duarte,Canada's AAA credit rating on the line as oil crash slams debt-loaded provinces,Provinces are likely to need more assistance from the federal government — which could trigger a downgrade,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-aaa-on-the-line-as-oil-crash-hits-debt-loaded-provinces?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/canada-1.jpg,"April 23, 2020 11:53 AM EDT","Canada’s stellar credit rating is being put to the test as the oil crash and recession expose the country’s weak link: its provinces.Among the Group of Seven countries, only Germany and Canada have AAA ratings from S&P Global Ratings. But as pressure rises on the government of Justin Trudeau to aid provinces and key industries, Canada’s fiscal position is looking shakier.Going into the COVID-19 crisis, Canada’s provincial governments had $853 billion (US$602 billion) of debt securities outstanding, more than the national government. They also shoulder most of the cost for health care and eduction. Several of them rely on energy revenues that are evaporating. Oil-rich Alberta released a budget in February based on West Texas Intermediate prices of US$58 a barrel. Its deficit projections crumbled within days.Last week the Bank of Canada expanded its asset purchase program to include as much as $50 billion in provincial debt to bring down yields. That may not be enough: Trudeau will likely have to come up with new fiscal measures too.“There is a very good chance that the need for more massive federal assistance for the provinces, for households, for the business sector, will trigger a downgrade at some point” for Canada, said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co.Canadian governments will have net borrowing needs of 11.8 per cent of GDP this year, higher than all G7 countries except the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund.Pricing on credit default swaps suggests traders see Canada’s profile as similar to Australia — whose top credit rating was put on negative outlook by S&P on April 7 — and lower-rated New Zealand. Canada’s economy is set to contract by 5.3 per cent in 2020, compared with 2.4 per cent decline globally, S&P said in an April 20 note.The federal and provincial governments have put together a virus response package of at least $315 billion, S&P said.“The fact that the Bank of Canada is now buying provincial debt, and that will help keep borrowing costs low — I think that will be very important for the credit rating,” said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co. She sees the Canada’s top credit rating as “extremely resilient,” citing the central government’s relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio, which was a little more than 30 per cent before the crisis.Fitch Ratings, which is in the process of updating its projections for Canada as well as other sovereigns, looks at gross consolidated general government debt rather than federal debt in its models, said Kelli Bissett-Tom, a director of Americas sovereign ratings. By that yardstick Canada is “among the weak” AAA-rated sovereigns, she said, though it isn’t an automatic trigger for a credit action.While the federal government doesn’t explicitly guarantee the debt issued by provinces, credit-rating companies and investors assume a high probability of support.For instance, Newfoundland and Labrador’s rating of A1 by Moody’s Investors Service would be two levels lower if not for the assumption of “a high level of extraordinary support from the government of Canada,” Moody’s said in an April 1 statement. Moody’s put the province on negative outlook, citing the decline of oil prices. It’s the most indebted province, with debt at about 2.5 times revenues for the fiscal year that ended March 31.Newfoundland and some other provinces, including Manitoba, want the Trudeau government to set up an emergency credit agency to help them borrow more cheaply. They also want changes to the fiscal stabilization program, a federal mechanism created in the 1960s to help provinces facing revenue drops.“We still believe the proposal for an emergency fund has merit, and we will continue to work with our provincial counterparts and the federal government on solutions to the challenges we collectively face,” said Newfoundland Finance Minister Tom Osborne.Alberta continues to press for a package of between $20 billion and $30 billion to help oil and gas companies stay afloat, Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said.“Oil and gas is the largest subsector of the Canadian economy and we have advocated to the federal government that the liquidity package needs to be significant,” said Toews in an emailed statement.Provincial debt issuance for this year may reach $150 billion compared with about $100 billion estimated before the COVID-19 outbreak, Bank of Nova Scotia analysts including Rebekah Young wrote in an April 15 note. That’s on top of federal financing needs of about $450 billion.“Provincials are absolutely key for Canada’s rating, because provincial debt in Canada collectively makes up the largest sub-sovereign debt issuance in the world,” said Alexandra Gorewicz, portfolio manager at CI Investments. Some of the provinces’ credit ratings may be “called into question.”Bloomberg.com"

The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.Current mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple’s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company’s first custom Mac chips won’t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple’s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company’s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Like with the iPhone, Apple’s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple’s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company’s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Apple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel’s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel’s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel’s chip advancements. That sometimes left years between Mac refreshes, upsetting some customers. Intel has also faced manufacturing challenges that Apple has blamed for some recent declines in Mac sales.Kalamata is Apple’s most ambitious computer chip initiative to date. It currently offers specific chips for Mac features, such as security and power management, that work alongside the main Intel processors.Apple also aims to stop using Intel cellular modems — chips that connect smartphones to the internet and support calls — after using them for only four years. The company plans to use 5G modems from Qualcomm in as many as four new iPhone models later this year. Apple last year acquired Intel’s modem business after striking the short-term supply deal with Qualcomm.Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Katherine Chiglinsky,Warren Buffett stays silent as even his ‘fortress’ is breached by coronavirus shutdowns,"‘We've got a few businesses, small ones, we won't reopen when this is over’ — Charlie Munger",https://business.financialpost.com/investing/warren-buffetts-fortress-is-breached-by-coronavirus-related-shutdowns,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/warren-buffett-1.jpg,"April 23, 2020 5:27 AM EDT","Even as market watchers await Warren Buffett’s splashy move to seize on fallout from the current crisis, his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. hasn’t been spared by the pandemic.Coronavirus-related shutdowns across the U.S. have hit Berkshire units from See’s Candies and a shoemaker to industrial behemoth Precision Castparts. That could leave a few scars on the conglomerate that gives the billionaire investor his ammo and has been pumping out more than US$20 billion in annual profit in recent years.Buffett’s business partner, Charlie Munger, put it bluntly. “We’ve got a few businesses, small ones, we won’t reopen when this is over,” he told the Wall Street Journal, without naming the units.As Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, Buffett has spent more than five decades crafting a behemoth with businesses in industries including insurance, energy and retail. That diversity helped the company weather the credit crisis in 2008, allowing its iconic leader to invest vast sums into other struggling companies.Buffett has stayed relatively quiet amid the turmoil this time around as the pandemic underscores just how tied his businesses are to the U.S. economy, which is getting hit on all sides by the virus and its ripple effects.“There’s no fortress that’s immune to that right now,” said Lawrence Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University Law School and co-author of the book “Margin of Trust: The Berkshire Business Model.”Some Berkshire operations are already feeling the pain. See’s, which makes the treats that Buffett and Munger famously munch on during their annual shareholder meetings, announced a furlough of its retail workers in early April, and is now testing whether it can reopen some shops. Shoe seller Justin Brands shut outlets throughout Missouri. Berkshire’s BNSF is expected to report that rail traffic declined during the first quarter, according to data from the Association of American Railroads and Bloomberg Intelligence.Industrial operations took a hit, too. Precision Castparts, acquired in 2016, manufactures components for the aerospace and power generation industries. The company said earlier in April that it would temporarily halt operations at a plant in Portland, Oregon, as customers reduced orders.To be sure, Buffett’s promise that Berkshire will “forever remain a financial fortress” hasn’t been broken yet. The company reported a US$128 billion cash pile at the end of last year, as well as a stock portfolio valued at more than US$248 billion.Some of its biggest revenue generators remain on solid footing. Auto insurer Geico said that shelter-in-place policies across the U.S. have reduced miles driven, which can translate into fewer accidents. And sprawling operations including the energy companies and heavy manufacturers are on the job.At chemical maker Lubrizol, the pandemic has forced a pivot familiar to countless businesses. CEO Eric Schnur said social distancing and work-from-home measures are now common at a company that began dealing with the effects of coronavirus months ago at operations in Asia, and is accustomed to rigid safety standards because of the dangerous chemicals that are part of its work.“It’s nowhere near business as usual, of course,” he said in an interview. “But keeping people safe in a potentially unsafe situation is something we think about every day whether or not there’s a coronavirus pandemic.”Schnur said he and other Berkshire unit chiefs benefit from a decentralized model allowing managers to operate with a degree of autonomy in good times and bad. That type of model allows executives with the deepest knowledge of a business to be the ones who implement strategies, according to Cunningham. Still, Schnur said he’s able to tap the expertise of Greg Abel, the vice chairman for non-insurance operations, if needed.Lubrizol, which hasn’t cut workers in the crisis, is ramping up production of an ingredient used in making hand sanitizers and prioritizing products needed for the manufacture of medical devices. The company announced Monday that it was donating materials necessary to create personal protective equipment, aiding Nike Inc.’s efforts to donate gear for health-care workers.Apart from Berkshire’s day-to-day operations, investors are left wondering what Buffett’s been up to. During the recent bull market, Berkshire underperformed the S&P 500 Index as Buffett struggled to find large companies to buy. Now, valuations have plummeted, creating an opening not seen in more than a decade.Munger said that he and Buffett are being careful. Companies aren’t begging Berkshire for capital because most people are frozen as they try to figure out how to navigate this “typhoon,” Munger told the Wall Street Journal.Berkshire’s earnings, set to be released in May, will shed some light on Buffett’s moves. Even in a quarter quiet on the front for major acquisitions, the results could indicate whether Buffett and his investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, had an appetite for shares in public companies during the market downturn.Part of Buffett’s success during the financial crisis came from the lucrative preferred-stock and warrant deals he made with companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. While Buffett has yet to announce a similar deal recently, shareholder Thomas Russo said Buffett’s ability to evaluate unique opportunities may help again.“He’s patient,” said Russo, who oversees about US$10 billion including Berkshire shares at Gardner Russo & Gardner. “One of the best features is that he is able to see opportunities broadly.”Buffett, 89, is set to host a virtual version of Berkshire’s annual meeting in May, an event that normally draws thousands of visitors to his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Investors hope he’ll have the “washtub” that he described in his 2017 annual letter:“Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold,” Buffett wrote. “When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.”Bloomberg.com"

A survey of CFIB members shows 80% of small and medium firms are closed or operating at reduced capacity because of the pandemic, meaning only 20 per cent are fully operational.“Even in the optimistic scenario with full utilization of all of these support programs, I still see no scenario under which there are not tens of thousands of permanent business closures,” Kelly said Wednesday by phone from Toronto.The federal government has stepped up aid to businesses, introducing measures such as a 75 per cent wage subsidy and $40,000 loans, and a rent relief program is expected soon. But the measures weren’t announced immediately after the closure of non-essential businesses, and the rent and wage subsidy programs aren’t yet putting money in the bank. The government said it will open applications for the wage subsidy on Monday.Relief on rent and wages may not come soon enough, forcing layoffs and requiring more Canadians to lean on the government’s income support program, according to Don Drummond, former chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank and a fellow at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario.“The bulk of the support may have to be handled by the emergency relief program and that’s definitely second-best because that breaks the employer-employee relationship,” Drummond said Wednesday in a television interview with BNN Bloomberg.Almost 7 million Canadians, or about a third of the labour force, have applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which provides those who have lost work from COVID-19 with $2,000 (US$1,409) a month.Many companies let employees go before the wage subsidy was announced, so it will be harder for them to find workers again once the recovery starts, Kelly said. “It’s going to take us months to put everybody back together as we come out of this.”And if businesses do re-open in the near future, Kelly worries some CERB recipients may opt to continue receiving federal money instead of returning to work.Companies should keep employees on payrolls, or bring previously laid-off workers back, according to Hassan Yussuff, President of the Canadian Labour Congress.“It doesn’t cost employers anything to keep employees on the payroll instead of laying them off, so they need to be bringing people back,” Yussuff said. “This is a very difficult time so workers don’t need to have the added stress of looking for a job when this is all over.”Bloomberg.com"

After some discussion, the client agreed to put the piece of jewelry up for auction at the major spring sale at Sotheby’s New York, which was supposed to be held in late April.And then the coronavirus pandemic hit.Live auctions were called off, and Sotheby’s pivoted to online sales. With global economies faltering, U.S. equity markets whipsawing, and people stuck at home indefinitely, the success of online jewelry sales was far from certain. Becket called the bracelet’s owner “and told her that we would evaluate if it should be put in an online sale or deferred to a live auction at a later date.”But to Becket’s astonishment, collectible jewelry sales started to do well — very well. Speaking to her wealthy clients, she discovered they were buying jewels as a sort of pick-me-up. “Clients are sequestering at home and, generally speaking, leading relatively dreary lives,” she says. Some, Becket adds, told her “they’re wearing their big diamonds inside their homes because it brings joy.”Everyone, she says, “is waiting for this to be over, and I suppose knowing that a million-dollar piece of jewelry is waiting for you is a fulfillment of when things return to the new normal.”The results speak for themselves. Since the beginning of March, Sotheby’s has run four online sales. Of them, 92 per cent of every lot sold, and 61 per cent of the lots exceeded their high estimates. In total, the sales brought in US$6.1 million, above the high estimate of US$5.7 million.“What we’re finding is that anything of good quality is performing well,” Becket says, “and actually better than it would have just a couple of months ago.” A 1930s-era diamond ring that carried a high estimate of £90,000 (US$110,000) sold for £162,000; a yellow-diamond ring that carried a high estimate of HK$1.6 million (US$206,000) sold for HK$2 million; a pair of emerald and diamond earrings from Graff sold for £50,000, above a high estimate of £32,000.Given the strength of these sales, Becket decided that “I could call the client with complete confidence and say to her that I thought we’d do a great job [selling the Tutti Frutti bracelet] online.” The bracelet will be offered in a standalone sale, with online bidding open from April 24 to April 28. The estimate is US$600,000 to US$800,000.The rise in online collectible jewelry sales comes at a time when the price of raw diamonds has sunk precipitously. Prices at industry auctions for rough diamonds have sunk from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, according to an April 7 release from the Rapaport Research Report, and demand for polished diamonds has also plummeted.“Polished exports from India fell 41 per cent year on year in February,” Rapaport wrote, while “shipments from Belgium dropped 38 per cent, and Israel’s plummeted by 73 per cent.” Meanwhile, “inventory rose among diamond manufacturers and dealers, with new supply becoming available while demand stayed frozen. We estimate that midstream inventory increased 20 per cent from the beginning of the year to mid-March.”If buyers are looking for an alternative asset to place their cash, in other words, diamonds, at least for the moment, are not an obvious safe haven.“I don’t think people were buying for the sake of investment,” Becket says. “We had a recent sale in Hong Kong, online, that was pretty much exclusively diamonds, and it did incredibly well.” It’s true, she continues, that “there has been a softening” in the auction market for jewelry as the value of loose stones has declined. But demand has stayed strong, Becket says, for lots with a compelling provenance, a prestigious maker, or a uniquely compelling aesthetic element to the object.“The Tutti Frutti bracelet is a case in point,” she explains. “The stones in a Tutti Frutti bracelet are pretty modest in intrinsic value,” because Cartier purposefully chose flawed coloured stones to contrast with the brilliant diamonds and settings. “So the Tutti Frutti jewelry we value more as works of art.”Now the question is whether or not buyers are willing to spend almost a million dollars on a bracelet they’ve never seen in person. Traditionally, Becket says, people are most willing to buy things with which they’re familiar: a Cartier “Love” bracelet or pieces made by famous jewelers such as Graff or Bulgari.In the past few sales, though, Becket has seen a “broadening” of what’s done well at auction. “A multicoloured pair of ear-clips, something we wouldn’t think would do that well online, suddenly has a number of bids,” she says. So the Tutti Frutti bracelet may well be the ultimate test of buyers’ willingness to take leaps of faith at online auctions.“If these kind of pieces continue to do well, it will mean the pandemic has forced us to arrive at the place we were heading anyway,” she says, “where people have become more and more comfortable buying things online, sight unseen.”Bloomberg.com"

That briefly catapulted it ahead of Toronto-Dominion Bank on Monday to become the second-most valuable company on Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite index, though it fell back to No. 3 on Tuesday as global markets slumped.“It’s tough to make money at the valuation Shopify is trading at,” said Jefferies analyst Samad Samana, one of the most bearish analysts on the stock. Risk-reward is not attractive and it’s hard to recommend a buy, he said. He has a hold call on the stock and a price target at US$400, below estimate consensus and well off US$585, its current price in New York.Brian Peterson, an analyst at Raymond James, noted the stock is trading at about 39 times his 2020 estimates.Its near-record valuation is “somewhat surprising” given the uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products, which Raymond James believes is the key driver behind the company’s withdrawal of its 2020 revenue guidance earlier this month.Peterson sees Shopify’s monster boom as good news for the future adoption of the platform though, as merchants are forced to migrate online, but its expansion may not “necessarily equate to sales volume.”A likely recession, “if we’re not in one already,” will inevitably see a downturn in sales as “no one is immune” to the pandemic, Samana said. The biggest concern is the spike of unemployment in the U.S., which has been the biggest revenue gainer for Shopify.Consumer discretionary products, sold by many of Shopify’s merchants, are among the hardest hit. While sales decline, Shopify may still be able to get a piece of a smaller pie, Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian wrote in a note Monday. However, some merchants are also expected not to renew their subscriptions amid a tougher environment, Arounian noted.The excitement surrounding Shopify has not worn out, however, as the stock has 15 buys, 14 holds and three sells, according ratings compiled by Bloomberg.Shares on loan to short sellers are still relatively low at 3.8 per cent of Shopify’s float, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.As Shopify inches closer to the top of Canada’s stocks leader board, investors are also reminded of the so-called curse that has seen former Canadian technology behemoths like BlackBerry Ltd. and Nortel Networks Corp. plunge after reaching seemingly indestructible levels.Bloomberg.com"

In Toronto, shoppers at a west end Loblaws can’t buy more than two dozen eggs and two gallons of milk.Spoiled for choice before the pandemic, North American shoppers are finding they can’t get everything they want as grocery stores ration in-demand items to safeguard supplies.While the panic that swept through supermarkets in the first weeks of the coronavirus lockdowns has eased, people are still filling fridges and pantries with stay-at-home staples from flour and yeast to pasta sauce and meat.The strong demand comes at a time of supply disruptions as food makers adapt to dramatic shifts in buying patterns and some processing plants close as workers fall ill. As a result, stores are restricting purchases to prevent items from vanishing from shelves. For shoppers, that can be unnerving.“It’s not a shortage, it’s just that it needs to get from the supplier throughout the supply chain to the stores,” said Diane Brisebois, president and chief executive officer of the Retail Council of Canada. “There’s been an unexpected increase in demand for those products, and if those demands continue, it might take a bit longer to get them to the shelves.”Overall, there’s enough retail supply, said Heather Garlich, a spokesperson for FMI, a food industry association that represents retailers and producers.But there have been “sporadic challenges” with high-demand products, and 49 per cent of U.S. shoppers report their supermarket has had products out of stock, according to the industry’s tracking. On popular items, “they could consider limits based on where the grocer may be located and when their supplier or wholesalers can get them product,” Garlich said.The dizzying variety of foods on grocery shelves has long been a trademark of North American supermarkets. That’s now changing, leaving shoppers worried. Some manufacturers have shifted their focus to making more of just a few core products, which makes it easier for retailers to restock supplies.“The thing I’m struck by, in the U.S., we’re so used to walking down a supermarket aisle and having thousands of choices,” said Heidi Heitkamp, a former North Dakota Senator and current member of alliantgroup’s strategic advisory board. “Now that’s not what people see on the shelves and it’s a little unnerving. But what everyone should be grateful for is that you can walk into any supermarket in a major metro area and you can find food to eat. That’s a critically important national security concern.”There are signs that panic buying is waning and shoppers are returning to more traditional patterns. U.S. packaged food sales rose 24 per cent in the week ended April 4 from a year ago, slowing from a gain of 32 per cent a week earlier, according to data compiled by Nielsen. Limits on the number of visitors per store are also affecting sales.Costco Wholesale Corp.’s sales rose in March but not as much as expected. Limits placed on its operations to cope with coronavirus-related demand slowed growth in the back half of the month.“I honestly think rationing may disappear at some point over the next few weeks because expectations have changed a little bit,” said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. “People have come to accept what’s happening right now.”And while meat aisles remain stocked, the spread of coronavirus among North American slaughterhouses is raising concerns of a shortfall in pork and beef at grocery stores. The shutdown of major U.S. processing plants, including Tyson Foods Inc.’s Waterloo plant in Iowa this week, means more than 15 per cent of the nation’s hog-slaughtering capacity is down.“Once we see the impact of workers testing positive in the packing plants, we’re going to see a shortage of meat,” said Heitkamp, the former senator.Bloomberg.com"

Season four of “The Crown,” an award-winning drama about British royals, is already in post-production, as is “Over the Moon,” an animated project.“We work really far out relative to the industry,” Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said during an earnings call with analysts Tuesday. “We don’t anticipate moving things around.”Over the past decade, Netflix has lured more than 180 million customers to its streaming service by offering a never-ending buffet of new shows. Seemingly nothing — not debt, not competition, not bad reviews — could stop its weekly drop of new dramas, comedies and documentaries.But the coronavirus has plunged Netflix into unknown territory. The company has paused production all around the world, with the exception of Iceland and South Korea. The global health crisis has interrupted the production of a new season of the hit show “Stranger Things,” as well as a movie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.With a lineup that includes “Too Hot to Handle,” “Black AF” and “Space Force,” Netflix isn’t going to run out of shows this quarter. It also has the rights to the Michael Jordan documentary “The Last Dance,” which has already been a hit for ESPN. But Netflix has no way of knowing what will happen later this year, which is one of the reasons it cautioned investors Tuesday not to read too much into a record-breaking surge in subscribers last quarter.“No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible, and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages and post-production) will play out,” the company said in a letter to shareholders.Netflix has shifted all of its animation series to remote production, and did the same with post-production on more than 200 shows. Animation is a huge new area of investment for Netflix, and now includes a couple of buildings in Hollywood. The company earned an Oscar nomination in 2020 for the animated movie “Klaus,” and has more than a dozen animated series due for release this year. It’s unclear how the new setup will affect the rollout of any projects.Netflix still plans to release more original content in 2020 than last year. And for the moment, the pause in production is a boon to its finances, helping lift cash flow.If Netflix can’t make as many movies itself, it can always buy them. Its film division will benefit from other studios being eager to offload product due to the temporary shutdown of movie theatres. Paramount Pictures and Media Rights capital sold Netflix “The Lovebirds,” a comedy starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, while Legendary sold Netflix a film starring Millie Bobby Brown of “Stranger Things” fame.Rather than waiting to see when they can release those movies in theatres, the studios can book a profit by selling the projects above cost to Netflix. Netflix, meanwhile, gets new films to market to its users.But if Netflix can’t get production up and running this year, neither animation nor new movies will fill the hole. The company releases hundreds of new TV shows, documentaries and other specials each year, and most of them require having dozens or hundreds of people on a set somewhere.A long hold on production could prevent Netflix from releasing as many shows as its customers have come to expect, and provide a reason for many cost-conscious consumers to cancel their subscriptions. The company put out 180 new titles in the U.S. last quarter, according to the blog What’s on Netflix, and had plans for similar amounts in the quarters ahead.Netflix said that a lack of new material might affect it less than peers because of its large library of old shows. But the company has also said time and time again that new shows are the biggest drivers of new customers. That’s why Netflix has minimized the impact of rival studios pulling popular programs like “The Office” and “Friends.”Bloomberg.com"

Detached homes fell 4.6 per cent, dropping just below $1 million.“The state of emergency measures currently in place, including the necessary enforcement of social distancing, has impacted the real estate market in many ways,” TRREB President Michael Collins said in the statement. “Home buyers and sellers have concerns about the economy and indeed their own employment situations. On top of this, many buyers and sellers are avoiding any type of in-person interaction.”Home sales declines will likely be steepest in the second quarter as social-distancing measures remain in place for most of the spring, said TRREB. The real estate group forecasts that average prices for the year will likely remain near 2019 levels.“As we recover from this temporary downturn, potentially later this year, home buyers will move off the sidelines in increasing numbers as they satisfy pent-up demand for ownership housing,” said the board’s chief market analyst, Jason Mercer. “Increasingly, these buyers will be faced with the persistent lack of listings inventory that was a serious problem before the onset of COVID-19.”Bloomberg.com"

Yet rather than gloat, the company’s executives warned investors not to get too excited. Netflix benefited in the first quarter from an unprecedented health crisis, the global coronavirus pandemic. With billions of people stuck at home, the world’s largest paid online TV network experienced an explosive jump in customers in March, with many binge-watching “Tiger King” and “Love Is Blind” to ride out the quarantine.But there’s no telling how long the boom will last. Netflix expects the surge to come at the expense of growth in the months ahead.“Our guess is subscribers will be light” in the third and fourth quarter, chief executive Reed Hastings said Tuesday on a call with investors.Netflix forecasts 7.5 million new subscribers in the second quarter — a great quarter under normal circumstances. But investors, who sent the stock to new highs this week, may have wanted more. Though they initially bid Netflix shares up as much as 12% after the close Tuesday, the rally soon fizzled. The stock was little changed as of 5:38 p.m. in New York.“Like other home-entertainment services, we’re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth,” the company said in a letter to investors. “We expect viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends.”While COVID-19 has been devastating to the global economy, video-streaming services like Netflix and YouTube have found a captive audience. The new Disney+ service surpassed 50 million subscribers in just five months, a faster pace than predicted. Three new video services, Quibi, Peacock and HBO Max, arrive this quarter and hope to have similarly rapid starts.Skeptics have said Netflix would lose customers to the new competition. But thus far, those fears have been unfounded.“What we’re seeing is people are cutting linear TV and adding Disney+ on top of Netflix,” said Nick Grous, an analyst at Ark Investment Management LLC, which owns the shares.The quarter’s results reflected two of Netflix’s strengths: breadth of programming and a global footprint.Months after releasing Oscar-nominated movies such as “The Irishman” and “The Two Popes,” Netflix cracked the code on tabloid-style documentary TV. “Tiger King,” about big-cat zoo owners, was the biggest new hit series for Netflix in the U.S. since “Stranger Things,” according to Nielsen.Meanwhile, “Love Is Blind,” a reality dating show, drew 30 million viewers in its first four weeks, Netflix said. A newer dating show, “Too Hot to Handle,” has been one of the most popular shows on Netflix since its release last week.Netflix also showed strong growth all around the world. Business in the U.S. and Canada picked up after a few sluggish quarters, with Netflix adding 2.31 million new customers in its biggest market. That was more than the prior three quarters combined. The company signed up nearly 7 million customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the most of any region.The coronavirus had another unintended benefit for Netflix: its first quarter of positive free cash flow since 2014. Netflix produced $162 million in the first three months of the year. While the company had already vowed to narrow its cash burn in 2020, a worldwide pause in TV and movie production lowered costs in the quarter and will continue to do so this year.Production shutdowns could turn into a headache for Netflix depending on how long they last. Subscribers are accustomed to a steady flow of new content, and some of its competitors, such as Walt Disney Co. and AT&T Inc.’s WarnerMedia, have big libraries they can use to entice viewers. But Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said Netflix has finished production on most of its new programs for 2020.Prior to the earnings release, Netflix investors had sent the shares to record levels, making it especially hard for the company to sustain the rally — even with blockbuster numbers. The stock had climbed 34% through Tuesday’s close, compared with a 15 per cent decline for the S&P 500.“I understand the caution around the response to the stock,” Grous said, before adding, “But we’re not focused too much on quarter to quarter. We’re thinking about the long-term trend here, and that is explosive growth.”Bloomberg.com"

A massive supply glut brought on by the pandemic and a worldwide shortage of storage space have touched off an relentless rout that has shifted the entire forward curve for oil.The meltdown spreading across global oil markets has already wiped out tens of thousands of jobs and frozen billions of dollars in capital spending. Its deflationary effect threatens to further cripple economies around the world already reeling from coronavirus-fueled lockdowns. Storage tanks, pipelines and tankers have become overwhelmed by a vast oversupply brought on by an unprecedented plunge in global fuel demand.Oil is a “dangerous market to trade in right now,” said Pierre Andurand, founder of Andurand Capital Management LLP, in a Bloomberg TV interview. The market needs oil production to fall immediately for prices to recover, he said.The price crash spilled into the ETF market, with the biggest crude-tracking fund, the United States Oil Fund LP, moving some of its WTI contracts into later months, according to a regulatory filing. The June/July WTI spread rallied more than US$1 a barrel on the move.Oil Ministers from the OPEC+ coalition held an unscheduled conference call on Tuesday to discuss the collapse without settling on new policy measures. The Texas Railroad Commission, meanwhile, opted to put off a decision on whether to impose oil-production quotas.In London, the immediate contract for Brent crude was at the biggest discount to the following month in data since 2008. U.S. marker WTI’s June contract was halted three times early in New York to manage the volatility, CME Group Inc. said.“If you start to look at the actual supply-demand situation for oil, it’s not so obvious that by the time those contracts expire, the storage situation around Cushing will be very different than what it is in May,” said Martijn Rats, Global Oil Strategist at Morgan Stanley, in a Bloomberg Radio interview. “The prices of these futures will need to connect to the physical reality, and they are likely to crack lower.”WTI for June dropped 43 per cent to US$11.57 a barrel in New York. The thinly traded May contract closed at US$10.01 a barrel.Brent crude futures for June slumped 24 per cent to close at US$19.33 a barrel.The collapse is reverberating across the oil industry, with prices trading below zero across America on Monday. WTI Midland in Texas — a flagship marker for the U.S. shale industry — was at -US$13.13 a barrel, while crude in Alaska was at -$US46.63.There are signs that these stunningly low prices are here to stay as tanks across the globe fill up. Royal Vopak NV, the world’s biggest independent storage company, said almost all of its space is sold.Crude stockpiles at Cushing — America’s key storage hub and delivery point of the WTI contract — have jumped 48% to almost 55 million barrels since the end of February. U.S. nationwide inventories are estimated to have increased another 14 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey.The Dated Brent benchmark, a global reference for nearly two thirds of the world’s physical flows, plunged to US$13.24 a barrel on Tuesday, its lowest since 1999, according to price reporting agency S&P Global Platts. That means that key European and African crude streams, including Urals from Russia and Bonny Light from Nigeria, would sell now under $10 a barrel, as they trade at a discount to the Dated Brent benchmark.Bloomberg.com"

But the recent price action in West Texas Intermediate raises the prospect of the unthinkable: A relatively plain-vanilla fund that offers investors exposure to fluctuations in crude prices might be worth less than nothing.The US$4.1 billion United States Oil Fund LP (ticker USO) slumped about 11 per cent to a record low on Monday as the front-month West Texas Intermediate contract made an unpredecented drop below zero, throwing into sharp relief the dearth of demand and storage capacity for the commodity stateside. The ETF tumbled 32 per cent to 12:44 p.m. in New York Tuesday.USO didn’t own any May futures, with its roll into the June contract scheduled to have been completed by April 13. Its two biggest positions are in the June and July West Texas Intermediate contracts. The net asset value of its holdings could drop below zero in the event the June contract falls well below zero before the projected roll of the position, scheduled to take place from May 5 through May 8.An exchange-traded fund has not and cannot trade below zero, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.Last week, the fund announced a reallocation of its holdings, aiming for 20 per cent exposure to the second-traded future rather than concentrating completely in the front month. Further adjusting this positioning could help protect against the net asset value of its holdings falling below zero. The lack of storage capacity in the near-term is the proximate cause for the May contract’s swoon into negative territory, while contracts further out the curve remain in positive territory for now.Wall Street strategists are speculating about the possibility that a move below zero for the front-month contract this time could prove much more damaging to USO.“Additional hypothetical: the desk notes that despite there not being a redemption mechanism, there is certainly a scenario where if June futures were to also go negative, then USO would be ‘lights out’ as a partnership and could actually ‘owe’ money,” writes Charlie McElligott, cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura Securities. The product’s holdings account for roughly 30 per cent of open interest in the June futures contract, he added.The fund’s prospectus allows for the termination of the fund on a discretionary basis, or resulting from the bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal, or removal of the United States Commodity Funds LLC. “However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate USO,” according to the prospectus.John Love, president of USCF LLC, did not immediately respond to phone calls or an emailed request for comment.Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management, talked to Bloomberg TV about the uncertainty regarding who might be exposed in the event that worst-case scenarios for USO come to pass.“There has been some speculation that the CME or the clearing exchanges may be somehow on the hook for that, or the ETF provider,” she said. “Unclear right now, if the June contract were to go negative who would be on the hook for that but it is certainly part of the enhanced volatility we’re seeing around the trading, both in WTI and in USO today.”In the case of the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), the exchange-traded product that offered inverse exposure to short-term volatility futures, language governing so called “acceleration events” that could result in its closure were clearly outlined in the prospectus. Credit Suisse announced the early redemption of XIV on Feb. 6, the day following an unprecedented doubling in the VIX Index that saw the indicative intraday value of the short-volatility product plummet by more than 80 per cent.USO posted a record inflow last week as traders speculated that depressed oil prices had nowhere to go but up, bets that have since soured spectacularly.Bloomberg.com"

On the inside, it’s a barren landscape. All 37 floors are empty.Office landlords in major cities around the world are facing a hit from the coronavirus. In Canada’s energy capital, they’re suffering from a triple dose of misery: the pandemic, an oil crash and a severe hangover from a building spree.More than 20 per cent of office space is vacant, and one firm projects more than 33 per cent of downtown will be open by early 2021, creating a cycle of falling rents, declining values and “a huge crater” in local government finances.It’s a cruel twist for a once-thriving city that has more corporate head offices than any other in Canada’s west, where downtown space was nearly impossible to get during last decade’s energy boom. The tight market then, and the oil market’s quick rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, spurred a wave of development that expanded downtown office space by millions of square feet.Now there’s an epic glut. Net asking rents — what the landlord receives — for high-quality office space have fallen to less than $15 (about US$10.60) per square foot, according to data from Altus Group Ltd. That’s less than half the cost in Vancouver and Toronto, two of North America’s tightest office markets, says Ray Wong, vice president of data operations at Altus.Four buildings are already completely empty, with the Nexen tower, at 600,000 square feet, being the largest after China’s CNOOC Ltd. moved its diminished staff in the city to a new location. And new buildings, such as the two-tower Brookfield Place development that opened three years ago, are still being absorbed by the market.“The office market is more than likely going to see vacancy increase, probably substantially,” said Todd Throndson, Calgary managing director for Avison Young.Canada’s oil companies have been hit uniquely hard by the prolonged period of lower prices that started in 2014. The industry is dependent on the higher-cost oilsands, and in recent years those firms have focused on trimming head-office staff to cut expenses and become more competitive with cheaper U.S. shale production.The industry also has been suffering from a lack of pipeline capacity that has made it harder to get its crude to U.S. refineries, weighing on local oil prices and restraining producers’ ability to grow.There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom. Whereas now, it's been bust for a long time“There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom,” said Roelof Van Dijk, CoStar’s director of market analytics for Canada. “Whereas now, it’s been bust for a long time.” His firm sees the city’s downtown office availability rate rising to 33.1 per cent by the first quarter of next year, exceeding vacancies in other energy-driven cities such as Houston and Dallas.“It’s going to hurt assessment values and the taxes that they’re paying on these properties. That creates a huge crater in city finances,” Van Dijk said.The crisis has already claimed a major victim in property developer Strategic Group, which put a chunk of its commercial real estate portfolio into creditor protection last year. The firm said that since mid-2014, 78 tenants occupying almost 575,000 square feet of space either didn’t survive or deserted their leased space.The crisis has rippled throughout the city, hitting both business owners and residents. The decline in downtown property values hurt other businesses by shifting about $250 million in property taxes to other non-residential properties from 2015 to 2018. To ease the burden on companies, the city last year raised residential property taxes.Those increases are coming at a difficult time for residents, many of whom lost their jobs during the oil downturn. Calgary’s unemployment rate was 8.6 per cent last month and is sure to spike higher. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has raised the spectre of 25 per cent unemployment for the province.Those figures all are threatening to worsen in the months ahead after oil’s shocking collapse. Western Canadian Select, the benchmark grade produced by the oilsands, has traded below US$4 a barrel this month, far below the levels Calgary’s oil companies need to be profitable. Kenney has said the industry can expect at least 18 months of depressed prices. That will likely mean more job cuts and more empty space.Landlords and tenants will need to work together to weather the crisis ahead, Throndson said. Already he knows of one landlord that is allowing its tenants to pay only operating costs and taxes while skipping net rent for a while. Another went to its bankers early on in the crisis and worked out a deal to only pay interest costs on its debt for the rest of the year, he said.Over the longer term, to rescue its office market, Calgary will need some larger change in its economic course, whether that’s an influx of technology companies or a rebound in the oil industry caused by a federal commitment to a national pipeline, Throndson said.For CoStar’s Van Dijk, diversifying the economy will be key. Many oil-market analysts are projecting demand will peak in the 10 to 20 years ahead, and Canadian oil, which is typically costlier to produce, process and ship to market, may not fare well in that environment, he said.“The question is, ‘Is this the industry that you want driving the economy?’” Van Dijk said. “Whether it’s 10 years, 20 years, 50 years down the road, eventually that gravy train is going to dry up.”Bloomberg.com"

The historic rout in crude rattled markets for a second day, with the June contract plunging almost 70 per cent at one point after May contracts that expired Tuesday sank below zero for the first time in history.

While major economies around the world take tentative steps toward reopening, signs the U.S. is close to bolstering spending did little to offset fresh concerns over the depth of the recession.“Markets appear to be taking a breather after that rapid recovery,” said Candice Bangsund, portfolio manager of global asset allocation at Fiera Capital Corp. “A lot of this is being driven by the profound and historic collapse in crude prices. That’s largely been the catalyst that’s roiled already fragile market sentiment.”President Donald Trump said his administration is working on a plan to make money available to the oil industry to prevent the loss of jobs after prices plunged.Corporate earnings add to woes. Deep profit declines often come with no company insight into the remainder of the year and mounting signs that capital investment is set to plunge.Meanwhile, reports that North Korea’s Kim Jong Un was in critical condition added to the uncertainty.

That’s reduced the output of wood chips that pulp mills rely on to make everything from toilet paper and wipes to cardboard boxes and paper bags, said Derek Nighbor, president and chief executive officer of the Ottawa-based Forest Products Association of Canada.Without federal aid to get some sawmill capacity back on line, input costs could rise or there could be a shortage of the materials pulp mills need for household products, he said. Panic buying has already caused shortages of toilet paper and other hygiene products in supermarkets around the world.“The demand from pulp mills has gone up at a time when we’re starting to see the chip supply become more scarce from the sawmills,” Nighbor said in a telephone interview. “It could drive the cost up or there could be product constraints for sure in the months ahead.”High production costs in Canada squeezed profits for sawmills. The U.S. housing market remains under pressure as the coronavirus spreads, and lumber futures plunged a record 32 per cent in March.The industry is optimistic that Canada’s government can tweak its wage subsidy program to help forest operators qualify and bolster their access to cash to help them survive the coming quarters, Nighbor said. Canada exports the bulk of its pulp, paper and packaging products and the U.S. is one of its major markets, he said.“We’re in a crisis here,” Nighbor said. “We need more of our sawmills running.”Bloomberg.com"

USO’s slide came after investors plowed US$1.6 billion into the exchange-traded fund last week — the best on record.USO is a popular choice for retail investors looking to bet on short-term price reversals, buying dips and selling rallies. However, those bets soured Monday. Crude plunged as a deadly pandemic ravaging global economies threatens to erase an entire decade of demand growth, slashing thousands of jobs and wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars from company valuations.“Traditionally, this product is used to play mean reversion. It also attracts outsiders whenever oil is so low it makes the nightly news,” said Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “So it’s basically an overcrowded bottom-calling trade gone bad.”State Street’s US$8.6 billion Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, ticker XLE, dropped as much as 6.4 per cent before paring losses. Meanwhile, US$2.6 billion Vanguard Energy ETF, ticker VDE, sank more than 6 per cent before recovering from its lows.Before Monday’s rout, traders poured money into USO as demand to bet against further declines faded. Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on USO — a rough indicator of bearish bets on the fund — is currently 0.83 per cent, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. That’s down from 5.9 per cent on March 12.USO said last week that it will move 20 per cent of its contracts from the nearest month to the second-traded month.

A deal for Caltex Australia would have marked the largest acquisition in the country this year as well as the third-biggest in the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The current situation in the world is highly uncertain,” Couche-Tard said in a statement. “The COVID-19 crisis is first and foremost a human tragedy that has impacted millions of people and has also been meaningfully disruptive to economies and businesses around the world, including the Australian fuel and convenience retail industries.”The Canadian company said it continues to see Caltex Australia as a “strong strategic fit” and plans to re-engage “once there is sufficient clarity as to the global outlook.” Matthew Halliday, Caltex Australia’s interim chief executive officer, said in an interview that the company has a “reasonably strong” balance sheet and continues to explore an initial public offering or trade sale for its property assets.Shares of Caltex Australia plummeted as much as 9.1 per cent in Sydney on Monday. The stock dropped 7.8 per cent at close, while the country’s benchmark index S&P/ASX 200 fell 2.5 per cent .Couche-Tard’s dropout could shift the focus to bids by other parties including the closely-held EG Group. The U.K.-based company in February offered to pay A$3.9 billion in cash for Caltex’s retail outlets along with shares in a new listed company made up of the remaining fuel refining operations. However, Caltex’s board rejected EG’s bid a month later.Caltex Australia, which has a network of about 2,000 retail fuel sites, hasn’t received any updates since then, Halliday said in the interview on Monday.“It’s fair to say everyone is focused on managing their way through the current situation,” the interim CEO said. “EG remains a very significant customer of ours, so we talk to EG all the time but no meaningful update from a transactional point of view.”Couche-Tard, owner of convenience stores operating under brands including Circle K, first offered to acquire Caltex Australia in October and sweetened its offer a month later to A$34.50 cash per share. Caltex Australia rejected the A$8.6 billion offer but gave the Canadian firm “selected non-public information” for a revised proposal. In February, Couche-Tard boosted its offer for a second time to A$8.8 billion, which is equivalent to A$35.25 apiece in cash.A plunge in oil prices and coronavirus-induced curbs on travel added uncertainty to the business outlook for both Couche-Tard and Caltex Australia. Due diligence for the deal was completed last week, though Halliday said the Canadian convenience-store giant didn’t table a final price.On Monday, Caltex reported an A$29 million net loss for the first quarter, following an earlier announcement that it would extend the maintenance shutdown of its Lytton refinery in Queensland as well as disclosing that its convenience shop sale levels were flat compared to 2019. The company has said it expects jet fuel demand in Australia to drop by as much as 90% as the country’s airlines slash their schedules.Couche-Tard indicated that any deal could be concluded quickly if revived.“We remain convinced of the long-term financial and strategic merits of an acquisition of Caltex and all the benefits it would offer to the shareholders of both companies,” Couche-Tard Chief Executive Officer Brian Hannasch said in the statement. “Our current plan would be to re-engage the process once there is sufficient clarity as to the global outlook, and the work done to date should mean that we will be able to quickly formalize our proposal at that time.”Bloomberg.com"

Now, a profit crisis is coming for Canadian stocks.After a wild earnings week in the U.S. where about 10 per cent of companies listed on the S&P 500 Index reported results, Canada’s earnings season is about to get started with 10 per cent of its benchmark due to report the week of April 20, according to BMO Capital Markets.Bellwethers like Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., Rogers Communications Inc. and Teck Resources Ltd. are set to provide a glimpse into their first quarter, which was barely half over when the coronavirus pandemic began. Some companies on the Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite index have already temporarily suspended or cut dividends to shore up cash, providing some inkling of what to expect when financials are released.Make no mistake, first-quarter profits are expected to slump — by how much is hard to say as analysts struggle to model results. But with many companies pulling their full-year forecasts, investors will be keen to hear how they are faring during a nationwide lockdown and what they have planned for when things start reopening again.In the private equity world, some of Canada’s largest pension funds have said they are preparing for the post-pandemic era by forming teams to analyze their portfolio companies or putting stress tests in place.Volatility will be the name of the game. With some energy companies reporting this week, options traders are pricing in earnings-day share swings that haven’t been seen in years, as a demand slump and oil price war knocked them down.Here’s what to expect from companies reporting this week:Big changes to earnings trends have hit Canadian companies hard in recent quarters, said Bank of Montreal’s Brian Belski. The depth in those revisions will be key, the chief investment strategist for BMO’s capital markets division said in a report.If U.S. earnings are anything to go by, it doesn’t look good. Both the numbers and the tone from the five largest U.S. lenders have underscored a view that Canadian financial services stocks — which make up almost a third of the stock market north of the border — will lag any eventual economic recovery, said Scotiabank’s Sumit Malhotra. The Big Six Canadian lenders report in May.And the uncertainty surrounding global economic growth will weigh on investors’ minds. While Trump has said the shared U.S.-Canada border will be one of the earliest to be released, both countries extended the restrictions for 30 days, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said over the weekend — disrupting North American supply chains for an extended period. And China, the world’s second-largest economy, suffered a massive setback after entering its first economic contraction in decades.One place of solace: President Donald Trump issued guidelines to U.S. states to consider as they decide whether to relax stay-at-home orders and other social-distancing measures, sending stock markets globally soaring Friday. Governors and businesses now have to make those difficult decisions.Bloomberg.com"

That put Shopify, which provides tools for companies to sell over the internet, behind only Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank as the biggest companies in Canada’s stock market.After downgrading the stock earlier this month, Raymond James analyst Brian Peterson said he was “dead wrong” as Shopify’s stock has gone “parabolic” since then.“What we seemingly missed in this dynamic is how quickly COVID-19 may push new merchants to the Shopify Platform,” he said in a report published Friday. “Many businesses needed to establish an ecommerce presence, and SHOP was the primary beneficiary of that.” He has a market perform rating on Shopify.Investors now see more value in Shopify than Canadian companies that have been around for decades: Brookfield Asset Management Inc. with its billions of dollars worth of real estate, infrastructure and renewable power across the world, as well as pipeline giant Enbridge Inc., Canadian National Railway Co. and Bank of Nova Scotia.With more consumers shifting online, Shopify is getting a leg up while the value of retail malls and office towers are being questioned, even in a post-viral world.Bloomberg.com"

Another $8.4 billion has been sent to residents not eligible for jobless insurance through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which pays $2,000 a month.The money, which amounts to about 20 per cent of what would typically be earned by Canadian workers in one month, represents a badly needed injection of income to buffer the effect of the pandemic — providing effectively a floor to the sharpest economic contraction on record in Canada. The government has also begun issuing one-time payments to low income individuals through a sales tax credit, estimated to provide another $5.5 billion.A lot more is coming. The CERB income support program is intended to last for a total 16 weeks, costing $24 billion over that time, but is designed to be scaled up or extended if necessary.

Last year, OMERS cut its stock holdings as its returns climbed and added to its infrastructure bets, while decreasing its real estate and private equity holdings moderately.The firm posted 11.9 per cent in returns on its investments in 2019. It plans to grow to $200 billion of assets under management over the next seven to 10 years.Over at Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, internal teams have started to run stress tests with portfolio companies to see how they are being impacted, said its head of equities, Jane Rowe. The pension fund’s management teams are also working with its treasury department to address potential liquidity issues with those companies, she said.Rowe will take on a new role of vice-chair for investments on Oct. 1, the pension fund announced Thursday.“It touches each portfolio company different. Some companies may not survive this event, but we are here to support them,” she said. “Nobody is going to the gym right now, so these are being impacted. Garbage business like GFL Environmental have not been impacted at the same amount, for example.”The $207-billion (US$147 billion) pension fund delivered a 10.4 per cent return last year, lagging its 12.2 per cent benchmark. The failure to beat that hurdle tends to happen when public equities have exceptional returns, the firm said in a March statement.OTTP has hired a consultancy firm and KPMG to help the companies in its portfolio to understand the resources that are available to them, including government support, and how to best tap these while navigating the pandemic-ridden world.Alberta Investment Management Corp. chief Kevin Uebelein sees a big advantage in private assets — whose performance are ranging from “holding up quite well to pretty badly” — amid this crisis.“We have the ability to be in the trenches with them, be hyper transparent and influence their outcome,” he said.AIMCo posted a 10.6 per cent total fund return last year, trailing its benchmark by 0.5 per cent, after a weaker performance from its division that manages less liquid assets like infrastructure and real estate.

As its oil sector shrivelled in recent years, Canada’s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis. Nearly one in three workers have applied for income support.What’s more, its households are among the world’s most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm.“I think it is the Great Reckoning,” says Douglas Hoyes, a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener, Ontario. “We’ve been in a period for so long where it didn’t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were. Well, guess what? Now it matters.”Since the economy began shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus, policy makers have raced to buttress the property market. Banks are offering mortgage holidays, including to landlords with multiple loans on investment properties.That has raised eyebrows even within the real estate industry. “Should someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance?” asks Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor. “Where exactly do we draw the line?”The country may not have much of a choice but to prop up housing. Real estate has become Canada’s largest sector. Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent.If it collapses, there’s not much that can pick up the slack — certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer. Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven’t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiralled higher, homeowners felt richer — they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher.That virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it’s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can’t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year.It’s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city’s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents.Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up — “Don’t use your house like an ATM” — as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties.This virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predictedToday, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 — a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis.Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt — an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country’s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust.“You have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,” says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. “And this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.”It doesn’t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only 2 per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas.That’s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren’t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September.For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That’s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections.Then there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that’s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada’s Airbnb hosts — who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 — need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Economists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.“It’s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter’s grandchildren aren’t even going to be able to pay this off,” says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. “What’s the plan after?”Bloomberg.com"

Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said the online retail giant is developing COVID-19 testing capabilities as a first step toward a system of regular checks on its employees globally.In an annual letter to shareholders, the billionaire founder outlined other steps the e-commerce giant has taken to curb the coronavirus, from shutting down non-essential services like Amazon Books to overhauling processes at Whole Foods. The next step was regular testing for all staff — including those who showed no symptoms, he said. On Thursday, Bezos said his company had assembled a team comprising scientists, managers and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build its first testing lab soon.“Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available,” Bezos said in the letter, which offers a rare window into the thinking of the world’s richest man and his plans for the company he founded. Bezos in recent years has rarely done media interviews or commented publicly on events.Amazon is working to keep its e-commerce operations running as the coronavirus pandemic sickens employees and disrupts supply chains. Amid criticism that Amazon wasn’t doing enough to protect workers in warehouses and on delivery routes, Bezos in March wrote to employees, thanking them for their work and predicting the outbreak “will get worse before it gets better.” He subsequently donned a mask and toured a company warehouse near Dallas, where he posed for selfies with workers.Bezos also reiterated previous company announcements that Amazon has distributed face masks and implemented temperature checks at facilities around the world. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company was crowding together would-be recruits at job fairs — flouting official guidelines urging people to stay at least six feet apart. In the letter, Bezos said: “We’ve shifted training protocols so we don’t have employees gathering in one spot, and we’ve adjusted our hiring processes to allow for social distancing.”Bezos, as is his custom, included in his note a copy of his 1997 letter to shareholders. It’s a way of reminding his audience that Amazon’s strategy of prioritizing long-term thinking and customer satisfaction over short-term profits has paid off handsomely for investors.Last year, Bezos used his annual letter to advance an argument that Amazon’s growth had benefited third-party merchants that sell on its site. The comments were widely interpreted as a rejoinder to critics who say Amazon has amassed too much market power and should be broken up.Bloomberg.com"

Before they’re allowed in, a nurse will take their temperatures and give them a screening questionnaire. Assuming they pass, they’ll move inside to greet their supervisors behind plexiglass wickets and slather themselves with hand sanitizer.The new safety measures — a sampling from a 20-page list of COVID-19 requirements, according to Chief Executive Officer Sean Boyd — become most challenging as the workers enter the giant elevator for a 45 minute trip that takes them three kilometres underground.“Normally in the cage you’re jammed in there like sardines,” Boyd said in an interview Tuesday. “We’ve reduced the capacity in the cage by more than 50 per cent. The workers will enter one by one, they’re separated by a curtain, they can’t face each other, they can’t speak to each other.” The measures are extensive, he says, but “we certainly think it’s safe.”Despite early signs of progress, it’s too early to proclaim victory in containing the pandemic in Canada. But with 6 million people seeking income support in the face of an unprecedented economic slump, pressure is building among the country’s provinces for a return to work. The effort will likely be messy, with bursts of activity followed by setbacks — and it will be months, if not longer, before the country is running anywhere near capacity.Quebec, the province with 52 per cent of the country’s cases and 44 per cent of its deaths, took an initial step this week by making mining and home construction priority sectors, enabling their return to business. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, has struck a cabinet committee to craft a recovery plan, while British Columbia may reveal more details this week on potential ways to consider relaxing some social-distancing restrictions.“We don’t want to add a housing crisis on top of the current crisis,” Quebec Premier Francois Legault said Monday during a daily press briefing, in explaining why the province has changed its mind about construction.On both sides of the border, regional governments are keen to control what reopens first and when. In Canada, provinces have control over many economic policies as well as public services from education to health. California and some of America’s most powerful states are forming their own regional alliances to coordinate the resumption of business, sparking a spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he has “total” authority to reopen the world’s largest economy.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday the Canadian government is “coordinating” his country’s response.“We are having ongoing discussions with the provinces at this point,” he said a news conference in Ottawa. “We recognize that different regions of the country are at different points along the evolution of their COVID-19 curve. We’re going to make sure that we try to stay coordinated as best as possible but those discussions are ongoing about how we’re going to reopen the economy. It’s just that it’s going to be a while still.”Discussions are ongoing about how we're going to reopen the economy. It's just that it's going to be a while stillIn Ontario, Linda Hasenfratz, CEO of auto-parts maker Linamar Corp., has had a front row seat to the reopening process. About 95 per cent of the company’s employees at her six factories in China are now available to work. Like the miner Agnico-Eagle, workers face temperature checks and extensive screening to rule out exposure to the virus, along with strict spacing rules and greater sanitation and hygiene at the plants. Most of the company’s 61 factories, which employ 27,000, remain shuttered, Hasenfratz said.“We can’t be locked down forever,” she said in a phone interview. “The virus will still be around us. It won’t be eradicated so it’s really important that we try to create a work environment and protocol to make sure we work safely together.”Any return to work hinges on further progress against the virus. The country had recorded 26,146 cases of confirmed COVID-19 and 823 deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, and seen a slight decrease in the pace of both in recent days.Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia’s chief medical officer, said Monday the province may consider potential steps to relax restrictions “to get going again in our communities and in our health care sector,” but only after considering an updated model of the outbreak’s trajectory. That model is expected to be released later this week, she said. The province was the first to feel the brunt of the disease and now appears to be pulling out first.“We will do like all countries in the world: a step-by-step, progressive approach,” Quebec Chief Medical Officer Horacio Arruda said.It may also be easier to get factories and construction sites up running again than to entice people back to restaurants or other public spaces.You can open your coffee shop again, but if people don't feel confident to go to it, then you're not going to see your economy come back online“The services side of the business, that’s harder,” Frances Donald, global chief economist and head of macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management, said on BNN Bloomberg television. “You can open your coffee shop again, but if people don’t feel confident to go to it, then you’re not going to see your economy come back online.”Agnico-Eagle’s Boyd said the return to work is strictly voluntary. The company has 900 permanent staff at the LaRonde mine.“It will be gradual and if we see things that we’re uncomfortable with, clearly we won’t go forward with it.”Bloomberg.com"

Occidental had been paying cash since Buffett invested US$10 billion last year to help fund the company’s US$37 billion takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., demanding an 8 per cent annual dividend.Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub survived a bitter 10-month campaign by Icahn to seize control of the company by granting him board seats and corporate governance changes. But as the COVID-19 pandemic destroys demand for crude and strips producers of cash, her most immediate challenge is to tackle the debt pile Occidental accrued last year to beat Chevron Corp. in the bidding war for Anadarko.With US$11 billion of debt due by 2022, Occidental is looking for any and all possible ways to save cash after being downgraded to junk last month. It has slashed employees’ pay, reduced its regular dividend to common shareholders for the first time in 30 years and asked workers to appeal for government financial aid for the oil industry.Occidental’s share registration doesn’t mean Berkshire and its affiliates will necessarily sell any stock, according to the filing Wednesday. It’s unclear whether Berkshire will eventually sell down its common stock stake in the oil producer, has already chipped away at that holding in recent months, or might buy more shares. Berkshire was Occidental’s ninth biggest common shareholder at Dec. 31, with a 2.1 per cent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.While Buffett has been known to keep some of his investments for decades, he’s also been willing to trim stakes at times. Recently, his Omaha, Nebraska-based company sold some shares in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. as the coronavirus ravaged the airline industry.Occidental is the second-worst performing member of the S&P 500 Energy Index since its interest in Anadarko became known a year ago, plunging 79 per cent in that span, while the index fell 51 per cent.Occidental declined 12 per cent at 11:44 a.m. in New York, with West Texas Intermediate crude down 3.1 per cent to US$19.50 a barrel.The Occidental bet was one of Buffett’s largest deals in recent years and mimicked some of the famous financial crisis-era moves that allowed him to get preferred stock in companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The transaction allowed Buffett to deploy a large sum of his cash pile and accrue generous dividends.Buffett has been struggling in recent years to find attractive ways to deploy his cash, which was close to a record US$128 billion at the end of last year. The billionaire investor noted in his annual report that Occidental’s dividends on his preferred stock could be paid in cash or in shares of the oil producer.Berkshire didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment sent to Buffett’s assistant.

The retailer’s stock climbed 5.3 per cent to a record Tuesday, lifting the founder’s net worth to US$138.5 billion.The pandemic has brought the global economy to a near standstill and pushed almost 17 million Americans onto the unemployment rolls in the span of three weeks. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. signalled Tuesday that loan losses fuelled by the unprecedented job cuts — many of them in the retail sector that Amazon so efficiently disrupted — could rival those incurred after the 2008 financial crisis.Yet Bezos and many of his wealthy peers have seen their fortunes recover in recent weeks, helped by the boost given to markets by unprecedented stimulus efforts by governments and central bankers. While the combined net worth of the world’s 500 richest people has dropped US$553 billion this year, it has surged 20 per cent from its low on March 23, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.“The wealth gap, it’s only going to get wider with what’s going on now,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “The really wealthy people haven’t had to worry. Yes, they’re less wealthy, but you haven’t had to worry about putting food on the table or keeping a roof over your head.”It’s not just the billionaires. Corporate insiders have been significant buyers of their companies’ shares, a show of confidence that the crisis will pass, even as the nation’s leaders debate exactly when Americans can safely return to work.The volume of transactions in beaten-down industries, from travel to health care to gaming, suggests executives and directors are more bullish than they’ve been at most other points in the past decade, according to Sundial Capital Research.The wealth gap, it’s only going to get wider with what’s going on nowCarnival Corp. board member Randall Weisenburger bought US$10 million of stock in the beleaguered cruise-line operator last week. The shares have jumped 56 per cent since the purchase.Others are going further to maximize returns. UBS Group AG is seeing ultra-wealthy clients ramp up borrowing to place more wagers in what they see as a cheap market. Mortgage brokers to the rich have said more clients are seeking loans backed by real estate to help them repay other debt, invest in businesses and snap up other assets.There have been massive losers among the moneyed set. Many in the oil and gas industry have been hammered by the collapse in crude prices including wildcatter Harold Hamm, whose fortune is down 64 per cent to US$3.7 billion. Emerging-market billionaires aren’t reaping the same rewards as those in the U.S. and there have been margin calls and forced sales.But there also have been remarkable gains.Leading the group is Bezos, who has added almost US$24 billion to his fortune in 2020, as well as MacKenzie Bezos, who was left with a 4 per cent stake in Amazon as part of the couple’s recent divorce settlement. Her net worth has climbed US$8.2 billion to US$45.3 billion, and she’s now No. 18 on the Bloomberg wealth ranking, ahead of Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest person, and Mexico’s Carlos Slim.Shares of rival retailer Walmart Inc. have also advanced, buoying the fortunes of the world’s richest family. Alice, Jim and Rob Walton now have a combined net worth of US$169 billion, up almost 5 per cent since the start of the year.Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has added US$10.4 billion to his fortune this year, more than anyone except Bezos.The fortune of Zoom Video Communications Inc. founder Eric Yuan has more than doubled to US$7.4 billion, as demand for its teleconferencing service exploded in the wake of the pandemic-driven lockdown.“The unfairness of it all is who is going to benefit from it most,” Maley said. “Money makes money.”Bloomberg.com"

Oil plunged to the lowest in two decades amid a record collapse in U.S. fuel demand. Treasuries surged with the dollar.Both earnings and economic data highlight the brutal impact of the economic stoppage designed to combat the virus outbreak. U.S. retail sales and factory output posted historic declines in March, and surveys in April looked even worse. Manufacturing in New York state and sentiment among American homebuilders plunged by previously unthinkable amounts.“The market mood has soured in the blink of an eye,” Mark McCormick, global head of currency strategy at Toronto Dominion Bank, said in a note. “It’s not surprising to us that the price action has started to wake up to the new realities of the environment: Unprecedented poor data and earnings guidance, a wobbly path from lockdowns to exit strategies and overpricing of the recent news cycle.”U.S. stocks have gone through their biggest bout of weakness relative to Treasury securities in decades, according to a barometer cited by Talley Leger, a senior investment strategist at Invesco US. The indicator is the ratio between the S&P 500 and the reciprocal of the 10-year Treasury’s yield, which he presented in an April report on market gauges. The ratio started this month by closing at its lowest level since 1983 after tumbling 85% from a high in October 2018.

The central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero and injected $150 billion into financial markets with a program of asset purchases.Additional measures could include following the Reserve Bank of Australia’s recent move into yield curve control, introducing more explicit forward guidance on future policy intentions, or broadening asset purchases to include long-term provincial securities and corporate debt.One thing he’s not expected to do is lower the Bank of Canada’s policy rate below the current setting of 0.25 per cent, which Poloz has said is the effective lower bound.The Bank of Canada embarked on its first ever large scale asset purchase program last month. The move to buy at least $5 billion of Canadian government bonds each week, on top of almost $100 billion of securities purchased under resale agreements, will help sop up the massive amount of debt the federal government is expected to issue in coming months to finance its stimulus package.That program could easily be expanded to include other asset classes, with longer-dated provincial bonds the most likely option, according to Derek Holt at Scotiabank. That’s one corner of the credit markets still experiencing strained credit conditions, at a time when provincial governments are looking to finance growing deficits.By targeting provincial debt, “you’d be saying ‘look, we’ve got your back,’” Holt said in a phone interview, adding that would likely have beneficial effects on borrowing costs for municipalities, agencies and large corporations. Though one difficulty is political: how much of each province’s debt to buy?The central bank could also increase weekly purchases to more than $5 billion, or buy more non-government debt such as mortgage bonds or corporate securities.Right now, the bank is acquiring assets primarily to restore proper functioning of financial markets, which is why much of the buying has been at the shorter end. But as markets return to more normal conditions, it will eventually need to shift its focus to stimulating the economy. To do that, officials will need to target longer-term borrowing costs where most of the funding for households and businesses takes place, a practice known as quantitative easing.There are doubts whether QE can be effective in smaller countries like Canada whose long-term bond yields are dictated by monetary policy in other countries. But the practice can be much more effective if the asset buying is concentrated around specific maturities, what economists call yield curve control.Focusing on the five-year part of the curve would be the most compelling move, according to Ian Pollick at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “To do this, they would likely target a ‘zone’ for yields in a part of the curve that matter most for businesses and households, which in our view is the 5-year tenor of the curve,” Pollick, global head of non-equity market research, said in a report.Australia’s central bank adopted a similar policy last month, when it announced a target for 3-year government bonds of around 0.25 per cent.The central bank may also commit to specific monetary policy intentions for a certain period, a tool known as forward guidance. Promising to keep rates low for a long time reduces the risk of a spike in funding costs, allowing banks to offer lower rates to households and businesses than they otherwise might.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz provided a sliver of guidance when he promised last month to continue buying assets until the “economic recovery is well underway.” More clarity around that promise could help cement expectations that interest rates will remain low for much longer.Bloomberg.com"

Johnson & Johnson surged after posting stronger sales and boosting its quarterly dividend. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. slumped as their profits were hit by major provisions. Treasuries rose, the U.S. dollar retreated against its major peers and oil tumbled.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 560.43 points, or 2.4 per cent, to 23,951.2, the S&P 500 gained 84.12 points, or 3.05 per cent, to 2,845.75 and the Nasdaq Composite added 323.32 points, or 3.95 per cent, to 8,515.74.Canada’s main stock index resumed its climb in a broad-based rally despite another drop in crude oil prices since the U.S. brokered a supply cut deal.The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 182.49 points at 14,258.43.Equities extended gains after a report that President Donald Trump will make some “important announcements” in the next few days regarding state guidelines on reopening the economy. Separately, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci said that a May 1 target to reopen is “a bit overly optimistic” for many areas of the country.As the earnings season gets under way, investors will get a sense of how bad the pandemic could hit global companies. The International Monetary Fund said the “Great Lockdown” recession would be the steepest in almost a century and warned the world economy’s contraction and recovery would be worse than anticipated if the coronavirus lingers or returns. Traders are also focused on whether trillions of dollars in stimulus and rescue plans will sustain the rally in risk assets amid uncertain corporate profits.“This will be a unique earnings season,” Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded “The Sevens Report” newsletter, wrote in a note. “But it remains critically important because it’ll give us microeconomic insight into the question of ‘How bad is the damage?’ — which remains the single most important question we all need to answer to successfully navigate this market over the medium and longer term.”Investor pessimism over the pandemic’s economic damage is at “extreme” levels with cash positions at the highest since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, according to a Bank of America Corp. survey.These are the main moves in markets:Bloomberg.com"

The news was first reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper.“If Bridging were to press existing borrowers out of the portfolio in order to satisfy unusual redemptions in the funds, the effect would be to cut off funding to these businesses during an unprecedented economic emergency,” the firm said in the letter seen by Bloomberg News. It could also result in investors being treated unfairly “if Bridging were to be asked to sell positions at a discount given the lack of a normal market.”The firm said in the letter that many of its borrowers — which work in everything from milling flour to delivering groceries, repairing Coast Guard vessels and monitoring train tracks — are experiencing higher demand for their products as people need more of the basic services they provide.Last month, Sharpe said the firm had a surge in calls from companies desperate for loans. He said at the time that his team was speeding up work to accommodate some of the requests for urgent loans ranging from $10 million to $50 million, he said.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn’t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported last month.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately $2.6 billion. It didn’t say how long the freeze would last to “avoid building unrealistic expectations.”Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corporation have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to the people familiar with the matter.Bloomberg.com"

It would also dwarf the 0.1 per cent contraction of 2009 amid the financial crisis.Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shockWhile the fund anticipated growth of 5.8 per cent next year, which would be the strongest in records dating back to 1980, it cautioned risks lay to the downside. Much depends on the longevity of the pandemic, its effect on activity and related stresses in financial and commodity markets, it said.Even if the IMF’s forecast proves accurate, it said output in both advanced and emerging markets would undershoot their pre-virus trends through 2021, seemingly dashing any lingering hopes of a V-shaped economic rebound from the health emergency.In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both. A lengthier pandemic would wipe 3 per cent off GDP this year compared to the baseline, while protraction plus a resumption next year would mean 8 per cent less output than projected in 2021, it said.“This crisis is like no other,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, wrote in a foreword to its semi-annual report. “Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.”As with the virus’s reach, the economic hit is sweeping. In the U.S., gross domestic product is expected to contract 5.9 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent expansion in its last global outlook in January. It may grow 4.7 per cent next year, the IMF said. The euro area will probably shrink 7.5 per cent in 2020 and expand 4.7 per cent in 2021, it said.“Many countries face a multi-layered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital-flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices,” the IMF said. “Risks of a worse outcome predominate.”The grim projections are a stark reversal from the IMF’s outlook less than two months ago. On Feb. 19, the fund told Group of 20 finance chiefs that “global growth appears to be bottoming out.” Three days later, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicted the virus would likely cut just 0.1 percentage point from the fund’s global growth forecast for this year, although she acknowledged “more dire scenarios” were being studied.The fund sees advanced economies shrinking the most, contracting 6.1 per cent. Emerging-market and developing economies will see a 1 per cent drop. Growth in China and India will decelerate but their economies will still manage to expand 1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, the fund said.The IMF’s baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of this year and that containment measures can be gradually wound down.Global trade volume in goods and services will probably tumble 11 per cent this year, the fund said.Growth in consumer prices in advanced economies may average 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 1.5 per cent in 2021, it said. The jobless rate in the U.S., which was at a half-century low before the pandemic, may swell to 10.4 per cent in 2020, the IMF said.Most central banks around the world have cut interest rates to around or below zero to blunt the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal stimulus packages have varied more. The U.S. is providing about 10 per cent of gross domestic product in support and Germany about 4.5 per cent, while Japan’s program is worth about 20 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.The IMF said that fiscal measures will need to increase if stoppages to economic activity persist, or if the pickup in activity once restrictions are lifted is too weak. Economies with financing constraints may also require external support, the fund said. Georgieva had repeatedly pledged to use the IMF’s $1 trillion in loan capacity to help its members.The IMF and World Bank are holding their spring meetings via video conference for the first time ever this week. Their normal in-person meetings typically draw thousands of delegates, observers and journalists from 189 member countries. The program has been pared down to mostly media briefings and private meetings, skipping the typical seminars and public discussions.Bloomberg.com"

Tesla, on the other hand, “is solely focused on electrification and doesn’t have the dilemma of balancing a transition from ICE (internal combustion engine) to EV.” Levy bumped his rating up to the equivalent of a hold.Coronavirus-related market gyrations led Tesla shares to drop as much as a 61 per cent from a record high on Feb. 19. The stock has been steadily advancing since the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter deliveries on April 2 and is back to the levels it was trading at in early March.“There is some clear optimism from the bulls,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote to clients on Monday. China production and demand appear poised for a significant rebound and should be a key growth driver over the coming quarter, he said.Even so, it is now a “virtual impossibility” that Tesla will be able to reach its original annual delivery forecast of at least 500,000 units, according to Ives. Bullish investors are also looking past the shutdown of the company’s vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California, which could last at least another month, further complicating the delivery trajectory for the coming quarters, he said.Credit Suisse’s Levy also sees Tesla coming up short of its full-year deliveries guidance and is now estimating the company will hand over about 400,000 electric vehicles to customers this year, down from his previous projection for 550,000.While Levy estimates Tesla is burning about US$300 million of cash every week that its Fremont factory is down, he believes the company will emerge from the crisis with advantages over other automakers.“It likely has a lead in batteries, its liquidity is improved and it has shown signs of improvements in basic auto execution,” Levy said.Bloomberg.com"

It also singles out shipments by 3M Co., which President Donald Trump had originally blocked from sending N95 masks to Canada and Latin America. He reversed course last week after reaching a production agreement with the company.The medical system in the U.S. — which leads the world in infections with more than 580,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases — is grappling with shortages of protective gear for health-care professionals. Competition for crucial medical supplies is fuelling confusion and suspicions between the states and federal government over conflicting priorities.Last week, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a temporary rule that would require all exports of certain masks, gloves and other materials used in the U.S.’s coronavirus response to get “explicit approval” from FEMA.The rule included a single exemption — for covered materials that are made by or on behalf of U.S. manufacturers with continuous export agreements with customers in other countries. And the exemption only applies if at least 80 per cent of that manufacturer’s domestic production was distributed in the U.S. in the past year.Within hours of publishing that rule, FEMA and CBP representatives were flooded with emails and phone calls asking for clarity.On a conference call the agencies held last week, companies and their lawyers laid out the shortcomings of the rule: What if a multinational firm ships products to one of its offices overseas because they’re needed for personal protection, but not for sale? One participant noted that their shipment, addressed to a U.S. military base in the Middle East, was halted because it didn’t fit the definition of the exemption under the rule, three people familiar with the call said.“This ban apparently happened because the president was shocked to see a story about a U.S. company exporting masks,” said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council. “But it shows the danger of regulating trade in vital medical supplies unilaterally by anecdote rather than after careful review and consultations with key trading partners.”This ban apparently happened because the president was shocked to see a story about a U.S. company exporting masksThe CBP memo, dated April 9, adds that the focus of the ban is on “commercial quantities,” which it defines as shipments valued at US$2,500 and containing more than 10,000 units of gloves, masks and other covered materials.A CBP spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment.While the internal guidance is seen as a way to help administer the export ban, the document has not been made public, leaving exporters in the dark on any modification that may have been made to the rule.The rule reserved the right for the FEMA Administrator to establish additional exemptions “that he determines are necessary or appropriate to promote the national defence and will announce any such exemptions by notice in the Federal Register.”Such a notice has yet to be published.Bloomberg.com"

That prompted the bank’s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned earlier this month that the bank wouldn’t be immune to fallout from the pandemic, predicting in his annual letter to shareholders that the economy would suffer a “bad recession” and financial stress mirroring the 2008 financial crisis.“Given the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves,” Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. “The first quarter delivered some unprecedented challenges and required us to focus on what we as a bank could do – outside of our ordinary course of business – to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support all of our stakeholders.”Some of the damage was offset by gains in the bank’s trading operation, which benefited from record volatility during the quarter as investors moved in and out of positions in response to the unfolding crisis. JPMorgan generated US$7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trading gains came off a wild three months for the markets, with stocks reaching record highs in January only to suffer the biggest decline since the 1987 crash as the extent of the pandemic started to become clear.JPMorgan shares rose 1.1 per cent in early trading at 6:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has fallen 30 per cent this year through Monday.The bank on Tuesday lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income — revenue from customers’ loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors — by US$1.5 billion to US$55.5 billion. The revenue source accounted for about half the company’s total last year, and in the past has helped counter more volatile results in the trading and investment-banking divisions.The Federal Reserve had two emergency rate cuts, bringing the central bank’s benchmark to virtually zero. The emergency action came as more evidence emerged that the U.S. economy was being hit hard by the virus and the global economic shutdown.For its part, JPMorgan has been waiving fees for some loans, allowing customers to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans, and removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards. It’s planning to lend an additional US$150 billion to clients across the world.KBW analysts led by Brian Kleinhanzl said in an April 8 report they expect provisions to peak in the second quarter as banks build reserves in advance of expected charge-offs under the newly adopted CECL accounting rules.Investors and analysts are taking comfort in the fact that banks are entering the uncertain period with higher capital levels than they had during the 2008 financial crisis.“The company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid – with a CET1 ratio of 11.5 per cent and total liquidity resources of over US$1 trillion,” Dimon said in the statement.While the results offer a look at the impact of the virus, the picture is somewhat muddled because they include January and February, before government lockdown measures began in earnest.

Some 213,000 were handled in the first nine days of the program, and total requests reached 500,000 by April 3.“People have had a chance now to catch their breath a little bit and take stock in their personal financial situation,” Neil Parmenter, president and chief executive officer of the association, said in an interview. He described the response in the first week as “unprecedented.”Initial demand may have been fuelled by unwarranted homeowner fears that the relief program was a “first-come, first-serve” limited-time offer combined with the approaching start of the month, when payments would be due, Parmenter said. The cooling pace of deferral requests doesn’t mean demand has peaked.“I don’t know if we can say it’s behind us because the requests are absolutely still coming in,” he said. “The traffic continues to be elevated from where it’d normally be.”I don't know if we can say it's behind us because the requests are absolutely still coming inCanada’s six largest banks have deferred about 12 per cent of the mortgages in their combined portfolios so far, and small and midsize banks have also deferred a “significant” number of the mortgages on their books, the association said. Some banks have reported that more than 90% of those seeking a deferral are approved.The cash flow freed up by Canadians from deferrals completed to date is about $778 million (US$561 million) a month, or $2.3 billion a quarter, according to estimates from the association using an average monthly mortgage payment of $1,326. That number will grow in the weeks ahead, as more deferral requests are processed, the association said.The federal government’s $25-billion Canada Emergency Business Account has also shown strong pickup, with the country’s five biggest banks approving more than 72,000 loans for small-business clients on Friday, the program’s first day. That’d be worth about $2.89 billion in loans, assuming clients took up the full $40,000 of interest-free government-backed loans offered to them.“We knew the demand was obviously going to be heavy,” Parmenter said of the small-business relief program.Bloomberg.com"

Still, it’s a sign that Amazon is able to accommodate a larger assortment of goods after hiring 100,000 workers and announcing plans to hire 75,000 more. Further details about specific products being accepted and quantities will be shared with Amazon’s merchant partners in the coming days.“Later this week, we will allow more products into our fulfillment centres,” Amazon said in an emailed statement. “Products will be limited by quantity to enable us to continue prioritizing products and protecting employees, while also ensuring most selling partners can ship goods into our facilities.”The move was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.In prioritizing toilet paper, bleach and sanitizing wipes over things like flat-screen televisions and toys, the company focused on delivering products people need right now, sacrificing sales from its deep inventory for the time being.More than half of all products sold on Amazon come from independent merchants who pay Amazon commissions on each sale plus fees for storing, packing and delivering products. Merchants selling in-demand products saw a nice sales bump from swift changes in customer demand while those in the out-of-favour categories watched their sales tank.While Amazon wasn’t accepting new shipments of goods it deemed non-essential, workers in warehouses around the country said they continued to shelve and ship non-essential items like kickballs, bedsheets and books as well as restock returned items. That generated tension because some workers said they felt Amazon could further restrict the products it sold to better protect warehouse workers. Dozens of employees have contracted the coronavirus, and protests have erupted in New York, Chicago and outside Detroit.Groceries and household essentials as well as bread machines, home fitness equipment and computer monitors were among Amazon’s fastest-growing products in March, according to the online retail research firm Stackline.

The dollar’s surge has been particularly painful for countries that ran up borrowing in greenbacks and which will now struggle to cover the loans, especially as their exports tumble.G-20 finance ministers and central bankers will convene by conference call on Wednesday. They are planning to offer lower income countries a freeze on bilateral government loan repayments for six or nine months or possibly into 2021, the Financial Times reported, citing an official.That fits a plan championed by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass. The World Bank in March estimated that US$14 billion in service payments are due this year.The fear is that if the emerging markets lag behind, “it means more of a U-shaped or an L-shaped kind of recovery for the U.S. and global economies,” said Nathan Sheets, a former U.S. Treasury official who’s now chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income.While the U.S., Europe and Japan have opened up the monetary and budgetary spigots to fight Covid-19 and its economic after-effects, many emerging economies lack the scope to do so.Morgan Stanley economists predict that emerging markets, excluding China, will shrink 4.1 per cent in the current quarter, a deeper dive than the 3.1 per cent of the first quarter of 2009 when the world was last in crisis, though shallower than what’s expected in richer economies. They also estimated in an April 3 report that the peak rate of growth during the recovery for those economies will be 6 per cent in the second quarter of 2021 versus 7.7 per cent in the same period of 2010.The problem is even more acute in the poorest nations, where many denizens can’t easily practice the social distancing and regular hand washing that has become de-rigueur in rich countries.Such an environment leaves the IMF reckoning that emerging market and developing countries will need trillions of dollars in external financing to fight the virus, only part of which they can cover on their own, leaving gaps of hundreds of billions of dollars. Half of the international lending organization’s 189 members are already looking to it for aid.Georgieva is trying to rally the world into a unified display of support at the Fund’s semi-annual meeting, which starts Tuesday as a virtual gathering after the typical spring gathering in Washington was re-imagined.“Today we are confronted with a crisis like no other,” Georgieva said in an April 9 speech. “The actions we take now will determine the speed and strength of our recovery.”There are questions, though, about whether the Fund has enough to counter the crisis, especially if it proves protracted.While the IMF says it has a US$1 trillion war chest, Ted Truman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculates that the maximum amount available for new lending is US$787 billion, after taking into account existing commitments and other factors. “The IMF will need more” from the U.S. and the rest of the G20, he said.And it’s not just the amount of resources that are at issue. It’s what kind they are.The crisis has exposed a gaping hole at the center of the global economy. There’s no ultimate lender of last resort who can provide the liquidity that’s demanded in a financial emergency.Some $62 billion was yanked out of emerging markets in the first quarter in a global dash for cash by investors, twice the size of outflows at the peak of the world financial crisis, according to the Institute of International Finance.While there are signs that pressure is easing — Indonesia, for example, sold $4.3 billion of dollar bonds last week to help finance virus relief measures — there are risks the outflows could resume as the hit to emerging market growth becomes more evident, IIF analysts said.The Federal Reserve has moved to partly fill the void, including opening up dollar liquidity swap lines with Brazil, South Korea and Mexico. Sheets said it should do the same with India, Indonesia and Chile.The IMF also has to step up and be willing to set its aside its traditional playbook for dealing with countries in trouble, in which it demands economic reforms in return for financial assistance.“This is much more of an exogenous shock,” said former U.S. Treasury official Mark Sobel, now at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think-tank focused on economic policy and central banking. “There needs to be some recalibration by the IMF to provide far more liberal and fast liquidity to members.”The fund seems to be trying to do just that.It’s looking at the use of precautionary short-term loans to get cash to countries, as well as other funding options like the increased use of reserve assets called special drawing rights, steps that would require the approval of rich nations.One problem with the IMF stepping up, said ex-IMF official Taimur Baig: Many countries don’t like turning to the organization because they fear being tarred as a nation in trouble.“Drawing on to IMF resources has an element of stigma and it is still seen as the last resort of a crisis-hit nation,” said Baig, who’s now chief economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.For some emerging economies with balance of payment challenges, the “more expedient” currency-stabilizing measure is to draw on swap lines or repurchase agreements, as Indonesia has done, said Baig, questioning why the IMF doesn’t also offer those facilities.In the 2008-09 crisis, the G-20 banded together to come up with an action plan.That’s been more difficult this time for a group riven by rivalries — the U.S. and China over trade, Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil, and the U.K. and the European Union over Brexit.IIF President Tim Adams said the G-20 must rise to the occasion, nonetheless.“There will be enormous attention and enormous expectations” focused on this week’s gatherings, he said. “Not meeting them could be detrimental for markets and for confidence.”Bloomberg.com"

At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.This year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.Bloomberg.com"

And now I would like to ask you: ‘Do you agree with these terms?’”In Riyadh, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman nearly chuckled as he looked at a wall of video feeds showing his counterparts around the world. “I go with the consensus. I agree,” he replied.At that moment, the OPEC+ alliance sealed the largest ever coordinated production cut, removing about a 10th of global supply. The historic deal had almost been derailed by a fight between Saudi Arabia and Mexico’s populist government, forcing President Donald Trump to step in and broker a face-saving solution.Prince Abdulaziz declared himself sleepless and exhausted, but triumphant nonetheless.“We have demonstrated that OPEC+ is up, running, and alive,” he told Bloomberg News in an interview minutes after he clinched the agreement. “I’m more than happy.”For the past month, Saudi Arabia had pumped every possible barrel for sale at rock-bottom prices, punishing Russia for refusing to support deeper OPEC+ output cuts in early March. Now, Moscow and Riyadh will both reduce daily production by millions of barrels, spearheading a global agreement between almost all the world’s major oil producers to rein in output.We have demonstrated that OPEC+ is up, running, and aliveBut the deal will only dull the pain, not end the crisis.The market is likely to remain overwhelmed for months to come by the catastrophic collapse in demand caused by the lockdowns designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus through some of the world’s biggest economies.“The OPEC+ agreement will not prevent sharp inventory builds in coming months, and near-term oil prices in the physical market will likely remain under pressure,” said Martijn Rats, oil analyst at Morgan Stanley.The deal between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will remove nearly 10 million barrels a day from the market through deliberate cuts. In addition, the group is counting involuntary declines in the production of the U.S., Canada, Brazil and several other countries, as companies reduce drilling activity due to low prices and weak demand.OPEC+ officials, using some creative accounting that also includes output drops in Venezuela, Iran and Libya, which are exempt from making cuts, said that as much as 20 million barrels a day will over time leave the market — 20 per cent of global production.Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19…..For the time being, the world will need to be content with the 10 million barrels a day from OPEC+. Yet demand is down by about twice that amount, meaning the world’s oil tanks will keep filling day after day as long as planes stay grounded, businesses shuttered and billions of people remain at home.Oil traders don’t seem optimistic. By 9 a.m. in London, prices had slipped into negative territory, falling as much as 2.7 per cent to US$30.63 a barrel.The biggest winner appears to be Trump, who refused to deliberately cut American oil production, but was still able to broker the final deal. His phone call with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, followed by a three-way conference call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, came up with the proposal that resolved the Latin American nation’s objections to the agreement.Trump has taken time away from grappling with the world’s largest coronavirus outbreak and waded into oil politics with a surprising goal. He’s gone from welcoming the crude price collapse to worrying about losing the American energy industry. Fearing that job losses in Texas and other oil-rich states could hurt his re-election prospects, he convinced Putin and the Saudi monarch to end hostilities and make a compromise.“Trump views himself as a deal maker,” said Joe McMonigle, an energy consultant and former U.S. government oil official. So “Trump went to the oil market’s red phone.”The president sealed the historic deal by offering the Saudis something that exists only on paper. When Mexico refused a big output reduction, putting the whole agreement in danger, Trump assured OPEC+ that the U.S. would cut its own production on its neighbour’s behalf.Mexico would remove 100,000 barrels a day, and the U.S. would contribute an additional 300,000 barrels a day, Trump said at the White House. OPEC+ officials and others involved in the talks said those extra barrels simply didn’t exist. The decline in American production would be driven by prices, demand, and capacity in pipelines or tanks, not presidential press conferences.But ultimately his offer was enough.Sunday’s agreement ended a period in which the OPEC+ alliance appeared to be dead, with former partners engaged in oil-trade warfare.It all started on March 6, when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak walked out of OPEC’s headquarters in Vienna and told reporters that his country was ready to increase oil production in April. He had just rebuffed Saudi Arabia’s push for his country to cut output by a few hundred thousand barrels a day, to help counter what most saw as a modest demand slowdown due to the coronavirus. In return, the kingdom had rejected his proposal to continue the group’s existing curbs at their current level.Angered by Russia’s refusal to cut and Novak’s talk of higher production, Saudi Arabia embarked on a shock-and-awe price war. Riyadh offered oil refiners unprecedented discounts for its crude, cutting its official selling prices by the most in more than 30 years. The kingdom also announced it was boosting production to an all-time high above 12 million barrels a day for April, up 25 per cent from February.When the market opened a few hours later, even the most bearish traders were shocked. The Sunday evening session is typically a sedate affair, mostly covered by traders in Asia, where it’s already Monday morning. But that night, every trader from Geneva to London and Houston was glued to their screens.When the selling started, benchmark Brent crude plunged more than 30 per cent in seconds — the biggest one-day drop since the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War.What followed was the most chaotic month in the oil market’s history, threatening the stability of the petroleum-dependent nations from Nigeria to Iraq and upending the business plans of industry giants like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Without fully realizing it, the Saudis had started a price war at the worst possible time. By early March, the coronavirus outbreak had spread well beyond Wuhan, infecting thousands of people from Iran to the U.S. Around the world, governments copied the lockdowns that China had already tried and tested. Country after country put their economies into deep freeze.With demand for jet fuel, gasoline and diesel sharply down, refineries cut production and reduced their crude purchases. The physical oil market started to resemble a closing-down sale. In one obscure corner of the U.S., oil even traded at negative prices, with producers paying consumers to take away their barrels.Without fully realizing it, the Saudis had started a price war at the worst possible timeBrent crude, the North Sea blend used as a global benchmark, had briefly traded above US$70 a barrel at the start of the year. On March 30, it plunged to US$21.65, the lowest in nearly two decades.The most prominent victim was the U.S. shale industry. Drillers in Texas and other states had turned America into the world’s largest oil producer, creating millions of jobs. But fracking is an expensive way to pump crude and the industry had piled up tens of billions of dollars in debt.As prices tumbled, roughnecks, truck divers and engineers quickly lost their jobs. Whiting Petroleum Corp., once North Dakota’s biggest producer, filed for bankruptcy on April 1.As Whiting was going bust, thousands of miles in Saudi Arabia engineers at Aramco were busy pushing their oil wells to the limit.At at exactly 11.29 a.m. on March 31, the giant video wall at the company’s operational nerve centre flashed total production surpassing 12 million barrels a day for the first time in history. Employees celebrated by snapping pictures, arms raised in triumph, according to photographs seen by Bloomberg News.The next day Saudi output crept higher, reaching 12.111 million, then 12.171 million, according to other photographs of the control room. Finally, it hit a record of 12.323 million barrels a day — enough to meet the combined pre-pandemic consumption of Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Spain and Italy and still have some barrels to spare.The oil was being loaded onto an armada of tankers in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, heading for markets that were already drowning in crude.It was an untenable situation, threatening to fill the world’s oil tanks within a few months and send prices crashing to levels not seen since the 1990s. Trump was already putting pressure on Russia and Saudi Arabia to rebuild their alliance.“I never thought I’d be saying that maybe we have to have an oil increase, because we do. The price is so low,” Trump said in a Fox News interview. The president, who had made a political career bashing OPEC and advocating for low gasoline prices, was worried the U.S. industry would be “wiped out.”Saudi Arabia and Russian blamed each other for the crash. Putin accused Saudi Arabia of trying to destroy shale; the Saudis said Moscow had kicked the whole thing off. None of it cut any ice in Washington.”Of“You are waging economic warfare on Texas,” Senator Ted Cruz told the Saudi ambassador in Washington in a private conference call.Recalling the conversation in a media interview afterward, Cruz said: “Their response is, ‘But Russia. But Russia.’ And I said, ‘But Russia garbage. Russia is our enemy, we know it. They behave like it and we treat them like it. You’re supposed to be our friend. And so don’t screw with us.”By then, both Saudi Arabia and Russia had little choice but to start talking. With consumption in free fall, it was only a question of time before they were forced to cut output, simply because there would be nowhere to put the oil.“We see a huge oversupply in the oil market,” said Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency.Trump spoke to both Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, commonly known as MBS, proposing a global deal to cut production. He couldn’t help boasting about the talks before the deal was in place, announcing in a tweet on April 2 that he hoped Riyadh and Moscow would cut output by 10 million barrels a day, if not more.Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!Brent crude jumped more than 45 per cent in just a few seconds, crushing many bearish investors. Even when the market closed hours later, the benchmark was still up 21 per cent — the largest one-day increase ever.Unsurprisingly for a deal that includes dozens of countries in the OPEC+ coalition and the G-20, the final deal is a fudge. Saudi Arabia’s production will only be 1.2 million barrels a day lower than its average level before the price war. Mexico won special treatment and America’s cuts are just an estimate based on forecasts for drilling.The trajectory of oil prices will be more dependent on how fast the world leaves lockdown and the pace of the economic rebound. Yet the deal’s significance goes beyond numbers.There has been a tectonic shift in global oil politics. Putin, MBS and Trump, the leaders of the the world’s three largest producers, are dictating global petroleum supply. And America now accepts that low prices aren’t in its interest.“Trump, who has been a critic of OPEC for years, is the one who put it together,” said Daniel Yergin, the oil historian. “Of all the deals he’s done in his life, this has to be the biggest.”Bloomberg.com"

Mexico appeared to have won a diplomatic victory as it will only be required to cut 100,000 barrels — less than its pro-rated share.With the virus paralyzing air and ground travel, demand for gasoline is collapsing and crude prices have plunged to 18-year lows. That threatened the future of the U.S. shale industry and the stability of oil-dependent states, while piling more challenges onto central banks fighting the fallout from the pandemic.The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters. With countries around the world extending their lockdowns, the death toll mounting in New York, and unemployment exploding in America, the oil market is now far more worried about consumption than supply. OPEC itself acknowledged the challenge, with its chief warning ministers demand fundamentals were “horrifying.”West Texas Intermediate crude plunged more than 9 per cent on Thursday as traders anticipated the cuts wouldn’t go far enough. Oil markets were closed on Friday for Easter.For the deal to be clinched, U.S. President Donald Trump had to intervene, after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftwing populist who has pledged to bolster Mexico’s oil-production prowess, balked at the terms. Bilateral talks between Saudi Arabia and Mexico continued through the weekend.OPEC+ was also seeking 5 million barrels a day of output reductions from producers in the Group of 20. The group, however, didn’t mention any curbs in its communique following a meeting on Friday, only saying it would take measures to ensure stability.Bloomberg.com"

It looked at the companies’ operating cash flow, cash on hand, unused credit facilities and new debt or equity and subtracted capital expenditures and debt due in 2020 to reach the conclusions, which were detailed in a presentation last week.“It’s going to be an extinction-level event for some companies,” said Craig Behnke, equity analyst at the trade publication commonly known as MJBiz Daily. “But it’s a healthy and necessary process for any industry to go through once it’s had a phase of absolute excess and exuberance.”The long-term investment thesis for the industry hasn’t changed as legalization spreads and demand grows, but first companies need to survive long enough to see it, said MJBiz Daily analyst Mike Regan.Many cannabis companies were running low on cash and struggling to raise more before the pandemic, which only made the situation more difficult as equity markets tumbled and volatility spiked. The total amount of capital raised by the industry fell 69 per cent in March from a month earlier as funding sources dried up, according to Viridian Capital Advisors.This has weighed on stock prices. The Bloomberg Intelligence Global Cannabis Competitive Peers Index fell more than 50 per cent between mid-February and its recent low on March 18, and had already lost two-thirds of its value in the 12 months before that.Based on an analysis of 1,400 consumer stocks during the tech bubble and the global financial crisis, Regan said pot stocks are likely to fall even further. In those two bear markets, valuations typically compressed 30 per cent to 50 per cent, falling to 2.4x sales or 7.5x EBITDA. While pot stocks have lost more than 50 per cent on average, many are still trading above those multiples. This is particularly true in Canada, where the average enterprise valuations are 5x sales and 11.3x EBITDA.Those that do survive will rebound sharply, but the trick will be picking the winners, he said.“Even if the long-term cannabis investment thesis is intact, it’s going to come down to executing on that idea to actually realize that return,” Regan said.Bloomberg.com"

Importantly, Russia has agreed to make deep cuts, the delegates said.Oil prices pared gains, trading up 1.6 per cent in London at US$33.37 a barrel as of 4:13 p.m. local time. That reflects concern that the volume of cuts being discussed equates to just a fraction of the demand loss, which some traders estimate at as much as 35 million barrels a day.It’s unclear whether the tentative deal is contingent on the U.S. also committing to curbs at talks on Friday. An agreement from OPEC+ and a broader alliance — including America — is crucial to reviving prices that have sunk to an 18-year low. Not only oil companies, but entire oil-dependent economies need the market to rebound if they’re to balance ailing budgets.Friday’s Group of 20 talks will provide the forum for U.S. President Donald Trump to respond to OPEC+’s agreement. The Kremlin has insisted that America must do more than just let market forces reduce its own record production. Trump, meanwhile, has said his country’s cut will happen “automatically” as low prices put the shale patch in dire straits.If OPEC+, the U.S. and other producers can cement an agreement at the G-20 meeting, the curbs would dwarf any previous market interventions.

He graduated from Boston-based Emerson College in 2009, just as the Great Recession gutted the jobs market for years.He spent his first few years after school fighting for low-paid work as a production assistant. His mentors told him, “‘Dude, you missed the good years by like five years,’” he said.A decade later, just as he had built up savings and was preparing to buy a house, the 31-year-old is out of a job again. The coronavirus outbreak has dried up production gigs in Hollywood, where he works.No age group will escape the pain of the current economic slowdown, but millennials were already on more precarious financial footing than their elders. They left college with unprecedented levels of student debt and missed out on crucial years of wage growth because of the 2008 downturn.Compared to other groups at the same point in their lives, people in their 20s and 30s have relatively low levels of home ownership, net worth and real income, according to a 2018 Federal Reserve Board of Governors paper.“They’re walking a tight rope and there are cliffs on either side,” said Kathryn Edwards, a labor economist at the Rand Corporation. “It’s hard to imagine someone making it through both of these recessions in this age group really unscathed.”Economic downturns are inevitable, but they’re not usually so severe. And once-in-a-generation recessions don’t tend to occur just a decade apart.For millennials, the timing of these events has been particularly damaging. People who enter a labour market with high unemployment typically see a 10 per cent hit to income in the first year, with the effect averaging out to a 1.8 per cent reduction in yearly earnings over 10 years, according economists at Yale and the University of Rochester. They also found the impact of the Great Recession on wages to have been “much larger” than previous downturns.Because an economic crisis hampers job mobility, the effects of one early on in a person’s professional life can last for the next 20 years, research from Carnegie Mellon economics professor Shu Lin Wee has found.This phenomenon isn’t confined to the U.S. In Britain, between 2006 and 2014 real earnings fell twice as fast for people under 30 than for those in their 50s, according to the Resolution Foundation.Meanwhile in Italy, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in Europe, just 24 per cent of houses and land are owned by the young, while the risk of poverty is twice as high among those under the age of 40 than those over 65, according to a study by business association Confindustria.Other generations will experience their own flavour of economic fallout from coronavirus. The oldest members of Generation Z are graduating into a world of city-wide lockdowns, as countries try to curb the spread of a global pandemic.Baby Boomers in the U.S. have now suffered successive blows to their retirement portfolios because of market routs. Those are the lucky ones: Almost half of U.S. households 55 and older have nothing saved for retirement. Millions of people of all ages are now out of jobs.“I worry about the younger guys more,” said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. They’re more likely to get laid off than those more senior, he said, adding, “I worry even more about the people without college diplomas.”While white collar workers can work from home, sectors largely filled by people without college degrees, such as retail, food services, hospitality and construction have already seen major job losses because of the pandemic.One such person is Denzel Buie, a 25-year-old glazier living in Philadelphia with his fiance and his three-year-old daughter. He was laid off a few weeks ago. Buie had health care through his employer and now worries that if he gets sick, he won’t be able to afford a hospital visit.“It makes you feel vulnerable because sooner or later resources that you had built up [are] going to run out,” he said.As for those in white-collar professions, Chip Espinoza, dean of strategy and innovation at Vanguard University, fears people in their 30s will once again get stymied in career advancement because another recession means Boomers won’t retire on schedule.“You’re really looking at a workforce that is going to continue to age and continue to create challenges for younger generations in their upward mobility,” he said. Millennials “will have to rent longer, co-habitate longer, and stay in starter homes longer.”Already millennials, because of their debt burdens and a pricy housing market, had been slow to dive into home ownership, a key way to build wealth. People like Michael Baum, who did manage to buy, fear they made their purchases at the exact wrong moment.Just two weeks ago, Baum, a 33-year-old special needs teacher, moved into a new house purchased using money from his wedding and family savings in Plano, Illinois. While he still has work, his wife recently lost her customer service job in retail. They not only have a mortgage, but her student loans to pay off still.“It could be a problem if the unemployment stops,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Private-sector forecasters now expect a historic contraction in second quarter U.S. output, followed by a rebound in the second half of the year.In an evening teleconference following the March 15 announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that he expected the virus to run its course and the U.S. economy to resume a normal level of activity. But he said “in the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy —ultimately, to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible.”Since then, the U.S. central bank has begun rolling out a number of emergency lending programs first deployed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Those include measures to fund short-term borrowings of companies in the commercial paper market and clean up the balance sheets of dealer banks and money-market mutual funds by accepting a wide range of securities as collateral in exchange for cash loans.The Fed has also since announced new lending programs which would see them extend support to large companies through purchases of longer-term corporate debt, as well as facilities that will offer lifelines to small and medium-sized businesses.

That compares with the 140-basis point spread it offered on $750 million of 10-year debt last year.The price Suncor is paying to borrow is by far outpacing the increase in risk premiums broadly in the Canadian company bond market in the past month amid global credit volatility. As of Monday, investors were demanding 245 basis points over government securities to hold Canadian corporate debt, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. That compares with 118 basis points buyers required when Suncor last tapped the market in May. The company’s new notes were priced to yield 5.039 per cent, compared with 3.128 per cent in the previous deal.Suncor sold debt at a time when Alberta is asking the Canadian government for an aid package that will help energy companies deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and an oil-price crisis.Despite spiking funding costs, Suncor is still rated investment-grade at Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, making it one of the highest rated firms in an industry that has largely moved to the riskier high-yield category. This may explain why 75 investors took part in today’s transaction, placing enough orders to cover the deal size by more than three times, according to people familiar with the matter.In response to the plunge in crude prices, the company slashed its planned capital spending for the year by about 26 per cent to a range of $3.9 billion to $4.5 billion to conserve cash. It’s also cutting operating expenditures and adjusting refinery utilization. “Suncor’s liquidity is good,” Moody’s said in a statement today, adding that the company would take needed action to maintain its capital structure and cash flow should oil prices remain low.A representative for Calgary-based Suncor didn’t provide immediate comment when contacted by Bloomberg.Bloomberg.com"

Bank of Montreal, for example, is enabling over half of its call centre staff to make the move, and has dramatically lowered the number of on-site staff in each remaining location by sending them to alternative sites, including closed branches to help maintain social distancing.At Royal Bank of Canada, 85 per cent of its call and operations centre employees in personal and commercial banking are already working from home, and the Toronto-based bank has a goal of reaching 95 per cent by early next week.Toronto-Dominion is able to shift about 350 employees in Canada and 150 in the U.S. each day, and by the end of April almost all of its 9,500 call centre staff will be working from home, aside from those with less than three months experience.“The whole business working together really made this happen: the logistics, the risk component, the technology, the deployment,” Toronto-Dominion’s Smith said. “We have people working every single night, all night long, every day of the week to make this happen.”The effort hasn’t been without its challenges, including deploying all the laptops and monitors — nor risks.“We know that it is a little bit different working from home — we can’t control everything that you can control in the office, so we had to become comfortable with the way we mitigate our risk,” Smith said. “That was a big obstacle that we overcame.”Working from home has been embraced by the employees, according to Smith. Workers get an extra 10 personal days to help with daycare issues and the ability to change schedules and do split shifts.When the COVID-19 pandemic ends, Toronto-Dominion expects to keep work-from-home as an option for call centre staff.“There’s no telling what this is going to look like when we’re all done and how people are going to feel, but I would like to continue to allow agents to work from home even after the crisis,” Smith said. “And that would be solely for flexibility.”Bloomberg.com"

Once the province does start to relax those measures, it will mimic other jurisdictions like Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea that have managed to both contain the virus while keeping their economies functioning, he said.That will include aggressive mass testing to identify positive cases and those with immunity, precise targeting of close contacts, border screening, strict enforcement of quarantine orders and encouraging the use of masks in crowded public spaces, he said.Kenney also released projections for the numbers of potential infections and deaths from the Covid-19 virus in the province under different scenarios:Under the “probable” scenario, Alberta may see as many as 800,000 infections and 400 to 3,100 deathsUnder the less likely “elevated” scenario, the province may see as many as 1 million infections and 500 to 6,600 deaths. If the province implemented no social-distancing measures, it could have experienced as many as 1.6 million infections and 32,000 deaths.“These models are not a done deal,” Kenney said. “I want Albertans to see them as a challenge. Perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation.”Bloomberg.com"

He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame after his hedge fund’s bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in “The Big Short,” an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis.Although Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled “bubble” in passive investment products. He’s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.“Universal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,” Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. “And it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.”Burry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community, began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle as the “real personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.” He said he began speaking out because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. “Unconscionable,” is how he described job losses in the U.S., which have caused a once-unthinkable 10 million people to apply for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN Bloomberg.Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He’s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a “game changer” in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn’t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. “We feel a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,” he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a “significant bearish market bet that is working out for now,” without providing details except to say it was a trade of a “good size” against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he has also highlighted large economies that haven’t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain. Germany and Japan have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here’s what he had to say about China’s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently and the long-term impact.“This is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.”“In hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.”“If there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.”“It’s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don’t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors’ hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.”“A more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups — the obese, old and already-sick — to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.”“I would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.”“When it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we’re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments — both new and repurposed — shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.”“Medically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.”“I believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features — such as a largely lawful and well-educated society — that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.”“Economically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.”“Countries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.”Bloomberg.com"

Then one of the bank’s credit-trading leaders, Nicholas Adragna, weighed in: “The trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr’s note.”The trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr's noteMore than 100 employees were on the message chain seen by Bloomberg, and some were horrified. It came soon after an outbreak of COVID-19 inside JPMorgan’s Madison Avenue headquarters, in which at least 16 people tested positive on a single trading floor. Some employees complain they’re getting conflicting messages from middle and senior managers about coming into offices, where billions of dollars of profit are at stake, and that they would rather follow the advice of government officials to hunker down at home.“We’ve stated many times that anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn’t have to,” said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan. “We have never had a policy requiring, or even requesting, a doctor’s note.”Those tensions aren’t limited to JPMorgan. While Wall Street firms have told most employees to work remotely, a number of traders and bankers who set up at home say they have been getting phone calls and messages from managers urging them to return to offices, some of which recently saw infections.Small and large firms are trying to maintain enough on-site staffing to ensure swift trading. It’s the finance industry’s version of an issue spanning the U.S., where “essential” workers feel they have to choose between keeping their jobs and risking their lives.Some investment banks have publicly touted the degree to which they are able to let employees work remotely, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently announcing that only one of every 50 workers was on site. But most trading divisions require additional staffing on high-speed office terminals to handle the deluge of customer orders as markets swing. Bank of America Corp. has said it has about one in 20 trading employees in the office. At JPMorgan it’s about one in five in trading.Around the same time that JPMorgan bond-trading executives were emailing each other, Jason Sippel, the bank’s global head of equities trading, held a conference call with his subordinates. He said the trading division isn’t as effective when too many people are working remotely but that it’s trying to be respectful of people’s circumstances, according to a person who heard the call.Still, the situation on Wall Street contrasts with the pressures on tellers and call-centre personnel to show up in consumer banking operations even though they earn less. And outside the financial industry, the situation is even harsher, with about 10 million people filing for unemployment benefits in just two weeks, and workers at companies such as Amazon.com Inc. airing grievances over safety conditions.Traders have long been known to work through illness, but in the past few weeks those attitudes have shifted as news stations showed refrigerated trucks outside New York hospitals, medical tents in Central Park and public health officials begging people to stay home.One trading executive at a major New York brokerage said he wanted to be the last person on his staff to stay at the office. Just before he left for home last month, he was exposed at work to the virus. He eventually developed a cough. Now outside New York, he has been working in solitude and staying up until 1 a.m. He recently got tested but still hadn’t received his results as April began.Inside BGC Partners, an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, workers received a memo marked “important” last month notifying them that no government orders were stopping them from showing up. “We remain open,” the memo said. “Driving to the offices and using mass transit are permitted in order to travel to and from our office.” Some BGC employees privately complained they felt pressured to keep coming downtown — even as other memos laid out the option of working from home. A BGC spokesman declined to comment.Still, two people at the firm who fell ill said they had no complaints. One credited managers for sending his entire desk home after the first person got sick. Another said he kept working in isolation until his symptoms were too severe, and that managers then gave him ample time off to recover.Most big banks announced similar strategies for preventing the spread of the virus at work: They assigned skeleton crews to trading floors and so-called disaster recovery sites, and sent the rest home. But within days, traders in offices privately complained about colleagues continuing to cluster around them. Some said they waited weeks for technicians to physically separate rows of specialized terminals.A JPMorgan trader in London said he was initially sent to the basement of the firm’s 19th-century building along the Thames, where scores of colleagues nervously worked side by side. The conditions improved when back-office staff were allowed to leave. He said he, too, has since been told he needs a doctor’s note to work from home.Inside Natixis SA’s New York office, nerves frayed after the French bank sent traders to a recovery site outside the city so cramped that social distancing was impossible, one person said. The firm later ditched the plan and sent people home, where employees received an important email from a top executive: “Highly Confidential: COVID-19 — Staff Infection List.”Workers who clicked the attachment realized it was an anti-phishing test on behalf of the compliance team and that they had failed it. Many were furious, the person said.“Natixis strongly rejects any suggestion that it has put its employees at risk,” said Daniel Wilson, a Natixis spokesman in Paris, adding that all investment banking employees in the Americas have been working from home since mid-March. “We have taken rigorous measures in the U.S., as elsewhere, to protect our employees’ health and help slow the propagation of the virus.”Market swings can generate big profits and losses for banks, and most executives agree it’s easier to navigate the turmoil from trading floors, where connections are faster and communication is easier.On March 26, the fourth day of New York’s statewide lockdown, JPMorgan’s Adragna dashed off a note to his subordinates. Troy Rohrbaugh, the bank’s global head of markets, “continues to want to push everyone to get back into the office,” Adragna said.A record had just been shattered in the investment-grade credit market, as U.S. companies raced to issue billions of dollars in bonds to bolster their financing. Adragna’s team had traded more than $3 billion of bonds that day and, the reasoning was, that wouldn’t have been possible if they’d been working from home.“With the amount of issuance trading we can really separate ourselves and do a great job for customers by being in the office,” Adragna wrote. “Let’s attack and use this as an opportunity to differentiate ourselves both internally and externally. LET’S GO.”JPMorgan’s spokesman disputed the notion that Rohrbaugh would push anyone to come into the office and said the markets chief has reiterated on his regular calls that anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn’t have to.Elsewhere within the industry, middle managers have cajoled reluctant employees by suggesting that their presence is needed to comply with regulatory pressure to more closely monitor traders’ dealings. It isn’t clear which watchdogs are making such requests.The Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority haven’t been pressing banks to increase on-site staffing in recent weeks, officials said. In a public notice last month, Finra said people would need to telework and that it would let firms improvise systems “reasonably designed” to supervise them.Working from home has received mixed reviews from bankers and traders. Some of them grimace at the technical difficulties and chafe at the awkwardness of working among family. Others are enjoying the time being close to loved ones, or finding other reasons to embrace it.One senior trader at Goldman Sachs said she’s been writing emails while sitting on a yoga ball, and doing pull-ups on bathroom breaks. When she has to go back in the office, she said, she’ll miss doing burpees, a type of squat thrust, while listening to conference calls.Bloomberg.com"

The yen weakened and Treasuries fell.The benchmark S&P 500 Index surged late in the trading session to finish up 7 per cent, closing at the highest level since March 13. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said earlier that deaths were showing signs of hitting a plateau in the state that has become the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak. Italy had the lowest number of new coronavirus infections in nearly three weeks and France reported a continued levelling-off of cases, helping to send European and Asian shares higher.“You can’t say that we’ve definitely turned the corner for certain but it does appear as though that is a good sign,” said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management, which oversees $28 billion.The number of deaths in the U.S. is still expected to peak on April 16, though the cumulative number of Americans likely to die from Covid-19 was revised downward to 82,000, from an estimate of 94,000 less than a week ago. But its apex, 3,130 Americans will die per day, up from the previous estimate of 2,644.The pound weakened after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was taken into a hospital intensive care unit for treatment for coronavirus after his condition worsened. The mostly upbeat tone in markets followed another negative week, and the mood among investors remains divided. Bulls are pointing to more attractive valuations, unprecedented stimulus and now slowing death rates in several major countries. Bears are fretting the continued spread of the disease, dismal economic data and the rising corporate costs of the pandemic and subsequent shutdown.“For now the markets will likely remain hostage to news on how long it will take to ‘get back to business’ and ‘the good life.”’ John Stoltzfus, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co., wrote to clients. “We’d expect markets to continue trading on a combination of fear, technical factors and wistful hope with fundamentals clouded by the uncertainty weaved by the insidious virus.”In Asia, Japan’s benchmark ended almost 4 per cent higher even as that country moved closer to declaring a state of emergency. The yen dropped as haven demand receded. Shares in Hong Kong rose while Shanghai was closed for a holiday.Elsewhere, crude oil fell on signals that a glut is growing at America’s key oil storage hub, offsetting earlier support from signs that Saudi Arabia and Russia are making progress toward a supply-curb agreement.Bloomberg.com"

As of last week’s close, the stake was worth $369.4 million.The Saudis are getting a bargain-bin price for Carnival — it’s down 81 per cent this year — as the cruise industry faces unprecedented risks. The Public Investment Fund has invested abroad previously, including stakes in Uber Technologies Inc., Tesla Inc. and SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund. But it isn’t generally known for making distressed investments.Now, it owns a slice of the dominant cruise operator, with a fleet of more than 100 ships and no customers to sail on them — at least for now.Carnival’s operations came to an almost complete stop last month after a series of coronavirus outbreaks at sea. Carnival’s Diamond Princess had more than 700 coronavirus cases, the biggest outbreak outside of mainland China for a time.Rival operators Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. have also shut down.The cruise industry was left out of the US$2.2 trillion U.S. stimulus bill, which excluded non-U.S. businesses. Although it is headquartered in Miami, Carnival is technically incorporated in Panama — an arrangement that allows it to avoid U.S. income taxes and minimum-wage requirements.Competitors are also domiciled outside the U.S.Since the halt of operations, Carnival has raised US$6.25 billion to help meet expenses, but it’s paying a steep price. Some US$4 billion in bonds were priced with an 11.5 per cent coupon last week. The shares were acquired before a planned stock offering by Carnival, so the percentage holding will change.In an interview Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said Carnival may turn to major shipbuilding nations such as Italy or Germany for lower-cost loans.“Yes, those are definitely potential sources,” he said. “And there are others.”Bloomberg.com"

Pot companies completed two capital raises worth just US$5.6 million the week ended March 27, according to data from Viridian Capital Advisors. That’s the lowest level of activity this year and compares to 17 capital raises worth $169 million for the same period in 2019.The lack of financing is starting to take its toll on the weakest companies. Last week, CannTrust Holdings Inc. and James E. Wagner Cultivation Corp. both filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada. For CannTrust, it was the end of a nine-month-long saga that began when regulators discovered it grew pot in unlicensed areas and ultimately suspended its license, a blow it wasn’t able to recover from.“The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated what were already difficult circumstances,” the company said in a statement, “making it even more challenging for CannTrust to attract new financing or a strategic partner.”There are other signs of strain, even in relatively healthy companies.Cronos Group Inc., which is well capitalized thanks to a large investment by tobacco giant Altria Group Inc., delayed the release of its fourth-quarter results and restated its financials for the previous three quarters because of issues with the way it reported certain bulk resin purchases. The company’s weak revenue in the quarter — just US$7.3 million — prompted at least three analysts to downgrade the stock.Hexo Corp. missed its quarterly filing deadline and, when it did report, announced $266 million of writedowns and impairment charges. Revised debt covenants require it to raise $40 million in equity by April 30, a “startling sum” that “could mean severe downward pressure” on the stock, according to CIBC analyst John Zamparo. If it can’t secure that financing, that “would put its going concern status at risk,” said BMO’s Tamy Chen.Although cannabis sales jumped as self-isolation orders took effect last month, providing a rare respite for the struggling industry, there are already signs the initial spike is starting to wane.After a notable increase in mid-March, “sales velocity meaningfully decelerated” on the Ontario Cannabis Store website last weekend, “suggesting that this recent surge may be transitory unless COVID-19 quarantine measures are meaningfully extended,” Chen said in a note. “We believe the COVID-19 fallout presents incremental downside for industry sales over the balance of this year.”Bloomberg.com"

But while forecasts range wildly, almost everyone agrees Thursday’s jobs report will show an historic decline.Royal Bank of Canada sees 1 million lost jobs last month and Citigroup Inc. predicts 1.1 million after the coronavirus forced companies nationwide to cut staff. At the other end of the spectrum, 4CAST projects a net loss of 100,000, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. puts it at 175,000.Such disparity may reflect just how quickly the virus has overwhelmed Canada’s economy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has rolled out massive fiscal support to encourage employers to keep workers on payrolls, but it’s unclear how effective those programs will be.Prior to the pandemic, the biggest decline in Canadian employment was 125,000 in January 2009.Last month’s potentially epic loss was foreshadowed by jobless claims that have already reached records, with more than 2 million Canadians applying for employment insurance in the second half of March.Statistics Canada conducted its labor force survey between March 15 and March 21, meaning the results should capture the early days of the disruption.The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey of 19 economists is for a drop of 500,000 jobs. If that plays out, it will be the biggest decrease in records back to 1976.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The unpredictability of the oil market is going to weigh on the currency, according to Bipan Rai, CIBC’s head of North American foreign-exchange strategy.Oil prices have plunged amid the coronavirus fallout and the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, hitting oil exporters like Canada especially hard. Russian President Vladimir Putin in televised comments Friday told the country’s top oil executives that crude-producing countries should join together to slash output. West Texas Intermediate gained a second day, still leaving it more than 50 per cent lower this year.Rai sees the U.S. dollar buying $1.45 by the end of June, compared with about $1.4150 now. That would leave it approaching the level of $1.4668 it touched last month — its weakest since early 2016 — amid the market turmoil fuelled by the pandemic.“When you look at the Canadian dollar right now, it’s primarily a story of oil price pressures,” Rai said. “We still don’t know how bad the impact is going to be in the real economy. But it’s going to be very very deep. We’re still very much beholden to political headlines, choppy headlines.”The median estimate is for $1.39 at the end of the second quarter, about 2 per cent stronger than current levels, according to a Bloomberg survey of 41 forecasters. But Rabobank NA, which had the most accurate overall currency predictions in the first quarter across major currencies, also expects a weaker loonie, forecasting $1.46 by the end of June.For Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank, it’s a story of U.S. dollar dominance.The Bloomberg dollar index has surged about 7 per cent this year, fuelled by haven demand and liquidity concerns as the pandemic fuelled market turmoil.“There has been one very obvious trend over the last month, and that is of dollar strength,” she said. “Quite simply, until we are at a point when the market wants to move back into high-yield, emerging-market currencies in significant amounts, I think the dollar is going to a retain a well-bid tone.”Bloomberg.com"

Athabasca’s Hangingstone Project is an oil sands steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) operation near Fort McMurray, with an operating break-even price of about $37.50 a barrel for Western Canadian Select, according to the company’s statement.

They will be free to actually produce that crude later on, when prices are better, and refund the government the revenue it paid them earlier, smoothing out the producers’ revenue and “leaving taxpayers whole.”“As a voluntary arrangement, Shut & Swap rests on market forces, and temporarily utilizes the balance sheet liquidity afforded by the Canadian government,” Greg Pardy, an analyst at RBC, said in a research note published Thursday.Canada’s energy sector has been collateral damage in the Saudi-Russia oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic. Storage tanks worldwide are brimming with crude as the global pandemic destroys demand, while Saudi Arabia and Russia ramp up output in a fight for market share.At one point last week, a benchmark of Canadian heavy crude tumbled as low as US$3.82 a barrel. The price of Western Canadian Select for May was US$16.25 below West Texas Intermediate Thursday, according to NE2 Group.And while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has opened the government’s coffers to businesses in an effort to save the Canadian economy, nothing specific has been done for the energy sector yet. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week that further relief measures, specifically for the oil and gas and airline sectors, will come in the “not too distant future.”The twin shock has taken its toll on all energy producers, big and small.Canadian oil giant Suncor Energy Inc. said last week it will shut in one of its two production lines at its two-year-old, 194,000 barrel-a-day Fort Hills oil sands mine. Additionally, demand losses could see commercial inventory levels to be breached within two to three weeks if Canadian production isn’t further reduced, Goldman Sachs estimated earlier this week.RBC’s Pardy said Canadian oil producers will need to shut in or curtail about 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels per day, or one-quarter to one-third of supply, in the second and third quarters of this year.“We have fielded a number of queries regarding the potential role that policymakers in Canada could play in providing energy sector support,” he said. “We believe that Shut & Swap — a conceptual arrangement aimed at revenue smoothing — could be a partial remedy.”Bloomberg.com"

But the crisis engulfing the industry now is so fast, the same rules don’t apply.From the shale patch of Texas and the oilsands of Canada to the plains of Siberia, production of at least one in every 10 barrels around the world is likely to be shuttered as demand is shredded by the coronavirus pandemic. Cost won’t be the ultimate arbiter for producers this time, because as the International Energy Agency says, “there could soon be no place for their oil to go.”Every imaginable space — from tanks and pipelines to rail cars — is filling to the brim. It’s a key reason that pressure is building for an output cut by OPEC and other producers at their meeting next week, though even the 10 million barrels a day of curbs that’s been touted may not be enough. Only those who can find a place to shelter their unwanted crude are likely to remain standing.“It’s important to think about who’s going to shut in. It’s all dictated by logistics and where you sit in these major pipelines around the world,” Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a Bloomberg television interview. “It’s going to be Russia, the U.S., Canada and parts of Latin America where you see the real damage.”The rout in demand is staggering. With large swathes of the global economy shut down to tackle the virus pandemic, with no idea of how long it’ll continue, some oil traders are estimating an unprecedented 35 million barrels a day destruction in oil use.Even if OPEC and other producers agree to a 10 million barrels a day of output cuts — in itself a mammoth undertaking —the IEA estimates 15 million a day of stockpile would still build up.When oil last collapsed five years ago it was America’s shale producers who took the immediate hit because of their sensitivity to price swings, and the nation’s industry is set to be battered again. Pipeline operators have asked drillers in Texas to ratchet back output.This time round everyone is sharing the pain. About 7 million barrels of daily output due to be shipped next month by a range of exporters is “homeless,” with “literally nowhere to go,” consultant JBC Energy GmbH estimates.Production is starting to buckle everywhere.IHS Markit expects as much as 10 million barrels a day of output to be shut-in from April through June as storage fills up. In Canada, Athabasca Oil Corp. suspended some oilsands operations and Suncor Energy Inc. said last month it will partly shut some of its fields.Brazil’s Petrobras is paring production by 200,000 barrels a day. Landlocked Chad in Africa has halted two fields, and Ecuador, Citigroup Inc. said, “isn’t able to sell its crude anywhere to anybody.”Producers who are operating offshore, or have access to coastal terminals, possess the widest options to reroute their barrels and will be the most “immune,” Goldman’s Currie said. Those “sitting behind thousands of miles of pipe” are the most exposed.Russia, despite having helped initiate the global price war, is among those particularly vulnerable to its fallout. As sales from ports and its Druzhba pipeline melt away, the country could be incapable of selling about 1 million barrels a day of its output, according to Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citi.Neighbours such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, both far away from their customers, face “severe offtake issues,” said David Wech, an analyst at JBC Energy in Vienna.While logistics are critical, oil’s collapse is simply making some production unprofitable. At US$25 a barrel crude, about 5 per cent of global production is losing money, according to the IEA.Companies are also slashing spending. BP Plc will invest less in its U.S. shale operations this year as it looks to reduce expenditure by about US$5 billion, lowering production. Some North Sea fields just aren’t economical at current oil prices.“In the short-term, low prices will decrease supply by incentivizing reduced production,” said Paul Horsnell, an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc.Amid the carnage, there may still be a winner. Saudi Arabia, OPEC kingpin and the main architect of the bruising price war, can pump crude from its vast fields at less than US$10 a barrel. It also has access to plentiful storage around the world — from Egypt to Japan.Riyadh is flooding the market with crude as it threatens to pump at record high levels, contributing to oil’s rout and forcing producers to consider an output agreement.The kingdom is convening an emergency online gathering of the OPEC+ coalition on Monday. The meeting is open to producers worldwide, including the U.S. If America were to join coordinated production cuts, that would be an unprecedented move away from the country’s free-market ethics.But there are no guarantees that a deal can be reached. And even if an expanded alliance is made and the currently discussed 10 million barrels a day of cuts are agreed, it would ultimately be insufficient in the face of such an enormous glut.“The market is going to be shutting stuff down whether you like it or not,” said Jan Stuart, global energy economist at Cornerstone Macro LLC. “That horse has left the barn.”Bloomberg.com"

Oil rallied on expected output curbs.The S&P 500 fell for the third time in four days as investors digested the abysmal jobs report that captured data in the period largely before government-mandated shutdowns went into widespread effect.

One more pillar of the Canadian economy is under threat from the coronavirus pandemic.What was a roaring start to the spring house-hunting season has ended in a whimper. By the time the dust settles on what’s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.“This is freezing the market,” John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. “The best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall. I don’t think anyone’s really expecting anything before that.”Real estate, along with residential building construction, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Canada’s output last year, ahead of energy at about 9 per cent. It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it’s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it’s all but shut down in Quebec.It’s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven’t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.“We’re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it’s ridiculous,” he says. “Why would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.”Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a “tough but temporary blow” to Canada’s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodHow quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.“The longer this goes, the more it’s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,” said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. “So it’ll affect qualifications.”The uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.“People aren’t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,” Collu said in a phone interview. “Purchase activity is going to be curtailed.”Still, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.“We see the outlook improving markedly next year,” RBC’s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. “Exceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.”Papailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and “you can go outside without getting your children or parents sick — I think the market is going to go bananas.”Elton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there’s a broader recession — and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.“There’s the big unknown — the elephant south of the border,” said Ash.Bloomberg.com"

He also tweeted that the cut could be up to 15 million barrels.Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!At noon, Brent futures were up 19 per cent, to US$29.56 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose US$4.59, or 23 per cent, to $22.55. Canadian WCS surged $3.80 to $9.09. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn’t spoken to the Saudi crown price and hasn’t agreed to cut oil production to boost prices, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a text message.The Middle East kingdom also didn’t confirm the cuts, but called for an urgent meeting of the OPEC+ producer alliance to reach a “fair deal” that would restore balance in oil markets, state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. Any curbs by the group would be conditional on other countries joining, according to a delegate.“The 10, 15 million barrel a day cut is just not going to happen. On top of that, Russia has older oil wells, so they can’t restart in the same way that Saudi Arabia can,” said Tariq Zahir, a fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.He added that there is a chance that the countries might agree to some sort of curb, but if there was a supply reduction of that size, it would come from inventories filling up storage, leading to economic shuts in. The move comes after oil was already climbing following China’s instruction to government agencies to start buying cheap crude for its strategic reserves.Despite the U.S. president’s optimism, Saudi Arabia hasn’t appeared to relent on its bid to flood the market yet, saying on Wednesday it was pumping at a record and had this week loaded almost 19 million barrels of oil in a single day. Meanwhile, Russia has said it’s not satisfied with the oil price.If collective action does remove 10 million barrels a day from the market, that would be the equivalent of about 10 per cent of world demand prior to the impact of coronavirus crisis.That may not be enough to stop the pain that’s rippled across the energy industry as demand craters with the coronavirus outbreak shutting down economies around the world, according to Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura. The trading house raised its consumption-loss estimate to around 35 million barrels a day.“We have no hope of production cuts matching the demand destruction,” he told Bloomberg, adding that by the middle to late April, “oil will have come out of the ground and will struggle to find a home.”That view is consistent with a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. note earlier this week, citing that any conceivable oil production cut by the U.S., OPEC+ and Canada would still “fall well short” of its estimated 26 million barrels a day of demand loss and only provide “fleeting support to inland crude prices.”Meanwhile, the physical crude market continues to show deepening signs of strain.Dated Brent, the benchmark for two-thirds of the world’s physical supply, was assessed at $15.135 on Wednesday, the lowest since at least 1999. Crude has slipped below $10 in some areas including Canada and shale regions in the U.S., Belarus wants to buy Russian oil for $4, while some grades have posted negative prices.As supply balloons, there are growing signs that the world is running out of places to store the glut.Bloomberg.com"

The Bank of Canada hasn’t set a limit on purchases, only saying it will buy a minimum $5 billion in government bonds per week until the nation’s recovery is “well underway.”While Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has been reluctant to define the purchases as “quantitative easing” specifically, he said last week he wouldn’t argue against characterizing the actions as such.The bond purchases are unprecedented — the central bank didn’t roll out this sort of program even during the financial crisis — highlighting the severe impact collapsing oil prices and mandated business closures are having on Canada’s economy. The operations will also keep credit flowing at a time when the government is expected to move ahead with record borrowing in coming months to finance its own stimulus package.The Canadian government on Wednesday sold $5.5 billion in five-year bonds.The next purchase of government bonds by the Bank of Canada takes place April 2, in the 10-year sector.Bloomberg.com"

As many as 70 per cent of the nation’s 6,000 oil explorers eventually may go under, according to Mizuho Securites USA LLC analyst Paul Sankey, as the twin blows of Covid-19 and a Russia-Saudi price war destroy producers like Whiting.Once the largest oil producer in North Dakota’s Bakken shale region, Whiting lost money in four of the last five years and spiralled deeper into debt just as the COVID-19 outbreak crushed energy demand. The company’s Bakken primacy won it little praise because the region was already falling out of favour as drillers shifted to lower-cost prospects in the Permian Basin.Touted as one of the “comeback kids” of U.S. shale by Canaccord Genuity in late 2015, Whiting said Wednesday that it’s agreed to hand most of its ownership to noteholders in exchange for erasing more than US$2.2 billion in debt, according to a statement.As many as 40 per cent of U.S. oil and gas companies could crater into bankruptcy or distress over the next two years as they grapple with a market crash and the coronavirus outbreak, according to asset manager Pickering Energy Partners LP.Shale drillers aren’t the sole sub sector clobbered by the crash. Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc., which specializes in hauling gear to offshore drilling sites and production platforms, disclosed Wednesday that it’s negotiating a plan with creditors to ease a US$1.2 billion debt burden. The company is planning a Chapter 11 filing.On Wednesday, Denver-based Whiting faced the maturity of US$262 million in convertible-notes . Whiting filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in the Southern District of Texas, listing debt of US$3.6 billion and assets worth US$7.6 billion in its bankruptcy petition.Even before the viral pandemic sent crude prices tumbling to the lowest in almost two decades, Whiting was struggling and never fully recovered from the last market crash of 2014-2016. In December 2015, as crude prices were just weeks from dipping to a 13-year low, Canaccord analyst Stephen Berman listed Whiting among a group of potential “comeback kids” in the U.S. shale industry.When former Anadarko Petroleum Corp. executive Brad Holly took the reins as Whiting’s chief in late 2017, oil prices were rising and at one point breached US$75 a barrel. But the debt load remained stubbornly high, prompting Holly last year to fire one-third of his workforce and scale back production targets after posting an unexpected quarterly loss.Oil now trades around US$20 a barrel, well below the US$50 level that Cowen Inc. analyst David Deckelbaum estimates Whiting requires to stay afloat. The company, which had a market capitalization of US$11 billion in 2014, was valued at about US$62 million as of Tuesday. Whiting’s bankruptcy filing followed that of shale drillers Alta Mesa Resources Inc. and Sanchez Energy Corp., which sought protection last year.Moelis & Co. is Whiting’s financial adviser, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP is its legal adviser and Alvarez & Marsal is its restructuring adviser.The case is Whiting Petroleum Corporation, 20-32021, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District.Bloomberg.com"

The decline in the U.S. was smaller at 15 per cent, it said.

The large Canadian banks matched those moves by cutting their prime rates, which influence borrowing rates for variable mortgages and credit lines, to 2.45 per cent from 3.95 per cent at the start of the month.As those rates have dropped, banks have been eliminating discounts off prime on variable mortgages. At the start of the month, qualified borrowers could get a rate of prime minus 1 per cent from HSBC Canada, for example, while Canada’s large domestic lenders were also offering “prime minus” deals as well.But those discounts have shrunk by 75 to 85 basis points, said Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com.Typical five-year fixed rates at also rising. Rates at large Canadian bank are now at 2.99 per cent to 3.04 per cent versus around 2.49 per cent to 2.59 per cent at the end of February, McLister said.“The big banks are leading the charge higher here, on both the fixed side and the variable side,” he said. Preferred borrowers can still get some prime minus deals at big banks, but they’re more like prime minus 10 or 15 basis points.McLister said the rising cost of short-term funding, used for variable mortgages, explains the jump. Spreads are wide, fewer people want to lend big banks money at preferable pricing, so that gets passed through to the borrower, McLister said.Fixed-rate mortgages, which are tied more to swings in the bond market, are also creeping up after Canadian bond yields hit record lows earlier in the month, added Cooper.“The banks just can’t afford to price their loans at what are de minimis bond yield levels,” Cooper said.She expects banks to start charging prime plus a premium for variable loans, as well as higher rates for fixed mortgages than those seen earlier in the year.“I believe mortgage rates will trend around current levels,” Cooper said. “I don’t think interest rates in general are going to be a lot higher in the next year.”Bloomberg.com"

Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra told President Donald Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow that the automaker might be able to help make much-needed ventilators, the scarce breathing machines used to keep coronavirus patients alive.The deal would help the company, which has had tense relations with Trump. It would help the administration, which faced charges that the pandemic caught it napping. Most importantly, it would help the sickest patients, those facing death without machines to breathe for them.But not 10 days later, Trump accused GM of foot-dragging and price-gouging in its effort to replenish the supply of medical equipment. “Always a mess with Mary B,” Trump tweeted, hours before invoking the Defense Production Act, which allowed him to order GM to move.As usual with “this” General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, “very quickly”. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke “P”.Newly revealed details show that GM has been continuously engaged in the effort — order or no order — and company officials say the sprint from first phone call to production will take about a month. A parallel effort by Ford Motor Co. isn’t expected to bear fruit until June, though the company has said it’s speeding up its work. Trump did an about-face Sunday, saying GM is doing a “fantastic job.”Even as Trump was excoriating GM on Friday, the automaker and its Seattle-area partner, Ventec Life Systems Inc., were closing in on a production date to build a machine called a VOCSN: ventilator, oxygen, cough, suction and nebulizer. When they start in mid-April, it will culminate a lightning-fast effort to convert an auto-parts plant into a medical-equipment complex.“The speed has been challenging,” Gerald Johnson, GM’s global vice president of manufacturing, said in a Sunday evening interview. “But we know it will save thousands of lives. Making cars is cool, but it doesn’t compare to what we’re doing.”Trump’s criticism of GM boiled down to the company asking the federal government to “show me the the money” before it would put the venture into high gear, according to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro. In initial discussions with the administration, GM and its partner were seeking about US$250 million for Ventec and its components suppliers to get production moving. The government wanted to contribute a fraction of that, people familiar with the deliberations said.“You can’t get to the finish line unless you first go to the starting gate,” Navarro, who was appointed last week to coordinate actions under the Defense Production Act, said in an email to Bloomberg News.The sprint started with exploratory phone calls on March 17 from an ad hoc group of business leaders called Stop the Spread. It was seeking ways to make up for what some members saw as a slow federal response to COVID-19. The group is led by retired American Express Co. Chairman Ken Chenault and Rachel Carlson, founder of online education firm Guild Education Inc.Making cars is cool, but it doesn't compare to what we're doingThey asked Barra’s team what they needed to make ventilators. GM needed a ventilator-making partner with an established product and a medical sales force.For his part, Ventec CEO Chris Kiple said that he needed a partner with mass-manufacturing expertise, factories and a workforce to produce on a huge scale to help cities like New York as patients overwhelm hospitals.Managers from both companies got on the phone that evening and started exploring how GM could help Ventec go from building a maximum of 250 ventilators a month to 10,000 and eventually get on pace to make 200,000 this year. The whole industry generally makes fewer than 100,000 a year. It was growth meant to match the exponential spread of a disease that has sickened at least 125,000 Americans and killed more than 2,100 in the epidemic’s early weeks.“They produce millions of cars a year in the U.S.,” Ventec Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brooks said of GM. “We produce hundreds of ventilators a month. They have a global supply base that understands making parts at large scale.”The next day, Barra told Kudlow that GM could pitch in. Kudlow, one of the administration’s primary pitchmen, floated the idea on television. He cited GM as an example of a company that was stepping up “on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons.”But GM was still studying how to make it happen. On March 19, Phil Kinley, vice president of manufacturing and labour and the plant-floor leader of the project, flew with engineers to Ventec’s site in Washington, Johnson said. Ventec sent technical specifications and drawings for the ventilator’s 700 parts to GM’s Tech Center in Warren, north of Detroit.GM’s purchasing team went to work, Johnson said. They contacted suppliers who make the small motors that run everything from automatic windows to wipers. They called wiring producers and companies that make tubes and hoses. By March 22, GM had most parts lined up.“The supply base really stepped up,” Johnson said.The VOCSN, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017, is primarily used for critical-care ventilation. It also delivers concentrated oxygen to the patient, and has a nebulizer that sends medication to the lungs, secretion management that creates an artificial cough and a suction device to keep the patient’s chest clear.The company boasts on its website that the 18-pound unit replaces 55 pounds of equipment. To make something slightly larger than a toaster oven, a GM assembly plant was ill suited. The assembly lines are made to swing a dashboard into the cabin of a Buick. Making a ventilator is more like building a watch: Assemblers work by hand at stations with tables and chairs.That sort of operation is now being created in a GM parts plant in Kokomo, Indiana. It has a clean room and 100,000 square feet that will contain two assembly lines.The facility has 300 on staff and will need 1,000 to achieve the production levels GM and Ventec want to reach. The carmaker has started evaluating new hires and is seeking volunteers among the staff idled by the shutdown of parts production in Kokomo and metal stamping in nearby Marion, Indiana.GM and Ventec engineers are disassembling a VOCSN unit and reassembling it as they lay out the factory and the process, Johnson said.“This is truly a major step at a critical moment,” said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor economics at the University of California at Berkeley and longtime watcher of Detroit’s automakers. “GM was written off and appears to be coming through.”GM and Ventec now need to decide how the units will be distributed and paid for. Negotiations continue with the government, which would likely buy and channel them through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to people familiar with the matter.That assumes a deal gets done. To the surprise of GM and Ventec, Trump accused the automaker of trying to gouge the government during his Friday press briefing. He tweeted that GM officials “want top dollar.”GM said it’s building the units at cost and is only the contract manufacturer for Ventec, which is the major player in negotiations with the government. The machines normally cost about US$18,000 apiece, while some ventilators can run as high as US$50,000.Another benefit of Ventec’s VOCSN is it replaces four other pieces of hardware typically needed for acute respiratory care. Using it could lower costs for hospitals because they won’t need to buy oxygenators, nebulizers and devices to clear the lungs.When Trump complained last week about pricing, people in the GM-Ventec venture thought that the device’s five-in-one therapy capabilities may not have been completely understood. People familiar with negotiations said there never was a firm proposal on volume or a timeline, and they were caught off guard when the president complained.As negotiations go on, GM and Ventec say they are progressing fast. “The responsible thing for us to do is move forward and meet that need,” Brooks said.There’s already been a change in sentiment from Trump. At his press briefing on Sunday, he said, “I don’t think we have to worry about General Motors now.”Bloomberg.com"

Now, they’re trying to figure out how to make ends meet and negotiate a maze of government websites to access billions of dollars in promised support.“I know that bills are pilling up for people and pressure is building,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday. “We’re working as quickly as possible to put money in your pockets.”From Calgary to Montreal, here are their tales.Four months ago, Ryan Urzada reopened the Atlas Hotel in Saskatchewan’s capital city after a $10-million (US$7.1 million) renovation that included a new indoor water park. Now he has laid off all but 20 of his 138 staff to keep the 200-room hotel afloat.About $1-million worth of bookings evaporated in a few days as virus restrictions began, including from three brides in “absolute tears,” said Urzada, 46, who took over the hotel from the Travelodge chain.His biggest priority is helping his employees negotiate an employment insurance system that’s completely overloaded. With bill deferments, he figures he’ll be able to hang on for two or three months. But he worries longer term.“The cash flow requirement this fall when all these bills come due for the whole economy is going to be overwhelming,” he said, suggesting that deferrals are going to have be turned into forgiveness. “You can defer all you want but everyone’s going to have their hands out in September.”Mandatory closures hit restaurants in Montreal, Quebec, a city known for its bustling food scene. A day after setting up a relief fund to help industry workers meet their most pressing needs, organizers had to close applications because there were too many to process. The group drew a line at 349 people and raised $41,500 on its GoFundMe page over a few days, but emails keep coming in.“We have some really heartbreaking pleas for help,” said Jessica Cytryn, one of the organizers. “One of our members word-searched our emails to find people who said that they hadn’t eaten in a few days and went out and bought food, and brought it to their homes.”Applicants to the fund include Robin Wattie, a 36-year-old musician who saw her European tour canceled and lost her bar tending and waitressing jobs. She’s awaiting a response to her application for unemployment benefits but worries she should have filed for provincial assistance instead.For now she makes do with a tiny cash stash and her credit card, and plans to ask for a new income replacement announced last week by Trudeau that gives $2,000 a month.“It’s like this big stressful puzzle,” she said.Paul Poscente has been getting calls every hour from his oil and gas clients, cancelling projects.His company, Backwoods Energy Services, provides a variety of services, including clearing timber and brush from work sites and building access roads and bridges. He’s now expecting a 30 per cent to 50 per cent decline in business as Alberta takes the hit from the Russian-Saudi oil price war. Backwoods is preparing a round of layoffs, wage rollbacks and expense cuts.The prospect is wrenching for Poscente, the chief executive officer, because Backwoods is 70 per cent-owned by the Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation near Edmonton, Alberta. It employs about 300 workers from the community, and its $140 million in annual revenue provides its largest independent source of funds.“It feels like I’m doing a disservice to my family,” Poscente said. “It’s materially devastating to the community, and it feels personal.”Still, Poscente, 57, said the company has grown with an “ultra-conservative” balance sheet since he took over as CEO in 2015 and expects it to withstand the economic troubles better than most competitors.Flight attendant Max Audet got notice a week ago he’d be laid off from Air Canada Rouge on April 3.“The main thing on my mind is that I don’t know how long it’s going to be for,” said Audet, 28, who is also a rep for the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents flight attendants. “It really adds to the stress.”Audet has immediately cut back. He’s reduced automatic savings to his retirement account for his final paycheques and is being careful what he buys at the grocery store. He takes comfort from the fact that with five years under his belt, he’s still senior to 62 per cent of Air Canada staff, thanks to a big hiring spree at the airline in recent years.“I’m definitely worried about the lasting impact it will have on airlines,” he said. “Will we see people doing less travel, which could definitely affect staffing levels over time?”Outside the Church of the Redeemer on Toronto’s Mink Mile, one of Canada’s ritziest shopping districts, the drop-in lunch program had plenty of customers.On a normal day, The Common Table provides about 80 lunches to the city’s must vulnerable residents, but with similar programs closing, the number has spiked.“There’s a good 20 per cent increase in the last few days,” Justin Laflemme, a church custodian who helps out at the program, said. “I spent a couple of years on the street as well so I recognize the faces and they’re not regulars of our program.”As the virus spreads, he expects things to get worse.“It can happen overnight for some people,” Laflemme said of the slide into homelessness. “It depends on their circumstances, what level of nest egg they have and what their income is. Someone at the low end of the curve can find themselves at the Ontario Works office within a week if they’re living paycheque to paycheque.”Bloomberg.com"

The White House had no immediate comment and didn’t release a summary of the call.The U.S. president has earlier said he does not want to see the energy sector “wiped out” after Russia and Saudi Arabia “both went crazy” and launched into a conflict that depressed oil prices.“I never thought I’d be saying that maybe we have to have an oil increase, because we do. The price is so low,” Trump said in an interview on “Fox & Friends.”Crude oil futures tumbled as much as 7.7 per cent in New York, touching an 18-year low.The Trump-Putin call came at the request of the U.S. and was “prolonged,” according to the Kremlin, which didn’t specify how long it lasted.Trump’s view on the the dispute marks a shift from earlier this month, when he likened the plunge in oil prices to a “tax cut” for Americans. The U.S. president spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on March 9 about the dispute.Trump has long argued that improving relations between Washington and Moscow could help solve international disputes. The president said he wanted to discuss trade with Putin, though he said he expected the Russian president to raise objections to U.S. sanctions. State-run Tass quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Putin didn’t ask Trump for sanctions relief on the call.Oil tumbled earlier to its lowest point in nearly two decades, heading for the worst quarter on record as coronavirus lockdowns cascaded through the world’s largest economies, leaving the market overwhelmed by cratering demand and a ballooning surplus. The slump in demand has shut refineries from South Africa to Canada.I never thought I'd be saying that maybe we have to have an oil increase, because we do. The price is so lowGoldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates consumption will drop by 26 million barrels a day this week. Meanwhile, Riyadh and Moscow are showing no signs of a detente in their supply battle as Saudi Arabia announced plans to increase its oil exports in the coming months, despite U.S. warnings against flooding the market.Some analysts argue Russia’s motivations extend well beyond oil and are complicated by the federation’s anger over U.S. sanctions and opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline linking Russia to Germany. And the price for getting Russia to back down could be too high.“Russia’s concerns with the U.S. go beyond market share. Putin is frustrated with sanctions and may be more interested in punishing the U.S. than Saudi Arabia,” said Dan Eberhart, a Trump donor and chief executive of drilling services company Canary LLC. “If Trump wants an agreement with Putin, he may have to promise to ease up on sanctions. I am not sure he can deliver without the backing of congress.”Rosneft PJSC over the weekend sold its assets in Venezuela to the Russian government, a move that shields the Russian oil giant from further U.S. sanctions while keeping Moscow behind the regime of Nicolas Maduro. Fears of broader sanctions have grown after the U.S. in recent months slapped restrictions on Rosneft trading companies for handling business with Venezuela.Talks between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies broke down in early March as Russia refused to sign on to larger production cuts proposed by Saudi Arabia. The failure to reach an agreement prompted the Saudis to unleash a price war which, combined with the devastating effect of the virus pandemic, caused the market to crash.Global demand is slumping by as much as 20 million barrels a day, about 20 per cent, as billions of people go into lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. The outlook remains dire, with traders, banks and analysts forecasting a huge oversupply as governments effectively shut their economies.Oil industry leaders, trade groups and some Republican senators have pressed the Trump administration to seek a diplomatic solution with Saudi Arabia. Six senators from oil-producing states last week urged Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to take a tougher stance against Saudi Arabia, while highlighting several “powerful tools at our disposal,” including sanctions, tariffs and other trade restrictions.“Trump would have better success pressing Saudi Arabia than Russia since they are dependent on the U.S. for protection, intelligence and arms sales,” Eberhart said.On the coronavirus, the two sides expressed concern about the scale of its spread, according to the Kremlin. The leaders discussed steps they were taking to fight the virus and potential areas of cooperation.Bloomberg.com"

The plant could be shut for two to five months, Nolan said, according to the report.North Atlantic, the union and Nolan didn’t respond to emails seeking comment outside of normal working hours. The 130,000 barrel-a-day refinery supplies fuel to eastern Canadian markets and the U.S. East Coast.While this is the first plant in the region to shut, refineries across the U.S. and Canada are cutting back as the gasoline and jet fuel markets seize up. Measures to slow the spread of coronavirus may result in an unprecedented plunge in fuel demand, with estimates that global consumption is shrinking by 20 per cent or more.U.S. government data show that the amount of refined products supplied to the market fell by more than 2 million barrels a day in the week ended March 20. With coronavirus cases in the U.S. on the rise since then, and more parts of the country shutting down businesses and limiting travel, consumption has likely slid further.Valero Energy Corp. has reduced processing rates across about half of its refineries, and Phillips 66 said many of its refineries are near minimum rates. Suncor Energy Inc. said it’s adjusting its refinery utilization. With refineries using less crude, the oil market is starting to seize up, with at least one pipeline asking producers to reduce output.Refineries globally have been cutting back activity. Last week, Gruppo API SpA indefinitely stopped its Falconara facility in Italy until fuel demand recovers. The nation’s fuel consumption has declined by about 85 per cent, a spokesman for the company said, citing a union of retail gas stations.

Refineries are starting to shut down because nobody needs the fuels they produce. In physical oil markets, barrels are already changing hands for less than US$10, and in a few landlocked markets producers are paying consumers to take away their crude.“The physical oil market has seized up,” said Gary Ross, an influential oil watcher and chief investment officer of Black Gold Investors LLC. “The logistics are struggling to cope because we are facing a catastrophic loss of demand.”Oil traders say it’s likely to get worse this week.The root cause is an accelerating plunge in consumption that’s without precedent since a steady flow of oil became essential to the global economy more than a century ago. The great crash of 1929, the twin oil shocks of the 1970s and the global financial crisis don’t come close. The world normally uses 100 million barrels of oil day, and traders and analysts reckon as much as a quarter of that has disappeared in just a few weeks.The global airline industry is grounded, countless businesses and factories are shuttered and billions of people have been forced to stay home.“Demand clearly is off, in some parts of the world, very dramatically,” Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told Bloomberg TV.The immediate problem is a lack of storage in the right places. With demand running 20 million barrels a day below supply, the world won’t have enough tanks to store the surplus in two or three months. But the issue is even more pressing because global tank capacity, mostly concentrated in a few hubs like Rotterdam, the Caribbean and Singapore, isn’t available to every producer. For those without access to pipelines and ports, local storage will run out in days, traders and consultants say.For those with access to the coast, one solution is to use the supertanker fleet as floating storage tanks, and that’s happening at an unprecedented rate. The CEO of the world’s largest tanker owner, Frontline Ltd., said on Friday that he’d never known such demand to hire ships for long-term storage. Traders could put 100 million barrels at sea, he estimated, but even that accounts for just a few days’ oversupply.In the U.S., one of the largest pipeline companies, Plains All American Pipeline LP, has asked oil producers to voluntarily cut output to avoid overwhelming the network that connects well heads to refineries through thousands of miles of pipelines.The world is running out of places to put oil because the shutdown of vast swathes of the economy has been catastrophic for demand. The collapse in commercial air travel has cut jet fuel use by up to 75 per cent, or almost 5 million barrels a day.As for gasoline, American drivers are the single biggest source of demand, using more than 9 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration. As whole states, including California and New York, have told people to stay home, billions of car journeys have been lost. It’s a pattern repeated in Europe and Asia.“Demand destruction is unprecedented,” said Ben Luckock, co-head of trading at Trafigura Group, the second-largest independent oil trader. He estimates the hit to consumption will total 22 million barrels a day in April.We are facing a catastrophic loss of demandAround the world, about 700 refineries turn crude oil into gasoline, diesel and other fuels. They are starting to dial down production and even shut outright because demand for the fuel they produce is so dire. In India, for example, where 1.3 billion people are under lockdown until mid-Aptil, the nation’s biggest refinery has cut processing rates at most plants by as much as 30 per cent.A small refiner in Italy, the epicentre of Europe’s virus outbreak, shut on Friday because demand for fuel plunged 85 per cent.As the refining system withers, the crude oil market is suffering. Many crudes, especially sticky, sulfurous grades that refiners find hard to process, trade at hefty discounts to international benchmarks. Western Canadian Select, a tarry blend squeezed from Alberta’s oilsands, reached a record low of US$4.51 a barrel on Friday.In the U.S., Oklahoma Sour is changing hands at US$5.75, Nebraska Intermediate at US$8, while Wyoming Sweet prices at US$3 a barrel.In one obscure corner of the American crude market, prices have already turned negative. Wyoming Asphalt Sour, a dense oil used mostly to produce paving bitumen, was bid at minus 19 cents a barrel in mid-March by Trading Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.The surprise, perhaps, is that benchmark futures are still trading as high as they are. Brent, the North Sea grade that sets the price for about two-thirds of the world’s oil, ended last week at US$24.93 a barrel, well above the historic low of US$9.55 a barrel in 1998.Luckock at Trafigura says future prices are likely to fall another US$10. Black Gold’s Ross also says Brent and the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, will be trading in the teens within days.The next stage of the oil market’s meltdown will be widespread production shutdowns as drillers decide the only option is to leave it in the ground until better days return. There are signs this is starting to happen.Brazil’s state oil company Petrobras has announced it will reduce output by 100,000 barrels a day this year because of the lack of demand. In Canada, some producers have shut down output, and Glencore Plc., the world’s largest commodity trading house, has shut down its production in Chad.Many producers are reluctant to shut wells because even though they’re losing money at today’s prices, some cashflow is often better than none at all. But as more refineries idle, the pipeline system grinds to a halt and storage tanks fill to the brim, they will soon have no choice.“The problem is no one wants to be the first to shut-in,” Black Gold’s Ross said.Bloomberg.com"

But that rally sputtered Friday, and the benchmark plunged just minutes before the close, illustrating how tenuous any gains can be, even with a US$2 trillion spending deal heading to the president’s desk for his signature. The S&P remains 25 per cent below its February record, and the Cboe Volatility Index is on track for a 10th straight close above 60. It averaged 18.7 in the past year.

That announcement may have contributed to the stock market’s late-day swoon.“When some of the short-term traders saw that, they decided to take some chips off the table in front of the weekend,” said Matt Maley, strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. “They probably decided it was a good idea to pare back some of their long positions in front of the weekend.”Investors had piled back into the battered U.S. equity market this week on speculation that the massive relief bill would offset some of the pandemic’s impact on businesses and households. A debate has ensued over whether that furious rally represented unwarranted optimism or the start of a long-term upswing.What remains clear is that the virus has ground the American economy to a near total halt, with new jobless claims spiking above 3 million as large areas of the country remain virtually locked down to slow the spread of the infection. A measure of U.S. consumer confidence fell the most since 2008. West Texas crude declined, setting up a fifth straight week of losses.

Asian equities mostly rose, though shares in Australia slumped. The pound gained even as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had tested positive for coronavirus.The recent revival of risk appetite looks sure to be tested by the continuing spread of the infection and the crippling effect of business closures. Tokyo is now seeing a surge in cases, while global deaths from the pandemic surpassed 24,000. The Reserve Bank of India on Friday became the latest central bank to step up emergency action to cushion the economic impact.“It is by no means a given that volatility has ceased to be a feature of global equity markets,” said Paul Markham, global equities portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management. “Markets will oscillate between the reassurance that governments and central banks will be standing by to support them and the uncertainty of both the duration and depth of what will undoubtedly be a significant economic impact.”These are the main moves in markets:Bloomberg.com"

A handful of experts is saying that will happen again.The comeback trail would be steep and long. The spread of coronavirus is crushing demand while Saudi Arabia and Russia are creating a glut. Everybody agrees U.S. production will take a bigger hit than last time, when it dipped before soaring. As many as 70% of the 6,000 shale drillers may go bankrupt, and one-third of shale-patch workers are expected to lose their jobs. Wall Street, which financed the last boom, has cut off the cash spigot.But some experts are saying the future, however far off, will be better. They’re looking past the dire forecasts and vertical chart lines and cautioning against despair. They’re echoing a widespread view that’s mostly unspoken during the market meltdown: Yes, America can shock the world again. The boom-and-bust cycle will shift, and shale is in a position, with its infrastructure, its ability to ramp-up quickly and its plentiful reserves, to rise from the ashes stronger than ever.When the dust settles in the Permian Basin and other American shale fields, the survivors will be leaner and more tech savvy, according to Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit Ltd. That means lower production costs and a greater ability to respond to the next price rebound with the last thing Moscow and Riyadh want — another boom.“Companies go bankrupt, but rocks don’t go bankrupt,” Yergin said in an interview. “When this all shakes out, there will be other people to develop shale.”Noah Barrett also believes the growth engine of U.S. crude production will be humbled, but won’t flicker out. That’s because shale has extensive infrastructure that isn’t going anywhere.“The resource is still there, the pipeline capacity, the processing capacity,” said Barrett, a Denver-based energy analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. “Those are still there.”Even if predictions are correct, that overall American oil output will slide to 8 million or 9 million barrels a day, down about one-third from the current 13 million, the U.S. would still count among the world’s very top producers, Barrett said.Bloomberg Intelligence is forecasting a more-modest production falloff of about 1.5 million barrels a day.The weakest companies “will go into stronger hands,” said Vincent G. Piazza, BI’s senior oil analyst. “The industry is going to be in a lot better shape than in 2014-2016. The balance sheet is in a lot better shape. I wouldn’t underestimate the ability of this industry to re-create itself.”Fereidun Fesharaki is a shale believer, too. The chairman of global energy consultant FGE said he also expects the price squeeze to force explorers to become more efficient and cost-competitive.Still, any rays of optimism must penetrate a very dense, dark cloud. In the market cataclysm that’s still unfolding, crude and fuel prices around the world have sunk to levels not seen in nearly two decades.As if by evil magic, the Covid-19 outbreak has chased tens of millions of people from streets, stores, factories and travel hubs, suddenly degrading demand for gasoline, jet fuel and diesel across the world’s largest economies.Veteran crude analyst Roger Diwan expects global consumption to plunge by more than 14 million barrels a day — the biggest demand shock since the birth of the oil age. The pipeline that hauls 60% of the East Coast’s gasoline supply from the Gulf Coast is cutting capacity by one-fifth. In Chicago, wholesale gasoline tumbled to 15 cents a gallon, the lowest since at least 1992.The virus-driven calamity has been compounded by the disintegration earlier this month of the Russia-Saudi cooperation pact that capped global crude supplies. Because of the rapidly expanding worldwide glut of crude, a barrel of oil in some parts of Texas recently fetched about $16. In Canada, oil traded for less than $10.The price plunge instantly made thousands of prospective shale sites money-losing propositions. Companies have been in such a hurry to cut losses that some have paid early-termination penalties on rigs and other gear to halt work before contracts are up.Slashing SpendingEven Chevron Corp. is retrenching. The California giant, widely recognized as holding some of the richest acreage in the Permian, said Tuesday it was slashing spending by $4 billion and halting share buybacks to conserve cash.In the final three months of 2019, nine explorers and six service companies filed for bankruptcy, according to Haynes and Boone LLC. That represented $13.5 billion in debt. This year’s churn is just getting started. Mizuho Securities analyst Paul Sankey expects as many as 70% of the 6,000 or so shale drillers to go bankrupt before the cycle turns.But private-equity firms that swooped in to buy ailing explorers and tempting assets during the last bust won’t be able to unfurl a safety net this time. The buy-and-flip model that underpinned their foray into shale has disappeared, forcing those firms to become oilfield operators, which in turn means tapping their own credit facilities, said Ian Rainbolt, vice president of finance at Warwick Energy Group, the biggest owner of non-operated U.S. shale assets.Only about one-third of the Permian and other U.S. fields count as sweet spots that can harvest oil profitably at $30 a barrel, he said. West Texas Intermediate traded at $21.42 on Friday.“Private equity’s going to be out of the game,” Rainbolt said. “It’s a very, very tough fund-raising market.”In the meantime, service providers — the hired hands of the oil industry who do everything from stack steel pipes to frack wells — will experience extreme pressure, along with the explorers who are demanding price cuts, said Stacey Morris, director of research at Alerian, an indexing and research company. Pipeline owners are somewhat insulated because oil and natural gas still need to be shipped to refiners and export terminals, she said.Shale Threshold“The market is going to be out of balance for quite some time,” Morris said.Yergin, the confidante of oil ministers and chief executives, sees the threshold for reinvigorating shale between $50 and $60 a barrel. U.S. crude was trading above the $50 level as recently as Feb. 26.“At $50, we’ll start to see a recovery and a step up in investment, so long as people feel safe about the price floor beneath them,” he said.It’s funny that Yergin should put it that way. A big part of shale’s resilience lies in its unique geology. Unlike the so-called conventional fields in Saudi Arabia and Russia, North American shale is rock so dense that it doesn’t degrade or collapse on itself if oil production is interrupted. In other parts of the world, disrupting output can do irreversible damage.That’s why the bulk of Chevron’s $4 billion spending cut will take place in the Permian, CEO Mike Wirth said Tuesday. It’s a rare field where production can be turned off almost instantly without adverse long-term impacts.With shale, “the assets don’t go away because you haven’t destroyed the field,” said Ken Medlock, senior director of Rice University’s Center for Energy Studies. “We’ll see a thinning of the herd but the assets will still be there.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The Bank of Canada last cut rates to these levels in 2009, during the global financial crisis.The move was necessitated by quickly deteriorating conditions, including a flood of new jobless claims last week, that suggest the economy is poised to produce one of the sharpest drops in economic activity in history.Policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz announced two new programs: the Commercial Paper Purchase Program and the buying of Canadian government securities in the secondary market. The government securities purchases will begin with a minimum of $5 billion per week, across the yield curve, the bank said in its statement.As the spreading coronavirus outbreak paralyzes economies globally, the energy-heavy Canadian economy is also having to contend with the crash in oil prices — prompting a steady drumbeat of recession calls.The move by the central bank is part of a wave of policy rate cuts and brings Canada’s benchmark rate closer to most other advanced industrialized economies. The Bank of Canada has now lowered interest rates three times this month, with a cumulative easing of 1.5 percentage points.The Federal Reserve has also cut by 150 basis points this month. In addition to lowering borrowing costs, the central bank has also announced in recent days a slew of new liquidity measures to inject cash into the banking system and money markets and to ensure it can handle any market-wide stresses in the financial system.Bloomberg.com  "

The small Kansas plant in the heart of rural America was offering just $1.75 a barrel for Wyoming sweet crude.With more than two billion people on virus lockdown from India to California, energy demand has plunged. In corners of the U.S., Canada, Russia and China, oil prices at the well-head are collapsing under the weight of an unprecedented glut.And with it, the industry is bracing for something that last happened on this scale 35 years ago: producers shutting down their wells as pumping crude makes no economic sense.“I have never seen anything like this in the markets,” said Torbjorn Tornqvist, the co-founder of Gunvor Group Ltd., a large commodity trading house. “We’ve never seen anything even close to today.”The oil market — hit by the double blow of a demand slump and a supply surge as Saudi Arabia and Russia wage a price war — is battling a surplus of as much as 20% of global consumption.The consequences are brutal: prices are now low enough to force a widespread suspension of production, or a shut-in as it’s known in the industry. For those waging the price war, it counts as a victory — as long as the shut-ins happen elsewhere.Brent and West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarks closely followed in Wall Street, are hovering around $25 a barrel. But in the world of physical oil — where actual barrels change hands — producers are getting much less.The industry is navigating what Paul Sankey, a veteran oil analyst at Mizuho Bank Ltd, described as “uncharted waters to unknown lands.”Wyoming Sweet, a landlocked crude with few outlets other than American refineries like Coffeyville, is paradigmatic of how the dynamics of the oil market are forcing output cuts. There are others: North Dakota Light Sweet has traded at $9.97 a barrel. Across the border, Western Canadian Select has plunged to $6.45. In Siberia, Russian crude has changed hands for less than $10 and Chinese domestic prices have fallen to single digits.Ultra-low oil prices are starting to work: Petrobras, the Brazilian state-run producer, is cutting output by 100,000 barrels a day from high-cost offshore platforms. Glencore Plc., the commodity giant, is shutting down its oilfields in Chad. In Canada, Suncor Energy Inc. has partially shutdown its Fort Hills oil sands mine.As the pain spreads, industry executives believe many other companies will stem production in the next few days.“We need to cut crude supply by 10 million barrels a day pretty quickly,” said Russel Hardy, the head of top independent oil trader Vitol Group. “Oil prices will need to go lower, to bring the prices to a level that triggers a response.”The last time the oil industry faced widespread shut-ins was in 1986, when Saudi Arabia also ravaged the market in a price war. During the price battles of 1998-99 and 2015-16 the industry also saw cuts, but not on a large scale.Put simply, the world cannot continue pumping at the current level of about 100 million barrels a day while demand is as much as 20% lower. The surplus would overwhelm storage capacity within weeks.In some emerging markets, where infrastructure is less developed, it’s already happening. Pakistan has told refiners to stop importing gasoline and diesel as the tanks are already brimming.Rush to SeaWhere there’s access to the sea, traders use tankers to store oil — and wait for prices to go up. Crude is now moving onto ships at a record pace, according to one of the industry’s largest shipowners.But inland, producers are reliant on sending crude to local refineries like Coffeyville and the lack of storage capacity will be decisive.“The surge in inventory in coming weeks will inevitably saturate local infrastructure, in our view, forcing many inland producers to shut-in wells,” said Damien Courvalin, oil analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Some producers will prefer to take the hit of negative prices — paying someone to take the oil off their hands — to the long-term costs of shutting down a well. In the aftermath of the last major downturn, a North Dakota sour crude went to a negative 50 cents.But as storage fills up, production will have to respond. IHS Markit Ltd., a consultant, estimates the Canadian province of Alberta has inland tanks able to store the equivalent of just 3.2 days of daily production. The central U.S., which includes Wyoming, has room for just 12.8 days’ output.“Production is going to have to be reduced or even shut in,” said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit. “It is now a matter of where and by how much.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

Canada saw 929,000 applications for unemployment benefits last week, smashing records, after businesses across the country were forced to close or reduce services to control the spread of the virus. Bank of Nova Scotia expects Canada’s economy to shrink 28 per cent in the second quarter on an annualized basis, far exceeding the worst of the 2009-09 recession.The government declined to comment directly on the talks.“The Covid-19 Emergency Response Act empowers the government, if necessary, to provide further support and stimulus to the Canadian economy,” Maéva Proteau, a spokeswoman for Morneau, said in an emailed statement Thursday. “With these additional tools, Canadians can have confidence that their government is well equipped to rapidly protect them and our economy in these challenging times.”The Canadian Bankers Association declined to comment.The government has created a $107 billion fiscal stimulus plan to soften the economic blow of COVID-19 on the Canadian economy. It includes $52 billion in direct support for companies and individuals, up from $27 billion announced last week. It also has $55 billion worth of tax deferrals for households and businesses.Parliament approved the government’s fiscal stimulus package early Wednesday.The discussions come at a time when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is also asking banks to provide relief for consumers, including cutting credit card interest rates.“I can assure you that the Finance Minister has had conversations directly with the banks about credit card interest rates. We recognize that they are a significant challenge for many Canadians at this point,” Trudeau said Thursday.Bloomberg.com"

With only an estimated 1.6 billion barrels of storage capacity still available, producers will be forced to cut output because by June there’ll be no place left to put the unwanted crude, it said.The oil market has been hammered by falling demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and as Saudi Arabia vows to flood the market with crude at deep discounts, following the collapse of the coalition of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia. On Thursday, Pakistan banned imports of crude and fuels because its storage sites are full. Vitol Group and Gunvor Group, two of the world’s top merchants, say there’s heavy interest in storing while several traders have booked supertankers to hoard barrels at sea.Supply may exceed demand by 12.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter, with other traders, banks and consultants also forecasting bumper surpluses, IHS said. Vitol said on Wednesday that demand has fallen as much as 20 million barrels a day from last year.“Production is going to have to be reduced or even shut in,” said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS. “It is now a matter of where and by how much.”There are already signs in prices about a potential scarcity of storage space. In the U.S, the so-called WTI cash roll traded down at the lowest level since December 2008 on expectations that inventories at the delivery point for U.S. futures would balloon in coming weeks and months.Brent futures are trading deep in a contango structure where spot prices are at discount to those in later months as the market tries to create the necessary financial incentives to store by pressuring near-term prices.Measures of the physical market for actual barrels of crude are also pointing to weakness globally.Of the world’s three largest oil producers, Russia has the least amount of available storage capacity at about eight days, IHS said. Those figures are based on the amount of production that could be stored if exports dried up. Saudi Arabia has 18 days, and the U.S. has 30.Nigeria, the biggest producer in Africa, is the most vulnerable among the areas measured by IHS. Estimated first-quarter 2020 daily production of 1.9 million barrels a day would fill up available local storage in 1 1/2 to two days, the firm said.Consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. also sees storage tanks filling in the coming months.“With OPEC pushing output to record highs, inventories will quickly get out of hand,” the firm said in a note. “We will run out of crude storage capacity by early Q3 20, with product containment arriving earlier.”Bloomberg.com"

The Bank of Canada is likely to follow with its first foray into so-called quantitative easing soon, according to market watchers at Canada’s largest banks.Although the central bank has already announced several programs aimed at unclogging credit markets, strategists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will need to introduce formal, large-scale asset purchases to keep borrowing costs low amid the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers.“More stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,” Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They’ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.Toronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program — between $50 billion and $75 billion — to be announced at the central bank’s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.“The BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,” Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.The Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.“There is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy — but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,” Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.“We can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,” CIBC’s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"

Customers in good standing who have been impacted by the pandemic can apply, with deferrals available for an indefinite period and no deadline to apply, according to the association.Under the plan, payments are skipped for a period of time, and interest accrued is added to the mortgage’s outstanding balance. The additional interest is incorporated into future monthly payments when they resume, or upon renewal at the end of the mortgage’s term.Canadian banks are reporting higher volumes of calls related to mortgages and other loans, along with requests for deferrals, since the relief plan was introduced.“Last week, our contact centres in Canada received close to 80,000 calls per day, with calls to our mortgage and loan teams up 500 per cent,” Scotiabank Chief Executive Officer Brian Porter said in a March 22 statement.Toronto-Dominion is “receiving thousands of requests daily for mortgage deferrals, and have processed thousands already,” spokeswoman Julie Bellissimo said in an emailed statement. “We are moving quickly through applications so that we can help provide our customers some immediate financial relief.”Bloomberg.com"

Firms that invest in mortgage-backed securities are facing margin calls and sinking valuations, forcing them to solicit offers on billions in assets in emergency sales.RBC “is hitting the accelerator to unlawfully seize and unload a large portfolio of plaintiffs’ assets at fire-sale prices into the seized markets which will have a cascading effect in the market for mortgage-based assets,” the lawsuit said.The bank’s auction “would not only dramatically and prejudicially underprice these securities to Plaintiffs’ detriment, but would also likely precipitate a chain reaction of other banks being pressured to foreclose on other mREITs’ pledged securities, all at prices informed by the fire sale that defendants seek to hold,” the trust said in the suit.The REIT is seeking a court order blocking the auction and stopping RBC from taking any actions against its assets “pending compliance with the parties’ agreements and current government guidance and regulations designed to stabilize the economy.”AG Mortgage Investment Trust announced Monday it failed to meet some margin calls and doesn’t expect to be able to meet future margin calls with its current financing.

Businesses owned by members of Congress, heads of executive departments and Vice President Mike Pence also would be blocked.With the prospect that Congress was closing in on a deal Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 11% in its biggest advance since 1933, and the S&P 500 rebounded with the biggest one-day gain since October 2008 after starting the week with a rout. In Asia markets, U.S. futures pared early losses after news of the deal.In a letter to his fellow Democrats, Schumer highlighted a series of transparency measures that would prevent keeping loans secret and create a new inspector general to oversee the program.Schumer also said that hundreds of billions would be spent on Democratic priorities, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, money for hospitals as well as more funding for cities and transportation.Democrats also rejected the US$3 billion sought by the Trump administration to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Pelosi said on Tuesday that the House could quickly approve a Senate-passed coronavirus stimulus with a voice vote that doesn’t require members to travel to Washington — as long as the bill does not have any “poison pills” Democrats object to.That would also require the unanimous consent of all House Republicans. The second-ranking House Republican, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, told his vote-counting team during a conference call Tuesday night that the best option is to accept a Senate-passed economic stimulus bill, according to Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine.Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, said after the agreement was reached that the “the president and his team look forward to swift action for urgently needed assistance to the American people and powerful aid to the nation’s economy as we work through this crisis.”The size of the stimulus package is unprecedented, dwarfing the approximately US$800 billion Obama stimulus that passed five months after the 2008 financial crash.Together with Fed intervention, the proposed legislation amounted to a US$6 trillion stimulus, according to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, or about 30% of annual GDP.The package will likely more than double a U.S budget deficit that was already set to hit US$1 trillion this year before the outbreak. It also may not be the last infusion of government spending in response to the spread of the virus.Lawmakers universally expressed a sense of urgency as the nation’s economy deteriorates and the health outlook grows more dire. The World Health Organization said the U.S. has the potential to become the new epicenter of the global pandemic as the number of known infections soars.The proposal is the third — and biggest — plan by Congress to confront the coronavirus crisis as the disease spreads.An initial US$8 billion plan passed by Congress March 5 is funding emergency health care needs stemming from the coronavirus, and a second plan enacted last week will provide many Americans with paid sick leave, food assistance and free coronavirus testing. It also will send tens of billions in fresh aid to states.Bloomberg.com"

Economists have slashed growth forecasts, and they now expect second quarter output to contract by the most in more than half a century.“The rise in EI applications gives us a sneak peak into just how sharp the drop off in economic activity has been over the past few weeks,” said Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “While we really don’t know how long this will last, we do know the hit to GDP will be severe.”Mendes said he expects the unemployment rate to spike to levels higher than even during the worst of the financial crisis.Bloomberg.com"

On Tuesday, he repeatedly talked about the harm a long-term economic shutdown would have on the nation, warning of thousands of suicides if there’s a prolonged downturn.“This cure is worse than the problem,” Trump said. “In my opinion more people are going to die if we allow this to continue.”Trump also claimed that the mortality rate of the coronavirus in the U.S. is lower than 1 per cent. The U.S. death rate is presently unknown.As Trump has increasingly talked about re-opening businesses and putting Americans back to work, the World Health Organization warned earlier Tuesday that the U.S. could become a new hub of the outbreak.The U.S. is showing a large acceleration in the number of infections and has the potential to become a new epicentre of the outbreak, said Margaret Harris, a spokeswoman for the Geneva-based agency. Over the 24 hours through 10 a.m. Geneva time Monday, 40 per cent of new cases were in the U.S., more than any other country.I would love to have it opened up and just raring to go by EasterTrump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said earlier Tuesday the White House will consider advice from public health officials as the administration moves to encourage Americans to return to work.“We’re not abandoning the health professionals’ advice but there is a clamour to try to re-open the economy, perhaps make it less of a shut-in,” Kudlow said Tuesday to reporters at the White House. “That’s one piece, but it’s yet to be determined.”Trump began discussing how to get Americans back to work last week, just days after issuing guidelines encouraging people to stay away from restaurants and large gatherings and educate their children at home. But he has largely trailed governors and municipal leaders, who have essentially shut down entire states and cities in order to combat the spread of the virus.That has triggered projections by one Federal Reserve official of a 50 per cent drop in U.S. economic growth.Trump was peppered with questions at a news conference Monday about how soon he would try to end U.S. “social distancing” practices and whether he would follow the advice of government health professionals. “I’ll be listening to them and others we have who are doing a good job,” he answered.One of those professionals, Deborah Birx, the State Department physician who advises Vice President Mike Pence on the government’s response to the outbreak, said at the news conference that she didn’t think Trump’s optimism about soon relaxing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines would hurt compliance.The president also warned Monday that if the economy is forced into a deep enough recession by social distancing measures, there could be deaths from suicides and other causes in excess of those caused by the coronavirus.“Public health includes economic health — that’s a key point. It’s not either-or,” Kudlow said. “That’s why we’re taking a fresh look at it.”Bloomberg.com"

Goldman said the Fed’s move would help alleviate the funding stress that’s driven gold lower, and investors would now pivot to focus on the expansion of its balance sheet, just as they did in 2008. Goldman also highlighted the rise in deficits in developed economies, as well as “issues around the sustainability” of European monetary union, according to a note.Spot gold climbed as much as 4.2 per cent to US$1,618.20 an ounce, before paring some of the gains. Futures in New York surged to as high as US$1,693.50 an ounce.“We believe this will likely lead to debasement concerns similar to the post-GFC period,” Goldman analysts including Jeffrey Currie and Mikhail Sprogis wrote in the March 23 note, referring to the global financial crisis. “Accordingly, we are likely at an inflection point where ‘fear’-driven purchases will begin to dominate liquidity-driven selling pressure, as it did in November 2008.”Other precious metals also extended gains. Silver was up 4 per cent by 12:01 p.m. in London and platinum rose 6.8 per cent. Palladium jumped as much as 16 per cent, the biggest intraday increase since 1998. South Africa, which accounts for 75 per cent of the world’s platinum and 38% of palladium supply, said it will close its mines for 21 days as part of a nationwide lockdown.Goldman reaffirmed its 12-month target for bullion to advance to US$1,800 an ounce; spot gold hasn’t traded at that level since 2011, the year prices hit an all-time high. The lift from the Fed’s move would also offset the negative impact of weaker emerging-market demand for bullion, the bank said.There was also a vote of confidence in bullion from veteran investor Mark Mobius. The haven’s recent sell-off alongside risk assets such as stocks and oil was a sign of pure panic, with investors selling everything as the pandemic spread, Mobius told Bloomberg TV in an interview.“I think it’s a mistake,” he said. “People should have gold and this may be a good time to increase holdings in gold — in fact I’m thinking that myself.”Bloomberg.com"

He thanked Tesla staff and customs officials in China and Los Angeles for assistance.“Elon Musk: how about this?

Many see it as inevitable that Poloz and his governing council will cut the overnight rate to near zero, then start rummaging deeper into their toolbox.“We think the bank will be forced to adopt QE and that they’ll look to ultimately buy up to $150 billion in securities,” said TD Securities macro strategist Robert Both in an email. “We think it is a question of when and not if.”Sharp Economic SlideQuantitative easing, which sees central banks buy government bonds as part of an effort to keep borrowing costs low for a prolonged period of time, would be a first for the Bank of Canada, which didn’t follow its peers to such lengths during the 2008 crisis.The global outlook is deteriorating rapidly, forcing central banks into new territory. The Federal Reserve said Monday it will buy unlimited amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to suppress borrowing costs and ease the flow of credit amid a historic economic shock.The Bank of Canada’s governing council often distances itself from monetary policy decisions south of the border. But the Fed’s move opens the door to a more robust response from Canadian policy makers.“The Bank of Canada doesn’t like being pushed by the Fed, but now it’s global,” said Benjamin Reitzes, an economist at Bank of Montreal, which sees an 80 per cent chance the central bank will need to start quantitative easing.“The question is why they’d wait until April — given the broad shutdowns it’s already clear that conditions have deteriorated sharply,” he said.While Poloz said last week that other options are on the table, he made it clear the measures the bank has taken so far — including upping the purchases of mortgage-backed securities — don’t constitute quantitative easing.“The programs the bank has introduced are very important in unlocking funding markets,” Ian Pollick, global head of non-equity market research at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “The problem is, liquidity is so distressed that they are not working as planned. They need to bring out the Canadian bazooka,” adding that he’s certain the central bank will “imminently” launch QE.Bloomberg.com"

It also set up programs to ensure credit flows to corporations as well as state and local governments.The Fed’s latest steps landed as investors wait for U.S. lawmakers to deliver a multi-trillion dollar package of coronavirus support, which failed to come together Sunday when Democrats objected that it did not do enough for average Americans.Following a string of emergency measures last week, the moves also increasingly push the central bank into new territory by providing direct support to U.S. employers, municipalities and households, which would traditionally be viewed as fiscal policy.“Wow, just wow,” George Rusnak, head of investment management at Wells Fargo Private Bank, said on Bloomberg Television.“Hopefully you’ll come out of this with some fiscal stimulus as well, and you’ll be set with good growth opportunities in the long run.”In a sign, however, of just how unnerved investors are by the pandemic, the Fed’s moves failed to spark anything beyond a brief rally in stocks and corporate bonds Monday after weeks of staggering losses.Stocks fell 4.5 per cent in New York. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries initially sank below 0.69 per cent as investors digested the news before pushing back to around 0.74 per cent.Some pockets of the market reacted positively to the Fed moves. Signs of stress in the corporate debt sector eased, with the CDX Investment Grade index spread tightening. Bond ETFs eligible for central-bank purchases rallied and the dollar retreated versus major peers.Monday’s Fed action followed an already-dizzying number of steps taken by Chairman Jerome Powell in the past three weeks that would have been unthinkable just months ago. They represent a dramatic reaction to the sudden stop inflicted on the economy by the contagion and by the subsequent panic among investors.Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs separately joined an emergency call to work on a joint response to the economic blow dealt by the pandemic.The U.S. economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicted the U.S. unemployment rate may hit 30 per cent in the second quarter, along with a 50 per cent drop in gross domestic product. Morgan Stanley expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30 per cent in the second quarter.The package included several unprecedented steps for the Fed, including intervention in the corporate bond market, purchases of commercial asset-backed mortgages and exchange-traded funds, and, if Congress clears the way, a significant Main Street lending program directly aimed at aiding small businesses.“This is not a slush-fund,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business earlier on Monday. “It’s a mechanism we can use working with the Federal Reserve to provide another US$4 trillion of liquidity into the market. That’s on top of the Fed’s balance sheet. This is a massive liquidity program.”Beyond the unlimited quantitative easing program, the new emergency facilities will employ a total of US$300 billion, backed by US$30 billion from the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund.Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington, said he expects those facilities to grow substantially if Congress moves ahead with plans to pump more money into the ESF.The draft of an economic aid bill currently being hashed out on Capitol Hill included US$425 billion for the ESF to support Fed actions.The Fed’s new credit facilities carry limits on paying dividends and making stock buybacks for firms that defer interest payments, but have no explicit restrictions preventing beneficiaries from laying off workers.The Fed said a week ago it would buy at least US$500 billion of Treasuries and US$200 billion of agency MBS. The Fed will now make those purchases unlimited and will take on a slew of new efforts, many aimed at directly aiding employers and households, as well as cities and states.“This is a great step forward,” said Julia Coronado the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. “Getting to the corporate bond market was critical. A lot of people needed to be clear the QE was unconstrained.”"

That campaign would end about March 31.The discussions centred on what to do after the 15-day period ends, and how to test and isolate everyone who’s sick so healthy people can return to work. It’s likely the CDC guidelines would be relaxed rather than scrapped altogether, one person said.The government’s top health authorities have warned that in the absence of any viable medical treatment, sustained and economically painful restrictions on daily life are the only way to beat the virus. This group is led by Deborah Birx, the State Department doctor tapped to advise Vice President Mike Pence on the government’s response to the outbreak, and Anthony Fauci, the influential director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.The advice of the medical professionals has so far formed the foundation of the White House’s coronavirus strategy, frustrating some of Trump’s economic and political advisers who think the president shouldn’t lean so heavily on them, according to two people familiar with the matter.The economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicted the U.S. unemployment rate may hit 30 per cent in the second quarter, along with a 50 per cent drop in gross domestic product. Morgan Stanley said Sunday it expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30 per cent in the second quarter.There had been more than 35,000 cases of the disease in the U.S. by Monday and more than 400 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.Social distancing didn’t begin with Trump’s guidelines and won’t necessarily end if he lifts them, as governors and municipal leaders have the power to issue “shelter in place” and other orders limiting daily life in virus-ravaged parts of the country. But the president has considerable power to influence Americans’ behaviour by the tone he sets at what has become daily, televised White House news conferences.“We’ll get a pretty good idea what we’re doing” at the end of his “15 Days to Slow the Spread” campaign on March 31, Trump said Sunday. “You know there will be a point at which we say: ‘We’re back in business, let’s go.”Some of the debate over how rapidly Americans should return to work is beginning to play out in public.Fauci acknowledged that aggressive public health measures can cause too much harm to the economy and “unintended consequences” in an interview with Science magazine published Sunday.“There is a discussion and a delicate balance about what’s the overall impact of shutting everything down completely for an indefinite period of time,” he said. “If you knock down the economy completely and disrupt infrastructure, you may be causing health issues, unintended consequences, for people who need to be able to get to places and can’t. You do the best you can.”Former Goldman Sachs Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said in a tweet Sunday night that “within a very few weeks” people at “lower risk to the disease” should return to work.“Is it time to start discussing the need for a date when the economy can turn back on?” Trump’s former economic adviser, Gary Cohn, tweeted on Sunday. “Businesses need clarity. Otherwise they will assume the worst and make decisions to survive.”But another former senior aide to Trump, Steve Bannon, said the president should take even stronger measures to limit Americans’ social interactions over the next two weeks in order to snuff out the virus — or risk irreversible economic damage.“We’re going to have to take the pain up-front. We’re going to have to shut it all down,” Bannon said on Fox News on Sunday. “Drop the hammer today on the virus.”Trump said Sunday he’d seen both comments. “They are not mutually exclusive, they sort of inter-mesh,” he said of Cohn and Bannon. Bannon wants “just a brutal shutdown, and then open up a little bit faster. So you know, there’s that fine line.”Late Sunday and into Monday morning Trump began retweeting supporters expressing exasperation with social distancing efforts.Bloomberg.com"

Today, the banking system is in far better shape. It never feels very good to have this degree of chaos, but this will pass.”Flatt said that while Brookfield had been expecting a recession and “market washout” for some time, no one could have predicted the coronavirus would be the cause. Despite this, he said he believes Brookfield is “very good shape” to weather the storm with US$12 billion in undrawn bank lines and only about 40 per cent of the US$50 billion it raised in its previous fundraising invested.Flatt said most of Brookfield’s businesses are resilient and therefore he doesn’t see any major issues. While some of its businesses — including the malls and ports it owns — will likely be impacted by people staying home, the bulk of its investments are in critical infrastructure.“While many are at home now, people and companies still need corporate premises, infrastructure, power, broadband, utilities and many other critical services that form the backbone of the global economy, and that Brookfield’s businesses provide,” he said.In addition, Brookfield agreed to acquire a majority interest in Oaktree Capital Group last year in an effort to build out a credit arm and in anticipation of the debt markets unwinding.“Now it’s taking place,” Flatt said. “The team at Oaktree is accelerating the pace of deployment of their current distressed debt fund and preparing to launch their next fund, which we think could significantly exceed the size of their last.”Bloomberg.com"

Oil sank as governments around the world imposed restrictions on movement to slow the disease’s spread, bringing its weekly decline to 29 per cent.The 10-year Treasury yield fell back below 1 per cent.

The Minister of Families, Children and Social Development’s office confirmed Trudeau was referring to applications for unemployment insurance.The speed of the meltdown in the labour market has no precedent. The largest number of jobless claims for a whole month was 499,200 in 1957, according to Statistics Canada data.“This is of course an unprecedented situation and it is putting a lot of pressure on our system but we’re on it,” Trudeau told reporters Friday at Rideau Cottage, where he is governing from home after his wife tested positive for coronavirus.This is going to be the depression of 2020The number highlights just how quickly economic activity has come to a halt as Canadians stay home and governments tell businesses to close to control the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. It also indicates the depth of the contraction may be worse than even the most pessimistic analysts had feared.“There are going to be large contractions in economic activity, that’s unavoidable when you’re shutting down portions of the economy,” said Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto Dominion Bank. “What you’re ultimately hoping for is you don’t get the negative dynamic on duration.”In Canada’s case, the economy is facing a double whammy of the pandemic and tanking oil prices, devastating an energy sector that still accounts for about one-tenth of output.“This is going to be the depression of 2020,” said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates Inc.The extent of the slowdown also suggests policy makers will need to have a bigger response to keep companies afloat and avoid a long downturn, Rosenberg said. Trudeau’s government has announced an aid package worth $82 billion (US$57 billion), which is mostly temporary tax deferrals. The Bank of Canada has cut its policy rate by a full percentage point, but still has its benchmark above other countries.“It’s one thing to have everybody filing for claims but if they have no job to go back to, it’s going to compound things,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

The shutdowns are contributing to the growing conviction that the world has slipped into its first recession since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.“This is kind of a rolling natural disaster,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America. “In terms of the impact on global production, the shutdown outside of China will likely become bigger than the impact from China.”The shock to supply chains, Harris said, is deeper and more sprawling than the trade wars of the past two years and likely to be more prolonged than the storms, earthquakes or floods that have been a source of stress for major industries in the past. He expects factory shutdowns will last into May and possibly longer.Compounding the blow for companies, the initial supply shock has become interwoven with a demand crisis in Europe, the U.S. and other major economies as workers and consumers are ordered to stay home.Apple SuppliersApple Inc., for example, is confronting the impact on component makers in Italy, Germany, Malaysia and South Korea after having weathered the February slowdown in Chinese factories that do the final assembly of products like iPhones and AirPods.In Malaysia, key suppliers like Murata Manufacturing Co., Renesas Electronics Corp. and Ibiden Co. have halted production as a result of restrictions on movements imposed by the government. Micron Technology Inc. is affected too, but said an exemption allows “limited semiconductor operations to continue.” Texas Instruments Inc. and On Semiconductor Corp. also have facilities there.Peru’s state of emergency and nationwide lockdown have led major mining companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Newmont Corp. to curb copper production there. The same is happening in other mining centers like Chile, Canada and Mongolia, with economists at Scotiabank saying the initial result from the hit in Chile and Peru alone leading to the loss of some 325,000 metric tons of copper production, or about 1.7% of global annual output.In Europe, industrial giants like Volkswagen AG and Airbus SE have shut down assembly lines in an effort both to reduce the spread of the virus and to deal with parts shortages and bottlenecks due to restrictions on travel within Europe.BottlenecksWhile governments in the region have pledged to safeguard the transport of goods as borders are shut to other nonessential travel, traffic disruptions have started to escalate. Trucks lined up for 40 miles near Berlin after the German border to Poland was closed, and diverting passenger cars to alternatives routes brought little relief.The car industry is particularly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Its fine-tuned logistics are designed to keep storage times to only between 1 and 2 months. The push into electric cars has added to complexity, because production of battery cells requires a steady flow of materials like lithium and cobalt.Germany’s Schaeffler Group, which employs 87,000 worldwide and is a major supplier to car makers, joined peers on Thursday in hammering out emergency plans to cut capacity in Europe and avoid layoffs. Those include reducing working hours and cutting production on certain days.“As we have to reduce production in our plants in the light of the crisis, it was important to us that flexible solutions be quickly established,” said Juergen Wechsler, who represents Schaeffler workers for union IG Metall.Liqui Moly GmbH, a maker of engine oil and lubricants based in the southern German city of Ulm, is suffering dramatic order declines. “If the situation demands it, I will forgo my salary,” Chairman Ernst Prost said.Detroit ShutdownAnton Posner, chief executive officer of supply-chain management and consulting company Mercury Resources, said the move by General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to temporarily shut down their U.S. plants will reverberate not only through their suppliers of finished parts but in steel, aluminum and transportation.“We have ships loading steel in Europe next week headed for the U.S., but will there be shipments beyond that with industry shutting down?” he asked. “Who’s going to hold inventory if there’s no consumption?”U.S. steelmaker Commercial Metals says it’s still at work and facing postponements, not yet cancellations. “So all these jobs are going to come back,” said CEO Barbara Smith.She hasn’t had any employees infected. But as a company heavily dependent on infrastructure and other construction projects, she is also worried about job sites being shut down due to infections. All of that has left an enormous cloud of uncertainty hanging over her business, even as she continues to book contracts, like one on Thursday related to a highway expansion in Dallas.“How can I give guidance when I don’t know how long it’s going to last or what all the ripple effects will be?” she asked. “I think it’s irresponsible for anyone to make assumptions right now.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The executive went home, came back to work Monday, then left again with chest pains. Meanwhile, an associate who woke up with a fever worried about letting down bosses but stayed away.This wasn’t a Goldman Sachs problem. Wall Street’s nonstop aggressiveness is clashing with the demands of a deadly pandemic. As government officials, doctors and companies tell people around the world to stay home, interviews with bankers and traders inside the industry’s giants show many feel torn between public health and private profit.“People do come in when they have a cold,” said Jim Toes, who runs the Security Traders Association, an industry group. “Sometimes you have that old boss where you’re damned if you do, you’re damned if you don’t: If you stay home, you get that snickering response. If you come in, you get in trouble.”Wall Street’s blanket directives telling workers to stop coming in aren’t as simple as they sound, especially for traders. One said he’s facing pressure to be “a tough guy” who follows the unwritten wartime rules. If there’s money to be made, the trader said, his bosses would want him in the position to make it, even if there’s a healthier and more soulful message being broadcast by the bank’s chief executive officer.Some bankers even said privately they would be relieved if markets temporarily shut, especially because they worry the new work-from-home policies aren’t as robust as they sound.Goldman senior executives have urged employees who are feeling ill to stay home. “If you are not feeling well, you must stay home even if your symptoms are mild,” Goldman’s Laurence Stein said in a Sunday memo. “Take sick time or work from home until your symptoms have subsided.”The culture that’s so ingrained across the top of Wall Street reaches far past Midtown Manhattan. Its impact can be felt among bank tellers who have no choice but to report to branches, or even white-collar workers in the Midwest.And while the health crisis finds about 100 million Americans without the luxury of working from home, the difference at banks is the degree of disparity that can be seen inside some of the industry’s largest firms. Many highly paid executives are able to log in from home, but operators still report to call centres. Workers in between feel confused and stuck.At JPMorgan Chase & Co., the country’s biggest bank, some managers are making workers come in despite announcements from more senior bosses to stay home, according to people with knowledge of the matter. After a senior mortgage executive told employees on a call that underwriters with remote access should start working from home, a subordinate stopped many of them from telecommuting in Milwaukee, where schools are shut.From their windows, JPMorgan employees there watched workers in Wells Fargo & Co.’s nearby building haul computer monitors and keyboards to bring home with them.At least 100 people in JPMorgan’s home-lending group were told they couldn’t work from home until all of them finish showing they can access systems from a remote location, according to people briefed on the plans. Some workers were asked to use sick leave or vacation days if they were unable to come into the office. One employee who said she wanted to take some time off this week to care for family was told it wouldn’t be possible to bring equipment home yet.“We have moved very quickly to enable work-from-home capabilities for our mortgage underwriters, and today the majority are,” a JPMorgan spokeswoman said by email. “The remaining groups will be work from home by the end of the week.”Inside Citigroup Inc., most workers in its call centres have continued to report to work, according to the bank. Some employees in Bank of America Corp.’s call centres are allowed to work from home, while others have been told to keep showing up but to maintain some distance from each other, a spokesman said. To be sure, the instructions inside firms have been changing by the day.“There are managers who will say, ‘We’re all in this together, if you want to take care of your kids and families, stay home,’” said Paul Sorbera, president of Wall Street executive search firm Alliance Consulting in New York. “And then there are others who will say, ‘We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of.’”The tension within the industry spans the globe.There are (managers) who will say, 'We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of'Some London bankers are choosing to work in the office to avoid their imperfect setups elsewhere. One trader for Commerzbank AG said trying to do his job at home was so gruesome that he keeps going into the office even as the contagion spreads. Senior traders at Nomura Holdings Inc. were sent to test the Japanese bank’s recovery site weeks ago, but connectivity issues and the distance from London drove some back to a city they find empty and eerie.Commerzbank is meeting the needs of clients while also protecting employees, according to a bank spokesperson. Nomura declined to comment.Last week, Goldman trading co-head Ashok Varadhan was working from home despite a chaotic week in markets, because he was feeling unwell.Such examples might help Wall Street bosses change decades of habit. In good times, it’s inconceivable for some in the business to step away from trading floors to go see a doctor.At Goldman Sachs, people there said, leaving for a medical appointment sounds so far-fetched that it has become a euphemism for heading out to a job interview.Bloomberg.com"

Data showed U.S. jobless claims came in higher than expected.Stocks slid in Europe and across most of Asia. In the euro zone, sovereign bonds soared from France and Italy to Greece after the region’s central bank boosted its efforts to stabilize the economy and capital markets.

While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at the time that he did not think negative rates would be appropriate policy in the U.S., markets have seen the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury dip as low as 0.31 per cent earlier this month.Buffett, the chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said earlier this month the effects of the virus and an oil shock were “a big one-two punch.” He later announced that shareholders would be barred from attending his company’s annual meeting given the spread of the virus.The billionaire investor has long favoured investing in stocks over bonds, building up an equity portfolio that topped US$248 billion at the end of last year. Buffett said in his annual shareholder letter, released in February, that it was almost certain that equities would outperform long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments in the long run if current interest rates and low corporate taxes were to persist.But he cautioned in the Yahoo Finance interview, conducted last week and released Wednesday, that he’s not an expert on forecasting the path of rates.“I have never been able to predict interest rates,” Buffett said. “Interest rates are important, but we don’t think they’re knowable.”Bloomberg.com"

Liquidity has vanished in many global markets, a bond rout is now underway and the Canadian dollar has plunged below 70 U.S. cents.Strategists, ensconced in home offices, are in the dark about what will happen to corporate earnings as authorities around the world shut down economic activity to avert a humanitarian disaster. Volatility on the TSX is at a record, and traders are on the lookout for evidence the outbreak is under control.In the meantime, investors are assessing government rescue plans, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s $82 billion (US$56.7 billion) package rolled out Wednesday that’s worth 3 per cent of GDP.Here are some of their views:Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at Manulife Investment Management, which manages $879 billion (US$677 billion) of assets:The S&P/TSX Composite Index has slumped to levels not seen since 2016, when the price of oil bottomed out. The market was about 1 per cent away from that as of noon on Wednesday.“The 2016 low is a key support level and one we are watching right now. This is an important technical support level that we would expect to hold. Given valuation, the current market environment is very similar to 2014-16 not only within the energy sector but financials and other areas of the market.”“In 2016 there were many great opportunities for investors based on valuation and dividend yields. This environment is very reminiscent of that.”“I am as close to the markets now as when I am in the office. The only challenge sometimes is finding a quiet place to work or take a call, as my wife and kids are home too. It’s cozy to say the least.”David Prince, founder of Harbinger Capital Markets Inc.:“When I am talking to the traders, I’m focused on ETFs, it’s because that’s where the volume is and that’s where the biggest volatility has been. But at least it’s tradeable and those ETFs are primarily in the U.S. and that’s what I have been recommending people invest.” He pointed to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF as examples of liquid ETFs.He recommends Canadian investors continue buying U.S. dollars and luxury goods providers with global supply chains, such as Burberry Group Plc and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. The return of Chinese shoppers to glitzy malls and boutiques will help boost demand for these types of companies, he said.Energy stocks now have smaller weighting on the Canadian benchmark than they did four years ago, Prince said. If the slide falls below the 2016 level, “it’ll mean that defaults are accelerating in this country. And to me, that’s the scary part,” he said.Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments:“We are going to be in a period of prolonged low interest rates and people still need income. Whether that income is going to come from dividend equities or alternative sources, I think that’s going to be apparent,” Taylor said in a phone interview from his home. “Companies that have good dividend payouts, that look pretty stable right now, I think those are going to be areas that could be really attractive investments for the next little while.”“We’ve been telling people, those who’ve got some extra cash on the sidelines, it’s probably not a bad time to start putting some of it to work.”Bruce Murray, chief executive officer at The Murray Wealth Group:Murray Wealth is “hunkering down” and “using the opportunity to upgrade our portfolio.” It’s “too late to sell” and the market turning is more of a medical question to do with the spread of the virus, he said.“Most of the downside is behind us,” he said — be there still may be more.Bloomberg.com"

This includes $27 billion in direct support for individuals and companies and $55 billion in temporary tax deferrals for both households and businesses.It’s a significant escalation in Canada’s stimulus package, and the urgency appears to be ramping up by the hour. Late Tuesday night, government officials were only talking about the direct stimulus aspect of the plan.The outlook, however, seems to be deteriorating quickly. The price of Canadian heavy crude slumped Wednesday below US$10 a barrel for the first time after oil-sands producers were forced to delay maintenance, pushing more oil into the market at the worst possible time.“Right now we are focused on making sure that people who are not getting an income or revenue because of this COVID-19 challenge have the money to be able to pay for groceries, pay their rent, and support their families through this difficult time,” Trudeau said.At a separate press conference, Finance Minister Bill Morneau called Wednesday’s measures the “first phase” of the response and said the government is prepared to do more if needed. “I will do whatever it takes,” he said. “There will be more to come.”Global financial markets are continuing to slide as the economic fallout from the pandemic outpaces even the massive response from governments and central banks.Trudeau also confirmed an announcement earlier by President Donald Trump that Canada and the U.S. have agreed to close the world’s longest undefended border to all non-essential traffic.The measures announced Wednesday include steps to bolster child benefit payments, a $10 billion emergency care program to workers who stay home and don’t have access to paid sick leave, and a 10 per cent wage subsidy to eligible small businesses for the next 90 days. The bulk of the support is a plan to allow taxpayers to defer filing until after Aug. 31 — a temporary liquidity support.Wednesday’s package brings the support offered to businesses and individuals to more than $500 billion during the crisis, the prime minister’s office said in a statement. The country’s banking regulator is loosening capital requirements to free up $300 billion of lending capacity, while the country’s housing agency is buying up to $50 billion in mortgages to provide liquidity.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz, who was also at the Morneau press conference, has cut interest rates by a full percentage over the past two weeks and moved aggressively to keep money flowing through credit markets. Investors are anticipating another half percentage point cut in coming weeks.Asked why he hasn’t moved since the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates on Sunday, Poloz said he would like the “benefit of analysis” of the recent fiscal steps and other measures taken by the central bank before deciding on the next steps.

But his head of North American human resources sent a follow-up email saying that vehicle manufacturing and energy infrastructure are deemed crucial sectors, and that the factory will remain in operation despite Bay Area orders for people to stay home to limit the spread of COVID-19.“Tesla and our supplier network will continue operations that directly support factory production, vehicle deliveries and service,” wrote Valerie Capers Workman, the company’s regional HR chief.Tesla representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The county’s public health department referred inquiries about Tesla to the company.Musk told his millions of Twitter followers on March 6 that “the coronavirus panic is dumb.” The electric car-maker has said little publicly about how it’s handling the virus, in contrast with other automakers and Silicon Valley’s leading technology companies.The coronavirus panic is dumbBut Tesla has some experience to rely on: its Chinese factory near Shanghai was temporarily shuttered earlier this year and is now back online.“My frank opinion remains that the harm from the coronavirus panic far exceeds that of the virus itself,” Musk wrote in the email on Monday. “If there is a massive redirection of medical resources out of proportion to the danger, it will result in less available care to those with critical medical needs, which does not serve the greater good.”Tesla shares pared a decline of as much as 11 per cent to trade down 2.5 per cent as of 11:30 a.m. Tuesday in New York. The stock, which was up 119 per cent for the year as of Feb. 19, erased its 2020 gains in early intraday trading.Some employees probably will opt to stay home and assembly lines likely will be slowed, Chris McNally, an analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a report. He assumes Tesla will lose output of as much as 10,000 vehicles and burn through up to US$1.2 billion in the first quarter, more than double his original bear-case scenario.Tesla has not said how many cars it expects to produce and deliver in the first quarter. In January, the company said deliveries should “comfortably” exceed 500,000 units for the year.

A day after President Donald Trump conceded the U.S. slump alone is set to be “a bad one,” economists threw away their forecasts that the world could avoid tumbling into recession for the first time since the financial crisis.Behind the rethink: The virus’s spread to Europe and the U.S., as well as new evidence that China — the first to be hit by what is now a pandemic — experienced a harder hit to its economy than originally projected.Morgan Stanley’s team, led by Chetan Ahya, said a worldwide recession is now its “base case,” with growth expected to fall to 0.9 per cent this year. At Goldman Sachs, Jan Hatzius and colleagues predict a weakening of growth to 1.25 per cent. S&P Global added its voice to the chorus with a report expecting that growth would range 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent.Such slumps would not be as painful as the 0.8 per cent contraction of 2009, as measured by the International Monetary Fund, but they would be worse than the downturns of 2001 and the early 1990s. Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs anticipate a rebound in the second half, but warn that the risk remains of even greater economic pain. The projections will apply further pressure on policy makers to do more to limit the health emergency and to deliver stimulus that helps companies and consumers through the shock and then drives a rebound in demand afterward.Although the U.S. Federal Reserve and fellow central banks have been active in loosening monetary policy, most governments have been slow in responding and are only now crafting fiscal packages that may still fail to pacify worried investors.“While the policy response will provide downside protection, the underlying damage from both COVID-19’s impact and tighter financial conditions will deliver a material shock to the global economy,” Morgan Stanley’s economists said.The outlook could darken even further if the virus lasts longer than anticipated, or wields greater economic pain — given factories, schools, restaurants and shops are closing around the world. A freezing up of markets or a continued sluggishness by governments to act are also regarded as threats.Elsewhere on Wall Street, strategists are laying out what governments should be doing.At JPMorgan Chase & Co., John Normand advocated developed economies repeating their handiwork of the crisis when they delivered fiscal stimulus worth 1 per cent to 2 per cent of gross domestic product. George Saravelos, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, said governments may also need to step in to guarantee support for households and companiesWhile the Fed gets “full marks” for its recent response in cutting rates and moving to stabilize credit markets, Northern Trust Corp. Chief Economist Carl Tannenbaum said Congress and the White House have so far failed to act boldly enough.“The other side of Washington really needs to step up with something as substantial in size, and intelligent in design,” he said.China is experiencing the biggest pain, and most economists failed to capture how far it would fall, with the likelihood now that its economy will suffer the worst turmoil in many decades. The Morgan Stanley economists now reckon its economy shrank 5 per cent in the second quarter.Since the outbreak originated in China, data is being treated by many as a harbinger of what’s to come in other regions. Morgan Stanley predicts the U.S. and European economies will suffer the most in the second quarter.Predictions for the U.S. still vary wildly, with some guessing activity could even decline as much 10 per cent on an annualized basis in the three months through June.

Belski upgraded real estate stocks to overweight from market weight, maintains energy and financials at overweight.“While investments, let alone society, have been gripped by the fear of the lasting effects of COVID-19 virus, we firmly believe this too shall pass and remain committed to perspective and analytically driven messaging as opposed to fear-laden headlines and the natural impulse to react,” Belski said.Canadian stocks entered a bear market last week and are now down about 30 per cent since their peak in February.The BMO strategist has had a knack for nailing year-end forecasts for Canadian stocks. Last year, he predicted the benchmark would end the year at 17,000, about 63 points from where it actually ended.

The Philippines became the first country to shut its financial markets, though it aims to reopen Thursday.“A bear market does not preclude rallies,” said Eleanor Creagh, market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “In fact, the biggest rallies can be in bear markets — erratic swings are exacerbated by the present high-volatility regime and strained liquidity conditions. With VIX remaining significantly above the long-term equilibrium, alarm bells are still sounding and traders should be wary of relief rallies.”After the Federal Reserve and other central banks dramatically stepped up efforts to stabilize capital markets and liquidity, traders are looking to fiscal authorities for action.

There are about 20 more countries interested in support, Georgieva said.The fund also has about US$400 million in its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to help poor countries with debt relief. With the help of donations, like US$195 million recently from the U.K., the IMF hopes to boost that to US$1 billion, she said.“As the virus spreads, the case for a coordinated and synchronized global fiscal stimulus is becoming stronger by the hour,” Georgieva said. “During the global financial crisis, for example, fiscal stimulus by the G-20 amounted to about 2 per cent of GDP, or over US$900 billion in today’s money, in 2009 alone. So, there is a lot more work to do.”Georgieva added that the IMF “stands ready to mobilize its US$1 trillion lending capacity to help our membership.” She praised the swap lines announced by central banks on Sunday, saying that going forward there may be a need for swap lines to emerging-market economies.The comments come after Georgieva said earlier this month that the global economic outlook has shifted to “more dire scenarios” and that it’s still difficult to predict the economic impact of the virus.

In addition, it united with five other central banks to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell held a conference call with reporters to discuss the actions during which he reiterated the central bank’s resistance to negative interest rates as some countries have used. The Fed’s key rate is now 0 per cent to 0.25 per cent, matching the record low it was last at in 2015.President Donald Trump, who as recently as Saturday attacked the Fed for not lowering rates faster and further, quickly expressed support for the move.“It makes me very happy and I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve,” he said. “That’s a big step and I’m very happy they did it.”U.S. stock futures tumbled steeply after the announcement, as investors worried that emergency measures by the Fed would fall short in countering the virus’s damage to the economy. Treasury futures surged in early Asia trading, giving rise to expectations that parts of the U.S. yield curve could soon turn negative.Powell told reporters on the call that the rate decision Sunday is in lieu of the Fed’s regularly scheduled meeting this week, planned for Tuesday and Wednesday.The action comes as the U.S. economy faces sharply curtailed activity in everything from basketball games, to dining out and travel. That’s likely to hurt revenue for thousands of companies and put many jobs as risk, if not cause outright layoffs.With Sunday’s announcement, the Fed is firing some of the biggest guns in its arsenal, but economists say without a similar, forceful response from the government, the country’s record 11 year expansion could end in recession. Stocks have already tumbled into a bear market.“The Fed cannot combat a public health crisis, but they can provide a helpful hand when the crisis abates,” said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economic research at Renaissance Macro Research LLC.The Fed said it will keep interest rates near zero “until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.”The central bank acted the day before leaders from the Group of Seven nations, including Trump, are set to discuss their virus response on a teleconference. Central bankers and investors have pressed governments to do more to support their economies given monetary ammunition is running low and because fiscal policy can be targeted at corners of an economy that need it most.“The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,” it said.To support smooth functioning in the Treasury and mortgage backed securities market, the Fed said it would lift its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and of MBS by at least $200 billion.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester cast a lone dissent, preferring rates were instead cut to a 0.5 per cent-0.75 per cent range.The Fed’s actions followed the Trump administration and Congress’s first comprehensive steps Friday to assure the public that it has a coordinated public health and fiscal policy response — in what could serve as a one-two punch that shores up investor confidence and helps stem a weeks-long meltdown in markets.The dramatic Sunday evening moves follow aggressive action by the Fed on Thursday to ease strains in the Treasury debt market through massive injections of liquidity and broader purchases of U.S. securities in a measure reminiscent of the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis.U.S. stocks have plunged, along with Treasury yields on virus outbreak The Fed’s action also comes less than two weeks after it slashed rates by a half percentage point in an emergency move that failed to reassure nervous investors, in part because it was not accompanied by steps from other policy makers. That move — alone — failed to comfort investors and stocks ended the day down almost 3 per cent.“The Fed’s mantra has been to go early and aggressive, so this is the best thing they could have done, they’re really inventing new stuff,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago.She also emphasized that more action is needed from fiscal authorities.“This is not enough,” she said. “The Fed is showing its commitment a lot more than the federal government is. They’re going to have to step it up a lot more.”Bloomberg.com "

The loonie has weakened almost 6 per cent this year against the greenback and government bond yields have plumbed record lows.The stock index has tumbled 30 per cent in three weeks since its Feb. 20 peak, battered by concerns on the virus and plunging oil prices. That’s about twice the 15 per cent slump in the three weeks after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.Before the market opened on Thursday, Bloomberg gathered with three top investors to discuss where we go from here. Around the table were Lesley Marks, chief investment strategist at BMO Private Wealth; Rob Vanderhooft, chief investment officer of TD Asset Management, which manages $394 billion (US$286 billion); and Kevin McCreadie, CEO and CIO of AGF Management Ltd., who sets the direction for about $37.4 billion in assets.Here’s a synopsis of the discussion.Financial markets are experiencing extreme movements not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. But the structure of the market has changed since then and that’s a factor in the volatility, said Marks.Exchange-traded funds are now an easier way for investors to move money quickly. “Historically, it may have taken a longer period of time to move money in and out of asset classes versus using an ETF,” she said.ETF assets had grown to more than US$5 trillion globally this year compared with about US$700 billion when the financial crisis first started, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Program trading may be another reason that activity is frantic in the first and last 30 minutes of any trading day and quieter in between.Vanderhooft at TD said a dramatic drop in liquidity is also contributing to the downturn. “Liquidity is a coward and it disappears at times of market disruptions and that’s certainly what we’re seeing right now.”Either way the market is a different beast, the strategists said.“They are not traditional market makers any longer,” said McCreadie. “I think in this period of volatility, we will see how the market structure has evolved and will it hold up.”The hit to oil prices is compounding the damage from the virus pandemic in Canada, where 15 per cent of the TSX index is made up of energy stocks. The breakup of the OPEC+ alliance led to a swift price war on crude, with catastrophic consequence for the oil patch. The country’s benchmark crude, Western Canadian Select, is at US$18.74 a barrel.“If you look at the impact on the oil market, it’s very, very negative for Western Canada,” Vanderhooft said. “As bad as US$31 WTI is, US$20 WCS is a lot worse. A lot of companies that were already teetering will go under.”Smaller producers may have a harder time surviving the current crash in prices than during the 2014 crisis because banks are less inclined to prop them up, added McCreadie.“This time around a lot of these smaller players aren’t going to make it,” he said. “I think you’re going to be dealing with bankruptcies.”The increased focus on climate change and sustainability may be factoring into banks’ thinking more now, said Marks. “You already had that major headwind without the latest crisis, without a price war, without the situation between the Saudis and the Russians. We think this will just fuel the fire.”Vanderhooft said that his firm has moved to a “more negative position” on the Canadian dollar as a result of the oil-price hit. The loonie hit fresh four-year lows at one point on Thursday.All three strategists say the markets will come back. McCreadie and Vanderhooft see the current turmoil as different than 2008.“2008 was a true credit crunch, people didn’t trust each other, banks stopped lending, there was no repo. The world stopped,” McCreadie said, adding there’s unlikely to be “system failure” now.As coronavirus cases start to ebb, as they have in China, that will likely be when the market begins to turn back up, especially if governments get their act together with fiscal stimulus to aid the economy.We're not playing this as a multi-year bear market“We’re not playing this as a multi-year bear market,” he said, though odds of a recession in North America have clearly risen. “I think it could be the pause that resets the cycle.”Marks said BMO hasn’t seen any substantial fear when it comes to asset outflows, with much of the money shifting to bonds from equities. “In conversations with clients, we haven’t seen that sense, that pervasive sense of panicking, that ‘Get me out of the market’ across the board.’”“We will get through this event,” McCreadie said. “We always do.”“You talk about fully balanced portfolios, that’s where clients need to be,” said Vanderhooft. “At times of stress like this, you kind of figure out why that’s the case.”McCreadie’s team at AGF will be looking at paring back investments that have generated double-digit returns and add some of its cash back into markets over the next few weeks.Marks said she is standing pat after BMO Private Wealth’s Investment Counsel Business reduced its equity exposure in November. While stocks have become cheaper, the lack of visibility makes it “hard to have conviction to step in,” she said.Bloomberg.com"

That added to optimism after the Federal Reserve said it was buying $37 billion of bonds across maturities.Canada’s main stock index closed Friday with a 9.6 per cent advance to regain some of the ground it gave up Thursday in its biggest one-day drop on record.The S&P/TSX composite index was up 1,1207.88 points or 9.6% at 13,716.33, a day after giving up more than 1,700 points.In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1,985.00 points at 23,185.62.

The dollar surged along with Treasury yields and stress in the credit markets showed signs of easing. Precious metals fell, with silver down almost 9 per cent and palladium posting its worst week on record.The S&P 500’s gain Friday was its biggest since 2008, even as the gauge lost 11 per cent this week.After days of no or inadequate action, policy prescriptions came fast Friday. As Trump announced his plans, Congress was also working on a relief bill. The European Union prepared to suspend government spending rules, and regulators in Italy and Spain banned short-selling on some stocks. China’s central bank said it would pump in $79 billion to bolster the economy.Other markets remained exceptionally volatile. The yen tumbled. Ten-year Treasuries swung from gains to losses. Sovereign bonds sank across most of Europe for a second day amid criticism of European Central Bank measures to address the pandemic. The dollar headed for its best week since 2016.“It’s possible we’re just recovering a portion of yesterday’s losses on the idea that there were no terrible headlines this morning,” said Christopher Jacobsen, a strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group. “The market had priced in the extreme dour outcome and the lack of newsflow this morning to confirm that worst-case scenario resulted in just a bit of a relief rally.”Even with Friday’s gains, global equities posted their worst week since 2008 as investors price in a severely weaker economic outlook. Cases are continuing to grow across the world and restrictions on people and businesses are weighing on sentiment. The Bank of Japan on Friday followed an earlier move from the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity.“It seems that the more severe things become in the short term, the more extreme will be the fiscal and monetary policy response,” Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management, wrote to investors. “It is very conceivable that the full boost from such measures will only really kick in just as activity rebounds, with pent up demand leading to a turbo-charged recovery in the second half of the year in the wake of an economic contraction in the context of the first half.”These are the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 Index climbed 9.2% at the close of trading in New York.

Trading was halted earlier in the day amid dramatic selling at the opening. The nation’s benchmark slumped to its lowest since February 2016 at the close.“The most important thing right now is to focus on liquidity, focus on safe yields and non-cyclical parts of market,” including Canadian banks, David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates Inc., said in a phone interview. He’s “nibbling back into the market” and advising clients to look for stocks where dividends are safe.Rosenberg, the former Merrill Lynch chief economist, who has long been forecasting a recession, thinks one has already begun in Canada and the U.S. “This is an absolutely horrible situation, at every level,” he said.A growing chorus of economists believe Canada is on the brink of recession as the economy takes a double hit from the coronavirus and tanking oil prices, ramping up pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to boost its fiscal stimulus package.Don’t bank on a quick bounce, at least according to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “The caveat here is that we do not believe there is a V-shape recovery given the magnitude of the recent technical damage in market internals,” the bank’s technical analyst Sid Mokhtari said in a note to clients.Crude oil slumped further after President Donald Trump said the U.S. would restrict travel from Europe for the next 30 days in an attempt to contain the coronavirus, pummeling fuel demand.Trudeau is in self-isolation and working from home while his wife awaits the results of a Covid-19 test. Sophie Gregoire Trudeau had been exhibiting flu-like symptoms after recently returning from a speaking engagement in London, the prime minister’s office said in a statement. While her symptoms have subsided, she’s self-isolating at home as she awaits the test results.The prime minister isn’t exhibiting any symptoms.U.S. stocks tumbled, with benchmark gauges posting their worst drop since 1987, as investors signalled the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary bond-buying measures and Donald Trump’s economic proposals won’t be enough to counter the economic impact from the coronavirus.All three major U.S. equity gauges fell more than 9%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 losing the most since Black Monday more than three decades ago. The stock rout was worldwide, with Europe’s benchmark index down 11 per cent in a record drop. Brazil’s Ibovespa tumbled as much as 20 per cent at one point, extending this year’s loss to almost 50 per cent in dollar terms. Canada’s main gauge was off more than 12 per cent, it’s worst day since 1940.Ten-year Treasury yields erased declines and inched higher as policy makers’ pledge of US$1.5 trillion in liquidity recalled the quantitative easing used during the financial crisis. Oil and precious metals fell, with palladium entering a bear market as it tumbled more than 20 per cent Thursday.The S&P 500 entered a bear market, wiping out all its gains since the end of 2018. Now investors are trying to guess at the effectiveness of policy makers’ measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus and limit its economic damage. Trump’s travel ban and tepid fiscal measures failed to impress most observers. Spirits were further damped by new bans on public gatherings in the U.S. and professional sports leagues’ move to suspend operations.“Markets likely need more. More innovation from central banks, more targeted help for the most vulnerable parts of the economy — and action from fiscal authorities to stop this transitory shock from developing into a more prolonged insolvency crisis,” said Seema Shah, a global investment strategist for Principal Global Investors. “Emotion is now driving markets.”On another bruising day across markets:More bad news about the impact of the coronavirus further sapped investor spirits. The leading U.S. infectious-disease official said the testing system in the country is failing. The European Union warned of sickness threatens to exceed health-care capacity across the region “in a few weeks or even days.” The National Hockey League followed the National Basketball Association’s lead and suspended its season.“Market moves suggest monetary stimulus has reached its limits,” said Lucas Bouwhuis, a portfolio manager at Achmea Investment. “Most of the stimulus needs to come from the fiscal side and we are just not seeing enough of that yet.”Meanwhile, signs that companies in the hardest-hit industries were drawing down credit lines to battle the effects of the virus on their businesses added to anxiety.“The risks have definitely risen,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA. “The question is how long will this last and I don’t think anybody can predict that at this point.”Bloomberg.com"

This adds a massive jolt of liquidity to financial markets that will also expand the Fed’s balance sheet for the duration of the operations.The Fed has been under increasing pressure to act as investors lost faith in the U.S. government’s ability to quickly produce a coherent policy plan after President Donald Trump addressed the nation Wednesday with few details on fiscal stimulus measures, but restrictions on travel from Europe to the U.S. that deepened the sense of alarm.“President Trump set out to calm everyone’s concerns, and he added fuel to the fire,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Capital Management, a Chicago-based wealth-management firm. “Right now, if you look at the technicals, we had finally slipped into what I’d call panic.”U.S. central bankers delivered an emergency half percentage-point cut last week and were expected to move again when they meet on March 17-18 in Washington, if not sooner, with some economists predicting they could slash rates to zero from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent at the moment.“Fed did its part today of helping with market functioning,” said Priya Misra, head of rates strategy at TD Securities. “We still need the fiscal help.”Bloomberg.com"

Indeed, its earlier advance due to its status as a haven during market turmoil may be why gold is being dragged down now.“Liquidity needs will be a key driver in the short term,” said Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered Plc. “Gold is one of the few assets that has outperformed, enabling investors to take profit rather than consolidate losses.”Traders say that the unrelenting rout in global equities is triggering margin calls, spurring investors to look for opportunities where they can cash in. Additionally, strength in the dollar is also curbing the precious metal’s appeal as a haven for holders of other currencies.U.S. equities plunged as much 8.5 per cent Thursday, before paring the drop, with trading settling into a range after an initial bout of selling triggered a 15-minute NYSE-mandated halt.

A rapid rise in coronavirus cases globally, the sharp fall in oil prices and volatility in financial markets make a contraction in the second and third quarters this year “likely” in the absence of fiscal measures, Jean-François Perrault, chief economist at Scotiabank, said Wednesday.“A reasonably mild recession appears likely unless timely and targeted fiscal measures are deployed in the very near future to deal with the economic impacts of the virus,” Perrault wrote in a research note.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released $1.1 billion in new funding earlier Wednesday in response to the virus, and said the government is ready to do more if necessary. Trudeau also said his government is prepared to use federal financing agencies to further stimulate the economy if needed, a measure that was deployed during the 2008-09 financial crisis.But that may not be enough. Canada’s measures pale in comparison to those set out by countries such as Italy, which plans to spend as much as 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion) on stimulus measures. Perrault recommends the government roll out a fiscal package equivalent to one per cent of GDP, or just over $20 billion, in order to prevent the Canadian economy from going into recession.The Toronto-based bank sees the country’s gross domestic product growth slowing to 0.3 per cent for the year in the absence of significant stimulus. Scotiabank’s isn’t the first bearish call to emerge this week in the aftermath of the oil price collapse but it does represent the most aggressive take yet on Canada’s future.National Bank of Canada Financial and Royal Bank of Canada will release their forecasts later this week. Bank of Montreal was the first of the six banks to revise their forecasts lower this week, with a call for full year GDP growth at 0.5 per cent.The latest stream of downward revisions include predictions that the Bank of Canada will cut rates to 0.25 per cent by June from its current 1.25 per cent. That’s in line with financial market expectations, according to overnight index swaps trading. The last time the Bank of Canada policy rate reached 0.25 per cent was in 2009. Earlier this month, the central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points amid escalating coronavirus concerns, matching an emergency move by the Federal Reserve.Here are the latest revisions from bank economists this week:Scotiabank — Jean-François PerraultSees Canada’s 2020 GDP at 0.3 per cent in absence of substantial fiscal stimulus and 0.7 per cent if there is fiscal stimulus worth one per cent of GDP. Without fiscal stimulus, Q2 and Q3 GDP will contract. Expects the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates by 50 basis points at the next two meetings.Bank of Montreal — Michael GregoryLowers 2020 GDP to 0.5 per cent from one per cent, and sees Q2 contracting by 3.5 per cent. Expects Bank of Canada to cut rates by 100 basis points over the next two meetings to 0.25 per cent.JPMorgan — Silvana DiminoRevises down 2020 forecast to one per cent or 1.1 per cent Q4/Q4 basis. Predicts no growth in Q2 and a two per cent rebound in Q3. Expects Bank of Canada to cut by 50 basis points in April with the “heightened risk” for an earlier emergency cut to zero per cent.Goldman Sachs — Daan StruyvenRevises down 2020 GDP to 0.4 per cent or 0.2 per cent on a Q4/Q4 basis. Sees Canada on “verge of recession” with a zero per cent Q1, -0.5 per cent Q2, 0.25 per cent Q3 and one per cent Q4.

Now, stocks have buckled under concern that the virus and a new downturn in the oil sector will hammer the economy.The WHO declaration and no comments on stimulus from President Donald Trump rattled markets. Trump said late in the market session that he’d make a statement Wednesday night on the administration’s plans. European officials signalled a growing willingness to move soon to combat the virus’s effects on the region’s economy.Signs that companies in the hardest-hit industries were drawing down credit lines to battle the effects of the virus on their businesses added to anxiety.“We have no idea when the coronavirus, the spread, is going to subside. That uncertainty is going to continue to create a lot of volatility,” said David Spika, the president of GuideStone Capital Management. “We have no idea how to model it, we have no idea what to expect from it.”Here are the main moves in global markets:U.S. stocks extended their three-week slide as investors grappled with the potential economic hit from the virus that is upending daily routines around the world. Policy makers are seeking to assure traders they’re on alert, with the ECB indicating it may move as soon as this week, the Bank of England cutting rates and German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledging to do “whatever is necessary” to bolster the economy.In the U.S., the Trump administration continues to promise “major” stimulus, but details remain uncertain. Democrats plan to urge the president to declare a national state of emergency. Markets are now growing worried that whatever does come will not have the ability to stave off a major blow to the world’s largest economy.“Every day we get whipsawed back and forth, and what we’re seeing today is general disappointment that fiscal policy is not at all clear in how it’s going to stimulate the economy,” said Michael Reynolds, an investment strategy officer at Glenmede Trust Co.Meanwhile, Joe Biden cemented his position as front-runner for the U.S. Democratic presidential nomination with primary victories Tuesday, further easing concerns among those opposing Bernie Sanders’s progressive platform.Bloomberg.com"

While there’s no immediate plan to adjust the province’s program limiting oil output, the government will monitor inventories and step in if storage nears capacity.“We will use the curtailment tool responsibly to ensure at least a survival price for our producers to get through this,” Kenney said.Alberta’s government has pledged to do what’s necessary to shore up its oil-dependent economy after world crude prices fell the most since 1991 this week amid a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The two countries’ battle over control of the global oil market comes as the coronavirus pandemic has obliterated energy demand. The sudden collapse in oil prices hit Canadian oil companies hard, prompting oil sands producer Cenovus Energy Inc. to slash capital spending by 32% and cancel its crude-by-rail program.After conversations with business leaders in recent days, Kenney said he’s also considering payroll tax relief and using the province’s balance sheet to help companies with their current liquidity crisis.Canada’s oilpatch was already struggling with pipeline shortages that prompted the province to impose production limits on its largest producers at the start of last year. The government had started relaxing those restrictions prior to the market downturn.While no new pipelines are expected to be constructed before year-end at the earliest, increasing volumes of crude have been flowing to the U.S. Gulf Coast on rail lines. Those shipments are now threatened after heavy Western Canadian Select’s price tumbled, with its discount to West Texas Intermediate futures shrinking to US$12.75 a barrel on Wednesday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s too small a price difference to support most crude-by-rail shipments, which require a US$15 to US$18 a barrel discount.Western Canadian oil stockpiles, stored primarily in hubs at Edmonton and Hardisty, Alberta, had reached 37 million barrels at the end of December, Imperial Oil Ltd. executives said in January. Inventories declined to 32 million barrels near the end of January, they said, citing Genscape data.“If producers stop rail shipments, Hardisty will fill and the differentials will widen,” said Brent Osmond, president of crude-by-rail company Clover Oil & Gas LLC. “This further depresses the realized price for Canadian crude, and exacerbates an already difficult situation.”Bloomberg.com"

Studies show it’s at least theoretically possible for other coronaviruses to survive on the dollar’s cotton-and-linen weave, though there’s little agreement on the actual risk of contagion.Behind the scenes, some industry groups and banks have been urging the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to issue a statement assuring Americans that there’s minimal risk for using cash, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The Fed, in turn, says it’s waiting for advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which so far has said the virus spreads primarily through person-to-person contact. In the meantime, the Fed has been putting notes repatriated from Asia in quarantine for up to 10 days to ensure it’s safe.The stakes are high for banks and companies handling electronic payments: Billions of dollars in profits hinge on whatever statement or policy authorities ultimately issue.On one side, small and mid-size banks are working to keep branches open so they can keep serving legions of business customers that refill their cash registers daily. Representatives from some lenders think it’s important for regulators to offer guidance on handling money, noting the risk of using currency is low — comparing it, say, to pushing an elevator button or grasping a handrail.If, on the other hand, authorities take steps that discourage the use of dollar bills, it will buttress the credit card industry’s long-running “war on cash,” sending more transactions through their networks and to payment apps that collect fees. That could even boost interest-bearing credit card balances.Firms such as Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., American Express Co., PayPal Holdings Inc. and a slew of large card-issuing banks would be among the top beneficiaries.The virus may end up serving as a “trigger event” for wider acceptance of cards long term, either persuading retailers to start taking them or prompting the government to force them, said Lisa Ellis, an analyst independent research boutique MoffettNathanson. The shift would be especially dramatic in regions of the world where card use is still relatively uncommon, she said.“Digital payments are already viewed as good for society by governments because they help with financial inclusion, they drive tax revenue and eliminate corruption,” she said. “This is another reason: ‘Oh, and it’s hygienic too.’”And on another side are millions of Americans who lack access to bank accounts, as well as poor and rural communities with few if any branches serving residents and local businesses. Many of them rely on cash for commerce. Repeatedly in recent years, consumer advocates have fought stores and restaurants that try to simplify checkout by going “cashless.” Cities such as New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco passed laws requiring dollars be accepted.Some of those groups worry they’re about to face a national battle to allow cashless commerce in response to the coronavirus.“Going cashless is definitely not something that we particularly support,” said Eric Espinoza, an associate director at Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, which helps provide financial services to low-income communities. “We certainly wouldn’t support it under a hasty decision-making environment in which you’re extremely reactive and potentially not as thoughtful about the repercussions.”Despite the increased popularity of credit and debit cards in recent years, cash still remains one of the most popular ways to pay for things in the U.S., accounting for 26 per cent of all payments by consumers last year, according to data compiled by the Fed. Spare change and dollar bills are still overwhelmingly favoured for small purchases, accounting for about 50 per cent of payments under $10.Roughly 25 per cent of Americans are either unbanked or underbanked — with black and Hispanic households making up the largest percentage of those lacking accounts, according to a study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. More than half of unbanked households in the U.S. say they lack the funds to keep an account open.“If you want to go that direction, it’s going to take really thoughtful planning in order to deal with the questions of inclusivity,” John Thompson, chief program officer for the Financial Health Network. “There’s still really important, substantively sized sectors of the country that are operating outside of the mainstream financial system.”Paper currency in the U.S. is made from 75 per cent cotton and 25 per cent linen, according to the Treasury. That makes the surface of bills coarse and fibrous, allowing germs to adhere more easily and survive longer than they can on smooth objects. One study in 2013 showed the dollar has the ability to show “significant and prolonged carriage” of the dreaded Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria known as MSRA.A 2020 study of coronaviruses, which included SARS and MERS, showed the microbes can persist on surfaces for as long as nine days. That can be reduced significantly using ethanol-based disinfectant, according to the study, but cleaning a paper bill proves more difficult than a plastic surface like a desk.Confronted with COVID-19, the People’s Bank of China began using ultraviolet light and high-temperature ovens to disinfect cash coming in. It has also replaced old notes with newly minted bills.The Fed is staying in contact with the CDC to make sure it’s aware of the agency’s latest thinking on how the virus spreads, a spokeswoman for the central bank said.So far during the current outbreak, the Fed hasn’t widely enacted its longstanding protocol for banks handling bills suspected of being dangerous: First stacking them in “straps” of 100, then bundling those into larger bricks and packaging them in plastic bags with the word “CONTAMINATED” scribbled in permanent ink.Even if the virus compels more people to use cards, the world’s largest payments network will still be battling the broader slowdown in spending, especially in the travel sector.“In the near term, at this point, coronavirus is a clear negative because of disproportionate impact on international travel and consumer discretionary spend,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Harshita Rawat said in an interview. “People are just not traveling internationally and this is one of the most profitable businesses that these companies have.”Bloomberg.com"

That’s in addition to the 24 Max that Air Canada received before regulators banned the jetliner from commercial flight after two fatal accidents.Air Canada’s shrinking appetite underscores the rising risk of cancellations for the Max, which could worsen as the coronavirus outbreak saps demand for new jets.

In February, Saudi Arabia produced about 9.7 million barrels a day.Welcome to the free market. The world is about to learn very swiftly how important a swing producer is for stabilityIt’s the latest manoeuvre in what’s set to be a long and bitter conflict between Russia and Saudi Arabia. On Monday benchmark oil prices fell more than 20 per cent, the largest one-day drop in almost 30 years, creating mayhem in global equity and bond markets.Oil prices initially pared gains on Tuesday, but later resumed its advance amid a broader rally in global markets. Brent crude was trading 9.4 per cent higher at US$37.54 a barrel at 10:49 a.m. in London. The benchmark plunged 24 per cent on Monday, the biggest drop in almost 30 years.Moscow responded within minutes in what looked like a war of words, with Alexander Novak, the country’s energy minister, saying Russia had the ability to boost production by 500,000 barrels a day. That would put the country’s output potentially at 11.8 million barrels a day — a record.The outcome of the price war will be determined by Saudi Arabia and Russia’s ability to inflict damage, but also their ability to absorb it.Saudi Arabia has greater offensive abilities, thanks to about 2 million barrels a day of idle production capacity. Riyadh can also use its strategic oil stocks to boost supplies at very short notice, according to people familiar with its strategy.On top of domestic stockpiles, it also stores crude near consumption hubs in Rotterdam, Okinawa and the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir. Russia doesn’t have a network of strategic oil stocks to match.Russia may have the defensive advantage. The Kremlin can dip into its US$150 billion wealth fund to offset the slump and bolster the ruble. Those reserves are sufficient to cover lost revenue “for six to 10 years” at oil prices of US$25 to $30 a barrel, the Finance Ministry said.Should Brent crude remain at US$35 without an adjustment in Saudi spending, the kingdom would run a deficit of nearly 15 per cent of economic output in 2020, while its net foreign reserves could run out in about five years unless it uses other funding sources, according to Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.“Welcome to the free market,” said Bob McNally, founder of consultant Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official. “The world is about to learn very swiftly how important a swing producer is for stability, not only for the global oil market but the broader economy and geopolitics.”For decades, the oil market has been largely regulated. First by Americans, who set production quotas for their oil companies through the Texas Railroad Commission in the first half of the 20th century, and later by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil cartel. Through that time, Texas and later OPEC acted as swing producers, upping output at times of scarcity and reducing it at times of lower demand, to keep prices stable.With oil demand rapidly falling due to the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic, the Saudi production hike, followed potentially by another one from Russia, is likely to force oil companies to store crude, rather than process it. Traders are already seeking out tankers to store the glut.The International Energy Agency earlier this week said that global oil demand will contract this year for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2009.The U.S. and other Western countries are starting to worry about the oil price war between two of the world’s most powerful petroleum nations. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Energy denounced in a rare statement “attempts by state actors to manipulate and shock oil markets”.Even as both sides ramped up production and the war of words, Novak said the door wasn’t closed to future talks. He said OPEC+ could meet in May or June. Bloomberg.com"

Western Canada Select, the benchmark grade produced by Canada’s oil sands, was down about 19 per cent to US$22.71 a barrel on Monday, in line with the 20 per cent drop for West Texas Intermediate.Canadian producers, particularly those focused in the higher-cost oilsands, have spent years trying to make their operations more efficient. They’ve also curtailed capital spending and worked to repair their balance sheets. Now those efforts will be put to the test.“At these commodity prices, nobody is making money and everybody is going to be free cash flow negative,” said Laura Lau, chief investment officer at Brompton Corp. in Toronto. “It’s going to be tough.”The oil decline hammered Canadian energy stocks. The 30-company S&P/TSX energy index plunged as much as 22 per cent Monday, its biggest intraday decline in Bloomberg data stretching back to 1988. Among the biggest decliners were Cenovus Energy Inc., which dropped as much as 49 per cent, and MEG Energy Corp., which tumbled as much as 47 per cent.To be sure, the long period of retrenchment leaves some Calgary-based producers better prepared for the current crisis than they were for the 2014 crash, which saw U.S. crude prices plummet from above US$100 a barrel in July 2014 to about US$26 less than two years later.For example, Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest integrated oil company, last month reported a cash operating cost of $28.55 per barrel in its oilsands operations last quarter, down 17 per cent from five years ago. The company has net debt of 1.22 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, down from 1.49 times in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. had adjusted cash production costs of $21.05 a barrel in 2018, down 43 per cent from $37.18 in 2014. The company had net debt of two times its Ebitda at the end of last year, down from three times in 2015.Canadian energy companies “are better equipped today than their U.S. counterparts,” Darrell Bishop, an analyst at Haywood Securities, said in a note. “While in 2014, U.S. companies levered up with higher-yield debt for growth, Canadian companies cut spending and growth plans and focused on getting balance sheets in order.”However, it remains to be seen how deep the current decline will go and how long it will last. Any severe, prolonged downturn in prices would hurt Canada, which depends on the energy industry for about 10 per cent of gross domestic product and a fifth of its exports.Oilsands producers will rarely shut in operations amid depressed prices because many of their costs are fixed and shutdowns can damage reservoirs. Some may try to prolong maintenance work on their facilities while prices are depressed but they have cut operating costs about as much as they can since the last downturn, Mark Oberstoetter, lead analyst for upstream research at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Calgary, said by phone.Oil prices this low will hurt other oil countries, including the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia, Randy Ollenberger, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg Television. About a third of U.S. exploration and production companies need WTI prices of US$55 a barrel to break even, and with prices at their current levels — WTI was trading at about US$33.50 at 11 a.m. Eastern time — some of those companies may go under, sowing the seeds of a price recovery, he said.“The industry simply doesn’t work at these prices,” Ollenberger said. “I don’t just mean U.S. shale or Canadian oilsands. I mean the industry globally doesn’t work at these prices.”Bloomberg.com"

Monday’s plunge in oil prices is sending them back to the drawing board to consider a much more dire situation. The country’s five largest banks will release updated forecasts in the next few days that will show a significantly weaker growth picture.“It’s very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth,” Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a phone interview. Besides the shock from lower oil prices, the financial market pressures and confidence impacts from coronavirus are “quite a lot to bear” if sustained, Caranci added.The oil crisis could be the last straw for the Canadian economy which was already on soft footing at the end of 2019, after a drop in exports and business investment resulted in the slowest quarterly pace of growth in three years. Now the oil shock has created more downside risk.Some economists are even flirting with the idea of a recession.It's very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth“Given market developments in the last couple of days, the likelihood of a recession has increased dramatically,” Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said by phone.As recently as last month, the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for growth of 1.6 per cent in 2020 — in line with what the federal government has been projecting in its fiscal outlook. That forecast was slashed last week to about 1 per cent on the back of the fallout from the coronavirus. The impact of this week’s oil shock is set to drive it even lower.Stocks dropped as much as 10 per cent early Monday in Toronto, the loonie weakened and government bond yields plunged as investor pessimism deepened. Canada exported just over $80 billion (US$59 billion) in crude oil and bitumen in 2018, when benchmark oil prices averaged US$57 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude for April slumped as much as 34 per cent to US$27.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before paring losses to 19 per cent.The Bank of Canada lowered interest rates last week in an attempt to stimulate growth. The outcome for the economy in 2020 may hinge on what the federal government does to bolster consumer and business confidence.Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week the government has the tools to shield the economy from the coronavirus crisis, though he stopped short of spelling out specific steps. With the federal budget expected within weeks, Morneau said the government plans to increase the amount it sets aside for emergencies.To be sure, Canada’s oil sector isn’t as large as it used to be, so the impact of lower prices may not be as dramatic. And the industry already underwent a significant adjustment after the rout in crude markets in 2014-15.“Yes, it’s a negative, that’s undeniable, but the footprint of the oil and gas sector is not what it was back then,” Benjamin Reitzes, a macro-strategist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto.Still, the combination of headwinds could weaken growth to the point where the pain shows up in the labour market. Given Canada’s elevated levels of household debt, that poses broader risks for the country’s financial system.According to the finance department’s own sensitivity analysis, a one-year, 1 percentage point decline in real GDP would have an annual $5-billion (US$3.69-billion) hit on the government’s bottom line. That would be on top of the near $30-billion deficit already forecast this year from the federal government, even before any new spending measures Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during last fall’s election campaign.Markets are already anticipating the Bank of Canada will lower interest rates to levels not seen since the 2008-09 recession. Swaps trading suggests the central bank will lower its policy rate to 0.5 per cent over the next six months, from 1.25 per cent currently.Bloomberg.com"

Fellow oil magnate Jeff Hildebrand is also set to fall off the ranking while Lukoil PJSC executives Leonid Fedun and Vagit Alekperov lost a combined US$5 billion.While these energy moguls are taking the biggest shellacking in percentage terms, losses have cascaded across industries and continents.India’s Mukesh Ambani, who began the week as Asia’s richest person, lost US$5.7 billion, and Frenchman Bernard Arnault, chairman of luxury-goods giant LVMH, led Europe’s decliners with a US$4.2 billion drop. Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Warren Buffett are both down US$4.4 billion. Carnival Corp. Chairman Micky Arison’s stake in the beleaguered cruise line operator slid 16 per cent to US$2.1 billion.The world’s 500 richest people lost a combined US$203 billion through the first 96 minutes of trading in the U.S. That’s the biggest daily plunge since the index began tracking the number in October 2016. The losses include declines in publicly traded assets and estimated drops in the values of private companies — as is the case with Hildebrand’s Hilcorp Energy — that Bloomberg calculates using public peers. More than a half-trillion dollars has been erased from the combined fortunes of the top 500 so far in 2020.“The near-term market focus is likely to remain on the virus’s spread across Europe and the U.S., and on stress in the financial markets,” Mark Haefele, UBS Group AG’s chief investment officer of global wealth management, said in a note to investors.Today’s losses could have been deeper, and they still may be before the day is done. Each of the three major U.S. stock indexes opened down more than 7 per cent in the first seconds, triggering a trading halt. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index pared the declines to about 5 per cent heading into the lunch hour as investors absorbed the prospect of an oil price war triggered by the breakup of the OPEC+ alliance and mounting concerns about how the spreading coronavirus will affect the global economy.While about 85 per cent of the people on Bloomberg’s wealth ranking were nursing losses Monday, there were some winners, including the Walton family, as investors seeking safe havens boosted shares of retailer Walmart Inc.China’s Qin Yinglin added US$537 million to his net worth as shares of his Muyuan Foodstuff Co. rose 4 per cent.

Those bets fuelled a rally in U.S. Treasuries, with the rate on 30-year bonds diving as much as 59 basis points. Benchmark U.K. bond yields tumbled below zero for the first time, Germany’s two-year bonds and rates in Australia and New Zealand fell to new lows.The latest frenzy in markets, spurred by concerns over an oil price war between the world’s biggest exporters, prompted the New York Fed to say it will boost the size of this week’s overnight and term repo operations to ensure reserves are ample and reduce the risk of pressures in money markets.“The more I think about it, the more it makes sense to me that the U.S. cash rate will fall below zero some time very, very soon,” said Chris Rands, portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the U.S. tries negative rates, especially with the tailspin in oil now adding to the virus fears.”The spread of the coronavirus and its fallout on supply chains and consumer spending have seen a dramatic repricing of global interest-rate expectations in the past month.

Adding to the sense of malaise, Japan posted its biggest economic contraction in more than five years, while France said its economy may barely expand.Risk assets plunged with S&P futures dropping about 5 per cent to hit circuit breakers, and European stocks plunged by the most since 2016, putting the STOXX Europe 600 Index on course for a bear market. Commodity-linked currencies weakened, with Norway’s krone and Canada’s dollar falling at least 1.9 per cent against the U.S. dollar. Italian bonds plunged, sending the yield on 10-year debt to 1.3 per cent.Meanwhile, the yen and the euro strengthened. And the dollar, which suffered its worst week in two years, was up 0.2 per cent, as soaring demand for U.S. Treasuries canceled out concerns that more Fed cuts would hurt the greenback’s appeal. The dollar has an edge over its peers by being the world’s reserve currency of choice.Treasuries, the world’s deepest pool of haven assets, have been rallying in the past few weeks as the virus wreaked havoc across the globe. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell surprised markets last week with an emergency rate cut of 50 basis points, raising the specter that the virus fallout will be longer and worse than anticipated.The yield on 10-year bonds dropped as much as 45 basis points to 0.31 per cent, before settling at 0.4 per cent as of 11:43 a.m. in London. Most of the German curve is now trading under negative 0.55 per cent, which, together with the euro’s advance, may give the European Central Bank food for thought when it decides on interest rates this week.“We know what the financial crisis looked like, the tech wreck, but this bond rally we’re seeing is just unchartered waters,” said Stephen Miller, adviser at GSFM, a unit of Canada’s CI Financial Group. “A global recession is now a probability, not a possibility.”Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said Friday that policy makers should be allowed to buy a broader range of assets if they lack sufficient ammunition to fight off a recession with interest-rate cuts and bond purchases.And money managers are expecting the Reserve Bank of Australia to turn to QE as soon as the middle of the year, while bets are increasing for the Bank of Japan to ease this month.“The market is panicking,” said Shinji Hiramatsu, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Position adjustment, loss-cut buying and all sorts of buying are emerging. Everybody’s buying Treasuries.”Bloomberg.com"

Analysts speculate the volatility is being caused by investors who need to mitigate losses elsewhere, and therefore are booking recent profits in bullion.“Gold is seesawing as some investors were apparently forced to sell it to cover losses elsewhere,” said Daniel Briesemann, an analyst at Commerzbank AG.Gold jumped as much as 1.8 per cent in the Asia morning, but gave up most of the rally later in the day. Spot bullion was up 0.3 per cent at US$1,678.69 an ounce as of 11:25 a.m. in London.

Platinum lost 3.4 per cent and palladium sank 5.5 per cent.The consensus is that gold will keep climbing. Prices could rally toward US$1,800 within weeks, according to UBS Group AG’s wealth-management unit.With back-to-back hits from the virus-driven slowdown and tanking crude, all eyes are on what the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve will do to defend inflation expectations, said Wayne Gordon, executive director for commodities and foreign exchange at the bank.The clearest sign that investors are still bullish: gold-backed exchange-traded funds are continuing to absorb cash. Bullion funds increased last week by the most since September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Markets are concerned that “we could see a more ugly situation before things get better, which of course is good news for gold,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.Bloomberg.com"

Brent crude tumbled by almost a third to US$31 a barrel on Monday, as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. told clients it could quickly dip into the US$20s.Such an extraordinary slump, if sustained, would savage national budgets from Venezuela to Iran, threaten the heartland of America’s shale revolution and upend politics around the world. For central bankers, the prospect of destabilizing prices are an added complication as they try to model the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the economy. And a long period of cheap oil prices could even hurt the fight against climate change by slowing the transition to renewable energy.“Something like this could have more global repercussions than a trade war between China and the U.S. because oil touches so many things in the world economy,” said Rohitesh Dhawan, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group in London.There are winners from rock-bottom oil prices — among them China, the world’s largest oil importer, whose recovery from the virus will be key for the global economy.Something like this could have more global repercussions than a trade war between China and the U.S. because oil touches so many things in the world economyBut this time is different. The U.S. — once a winner from low oil — is now an exporter rather than a buyer. And the hit to economic demand from the virus dulls the impact of any stimulus that cheap oil might provide. Oil shocks — on the way up — used to be feared for their impact on inflation. Now in a world where central bankers desperately pursue price growth, the opposite dynamic is at play.“Lower oil prices will still not get people back in trains, planes, and automobiles, and stimulating the economic sectors most heavily hit,” said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist with Axicorp Ltd. “But now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdown.”The crisis was precipitated when Russia refused to yield to a Saudi-led gamble to force Moscow to join OPEC in production cuts. OPEC presented a take-it-or-leave-it plan to slash production and throw a floor under prices. But Russia had another idea: its strategy was to squeeze American shale producers, which have flooded the market in recent years as OPEC+ nations held back their own production.Now many of those U.S. operators will be losing money on every barrel of oil they produce and, unless there’s a dramatic recovery in the price, face bankruptcy. Even before Friday’s catastrophic meeting, banks were expected to restrict lending to shale drillers and a chunk of high-yield energy debt is already trading at distressed levels.The last bust in the U.S. shale industry — when prices went as low as US$26 — contributed to a manufacturing recession in 2016, when industrial regions, many in states likely to swing this year’s presidential election, saw a slowdown in orders from new shale oil projects.Now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdownRussia was willing to walk away from talks with OPEC in order to hurt U.S. rivals as it’s more resilient to lower prices. It has a floating currency — unlike Saudi Arabia — and can sustain its budget with lower oil revenues.“Russia and President Putin are in a better position to fight this war than is Saudi Arabia or its Crown Prince,” said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro Advisory, a Moscow-based consultancy.The threat of economic — and even political — self-harm didn’t dissuade Saudi Arabia from launching a price war on Saturday in response to Russia’s refusal to cut production. But crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will see his plan to retool the economy undermined as he moves to cement his political dominance.Saudi Aramco — the national oil company listed on the stock market last year in a deal that put the prince’s credibility on the line — saw its shares plunge 9 per cent on Sunday and another 10 per cent on Monday in a sign of the instability ahead.“Oil prices at sustained lows of US$40 for five years is crisis time in Oman first, then Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, with defaults, peg devaluations, hefty spending cuts and higher taxes, with deep recessions and insolvent banks,” said Rory Fyfe, chief economist at MENA Advisors. At US$20, it would force political change in Saudi Arabia and the region, he said.The crash means Gulf powers may also end up with less cash to spend on conflicts in the wider region, according to Steffen Hertog, a Gulf specialist at the London School of Economics. That could favour Russia, which has been playing an increasingly prominent role in the region.More immediate will be the shock to oil majors such as BP Plc, and their response will have ramifications well beyond their investors. Chief Executive Bernard Looney is trying to transform his company in the face of climate change, while also reducing debt and maintaining a generous dividend.The payout is all but sacred — as it is for Royal Dutch Shell Plc — though market gauges already indicate investors doubt it’s sustainable. Looney vows he can maintain the dividend and become a greener company at the same time, though he underlined last month the need for a healthy oil and gas business to fund the transition. A price crash will push balance sheets to the limit.“Sharply lower oil prices for a sustained period with a concurrent OPEC+ driven supply shock and virus demand shock almost certainly means oil majors’ energy transition plans and climate ambitions will be obstructed or slowed, at least in the near-term,” said Will Hares, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “In the face of oil at US$40 or lower, these companies will be battening down the hatches. The first priority is protecting the dividend.”The crash imposes another body blow for credit markets, thanks to the energy industry’s outsize share of U.S. high-yield securities. America and Europe were already shutting down to new debt issuance, and the oil crisis now threatens to trigger an outright funding squeeze should distressed borrowers prove unable to roll over maturing debt. Premiums on U.S. junk bonds soared last week to 550 basis points over Treasuries, the highest since 2016.A slowdown in green plans isn’t the only risk the price crash could pose for the transition to a cleaner economy. Cheap fossil fuels tend to encourage their use — increasing emissions — and dissuade users from switching to alternatives.On the flip side, lower oil prices could allow governments to cut subsidies and increase taxes on fossil-fuel consumption and use revenues to invest in renewable projects, said Ivetta Gerasimchuk at the International Institute for Sustainable Development. And for Europe — which is leading the charge on climate change policies — the impact of cheap oil is still an economic boost, potentially giving governments more room to fund green projects.The key question is how long the rout continues. OPEC+ members appear to be keeping the channels of communication open and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the alliance wasn’t dead even as he swept out of Vienna on Friday, leaving his counterparts in shock. But each side wants the other to blink first.“The Saudi intention is to force Russia back to the negotiating table by engineering an oil price collapse. Most structural indicators suggest, however, that Russia is more resilient to lower oil prices than Saudi Arabia, so it’s not clear this will work,” said the LSE’s Hertog, author of ‘Princes, Brokers, and Bureaucrats: Oil and the State in Saudi Arabia’.“In the end, this will be Putin’s decision, but we could be in for a lower-for-longer oil price scenario.”Bloomberg.com"

As the global oil benchmark plummeted to as low as US$31.02 a barrel, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned prices could drop to near US$20 a barrel.The cataclysmic plunge will resonate through the energy industry, from giants like Exxon Mobil Corp. to smaller shale drillers in West Texas. It will hit the budgets of oil-dependent nations from Angola to Kazakhstan and could also reshape global politics, eroding the influence of countries like Saudi Arabia. The fight against climate change may suffer a setback as fossil fuels become more competitive versus renewable energy.“It’s unbelievable, the market was overwhelmed by a wave of selling at the open,” said Andy Lipow, president of Houston-based energy consultancy Lipow Oil Associates LLC. “OPEC+ has clearly surprised the market by engaging in a price war to gain market share.”Hammered by a collapse in demand due to the coronavirus, the oil market is sinking deeper into chaos on the prospect of a supply free-for-all. Saudi Arabia slashed its official prices by the most in at least 20 years over the weekend and signalled to buyers it would ramp up output — an unambiguous declaration of intent to flood the market with crude. Russia said its companies were free to pump as much as they could.Aramco’s unprecedented pricing move came just hours after the talks between Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies ended in dramatic failure. The breakup of the alliance effectively ends the cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia that has underpinned oil prices since 2016.The state-owned Saudi producer has privately told some market participants it plans to raise output well above 10 million barrels a day next month and could even reach a record 12 million barrels a day, according to people familiar with the conversations, who asked not to be named to protect commercial relations.Oil prices have suffered massive drops each time that Saudi Arabia has launched a price war to drive competitors out of the market. West Texas Intermediate fell 66 per cent from late 1985 to March 1986 when the country pumped at will amid a resurgence of U.S. oil output. Brent crude briefly dropped below US$10 a barrel when the kingdom had a showdown with Venezuela in the late 1990s.With oil demand already plummeting due to the economic impact of the coronavirus, traders forecast that prices will drop even further. “The oil market is now faced with two highly uncertain bearish shocks with the clear outcome of a sharp price sell-off,” said Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in New York.Brent for May settlement tumbled as much as US$14.25 a barrel to US$31.02 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange, the biggest intra-day loss since the U.S.-led bombing of Iraq in January 1991. It pared some of those losses to trade 22 per cent lower at US$35.39 a barrel as of 8:04 a.m. in Singapore.West Texas Intermediate crude plunged 22 per cent to US$32.22 a barrel after sliding as much as 27 per cent to US$30 a barrel just after the open. Trading was frozen for the first few minutes because of the scale of the loss.While the price crash was dramatic, for oil specialists the movements in time-spreads, options and volatility are just as remarkable. Brent’s three-month price structure widened sharply as oil for prompt delivery collapsed against later shipments. It moved deeper into contango, a sign of bearishness and oversupply, making it profitable for physical traders to buy crude and put it in storage, either in onshore tank farms or at sea on tankers.The plunge in oil also ricocheted across financial markets. U.S. equity futures plunged, along with oil currencies including the Norwegian krone and Mexican peso, while havens such as the Japanese yen and gold jumped. Shares of oil producers got hammered, with Australia’s Santos Ltd. and Oil Search Ltd. losing more than 20 per cent in early Sydney trading.The prospect of another price war is spooking traders who will remember the crash that began in 2014, when an explosion in U.S. shale production prompted OPEC to open the spigots in an attempt to suppress prices and curtail shale output.That strategy ended in failure, with shale producers proving too resilient and Brent crude tumbling below $30 a barrel in 2016 amid a global glut. It was that crash that prompted OPEC to club together with Russia and others to curtail output and help shore up their oil-dependent economies. Bloomberg.com"

The kingdom plans to accompany the price cuts with a hike in crude supply, according to people with knowledge of the situation.Saudi Arabia is now really going into a full price warAramco’s pricing announcement is the first major marketing decision since producer talks in Vienna ended in dramatic failure on Friday, when Saudi Arabia was unable to persuade Russia to agree to prolonged and deeper cuts in output. Saudi production is set to exceed 10 million barrels a day next month, according to the people, who asked not to be named to protect commercial relations. Such an increase would amount to more than 3 per cent of Saudi output in February.“Saudi Arabia is now really going into a full price war,” said Iman Nasseri, managing director for the Middle East at oil consultant FGE.The collapse of the meeting between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its erstwhile partners effectively ends the cooperation between the Saudis and Russia that has underpinned oil prices since 2016. Unshackled from the cartel’s restrictions and with budget holes to fill, there is every chance producers will ramp up output. A reduction in the official selling prices, or OSPs, suggests the Saudis are looking to do just that.“It’s certainly a high-risk, high-stakes approach,” Tim Fox, chief economist at Dubai-based lender Emirates NBD PJSC, said Sunday in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It will be a question of who blinks first.”Aramco’s pricing decision affects about 14 million barrels a day of oil exports, as other producers in the Persian Gulf region follow its lead in setting prices for their own shipments. Every month, the Gulf’s biggest producers announce the official selling price for their crude grades as a differential — a premium or discount — against regional benchmarks. The changes are usually measured in cents and, at most, a couple of dollars.The state producer lowered April pricing for crude sales to Asia by US$4 to US$6 a barrel and to the U.S. by US$7 a barrel, it said in a pricing announcement emailed Saturday just before midnight Saudi time. Aramco didn’t immediately comment on the strategy behind such deep reductions in pricing.With the coronavirus eroding demand, pushing Brent crude down about 20 per cent so far this year heading into the meeting on Friday, the Saudis had hoped to shore up prices. Brent fell further after Russia balked at OPEC’s plan, closing the week down more than 30 per cent for the year.Saudi Arabia pumped 9.7 million barrels a day last month, but with the agreement on output cuts expiring at the end of March, the kingdom will be free to produce as much as it wants. The Saudis say they can pump as much as 12.5 million barrels a day.Aramco slashed its official selling price for flagship Arab Light crude to buyers in Asia by US$6 a barrel, to a discount of $3.10 below the Middle East benchmark. The cuts eclipsed the $1.90 reduction expected by traders and refiners. It also reduced Medium crude to Asia by $6 a barrel, dropping the grade to a $4.05 discount, according to the company’s pricing sheet.Aramco sells most of its crude in Asia, a region that — until the virus outbreak in China — had served as the driver for global growth in energy demand.The company lowered pricing to northwest Europe and to the Mediterranean region by between $6 and $8 a barrel. Aramco made its biggest cut for crude to northwest Europe, where an $8 a barrel reduction in most grades amounts to a direct challenge to Russia, which sells a large chunk of its flagship Urals crude in the same region. Aramco will sell Arab Light at an unprecedented $10.25 a barrel discount to Brent in Europe.The world’s biggest oil exporter had expected to announce its pricing on Thursday but delayed the decision until after the meeting on Friday between the OPEC and allies including Russia. The postponement marked the first time in at least a decade that Aramco missed its pricing schedule. It typically announces pricing for its crude on the fifth day of each month. Bloomberg.com"

However, downside risks to the economy are now “more than sufficient” to outweigh continuing concern about financial vulnerabilities from cheaper money, the governor said.In fact, he flipped the argument on its head — as he had done in his last rate cut in 2015 — arguing the move may actually improve financial stability.“Indeed, declining consumer confidence would naturally lead to reduced activity in the housing market,” he said. “In this context, lower interest rates will actually help to stabilize the housing market, rather than contribute to forth.”Lower interest rates will actually help to stabilize the housing market, rather than contribute to forthIn the decision Wednesday, officials said the virus has driven economic activity down sharply in some regions, disrupted supply chains, pulled down commodity prices and prompted a repricing of risk that has tightened financial conditions. Poloz Thursday put much of the emphasis on a major unknown: the impact the crisis could have on broader confidence levels.“It is possible that the global economy will snap back quickly after the health professionals have managed the situation and conditions have returned to normal,” Poloz said. “However, the outbreak and its effects could be more persistent. Consumer and business confidence could be set back for a longer period of time, causing economic growth to slow more persistently.”Poloz’s speech is what the central bank calls its Economic Progress Report, in which it aims to provide insight into deliberations following the rate decisions that aren’t accompanied by new forecasts.

Bonds continued to rally after the Federal Reserve’s rate cut.The S&P 500 rose for the second time in three days, taking its rebound from the worst week since the financial crisis to almost 6 per cent, after Congress authorized nearly US$8 billion for virus prevention. Stocks opened higher on speculation other central banks and governments would provide stimulus as the outbreak claimed more lives and new cases piled up. Joe Biden’s surprise surge in Tuesday’s presidential primaries added to bullish sentiment. The equity benchmark is still 7 per cent below its February record.Stocks tumbled Tuesday after the Fed’s move wasn’t followed by other Group of Seven nations with rate cuts or fiscal stimulus in the face of the virus’s growing threat to the global economy. But equities got a boost after the Bank of Canada cut its benchmark Wednesday, and amid speculation the Bank of England and the European Central Bank would also take action.Ten-year Treasury yields pushed back above 1 per cent, while two-year dropped to 0.66 per cent. The low rates also helped breath new life into corporate bond deals after a days-long hiatus.Part of the rebound also came from Biden’s surprise win, particularly in corners of the market most sensitive to the race’s outcome. Managed-care providers, threatened by Senator Bernie Sanders’s “Medicare for All” platform, surged, with UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Anthem Inc. each gaining more than 10 per cent.“It looks like a combination of two things: to me, Biden’s showing on Super Tuesday is really an unexpected surprise, a positive surprise to the markets because I think markets always prefer a more moderate centrist Democratic nominee,” Deepak Puri, Americas CIO at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, said by phone. “The other is the G-7 coordinated fiscal and monetary policy easing, which is on top of the 50 basis-point rate cut by the Fed announced yesterday. I think the market was initially a little bit taken aback by the rate cut announcement, but now that it’s had some time to digest, it’s starting to feel that the Fed is going to do whatever it takes to again stabilize the demand and supply shock.”Investors are anxious for promised action by the Group of Seven to confront the virus while they’re buying risk assets on dips and watching the world’s biggest bond market move closer to negative yields. The Democratic contest posed a fresh challenge to Trump as nine states went to Biden, who’s positioned as a moderate against a more progressive Sanders in the race for the party’s nomination to take on Trump in November.These are the main moves in markets:The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose three basis points to 1.03 per cent.The yield on two-year Treasuries fell three basis points to 0.67 per cent.Germany’s 10-year yield fell one basis point to -0.63 per cent.Bloomberg.com"

The Canadian currency extended losses, while stocks initially climbed as traders wagered more rate cuts are ahead.“The BoC statement is really pessimistic,” said Steven Englander, Standard Chartered Bank’s head of North America macro strategy. There was “no effort to sugar coat” the economic downside, fuelling the drop in yields and the loonie.The bank’s rate cut comes on the heels of a reduction from the Federal Reserve as central banks face pressure to act with urgency on a dimming growth outlook. Policy makers cited the spread of the coronavirus as a “material negative shock” after the economy already stalled in the fourth quarter. Swaps traders are still pricing in almost a 70 per cent chance of a rate cut for the next meeting on April 15.Canadian 10-year yields declined as much as 10 basis points to as low as 0.860 per cent. That move wiped out the previous all-time low of 0.908 per cent reached Feb. 11, 2016, according to Bloomberg data going back to 1989. The yield is following the lead of the U.S. 10-year equivalent, which tumbled below 1 per cent to a new record Tuesday when the Fed cut rate cuts.The S&P/TSX Composite Index was up about 1 per cent on the day but lost most of its rally from the interest rate cut.The Canadian currency dropped 0.3 per cent Wednesday to $1.3422 per dollar. The move pushed its slump against the greenback to about 3.1 per cent so far this year.The loonie “has further room to drop,” said Bipan Rai, North American head of FX strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The BOC “was already concerned with respect to consumer confidence heading into this meeting and the dovish guidance points to another cut in April.”The central bank was quick to highlight why a 50-basis-point cut, the first since the 2008-2009 recession, was necessary, saying “the outlook is clearly weaker now than it was in January.”Bloomberg.com"

Uncertainty will remain high as long as the outbreak duration is unknown, she said.“It is, unfortunately, spreading undetected more than initially was thought,” Georgieva said. “The moment it became clear it is no more just about China and maybe a small number of countries in Asia surrounding China, then the outlook on what the impact could be changed.”Georgieva said that the IMF is making available US$50 billion to help countries deal with the virus, including $10 billion at zero interest for the poorest nations. Countries can draw on that money if they need it, she said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television.The shift comes as governments and central banks step up emergency actions to protect against greater economic damage and financial-market instability, with the Bank of Canada on Wednesday joining the Federal Reserve in cutting interest rates by a half point. Global infections have topped 93,000, resulting in more than 3,200 deaths since the virus originated in Wuhan, China.Georgieva said the virus demands a global response as it affects significant elements of both supply and demand, and IMF member nations are committed to coordinated action. She said that the IMF is confident that global growth this year will be slower than 2019, when growth was 2.9 per cent. The IMF had previously seen 2020 growth accelerating to 3.3 per cent.Malpass, who on Tuesday announced a US$12 billion immediate support package to help poorer countries confront the health and economic impacts from the spread of coronavirus, said 12 countries have so far expressed interest in participating. The speed and breadth of the response will be crucial to its success, he said at the briefing.On Monday, the Washington-based organizations pledged in a joint statement to use “available instruments to the fullest extent possible, including emergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance” to aid member countries as they respond to the virus.Georgieva also said Wednesday that the IMF has conducted a dry run for the virtual format that will be used to convene their spring meetings next month with the World Bank instead of holding the conference in Washington.Bloomberg.com"

The legal proposal is the cornerstone of the bloc’s Green Deal, a far-reaching strategy that foresees a radical overhaul of the European economy over the next three decades.“The Climate Law is the legal translation of our political commitment, and sets us irreversibly on the path to a more sustainable future,” von der Leyen said in a statement. “It offers predictability and transparency for European industry and investors. And it gives direction to our green growth strategy and guarantees that the transition will be gradual and fair.”The draft measure proposes a binding target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, without setting intermediate targets at this stage. That triggered criticism of the law by environmental activists, including Greta Thunberg, who called the law “surrender” because it doesn’t ensure more rapid action.The scolding highlights the challenges policy makers face as they seek to balance business interests with the ambitions of an ever-growing green movement. Fighting climate change has catapulted to the top of the EU’s agenda, with 93 per cent of Europeans seeing global warming as a serious problem.The Green Deal was designed to appease these concerns and become a new growth strategy for the 27-nation bloc. But regulatory proposals by the EU’s executive arm are subject to approval by member states, and the climate law reflects the need to seek a compromise between competing national positions. With differing energy mixes, wealth and industrial strength, EU governments are set to wrangle over every bit of the climate strategy and the draft law that will set the basis for the clean-up.However, the dynamics may change with the draft measure. It will pave the way for a new regulatory track where measures to cut emissions avoid a veto by a single country, a tool that was used several times by coal-dependent Poland to halt ambitious policies.Once approved by national governments and the European Parliament, the climate law will start a regulatory frenzy. Everything from energy production to agriculture and the design of cities will be overhauled under the Green Deal strategy that von der Leyen has described as a moonshot.“I’m excited by this,” said Peter Vis, senior adviser at Rud Pedersen Public Affairs in Brussels. “Von der Leyen is setting the ambition without knowing how we will get there. But when Kennedy committed to putting a man on the moon he also wouldn’t know if that is possible.”Here are the main elements of the draft law:The EU executive is also seeking more powers to make sure the bloc delivers on the net-zero emissions goal, making it more difficult for governments and the EU Parliament to object to intermediate targets. It wants to regulate those goals via measures known as delegated acts. To oppose them, a qualified majority of votes is needed in the Council of the EU, which represents member states, and a majority in the Parliament.“Enshrining the climate neutrality goal into law is a crucial and welcome step,” said Sam Van den plas, policy director at Carbon Market Watch lobby in Brussels. “However, the climate law’s success will be determined by how it translates into short-term climate action. Europe faces an existential climate crisis and every year matters to reduce greenhouse gas pollution.”The biggest challenge for Europe will be to secure investment for the environmental clean-up. The costs are dizzying: to reach the existing 2030 goal Europe needs investment of 260 billion euros (US$290 billion) annually.Earlier this year, the commission proposed a 1 trillion-euro plan designed to be the financing pillar of the Green Deal. It envisions earmarking around 500 billion euros from the EU budget for the clean shift over the next decade, while separately leveraging 280 billion euros of private and public investment and establishing a funding mechanism with another 143 billion euros, also from public and private sources, to help regions facing the most costly clean-ups.To ensure the Green Deal materializes to be Europe’s new growth strategy, new markets must be developed, with both public and private finance flowing to small and large companies alike to help them deploy first new technologies, according to director general of the chemical industry association Cefic.“The proposal for a climate law is an important first step to achieve investor confidence, which is crucial,” Mensink said. “It is a start of an important journey; our sector must go through a deep transformation, within only one or two investment cycles, for which we need enabling conditions. Therefore, much more is needed.”Bloomberg.com"

Stocks dropped while the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1 per cent.Bank of America has predicted that the global economy will see its weakest year since the financial crisis as the virus damages demand in China and beyond. Futures markets predict more rate cuts, with the Bank of Canada likely to lower its benchmark rate on Wednesday morning.But Picton sees higher rates down the road. He acknowledges that there will be a “significant interruption” to the global economy, but is convinced it will end quickly and there will be a V-shaped recovery later in the year.The headwinds of the recent past — a trade war, tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and a lack of significant Chinese stimulus — have shifted as policy makers react to the virus threat, he said. When the outbreak subsides, there will be pent-up demand globally for goods and services, he added.That is likely to be a powerful recipe for a move higher in most risk assets, including global equities, Picton said.“The coronavirus might have just delayed a powerful recovery phase that was beginning to develop,” he said. “And then I think there will be a stimulus response that builds an even greater tailwind.”Picton Mahoney was one of the earlier entrants into the hedge fund market in Canada. One of the firm’s oldest funds, a long-short equity fund, returned 8.25 per cent annualized since inception as of Jan. 31, outpacing the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index by more than two percentage points.Picton sees parallels between the current environment and the late 1990s. Back then, a period of turmoil — the Asian crisis and Russian default of 1997-98 — forced central banks to reverse course on a round of tightening.After the Fed cut in 1998, interest rates began rising again in 1999 as the global economy regained speed. Picton thinks the same thing will happen again.That means interest-rate sensitive investments will underperform as the recovery takes hold, said Picton, whose firm has about $7.5 billion (US$5.6-billion) in assets under management. The firm is shorting some rate-sensitive securities and buying derivatives that will pay off if rates go back up.And if its is indeed the late 1990s all over again, how else should investors play it?“The very simple answer is, take risk across all asset classes, understanding that you’re probably in a giant poker game against everybody else who’s doing the exact same thing,” he said.For Picton, the sharp gains in government bonds is overdone and the correction in risk assets, especially in high-yield debt, is reflecting a near-term outlook of negative economic data.There is “so much of a narrative that rates will not go up again that the bond market is somewhat missing on the plain signals that would have been picked up in the past,” he said. “I don’t believe that the bond market’s going to get it right this time, like they did back in 2008 in the last recessionary phase.”One of his top picks is First Quantum Minerals Ltd., which has started the world’s largest copper mine in the Panamanian jungle, in an environment where supply is probably less than demand growth, according to Picton.“Inventory’s already low and more importantly there’s no new projects that you can see on the horizon,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Treasury 10-year yields hovered around 1 per cent after breaching that level on Tuesday for the first time in 150 years.Contracts on the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite rebounded from tumbles on Tuesday, when the 50 basis-point Fed move failed to ease concerns about an economic downturn. Moderate Joe Biden’s surprise comeback hours later in the Super Tuesday race for the Democratic Party nominee took the lead from Bernie Sanders that had unsettled some investors. The Stoxx Europe 600 erased early declines, with utilities and miners leading the advance and all 19 industry sectors in the green.A volatile session in Asia left stock markets mixed. Hong Kong and China PMI data fell to record lows, underlining impacts of the virus on the region’s commerce. The euro dipped after posting its best four-day rally since January 2018. Crude oil gained for a third day.Investors are anxious for promised policy moves by the Group of Seven to confront the virus while they’re tempted to buy on dips in risk assets, all while the world’s biggest bond market gradually moves closer to negative yields. The Democratic leadership contest threw up a fresh challenge to President Donald Trump as Biden, positioned as a moderate against a more progressive Sanders in the race for the Democratic nomination to take on Trump in November, won nine of 14 states as results rolled in.“The magnitude of the market sell-off and the rapid policy reaction encouraged us to recently add to our risk positions” through additional exposure to U.S. high-yield credit versus high-quality bonds, Mark Haefele, UBS Wealth Management’s global chief investment officer, wrote in a note. “Where appropriate, we also advocate options strategies to increase exposure to U.S. equities.”Equities earlier had tumbled after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the virus outbreak will weigh on activity “for some time.” Expectations the Fed may act again as soon as this month show markets remain extremely cautious about the economy’s prospects to weather the hit. Meanwhile, virus infections and deaths continued to rise in China and the U.S.“They’re pushing on a string,” said veteran emerging-markets investor Mark Mobius in a Bloomberg TV interview. “The problem is not so much interest rates, which are already very low globally. The problem is the supply chain coming out of China.” Markets will worsen “unless China can ramp up production,” he said.These are the main moves in markets: Bloomberg.com"

Most segments posted almost double-digit price growth with condos rising about 12 per cent over the year, the board said.The number of transactions jumped 46 per cent from February 2019, which was a 10-year sales low as the market struggled with tougher mortgage rules and higher interest rates. The opposite is happening this year, with mortgage rates declining as bond yields drop amid the coronavirus and the Bank of Canada expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday.February sales were up by about 15 per cent compared to January.“Sales growth will be strong this year,” board President Michael Collins said in a statement. However, the annual pace of sales will likely slow as stronger sales came into effect after the first quarter of 2019.The average sale price for a detached home in central Toronto was $1,184,800 in February, up 8.1 per cent from a year earlier. Condo prices rose 11 per cent to $609,200 on average downtown.New listings rose 7.9 per cent to 10,613 in February from a year ago, not enough to meet demand meaning market conditions tightened considerably over the past year, TRREB said.“Sales growth well in excess of listings growth is once again the norm,” the board’s Chief Executive Officer John DiMichele said.The regional real estate board’s current average forecast is for 10 per cent price growth to $900,000 in 2020, noting that while the outlook represents “a very robust pace of growth” it’s possible that further tightening with detached homes could push overall average selling price above its baseline scenario, the board said. Bloomberg.com"

Fed funds futures are pricing more than a percentage point of central bank rate reductions for 2020, including another quarter-point cut in the first half of the year.The central bank said in its statement that it was “closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.”Powell, in response to a reporter question about the scope for further moves, said “we do like our current policy stance,” before repeating the Fed’s reference to taking action if needed.The Fed’s decision could presage a wave of easing from other central banks around the world although those in the euro-area and Japan have less scope to follow with rates already in negative territory. It came hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would “use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.”The vote for the emergency cut to a range of 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent was unanimous. The Fed also said in the statement that the “fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.”The decision came amid public pressure for a cut by President Donald Trump, whose stewardship of the economy is central to his reelection campaign this year. Following today’s shift he called for more, demanding in a tweet that the Fed “must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA.”The Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!U.S. central bankers were scheduled to gather March 17-18 in Washington. Tuesday’s decision was the first time it had cut by more than 25 basis points since 2008.The reduction marks a stark shift for Powell and his colleagues. They had previously projected no change in rates during 2020, remaining on the sidelines during the election year, after lowering their benchmark three times in 2019 to a range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent.As recently as last week, some officials, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, had indicated they thought it was too soon to respond to the virus. They pledged to monitor the situation, but argued monetary policy was already easy and the fundamentals of the economy strong with unemployment near a 50-year low.But as the number of reported cases of the virus rose around the world in recent days and the U.S. reported its first fatality, traders increasingly bet the Fed would step in. Powell seemed to cement that view with a promise on Friday to “act as appropriate,” which lent some support to stocks.Lower rates do little for factories lacking needed materials from abroad and are unlikely to spur consumers to shop if they’re scared of infection. But they should support consumer and business sentiment as well as ease financial conditions by making debt payments easier to manage and by calming market volatility.Powell has staked his chairmanship on sustaining the expansion, words he has used to describe the essential mission of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s rate-setting panel. Despite the limited ability of monetary policy to ease the impact of a public health emergency, the rate cut could support consumer and business sentiment. Lawmakers are working on a $7.5 billion virus response bill, another reminder that critical fiscal policy can take weeks to move through Congress.One lesson Fed officials will take away from this moment is how rapidly their policy space is used up in a crisis.Total cuts of one percentage point this year, which several Wall Street firms are forecasting, would bring the bottom range of the Fed policy rate down to 0.5 per cent. If the virus impact is worse than expected, or if the economy is hit by a separate shock, the policy rate could strike zero.At that point, Fed officials are left with unconventional tools, such as purchases of longer-dated Treasuries — known as quantitative easing. The effectiveness of such tools when longer-term rates are already low remains to be seen.The Fed is in the midst of a review of its tool kit to achieve its goal of maximum employment and stable prices. They are considering policies such as outcome-based forward guidance, where a policy change would be linked to some tangible metric such as achieving an inflation rate, and yield curve caps.Wherever the discussion lands, the virus has highlighted the need for better fiscal and monetary policy coordination in a time of exceptionally low interest rates, says Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives.The Fed is “carrying the domestic burden and the global burden” because they are one of the few central banks in developed economies that still has rates to some degree above zero, Coronado said. “The fiscal policy response has been lacking. There are people that are going to be struggling to pay their bills and certain workers are going to lose incomes. This is the shock that needs to be insured and we are really behind the curve.”With assistance from Sophie Caronello, Alexandra Harris and Alister BullBloomberg.com"

Lower bond yields amid the virus have allowed Canadian banks to unveil mortgage specials and the government has tweaked its mortgage qualification rules. Meanwhile, markets have begun to price in an interest rate cut from the Bank of Canada to cushion the economic of virus as soon as Wednesday — maybe even 50 basis points.“All of this is great news for housing and the mortgage market — until and unless we see a huge spike in coronavirus cases in Canada and/or a big jump in unemployment,” Robert McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com, said in an interview. “Lower rates are stimulative to housing.”Home prices in some of Canada’s largest cities have already been rebounding after the market slumped through 2018 and 2019. Shrinking supply in Toronto drove prices to their strongest gains in more than two years in January. Pasalis estimates that sales were more than 40 per cent higher in February from a year ago.“We’re back to near all-time highs in some markets, and we’re seeing prices ramp up and bidding wars in hot markets,” McLister said. “Everyone knows exactly what happens in the near term if mortgage rates plunge — that’s just more kerosene on the fire.”Royal Bank of Canada cut some mortgage rates at the end of January and HSBC Holdings Plc’s Canadian division began offering a three-year fixed-rate mortgage special of 1.99 per cent on Monday while lowering its five-year fixed rate for uninsured mortgages by 30 basis points to 2.49 per cent.“This freefall in yields has been stunning — you don’t see this often — and it’s now just starting to translate into meaningful discounting in mortgage rates,” McLister said.Jonathan Bundle, head of mortgages and secured lending at HSBC Bank Canada, anticipates more competition on mortgages ahead.“There’s indication that it’ll be a strong property market this year and because of that you are going to see that a lot of lenders will end up being competitive,” he said.Still, some realtors have reported some early impacts on activity in cities like Vancouver as the coronavirus outbreak in China cut travel demand in the first two months of the year.“Since they’re not coming here for vacation for Chinese New Year, it’s pretty hard for them to make a decision on any property,” Vancouver realtor Jerry Huang said in an interview. “People were planning to do open houses early February and obviously the turnout wasn’t as good because there’s just a lot less traffic.”He estimated a drop of “50 per cent plus” of overseas buyers, especially from Asia, who were going to visit Vancouver for real-estate projects and deals that just didn’t come.Other buyers look to have been making up for that. Vancouver home sales surged 45 per cent in February from the year before and prices rose 0.3 per cent, according to data released Tuesday from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.Kevin Wang, real estate adviser and property manager at W Brothers Real Estate Group in Vancouver, said longer term, buyers from China may have more of an incentive to buy in Canada to avoid future virus outbreaks.The market is so far out of balance that you could lose half the sales and it'd still be really, really busyNeither Ratespy’s McLister nor Realosophy’s Pasalis see the coronavirus as playing a big role in the coming months for housing demand, noting that Toronto’s SARS outbreak 17 years ago failed to dampen sales.“The market is so far out of balance that you could lose half the sales and it’d still be really, really busy,” Pasalis said.Bloomberg.com"

Fed chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference that the U.S. economy remains strong but the virus outbreak will weigh on activity “for some time.”The two-year Treasury yield sunk to 0.70 per cent, while the 10-year plunged below 1 per cent for the first time ever. Banks led losses on equity benchmarks.“Does a 50 basis point cut change things? That’s a tough one to answer,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale. “It could perhaps help the credit markets, especially primary markets that are currently somewhat frozen. But Fed cuts tend to be less effective in situations like this when there is a supply and demand shock.”Investors had piled out of risk assets last week as the spreading virus threatened to derail global growth, only to pour back in Monday in anticipation of concerted action from Group of Seven officials. Oil continued its rebound Tuesday, approaching US$46 a barrel, while gold also rose. The yen was higher versus the dollar.“Moving between meetings with a bigger than normal interest rate cut looks like Fed officials are panicking as much as stock market investors did last week,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for MUFG Union Bank. “They did not need to be so aggressive and the Fed under Powell keeps responding wrongly in our view more to the financial markets than they are to the broader economy. We aren’t in a recession yet and today’s move won’t keep one from coming.”The OECD warned that growth will sink to levels not seen in more than a decade and ever more businesses are warning about the impact of the illness. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the Federal Reserve “should ease and cut rate big.”The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said it would take all necessary steps to help the economy.

It sold $17 million worth of recreational cannabis in the period, up 7.4 per cent from the prior quarter. Its adjusted EBITDA loss of $35.3 million also missed the consensus expectation of $21.8 million and was wider than the biggest estimated loss of $29.3 million.Tilray announced that it closed a $60 million senior credit facility on Feb. 28 with a two-year term and 8 per cent interest. The company ended 2019 with $97 million in cash, a number that has prompted analysts to question whether it has enough funding to support its operations. The company recorded a $68.6 million inventory writedown and a $112 million impairment charge related to its revenue-sharing agreement with Authentic Brands Group.“Between cash we have on hand and that senior credit facility, and then managing our cash burn and other levers to raise capital, we feel comfortable that can manage this to being EBITDA positive in Q4,” said Chief Executive Officer Brendan Kennedy, adding that he’ll continue to look for ways to cut costs and focus on the most profitable areas of the business.Tilray’s adjusted gross margin fell to 29 per cent from 31 per cent in the prior quarter. Kennedy said that was the result of startup costs related to the launch of new products like vapes, chocolates and beverages, and he expects margins to return to third-quarter levels in the current quarter.“The debt raise, while important, will not be enough to overlook a large top-line miss with outsized EBITDA losses,” MKM Partners analyst Bill Kirk said in a note.Other cannabis companies fell in sympathy, with Canopy Growth Corp. down 2.4 per cent, Aurora Cannabis Inc. off 1.5 per cent and Aphria Inc. falling 1.4 per cent.Bloomberg.com"

A doctor in a Colorado ski town is soothing wealthy clients who want a cure. And one New Yorker called up the hospital with his name on it.Like everyone across the U.S., the rich are bracing for a deadly coronavirus outbreak. Ken Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot Inc., watched President Donald Trump’s press conference and wondered if the media was overplaying the risk — but he also made two well-placed phone calls from his winter outpost in North Palm Beach.One was to a top executive of NYU Langone Health, and the other was to a top scientist there. Both were reassuring.“What I’ve been told by people who are smarter than me in disease is, ‘As of right now it’s a bad flu,’” said Langone, an 84-year-old who loves capitalism so much that he wrote a book called “I Love Capitalism!” He plans to come back to New York this month for an appointment. If he happens to feel sick, he will go to NYU Langone, and said he’d expect no special treatment.Some billionaires, bankers and other members of the U.S. elite are calm, others are getting anxious and everyone is washing their hands. But the rich can afford to prepare for a pandemic with perquisites, like private plane rides out of town, calls with world-leading experts and access to luxurious medical care.“It’s been a full-on war-room situation over here,” said Jordan Shlain, an internist and managing partner of Private Medical, a high-end concierge service. The company is procuring hundreds of full-body coverings for work that includes visits in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and New York. “We have to beg, borrow or steal. Well, not steal — beg, borrow and pay.”Tim Kruse, a doctor who makes house calls in Aspen, Colorado, said “the wealthy aren’t going to necessarily have access to things that the common person is not going to have access to.” But that hasn’t stopped them from asking if they can get their hands on a coronavirus vaccine. “The answer is no. They just want to know.”Confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide have passed 88,000, and more than 2,900 people have died. The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment for the illness to “very high.” Fear over the economic fallout has upended global markets, plunging Treasury yields to all-time lows and giving the S&P 500 index its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.One co-founder of a major hedge fund, who asked not to be named discussing his plans, said he’d run in the other direction if his peers start fleeing into doomsday bunkers. He might fly to a house he has in Italy, a country that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises Americans to avoid. Widespread panic, he added, would only make plane tickets cheaper.This is going to destroy the marriages of the richCharles Stevenson, an investor who was the longtime board president at a Park Avenue co-op that’s home to several billionaires, has been staying in Southampton.“I don’t feel concerned at the moment — it’s not near me right now,” Stevenson said. “If people in the village have coronavirus, I’d get out of here.” He’d fly to Idaho and close himself off in a cabin, he said, and his family could join him if they wanted. “That becomes a personal choice of theirs.”Wealthy couples who aren’t used to actually spending time together are in for trouble, according to Mitchell Moss, who studies urban policy and planning at New York University.“This is going to destroy the marriages of the rich,” said Moss. “All these husbands and wives who travel will now have to spend time with the person they’re married to.”Trump has predicted the virus will disappear “like a miracle,” while Democrats outlined demands for funding that include a guarantee of an affordable vaccine. Face masks don’t effectively prevent the public from catching coronavirus, according to U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, though health-care providers are at risk if they can’t get them. “Seriously people,” Adams wrote on Twitter, “STOP BUYING MASKS!”Jewel Mullen, associate dean for health equity at the University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School, said millions of Americans can’t afford to stock up on supplies, miss work or have a steady doctor to call for advice — even on a good day.“Resources like money and transportation and information give people head starts on protective and preventive measures, and can help create more comfortable scenarios for people to cope with disasters,” said Mullen, an internist and epidemiologist who was commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Public Health. “That’s where you really get to see disparate needs.”JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest bank in the U.S., stopped employees from going on any inessential business trips. It joined a string of other corporate giants in restricting travel, splitting up teams and traders to different locations, or quarantining staff. Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive officer, said not long before the announcement that he had dreamed he and other billionaires contracted the virus during January’s World Economic Forum in Switzerland.“I had this nightmare that somehow in Davos, all of us who went there got it, and then we all left and spread it,” Dimon said during the bank’s annual investor day. “The only good news from that is that it might have just killed the elite.” His audience chuckled.Bloomberg.com"

The Paris-based OECD now expects the weakest global growth this year since the 2009 recession, and said a ‘long lasting’ epidemic would risk a worldwide recession.The prospect of central banks’ action helped halt the worst rout in stocks since that crisis. Money markets now see the Fed lowering its main rate by 50 basis points this month, and give a 70 per cent chance the European Central Bank will pare its by 10 basis points.Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted the Fed will ultimately slash by 100 basis points in the first half of the year. The BOE will cut by 50 basis points and the ECB by 10 basis points, it said.There is even speculation that the Fed will move before its policy makers gather on March 17-18, and some economists see the potential for international policy makers to coordinate cuts for the first time since 2008. Investors increasingly bet the central banks of Australia, Canada and Malaysia will ease at meetings already scheduled for this week.“Global central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks,” Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report on Sunday. “We suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.”With interest rates already low, governments may also need to do more to support demand. The French government said on Monday that Group of Seven finance ministers will hold a conference call this week to coordinate their response. Italy is already seeking to widen its budget deficit to pay for at least 3.6 billion euros (US$4 billion) in proposed emergency economic measures.Just a week ago, key central bankers were saying it was too soon to respond to the outbreak, a reticence to act that may also reflect their reluctance to be seen as racing to rescue investors. The plunge in global stocks is forcing a change in stance.“Central banks will almost certainly all induce one form of easing or another, ” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.The Bank of Japan backed up Monday’s promise to help markets by offering to buy 500 billion yen (US$4.6 billion) of government bonds to provide liquidity. Indonesia’s central bank lowered the amount lenders need to keep on reserve to shore up liquidity in its markets.By not alluding to monetary policy as Powell did, Japan’s statement revealed the constraints the BOJ and many other central banks are under. Japan’s key rate is already minus 0.1 per cent compared to the Fed’s 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent range.The ECB is also limited by a deposit rate that stands at minus 0.5 per cent. Prior to the outbreak, policy makers were signalling a reluctance to reduce it even further given concern that banks, who are already seeing profit margins squeezed by negative rates, might pull back on lending.President Christine Lagarde said last week that the ECB didn’t yet think the outbreak will have a lasting impact on inflation, its primary mandate.An ECB spokesman declined to comment on whether a statement would be issued on Monday, and referred back to Lagarde’s comments of last week.“We are vigilant, we are mobilized, but we remain calm and proportional in the responses we need,” Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on BFM Business television on Monday.Even before the latest crisis, economists were questioning the benefits of ultra-loose monetary policies given more than 700 interest-rate cuts and several rounds of bond-buying since the financial crisis. They boosted asset prices, but failed to generate substantial rebounds in economic growth.Lower rates won't help manufacturers whose factories are closedFor central bankers, whose prior stimulus moves have already greatly depleted their ammunition, the new challenge is that easier policy may be even less effective to combat the economic pain posed by a health emergency. That’s because by shutting workplaces in China and increasingly abroad, the virus is dealing a blow to the world’s capacity to produce goods. Lower rates won’t help manufacturers whose factories are closed or which lack materials to make their own products. On the demand-side, they would likely also fail to spur consumers to shop or travel if they’re worried about infection. But easier monetary policies should counter tighter financial conditions, support markets and maintain the supply of credit, thus helping to drive a rebound in demand once the virus is under control. Weak inflation also gives most central banks scope to act.Fresh evidence of the economic shock triggered by the virus came Monday as IHS Markit reported its Chinese factory index dropped to the lowest since the series began in 2004. Gauges for Japan and South Korea also slumped.“Rate cuts are not the silver bullet, although they can support markets somewhat,” said Jerome Jean Haegeli, chief economist at the Swiss Re Institute in Zurich.Governments will likely have to help too. Economists at Morgan Stanley predict the combined fiscal deficit of the four largest advanced economies plus China will now run to at least 4.7 per cent of global gross domestic product this year, the biggest since 2011. Bloomberg.com"

He was 84.His death was reported Monday by CNBC, which cited his wife, Suzy.The former GE chairman and chief executive officer, whose blunt style and ceaseless cost cutting earned him the sobriquet “Neutron Jack,” mentored proteges who went on to run some of the world’s best-known companies. Named “Manager of the Century” by Fortune magazine in 1999, he presided over a stock surge of almost 3,000 per cent during a two-decade tenure.“He became the gold standard of greatness, the icon of industrial imagination,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale University business professor who knew Welch since the 1980s. “His track record over those 20 years as CEO is hard to see excelled anywhere.”Known simply as Jack to even low-level employees, Welch became the youngest CEO in GE’s history in 1981. He created a leaner company, yet one whose dependence on finance would eventually prove to be a threat. Along the way, he molded GE’s culture to reflect his demanding personality, one larger than his 5-foot-7-inch (1.7-meter) frame.“I like challenging people. I like debate. I like all those things,” he told interviewer Charlie Rose less than two months after his 2001 retirement. “And yet I love having a drink with ’em, too.”Welch stepped down four days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He remained active for more than a decade as a consultant and media commentator.Business leaders extolled his ability to boost profit and shareholder wealth with his restless, results-driven approach. GE became the world’s biggest company by market value at more than $500 billion in 1999.Imitators across corporate America copied his leadership strategies, and recruiters snapped up lieutenants including W. James McNerney Jr., who later became Boeing Co.’s CEO, and Robert Nardelli, who ran Home Depot Inc. and Chrysler. Another GE executive, Jeffrey Immelt, would best them to succeed Welch.Welch’s legacy was dented in retirement, as GE’s stock lost a third of its value within a year. The shares would lag behind the pre-Sept. 11 level for virtually all of Immelt’s 16 years as CEO.Soon after Enron Corp. collapsed in late 2001, GE found itself facing accounting questions about whether Welch relied on moves such as one-time asset sales to produce consistently steady profit gains. GE Capital under Welch grew so vast that unit’s struggles in the 2008-2009 financial crisis would imperil all of GE. The company has since exited nearly all of the lending businesses.“There’s been some revisiting of the robustness of the financial services model. GE Capital was providing cover for some other parts of the business,” Sonnenfeld said. There was a “backlash that did dog Jack Welch.”John Francis Welch Jr. was born Nov. 19, 1935, in Peabody, Massachusetts. He was the only child of John Sr., a Boston & Maine Railroad conductor, and Grace Andrews Welch.Growing up in Salem, Massachusetts, he was outspoken and athletic. He played golf, hockey and baseball at Salem High School, where he was voted “most talkative and noisiest” boy by classmates and wrote in the school literary magazine that he wanted to “make a million.” Welch’s mother infused him with self-confidence and helped him overcome a boyhood stutter — “the most influential person in my life,” he wrote in his 2001 autobiography “Jack: Straight From the Gut.”After a close hockey defeat as a youngster, Welch flung his stick across the ice, prompting his mother to march into the locker room, grab him by the jersey and shout: “You punk! If you don’t know how to lose, you’ll never know how to win.”In 1957, he graduated with honours from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst with a bachelor’s degree in engineering. Three years later, he received a doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of Illinois and took a $10,500-a-year job with GE in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where the company developed new businesses in plastics.Working his way through the ranks from vice president to vice chairman, Welch gained a reputation as a maverick, questioning whether GE was being run the right way. He saw GE’s future in plastics, medical equipment and financial services, not household appliances.At 45, Welch succeeded Reginald Jones as chairman and CEO. While GE was profitable, Welch was concerned that it was too big to be flexible. He sorted GE’s divisions into “winners” — those first or second in their industries — and “losers,” mostly older units that had to improve or face disposal.Over a five-year span in the 1980s, he sold more than 200 businesses and closed dozens of factories. Annual dismissals of the 10 percent of employees deemed the lowest performers also became standard. Welch’s moves would shrink the workforce by one-third to 239,000 people.“A successful leader can shock an organization and lead its recovery. An unsuccessful leader will shock an organization and paralyze it,” Welch said in a 1994 Industry Week interview. “Organizations constantly need to be regenerated.”GE under Welch spent more than $25 billion on acquisitions, and he pushed into finance as the U.S. economy shifted away from manufacturing. He looked overseas, too, boosting foreign sales by more than 50 per cent.He pioneered widely imitated training programs, including “Work-Out,” in which employees learned to accelerate decision-making with days of brainstorming. In 1995, Welch implemented the Six Sigma quality controls to improve manufacturing processes. Noting GE’s success, companies around the world would adopt a similar methodology.Welch knew thousands of employees by name and would send handwritten notes to voice his approval or dissatisfaction.“He had tremendous, tremendous passion for the business, but he also had tremendous passion for people,” William Conaty, whose 40-year GE career included serving as human resources chief under Welch, said in a 2014 interview. “If your wife was sick, he’d want to know how she was doing.”Welch also worked six days a week, taking only Sunday off to golf — he called working weekends “a blast” — and expected similar dedication from those who wanted to get ahead. “I never once asked anyone, ‘Is there someplace you would rather be — or need to be — for your family or favourite hobby or whatever?”’ he said in his 2005 book, “Winning.”Welch delayed his mandatory age-65 retirement for almost a year for a final challenge: a US$53 billion bid for Honeywell International Inc. that collapsed when he balked at European regulators’ demands for concessions.A lifelong Boston Red Sox fan, Welch would test executives and potential hires on their baseball knowledge. He was also a golf addict, hitting the links with Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton and executives including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.After leaving GE, Welch served as a part-time adviser, a partner at investment firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice and consultant to companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co. He taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s business school, opened a management institute bearing his name and stayed in the public eye with guest-host gigs on CNBC and New England Sports Network.Welch married Carolyn Osburn in 1959, and they had four children before divorcing in 1987. He was married to corporate lawyer Jane Beasley for 13 years. They divorced in 2002 amid revelations of an affair with Harvard Business Review editor Suzy Wetlaufer that began when Wetlaufer was interviewing him for an article.The two married in 2004 and went on to collaborate on “Winning,” but not before divorce proceedings opened a public argument over Welch’s fortune, with his second wife’s lawyers claiming his asset valuation of US$456 million was at least $100 million too low. The case was settled in 2003.By then, Welch’s retirement package had been shown to include his US$11 million Central Park West apartment in New York City, use of a private jet, a leased Mercedes-Benz, restaurant and laundry expenses, country-club fees and sports tickets. He later opted to pay for some perks himself.With assistance from Heather Burke.Bloomberg.com"

Tech shares led the rebound after seven straight days of declines for the benchmark index, with monetary policy makers from Japan to England joining the Federal Reserve in promising to take action to support their economies if needed.Ten-year Treasury yields pared an early slide to trade little changed, while 30-year rates rose. Oil rallied on expectations that the OPEC+ alliance will deepen output cuts.The stock gains provided hope for investors after last week’s nearly unprecedented rout, even as the S&P 500 Index traded more than 10% below the record it reached just two weeks ago. The coronavirus has already done severe economic damage — with the OECD warning that growth will sink to levels not seen in more than a decade — but investors are betting that policy makers will take decisive action to limit the pain.“Markets are already looking beyond the first half, looking toward the second half to see whether or not we get a recovery in demand,” said Anik Sen, global head of equities at PineBridge Investments, which has about US$101 billion in assets under management. “We’re finding stocks at much more reasonable levels than they have been.”The global death toll from the virus has surpassed 3,000. U.S. cases climbed over the weekend, with the first infections appearing in New York City, Brussels and Berlin, while cases jumped in hot spots of Italy, Iran and South Korea. Positive tests in Italy jumped by more than 500 to 1,694 on Sunday with 41 deaths. Lombardy, the region that includes the financial capital of Milan, accounted for almost 1,000 cases.These are the main moves in markets:Bloomberg.com"

Demand spiked for safe assets from Treasuries to the yen.The S&P 500 plunged 11 per cent in the five days and the Dow Jones Industrial Average careened to the lowest since June, wiping out almost US$3 trillion in value from American equities. Treausires surged, pushing yields on the 10- and 30-year notes to record lows during the period. Oil plunged toward US$45 a barrel in its biggest weekly rout since 2008.“Investors are selling stocks first and asking questions later,” Keith Lerner, SunTrust’s chief market strategist, wrote in a note. “We are seeing signs of pure liquidation. ‘Get me out at any cost’ seems to be the prevailing mood. There is little doubt the coronavirus will continue to weigh on the global economy, and the U.S. will not be immune. There is much we do not know. However, it is also premature to suggest the base case for the U.S. economy is recession.”Canada’s largest stock index flirted with correction territory after plunging for a sixth-straight day, capping off its worst week since the global financial crisis of 2008.The S&P/TSX composite index was down as much as 821 points Friday and closed down 454.39 points at 16,263.05.Treasury yields plunged to all-time lows, with the two-year sinking 15 basis points to 0.90 per cent. Crude hit US$45 a barrel, while gold tumbled the most intraday since June 2013. European shares sank to the lowest since August.Battered bulls got a boost when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is monitoring the virus and will act as appropriate, adding that the “fundamentals of the economy remain strong.” Bank of America strategists now expect the Fed to cut rates by 50 basis points at its March meeting. White House Economic Adivser Larry Kudlow suggested investors “buy the dip.”Banks led the sell-off, with JPMorgan sinking 4 per cent, as travel restrictions took hold and trading floors scrambled for contingency plans if offices are required to close. Airlines tumbled after Lufthansa curbed short-haul flights and United pared back travel in Asia. Terminal users can read more live analysis in Bloomberg’s markets blog.U.S. equity markets shuddered as the World Health Organization raised its global risk level for the virus and a White House official suggested some schools could close. More major companies warned that disruptions could upend sales and profit forecasts. Germany said it will intensify border checks and Switzerland banned large events, leading to the Geneva car show being canceled. Iran and South Korea revealed more infections while the first cases appeared in Mexico and Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.Downgrades to the global outlook keep rolling in and money markets now see three Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year. Bank of America predicted that the global economy will see its weakest year since the financial crisis as the virus damages demand in China and beyond.“Asset prices diverged significantly from growth in the past year, in part because of central bank policy, but also because passive investment’s main signal is price action,” reckons James McCormick, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets. “The COVID-19 escalation runs a real risk of virtuous cycle turning to a vicious one.

While it probably doesn’t hurt to load up on disinfectants amid the outbreak of a potentially deadly virus, using the same logic to buy shares of the company may not be so prudent.The chlorine-based liquid cleaner is getting a rare opportunity to shine, and unfortunately it’s due to the coronavirus scare. Shares of Clorox Co., which is best known for its bleach and disinfectant products, climbed 2.5 per cent to an all-time high this week — and that’s as most of the S&P 500 index fell. In fact, Clorox’s gains have topped all but two other members of the U.S. market benchmark: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. The two drugmakers are working to develop treatments to combat the illness. Until they do, bleach, it seems, may be one of our best hopes.Clorox generates a third of its revenue from cleaning products for household and professional use, and 85 per cent of its sales occur in the U.S. It’s hardly a fast-growing business, nor is it typical to see large fluctuations in demand, except for in the September quarter at the start of the regular flu season. Sales of Clorox’s cleaning products have held steady at US$460 million to US$570 million every quarter for the last four years, averaging US$508 million over that span. Wet wipes aside, it’s a pretty dry business.But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning that the same flu-like Covid-19 virus that crippled China’s Hubei province and is spreading globally could now threaten the U.S. If that’s the case, Clorox may be about to experience a surge in demand. “So far we’re not seeing an uptick,” Clorox CEO Benno Dorer said during the company’s earnings call Feb. 4, which was before the outbreak grew so severe that there was talk of a pandemic. But “we’re getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our health-care institutional customers,” he said. It’s a part of the business Dorer knows intimately, having worked in the cleaning division for years before being named CEO in 2014.The market clearly sees Clorox as a hot commodity. The only problem is that Clorox’s stock is already quite expensive, and it’s not like the sales boost from the coronavirus will be permanent.Clorox trades at 26 times forward earnings, which is 13 per centhigher than its average valuation over the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Price-to-earnings ratios for all the consumer-products giants are elevated, but Colgate-Palmolive Inc., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. are sill cheaper than Clorox on that metric.Six analysts kept their “sell” ratings on the stock after Clorox’s latest earnings report earlier this month, which showed that two of the company’s other product lines — bags and charcoal —continued to prove troublesome. (Nine have a neutral rating, and only two recommend investors buy the shares.) Clorox had mistakenly raised the prices of its Glad trash bags last year to offset resin costs, but its competitors didn’t follow suit and so it lost market share and had to turn to promotions. The company also said retailers have been devoting more space to alternative grilling fuels, an area that it’s beginning to move into as sales of its Kingsford charcoal decline; Clorox even renamed that division “grilling” to reflect the shift.In normal times, when the entire planet isn’t raiding supermarket shelves for bleach disinfectant, Clorox’s growth has to come from demand that it creates by developing new versions of its products. When your main products are things like liquid pipe de-cloggers and grease removers, it’s hard to do much in the way of innovation. (Clorox also owns, somewhat randomly, Hidden Valley salad dressings and Burt’s Bees lip care.)With this week’s coronavirus-induced market sell-off, investors are desperate to grab on to shares of the few companies that could stand to benefit from the outbreak. Clorox may play its own crucial role in combating the disease, but its stock is already overheated.Bloomberg.com"

The bourse said it has undertaken necessary measures to mitigate the risk of recurrence and that the incident was not the result of a cyber-security attack.Exchanges operated by TMX stopped trading shortly before 2 p.m. Eastern time Thursday and did not re-open. The S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 1.9 per cent at the time. Major U.S. benchmarks dropped more than 4 per cent after falling sharply in the last hour of trading.TMX Group will be left with a “black eye,” Thomas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Securities Ltd. and chairman of the rival Canadian Securities Exchange, said in a phone interview. “It’s a terrible thing to happen, particularly in a cataclysmic market that we’re currently experiencing this week that people either want to trade, need to trade, want to get out or want to get in.”Toronto-based TMX had said in a series of tweets that clients were not able to enter, modify or cancel any open orders on the Toronto Stock Exchange or the TSX Venture and TSX Alpha exchanges. At about 3:20 p.m. the company said its markets would remain closed for the rest of the day, leaving traders scrambling for alternatives. The three exchanges had seen 660 million shares traded up to that point, according to TMX Group’s website.High VolumeThe halt comes in the midst of a week-long dive in global markets as anxiety over the spread of the coronavirus weighs on equities. Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem.In the first three days of the week, investors traded an average of 305 million shares a day in TSX Composite stocks, according to Bloomberg data. That is 41 per cent higher than the average daily volume in the three months ended Feb. 26.“I don’t know the inside of what happened at the TSX. What I can tell you is in the last couple of days we have seen a substantial increase in order flow, in our market also,” said Jos Schmitt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., a competing exchange in Toronto. Schmitt made the comments in an interview on BNN Bloomberg television.TMX Group had also halted trading in all equity derivatives on the Montreal Exchange.To be sure, Canadian traders have the ability to divert some of their trades to rival exchanges such as Nasdaq Inc. and NEO Exchange. “Volume does, when it can, move away from our primary market, the TSX, into alternative markets and they can trade,” Diana Avigdor, head of trading at Barometer Capital Management, said on BNN Bloomberg. Volumes can decline due to technical issues “but it’s not impossible to trade,” she added.TMX Group has been hit by outages before. In April 2018, the TSX and its derivatives market shut down for more than two hours on a Friday afternoon. TMX said that failure was the result of a defective storage module.Caldwell said he thinks the event will raise hard questions for TMX Group. “Rest assured the commission are not going to give them a pass on this,” he said, referring to the Ontario Securities Commission. TMX will likely be asked what measures are being put in place so it doesn’t happen again, he added. Bloomberg.com"

None of Canada’s other big banks has achieved such a fevered growth rate in almost two years, with Royal Bank grabbing a greater portion of the $992.4 billion (US$742.5 billion) mortgage market spread among the country’s five largest lenders. Among those companies, Royal Bank’s market share is now 27.4 per cent.“It’s demonstrative of our investments both in digital and distribution and talent,” Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said in a phone interview after Royal Bank reported first-quarter results. “We had been adding resources in the field while some of our competition was reducing their face-to-face advice.”Royal Bank’s push comes as a rebound in housing takes hold. Home prices in some of Canada’s largest cities including Toronto have recently climbed to records amid a shortage of properties for sale. Including lenders outside the big banks, the nation’s mortgage market in December expanded 4.9 per cent from a year earlier to $1.63 trillion, Bank of Canada monthly data show. That marked a rebound from February 2019, when growth was the paltriest in 18 years.Royal Bank has pulled further ahead of competitors including Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal, and even extended its lead over Bank of Nova Scotia, which has been No. 2 in mortgage growth since the latter half of 2018. At Scotiabank, mortgage balances rose 5.3 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest increase in two years.Royal Bank is the country’s largest mortgage lender, based on an average balance of $271.8 billion in the first quarter.“We are bringing a broader spectrum of advice and solutions to our clients, and when we do that we expect to continue to increase market share,” Bolger said, adding that Royal Bank is wooing customers with internet-based tools including OJO Home, an artificial intelligence-powered property search for Greater Toronto, and MoveSnap, an online concierge service for moving-related tasks.The mortgage-growth revival comes as the government tweaks loan-qualification “stress test” criteria and the spring homebuying season approaches. Bank executives, who have spent recent years dealing with the risks of an overheated housing market, are largely shrugging off such concerns this time around.“Sales activity has been solid, price performance is generally up in the market and it doesn’t feel overly frothy,” Bank of Montreal CFO Tom Flynn said in a phone interview this week.At Flynn’s bank, the domestic mortgage book rose 2.9 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest gain since 2017, in what he said was a reflection of healthy market conditions.Toronto-Dominion’s domestic mortgage balances rose 3.5 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest year-over-year jump since 2016.“Definitely the volume of transactions in the market do seem to be picking up and the market does seem to be active again,” Toronto-Dominion CFO Riaz Ahmed said in an interview, adding that he expects “mid-single-digit” growth rate in Canadian mortgage volumes for the rest of the year.Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, once the market leader for mortgage growth, increased home-loan balances by just 0.5 per cent in the first quarter after seeing its book contract for most of last year. Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig promised improved growth by the end of the year as momentum builds.“Our goal is to be closer to market from a growth perspective,” CFO Hratch Panossian said in an interview. “We’re on track with that.”Bloomberg.com"

It whipsawed investors earlier, turning lower late after California’s governor said the state was monitoring 8,400 people for signs of the virus after they travelled to Asia. The decline of more than 10 per cent since last Friday has the benchmark on pace for its worse week since the 2008 global financial crisis and helped push the index into what is known as a correction. The MSCI All-Country World Index fell to the lowest since October, while the Stoxx Europe 600 also entered a correction.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,197.43 points, or 4.44 per cent, to 25,760.16, the S&P 500 lost 137.99 points, or 4.43 per cent, to 2,978.4 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 414.30 points, or 4.61 per cent, to 8,566.48.Meanwhile, trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange was halted due to an unspecified technical issue.Earlier in the day, the TSX fell as much as 585 points due to fears of the novel coronavirus’s effect on global economic growth.“Stocks and bonds say we’re doomed,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for MUFG Union Bank. “Anyone who has a better idea for what lies ahead please let us know because right now the direction ahead for the economy is straight down.”The outbreak has the potential to become a pandemic and is at a decisive stage, the head of the World Health Organization said Thursday. The global economy is on course for its weakest year since the financial crisis as the virus damages demand in China and beyond, Bank of America predicted. Earlier, Goldman Sachs slashed its outlook for U.S. companies’ profit growth to zero. Germany is examining potential stimulus measures to stem the economic impact. Saudi Arabia halted religious visits that draw millions.Haven assets continued to be in demand, and the yen strengthened as yields on 10-year U.S. and Australian government bonds hit fresh record lows. Oil sank further. The pound reversed a gain after the U.K. told the European Union it could walk away from the negotiating table in June if progress isn’t being made toward a trade deal.Investors are pricing in a Federal Reserve easing in April followed by another rate cut in July, swaps data show, while bets for easing from Japan to Australia have also increased after the International Monetary Fund cut global growth forecasts.Losses continue to mount as investors weigh each gloomy headline on the virus. U.S. health authorities on Wednesday said they found the first case of the illness that does not have ties to a known outbreak. Microsoft Corp. joined an expanding list of companies warning over the impact of the virus on operations.“The way the market is going down, it’s happening pretty quickly, but it’s very difficult to say that it’s over,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “Bottoming is a multistep process and you’re probably still in step one.”Bloomberg.com"

With more than 20,000 attendees per year PDAC is a “massive petri dish of handshakes and coughs,” he wrote.Organizers said the conference will continue as planned — with a rigorous sanitation protocol in place. They will be ramping up cleaning and disinfection of things people touch: from door handles, to microphones, to touchscreens.That said, most exhibitors from China were forced to pull out because of international travel restrictions, a spokeswoman said on Thursday. “Others are attempting to make alternative arrangements,” Kristy Kenny said by email. “‘At this time, cancellations by individuals and companies have been minimal.”The virus continues to spread beyond its epicentre of China with more than 82,400 cases globally and 2,800 deaths. The economic ramifications are multiplying. Analysts at Bank of America Corp. said the world economy is now on track for its weakest year since 2009 during the financial crisis and stock markets continue to slump.The virus is disrupting events around the world. Banks are restricting travel and attendees at a derivatives conference in Frankfurt had their body temperature measured by an infrared camera to check for symptoms.Attendance at Toronto’s PDAC event peaked in 2012, at 30,369 attendees, after which a steep downturn in prices knocked back the numbers for four straight years before they began to recover. Close to 26,000 people attended last year’s conference, which PDAC says injects more than US$70 million into the local economy.With gold prices at a seven year high, and miners awash with cash, the 2020 event was shaping up to be a good one. But the mood, among some of those still planning to attend, is less than celebratory.The investor Stein’s LinkedIn post triggered an animated string of comments. “All attendees need to be vigilant,” David Thomas, investment committee member at Resource Capital Funds, wrote. “Regular and thorough hand washing is very important. As for the fist bumps instead of handshakes, I’m more inclined to wave from a distance.”In addition to stepping up disinfection, PDAC will be posting signs “reminding attendees of hygiene recommendations” and making hand sanitizer widely available, Kenny said.“I think anyone who goes is crazy and complacent about the issue,” Alex Black, chief executive officer Vancouver-based Rio2 Ltd., wrote. “Any mining person knows that health and safety are the most important aspects of our business.”Bloomberg.com"

In social media posts, Seagal urged fans not to miss out on the token offering. A press release also identified him as Bitcoiin2Gen’s brand ambassador.He agreed to settle the SEC’s allegations without admitting or denying wrongdoing, and will pay a US$157,000 fine and the same amount in disgorgement, the regulator said.Seagal now lives in Moscow, according to the SEC’s order. In August 2018, the Russian Foreign Ministry named him a special representative to improve relations between Russia and the U.S., according to a posting on Facebook.The actor agreed to let his likeness be used to promote Bitcoiin2Gen’s token after consulting with counsel, according to a Thursday email from his lawyer. Later on, Seagal became concerned that the project wasn’t legitimate and terminated the relationship.“Mr. Seagal cooperated fully with the SEC’s investigation, and this matter is now behind him,” the email said. “He looks forward to continuing his life’s work as an actor, musician, martial artist and diplomat.”Celebrity endorsements of ICOs — in which companies raise money by selling digital tokens instead of shares — became increasingly common as Bitcoin surged to a record high in 2017. All the hype prompted the SEC to publicly warn that pitches could be unlawful if the famous backers’ compensation wasn’t disclosed.In 2018, the SEC accused boxer Floyd Mayweather and music producer DJ Khaled of failing to disclose that they had received payments for hyping ICOs. Mayweather, one of his sport’s most recognizable personalities, agreed to pay more than US$600,000 to settle with the regulator, while DJ Khaled agreed to pay more than US$150,000.Bloomberg.com"

Economic growth in the fourth quarter is expected to be a measly 0.3 per cent on an annualized basis when data is released on Friday, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.While a tentative trade deal between China and the U.S. had boosted optimism, that is fading amid the coronavirus contagion and more disruptions on the country’s rails, this time from protesters opposed to a natural gas pipeline.Corporate executives are only beginning to get a handle on the damage, and much will depend on how quickly the virus can be brought under control so that normal trade and travel can resume. Here are thoughts so far from Canadian companies doing business overseas.Chuck Magro, chief executive officer of the world’s largest supplier of crop nutrients, is watching the impact of the coronavirus “hour by hour.” The biggest effects so far have been on potash, he said.“We believe that the contract negotiations will move now from the first quarter to the second quarter and that’s simply because most of the buying committee, large organizations are working from home,” he said at an industry conference Wednesday. “Our sales organizations in China are working from home. They’re not meeting.”Potash is stuck at its China port because the supply chain is down, he said.“Just a couple of days ago the Chinese government authorized for the first time in five years the use of strategic reserves in potash. We interpret that as an indication that China is worried they don’t have enough potash for the spring season.”In the long run, that will be good for the potash industry as reserves will need to be restored, he said. Agriculture is not correlated to economic growth, he added. “The old adage that people need to eat still holds.”Bad weather, blockades, and the virus created “the perfect storm” for the Vancouver-based producer of coal, copper and zinc and Canada’s largest railway customer, CEO Don Lindsay said.“Commodity prices were negatively impacted by global economic uncertainty in 2019. This has continued into 2020,” he told analysts on Feb. 21. “There were some signs of improvement in December and early January with an agreement on a U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal but then the coronavirus emerged and the full impact of the virus is still unknown.”Before the virus, Lindsay said, the company’s plan was to sell at least one asset this year, possibly using the capital for share buybacks. “With coronavirus still prevailing, I think most people are going to…wait and see how that shakes out. It’s still unknown what the long-term effect is, not just the disease itself,” he said.The miner’s shares are down 39 per cent this year.Most of Lululemon’s 38 stores in China remain closed since first shutting down due to the virus on Feb. 3., though some are coming back on a reduced schedule, CEO Calvin McDonald said.“The safety of our people is our highest priority, and we are adjusting store operations based upon the recommendations of local authorities,” McDonald said in a statement on Feb. 21.The Vancouver-based company’s US$1-billion international sales opportunity is being led by China, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “China’s performance- and sports-inspired apparel market is worth almost US$87 billion, and management aims to connect with 400 million active millennials,” analysts Poonam Goyal and Abigail Gilmartin said in a report.McDonald said he remained confident in the long-term opportunities in China. The company will provide an update on the impact in its earnings report for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Feb. 2. That call is expected next month.The number of cargo planes flying into Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Moncton, New Brunswick, to be loaded with lobster bound for China has dwindled, said Geoff Irvine, executive director of the industry group. While the airports would typically see about nine charter flights a week, that has dropped to one a week in the past month, he said.China has become Canada’s second-biggest export market for live, processed and frozen lobster next to the U.S. While February is typically a slower month for sales, lobster companies are storing the additional unsold inventory or sending it to be processed, Irvine said.“The Chinese in general are not going out to eat so they’re not consuming lobster in restaurants,” Irvine said by phone. “That’s hopefully going to change as they go back to work and the quarantines end.”Canada shipped more than $450 million (US$337 million) worth of live lobster to China in 2019, according to Statistics Canada data.Barrick is benefiting from its experience with highly contagious diseases such as Ebola to help it deal with the coronavirus, CEO Mark Bristow said in comments following a Bloomberg TV interview at a conference Feb. 24.In addition to expanding its health checks across the entire organization, Barrick is increasing supplies of raw materials such as cyanide and cement at its mines, Bristow said. The company will have three to four months worth of those “consumables” on hand, compared with the one-and-a-half months it normally keeps, he said.“The thing about these epidemics is that you have to respond before they hit you,” Bristow said. “We have an emergency action plan.”Bloomberg.com"

Volatility has spiked. And investors have been piling into government bonds, pushing yields to record lows.Anxiety is everywhere for investors in the nation’s markets as the coronavirus outbreak and protests that hobbled rail traffic are magnifying concerns about an economic slowdown.The S&P/TSX Composite Index lost this year’s gain in just four days of trading and plunged even further Thursday — leaving it down about 2 per cent in 2020. It had climbed 5.2 per cent as of Feb. 20.A technical indicator that measures buying strength versus selling strength — known as the Bloomberg Fear and Greed indicator — slumped to the lowest level since the global market rout in the fourth quarter of 2018.The coronavirus continued to spread across the world as new clusters of cases have emerged in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams confirmed Wednesday a new positive case of the virus in Toronto, taking the number of infections in Canada to more than 10.Meanwhile, environmental and Indigenous-rights activists have obstructed rail lines across Canada for weeks to protest the construction of TC Energy Corp.’s $6.6 billion (US$4.9 billion) Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia. That has paralyzed parts of the nation’s rail network in recent weeks, bringing grain movement to a near halt.Now, analysts are expecting profits to slow for the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Almost a quarter of companies that have reported earnings results since Jan. 17 have cited or answered questions related to the virus or rail blockades and its potential impact on profits, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Bank of Montreal, said in a report published Wednesday.Belski isn’t so worried. “While the coronavirus Covid-19 and rail blockades suggest a double hit to the Canadian supply chain, our work shows the overall impact is likely to be relatively minor.” Supply disruptions will present near-term earnings risks, but profit growth will rebound down the road, he added.Market turbulence has surged. Volatility on the S&P/TSX soared to its highest in about six months. For the loonie, three-month implied volatility rose to the highest in almost five months as fears sparked demand to hedge the Canadian dollar’s weakness.Traders are abandoning the Canadian dollar as the viral outbreak confounded global markets, clouding the outlook for the commodity-linked currency. It was among the worst performers of Group-of-10 peers Thursday, pushing it to levels unseen since June.The loonie may continue to fall. Simon Harvey, a London-based market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. and Monex Canada Inc., said that “currency markets may be lining up for another serving of a Poloz special — talking the currency down in order to do the bank’s bidding in the short-run, thus buffering the Canadian economy from slowing global growth headwinds.”Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends going long on the Japanese yen against the Canadian dollar as currency markets enter a “longer period of virus-related uncertainty,” strategist Zach Pandl said in a note to clients Wednesday.His view is based on the expectation that risk aversion will remain high, “dollar bloc” currencies will underperform, and that the Bank of Canada could turn more dovish. Markets are pricing in at least two interest rate cuts from the central bank this year.In fixed income, plunging bond yields boosted gains on government debt while spreads in the corporate bond market increased to their widest since mid-December. That’s another indicator of economic concern. Canada’s 30-year government bond yield fell to a record low after breaching the Aug. 15 floor.“Canadian government bonds offer two important benefits at the moment that are increasingly hard to find in the world today: a AAA credit rating and positive nominal yields,” said Kurt Reiman, chief Canadian investment strategist at Blackrock Inc. “During the latest setback for risk assets, Canadian fixed income has provided important portfolio ballast as interest rates decline — even with interest rates at incredibly low levels.”An aggregate index of Canadian bonds in U.S. dollars returned 1 per cent year to date, compared with a 3 per cent increase for a comparable U.S. benchmark, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. Yet investors snapped up a Canadian issue by Hydro One Ltd. when first sold earlier this week. The notes are trading below their initial pricing as global credit markets grind to a virtual standstill amid the coronavirus outbreak.For Mark Stacey, times like this should remind investors about the advantage of having a balanced portfolio.“While stocks have sold off aggressively, government bonds and many liquid alternative strategies have done just the opposite in recent days,” said Stacey, head of portfolio management at AGF Investments Inc. “By allocating to a range of low and/or negatively correlated asset classes, investors are better able to limit losses from a market correction, and should also be rewarded with reduced portfolio volatility, leaving them positioned to recover any of the losses they do incur more quickly.”Bloomberg.com"

Toronto is dotted with more cranes than any other North American city, and Tiburcio has bragging rights for operating the tallest one.It gives him a killer view of Lake Ontario from a perch 860 feet (262 metres) up, even higher than the condo towers and office buildings nearby. But he’s not getting paid to enjoy the scenery. He’s doing one of the most critical tasks in construction.“It can be very stressful, especially on a big job like this,” Tiburcio said on a break from helping to build CIBC Square, the future headquarters of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “It’s what gets me up in the morning. Every day is something new and every day is a new challenge.”Crane operators have been called the “rock stars” of construction, willing to work for hours in isolation at dizzying heights, manipulating machinery to hoist steel beams and other heavy materials around congested building sites. Demand for the operators is soaring in and around Toronto, where about 120 cranes rise from projects across the metropolitan area.Every day is something new and every day is a new challengeIt’s part of a decade-long building boom in North America’s fastest-growing city that shows no signs of wavering. A surge of immigration has fuelled the market for housing, and a proliferation of condo towers. New office developments downtown, already home to Canada’s biggest financial firms, are drawing tech companies including Google, Shopify Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which is moving its Canadian headquarters from a Toronto suburb to CIBC Square.This winter workday is typical for Tiburcio. He rises in the wee hours for the 50-kilometre (31-mile) drive from his suburban home to reach the job site by 5 a.m. He’s one of about 740 workers building the twin-skyscraper project being developed by Canada’s Ivanhoe Cambridge and Houston-based Hines.Tiburcio spends 20 minutes ascending to the operational heart of a Comedil CTL 630 tower crane. He starts by riding a lift up the side of an unfinished building to an open 46th floor. He then crosses a metal walkway to the crane’s white steel tower, and scales a series of ladders to reach the cab.After doing his inspections, he gets busy. He’ll spend the next eight hours or so in a cramped enclosure, on a padded seat he personalized with a black cover and a yellow, orange and red flame design.His hands embrace a pair of joysticks: One lifts the boom and swings the crane left and right, while the other controls the hoist. Paperback-sized video screens guide his efforts. To his upper left is a monochrome screen showing the crane’s radius, load weight and hook height. Motorola radios dangle overhead, providing a link to workers below.“You’ve got many trades that need the crane and you’re doing your best to help everybody out and give everybody a lift,” said Tiburcio, a crane operator for 11 years. “Everybody needs to work, everybody has their job to do.”At 49 floors, this is the tallest building Tiburcio has worked on, and he calls it the highlight of his career.But the job hasn’t been easy. When he started on the project a couple of years ago, he worked 70 to 80 hours a week while he and his wife faced the demands of being first-time parents. Things eased up when relief operators were brought in, giving Tiburcio the chance to spend more time with his son, who’s now a toddler and thinks Dad has the coolest job.“He already knows all about tower cranes,” Tiburcio said.The Toronto native knows about fatherly influence: He followed his own dad into construction, spending three years as a labourer. When he was ready for a change, Tiburcio’s boss at the time told him about the demand for tower crane operators. He’s had steady work since making the transition, and makes a six-figure salary.As he mans his controls, Tiburcio takes time to scan his 360-degree view and tally the cranes around him. He counts 40 — assurance that work won’t dry up when this current job is done.“There are plenty more projects coming up.”Bloomberg.com"

Now, investors are shunning it.Air Canada lost $3.9 billion (US$3 billion) in market capitalization from its January peak, making it the worst-performing airline on the Bloomberg World Airlines Index this year. Its shares have slumped 28 per cent on deepening fears that the spread of the coronavirus will hinder travel.On Tuesday, the carrier extended the cancellation of all flights between Canada and China to April 10 over concerns about the virus known as Coved-19. It also stopped daily non-stop flights between Toronto and Hong Kong until April 30 due to reduced market demand.New clusters of cases have emerged in Italy, Iran and South Korea. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Americans should prepare for significant disruptions to daily life if the coronavirus begins to spread locally in the U.S. Donald Trump’s administration was also considering whether to adopt more restrictions on air travel because of the outbreak, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said.United Airlines Holdings Inc. — the biggest U.S. airline to China before American carriers temporarily suspended flights — withdrew its 2020 profit forecast late Monday, citing uncertainty from the virus.Last year, Air Canada won the global equity crown among airlines after rising 87 per cent with plans accelerate its global presence in leisure travel with the acquisition of tour operator Transat AT.Revenue from outside Canada grew to 64 per cent of total sales last year from 59 per cent in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About one-fifth of the airline’s capacity is on Pacific routes.In its fourth quarter results last week, Air Canada reported earnings per share that missed the lowest analyst estimate. The airline’s outlook for the year saw first quarter Ebitda come in about C$200 million lower from the prior year, assuming its mainland China and Hong Kong services will fully recover by the third quarter and that the Boeing 737 Max aircraft will gradually return to services in that period.Air Canada still has a positive longer-term outlook despite facing near-term pressure from coronavirus risk, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce analyst Kevin Chiang wrote in a report published Tuesday. He sees the recent sell-off as “further buying opportunity” for investors.The stock has 14 buy recommendations, two hold ratings and none of the analysts covering the company believes investors should sell the shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Bloomberg.com"

That indicates that the concerns are mostly for the short term —at least for now.Outwardly, of course, it hasn’t been a good week for bulls as worries about the spread of the coronavirus outside of China increase. The Cboe Volatility Index closed Tuesday at 27.85, its highest level since December 2018, when turmoil in Washington and concerns that Federal Reserve policy might be too hawkish sent stocks tumbling, though it fell 5.9 per cent to 26.21 as of 8:20 a.m. in New York on Wednesday. The S&P 500 Index itself has lost 7.2 per cent in the past four days, its worst such performance since Christmas Eve that year.Wu Silverman also notes that some investors have been selling near-the-money put options to fund levered multiples of tail puts.The other big thing she is watching: factor performance, particularly in stocks with positive price momentum and those seen as having relatively low valuations. So far, she sees momentum continuing to do well — which is consensus positioning — but on Feb. 20 she recommended trades like buying call options on the iShares Russell 2000 exchange-traded fund to position for a potential change to value.“If we start to see a rotation here, then it flags a major shift in the market’s concerns for growth,” she said Tuesday.Bloomberg.com"

Lee Partners, it said in a statement Tuesday. Mondelez paid about $1.2 billion for Give & Go., people with knowledge of the matter said.Representatives for Mondelez and Thomas H. Lee declined to comment on the terms. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, according to the statement.“We are passionate about the consumer and this acquisition is very much on trend,” Glen Walter, president of North America for Mondelez, said in an interview. “We are very passionate about the on-the-go snack.”Give & Go’s management will hold a minority stake in the Ontario-based company. Its headquarters will remain in Canada and all of its products will continue to be made at their current locations.The Give & Go deal reflects a dual strategy for Mondelez, which like other snack makers is building on the popularity of the indulgent food category while also responding to consumer demand for healthier treats, including vegan options.In July, Mondelez acquired a majority interest in Perfect Snacks, a maker of nut-butter based protein bars. Mondelez’s Cadbury business is developing a plant-based version of its flagship Dairy Milk chocolate brand, The Telegraph reported in February.Mondelez should be able to build on solid distribution that Give & Go brands have in North America to accelerate sales, said Jennifer Bartashus, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.“This acquisition is a good fit for Mondelez, because it brings a couple of well-known brands into the overall portfolio in categories that complement the company’s core strength in cookies, crackers and chocolate,” Bartashus said.Most of Give & Go sales fall into categories with stronger growth and margin profiles than some parts of Mondelez’s portfolio such as gum and powdered beverages, she said.Give & Go’s scale and high single-digit growth will give Mondelez an entry into the bakery and pastries, Wells Fargo & Co. analysts wrote in a note Tuesday.“Over time we think capabilities exist to extend Mondelez’s existing brands into new formats,” they said.Thomas H. Lee Partners bought Give & Go in 2016 from Omers Private Equity. The bakery acquired Create-A-Treat Ltd., Nafta Foods & Packaging Inc. and Uncle Wally’s Bake Shoppe during the firm’s ownership.Mondelez shares have climbed 21 per cent in the past year. They fell 1.1 per cent to US$57.11 at 3:23 p.m. in New York trading Tuesday. The S&P 500 Packaged Foods Index, in which Mondelez has about 30 per cent weighting, was down 1.8 per cent.Bloomberg.com"

Their cumulative return in 2019 was 273 per cent.It’s early in the year to be tallying gains and losses, but it’s the abrupt reversal of sentiment that’s startling. Investors won’t know the exact cost of the coronavirus, both in human and economic terms, for months. But they know the illness is now spreading fast outside China, and that the headwinds will hit an aging global business cycle and a U.S. equity bull market that has outlasted all others.“Given where we are in markets, given where we are in the cycle in 10 years, anything that’s negative in markets they’re going to jump,” said Philip Webster, director of European equities at BMO Global Asset Management in London. “Investors shoot first and ask questions later at the moment.”The scorecard reflects those kinds of concerns. Industrial raw materials — the ones most exposed to the business cycle — have been hammered. Shares of companies, particularly in the riskier developing world, have tanked.At the other end of the spectrum, the ultimate safe havens for an economic downturn — gold and Treasuries — are winning in 2020, alongside high-quality American corporate debt. The preference for these dollar-denominated assets has also given wings to the greenback.These are the big survivors of the everything rally. For much of 2019, U.S. bonds and gold rallied on the back of a central bank pivot toward easier policy at the start of the year. Now, expectations that more rate cuts or stimulus will be needed to combat the impact of the coronavirus are further stoking those kinds of bets.“Bond yields have stayed low, stimulus is there, rates are still being held down,” said Webster. “Yes, there’s been a shift out of equities into non-risk assets, but I’m fairly relaxed” about where the portfolio is, he said.Overlaying the Gregorian calendar on asset moves can be deceptive, of course. Any investor or trader whose performance isn’t measured annually may look at the picture very differently. For example, even with the turmoil of the past four trading sessions in U.S. stocks, an investor who bought the S&P 500 Index 12 months ago would still be up 12 per cent through Monday.On Wednesday morning stocks in particular appeared to be making fresh efforts to stabilize. Futures for the benchmark U.S. gauges fluctuated, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index clawed back well over half of its earlier losses. Market players are scrambling to figure out whether the virus will be contained and a V-shaped recovery will ensue, or if the impact will be lengthy leading to more L-shaped economic performance.“It’s a bit early to know which will be the scenario,” said Denis Panel, head of the multi-asset, quantitative and solutions group at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “We’re in a situation where we could increase the risk — the V — or we could reduce the risk and short the market potentially if it’s an L scenario. It’s quite an interesting time.”Bloomberg.com"

That follows a rapid increase in cases from Italy to Iran and Japan, with a growing list of companies warning that profits will suffer as economies around the world suffer. The S&P, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite indexes all set record highs this month.Wall Street’s three major stock indexes fell 3 per cent as the coronavirus spread further around the world and officials described it as “a rapidly escalating epidemic,” a day after the S&P 500 and the Dow Industrials’ biggest daily decline in two years. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to a record low of 1.3055 per cent as investors sought shelter from the virus’s impact on the outlook for growth.

It had sought to raise as much as US$2.1 billion at the top end of its marketed range of US$20 and US$24 a share. But banks running the IPO only got support for the offering at about US$18 a share, according to people familiar with the matter then.Prior to that, it scrapped plans to raise money via an IPO in 2018 after getting backing from BC Partners and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan to recapitalize GFL instead. It had aimed to raised as much as $1 billion through a share sale, people familiar with the plan said in January 2018.Chief Executive Officer Patrick Dovigi founded GFL in 2007 and has made over 100 acquisitions since, the largest being the US$2.8 billion purchase of Waste Management Industries USA Inc. in 2018. The company has yet to turn a profit and has racked up debt to fuel those purchases — $7.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The IPO is being led by banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of Montreal, Goldman Sachs Group, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia. Other banks involved in the proposed offering include Barclays Plc, BC Partners, Raymond James Financial, Stifel Financial Corp., Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of America, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, HSBC Holdings Plc and National Bank of Canada.Shareholders include Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, BC Partners and GIC Private, the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore.GFL has facilities across Canada and in 23 U.S. states, serving more than 4 million homes. The company, which has more than 11,500 employees and 135,000 business customers, provides services including solid-waste hauling, soil remediation and liquid-waste management.Bloomberg.com"

The central bank is now actively developing a prototype digital currency, according to a background document.“We need to move forward to work out what a potential CBDC might look like and how it could be managed, if the decision were ever taken to issue one.” Lane said regarding preparations for a potential central bank digital currency in Canada.Central banks around the world are trying to get to grips with emerging payment technologies. Private-sector initiatives such as Facebook Inc.’s Libra are adding urgency to the debate over how digital currencies should be handled.The Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund have called for central banks to at least study the possibility of as private sector firms experiment with competing units of exchange.The Bank sees two main scenarios where the central bank could see the need to issue its own digital currency: firstly, if the use of cash is restricted or eliminated, and second, if private cryptocurrencies were to make serious inroads.“In both scenarios, there would be an argument for the Bank of Canada to step in,” said Lane. “The Bank would do this as a trusted public institution, creating an official digital currency that is designed with the interest of the public as its top priority, with no commercial motive.”It isn’t the Bank of Canada’s first foray into the matter — staff have authored several papers on the potential effects of introducing a central bank digital currency, including the possibility of reduced market power of private banks. However, the central bank is shifting to the development of an actual prototype, though it could still be years away from being ready, and will still need a legislative framework.“If one or more alternative digital currencies threatened to become used widely as an alternative to the Canadian dollar”  then a central bank issued digital currency could be used to defend monetary sovereignty, the Bank said. Bloomberg.com"

No terms were given.Shares tumbled as much as 42 per cent, the most ever, to 25 US cents in Toronto on Tuesday.Green Growth had previously positioned itself as a CBD retailer, touting its mall kiosks and its partnerships with the likes of Abercrombie & Fitch Co., DSW shoe stores and Authentic Brands Group.It also made a splashy attempt to enter the Canadian cannabis industry with a $2.4-billion hostile bid for Aphria in January 2019 after a short-seller attack triggered a plunge that erased more than half of Aphria’s market value. Since then, Aphria has posted three consecutive quarters of Ebitda profitability.Green Growth remains confident in the future potential of CBD, but “with high potential in the future comes material overhead costs and other obligations in the near term,” CEO Peter Horvath said in a statement. “These near-term overhead costs and other obligations, together with constraints on liquidity, have posed significant challenges that have hindered us from growing the CBD business to its full potential.”Green Growth reported a net loss of US$34.8 million for the quarter ended Dec. 28. The company declined further comment.Under the so-called stalking horse agreement with BRN, Green Growth will enter into a 30-day “go shop” period during which it can actively solicit other offers. The company will hold as much as a 20 per cent carried interest in the CBD business after the deal closes.Holders of US$23.7 million of 8 per cent convertible debentures maturing Oct. 18 have agreed to extend the maturity to 2024, lower the interest rate to 5 per cent and reduce the conversion price.

It’s not clear that any other proposed mine would be able to clear the hurdles that felled Frontier in the years to come, possibly spelling the end of an era of megaprojects that transformed North America’s energy landscape by turning Canada into the top foreign crude supplier to the U.S.“This may be the nail in the coffin,” said Laura Lau, who helps manage $2 billion (US$1.5 billion) in assets at Brompton Corp. in Toronto. “I would expect some smaller projects would have a better chance going through.”On top of middling oil prices, a pipeline capacity shortage in Canada and heightened competition from U.S. shale, the oilsands have become a particularly shunned industry in a world of rising concerns about climate change, leading some major funds to divest their holdings. And with speculation oil demand could peak in 10 years or so, companies are growing increasingly wary of committing to multibillion-dollar projects that require decades of operation to pay out.The oilsands of Alberta have drawn the ire of environmental activists because of the region’s vast open-pit mines that require the clearance of forest, produce massive lakes of wastewater and consume more energy than other ways of extracting oil. Refining the sticky, black bitumen scooped from some mines in so-called upgraders is also very carbon-intensive. Newer, smaller projects, while more efficient, still use a lot of energy to extract the oil with the help of steam.While attempts to make Canada’s oilsands into an economically viable source of crude have been ongoing for about a century, the industry experienced its heyday in the 2000s and 2010s, when fears abounded that the world may be running out of crude.Those fears prompted a flood of global investment as nations and international producers rushed to secure supplies. From 2004 to 2014, about $210.1 billion was invested in the oilsands, according to data from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Over those 10 years, oilsands output more than doubled, to 2.2 million barrels a day, and Canada shot up from the world’s eighth-largest oil-producing nation to the fifth-largest.The industry has struggled since global oil prices crashed from more than US$100 a barrel in mid-2014. New pipeline projects were stalled by environmentalist opposition and legal challenges, weighing on Canadian heavy crude prices. International giants including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips sold off oilsands assets. And capital spending in the oil sands fell for five straight years.The situation came to a head in late 2018, when a wave of new production, the shortage of pipeline space and a heavier-than-normal refinery maintenance season in the U.S. combined to cause a crash in Canadian heavy crude prices. That prompted Alberta’s government to implement mandatory production limits that started in 2019 and may remain in effect for the rest of this year.Teck Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay, in a letter explaining the company’s decision on Frontier, acknowledged the project raised broader questions over climate change and how countries’ regulatory regimes should balance resource development and emissions reductions.“The growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved,” Lindsay said. “In that context, it is now evident that there is no constructive path forward for the project.”But the hard economic reality remains the potentially biggest hurdle. Frontier’s 2011 application relied on long-term oil prices over its four-decade life of about US$95 a barrel, a level global benchmarks haven’t seen since 2014. With both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude prices in the US$50-a-barrel range and the U.S.’s Permian Basin continuing to pump more oil, those prices may not return anytime soon.The growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved“This was the last big oilsands mining project advancing in the oilsands,” said Kevin Birn, IHS Markit’s director of North American crude oil markets. “Fully new greenfield ones outside this one, I don’t think there is any.”Analysts had generally positive reactions to Teck cancelling Frontier. Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba said that despite the $1.13-billion writedown Teck would take on the project, “it removes overhanging concerns about the company potentially making a significant investment in fossil fuel amid raising ESG focus.”To be sure, the oilsands industry is far from shutting down. Major producers are generally profitable and producing free cash flow. Capital spending is even projected to tick up this year. Producers are continually developing new technologies and finding ways to cut costs.They can still expand existing mines and are able to add output from what are known as in situ projects, which resemble more familiar methods of oil extraction by tapping underground resources through the use of wells. Those tend to be smaller, cheaper and faster to build.But even those projects are having trouble in the current environment. Imperial Oil Ltd. last year delayed its $2.6 billion Aspen oilsands project, which had been approved and was scheduled to start production in 2022, because of Alberta’s production limits.And with the cancellation of Frontier, there are no major mine projects of the kind that formed the industry’s bedrock. The last big mine to come online was Suncor Energy Inc.’s $17-billion Fort Hills mine, which started producing in 2018.Teck is a partner at Fort Hills and is considering getting out of that investment, too.Bloomberg.com"

This comes after criticism that the policy was too tight and unfairly kept younger, first-time buyers out the market.The gap between the old qualifying rate and the new rate is about 30 basis points, which will allow the median household in Canada to buy $13,500 (US$9,800) in extra real estate, according to CIBC’s Benjamin Tal. That equates to less than a 3 per cent improvement in purchasing power, the bank’s deputy chief economist wrote Friday in a note to clients.“It’s becoming more and more apparent that, short of drastic measures, it’s impossible to fight supply issues with demand tools,” Tal said. “Increased supply (rental or otherwise) is the only reasonable solution to the housing affordability crisis that many Canadians are facing.”While the existing qualification rule, introduced in 2016 for insured mortgages and extended in 2018 to the uninsured space, were effective in restoring balance to a market that seemed to be escalating out of control, a rebound in Canadian housing is underway. Home prices in some of the country’s largest cities such as Toronto climbed to fresh records recently, driven higher by dwindling inventories.It's becoming more and more apparent that, short of drastic measures, it's impossible to fight supply issues with demand toolsTal’s comments were echoed by Neil McLaughlin, group head of personal and commercial banking at Royal Bank of Canada, who said Friday on a conference call with analysts the stress test change will have “quite a minimal impact.”“Our analysis so far looks like it would be about 25 to 30 basis points reduction in the qualifying rate,” McLaughlin said. “That would really translate into a fairly small increase in purchasing power for the average borrower, probably in the neighbourhood of about $20,000, $25,000 on an average mortgage.”He also agrees with Tal on what’s needed to address the affordability issue. “The lack of supply in the major urban markets is still the real focus for where the policy needs to go,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Rejecting the mine would have sparked widespread anger in Alberta, where the mine would have provided jobs and investment; approving it would have alienated the Liberal prime minister’s environmentalist base.However, Teck pulling the application won’t be an unvarnished win for Trudeau. In a letter explaining why the miner pulled the plug, Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay placed the blame on governments, saying Canada doesn’t yet have a clear framework to reconcile resource development and climate change.“The growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved,” Lindsay said. “In that context, it is now evident that there is no constructive path forward for the project.”Beyond the climate-change debate, the economics of the project have changed radically since it was first proposed in 2011. Back then, crude prices often topped US$100 a barrel and fears abounded that the world was running out of oil. Canada’s oilsands, which contain the world’s third-largest reserves, saw a boom of spending as companies and countries rushed to secure supplies.But since then, fracking techniques unlocked massive reserves in Texas’s Permian Basin, helping the U.S. surpass Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s top oil producer. Teck’s application for the project relied on long-term prices of about US$95 a barrel, a level global benchmarks haven’t reached since 2014. West Texas Intermediate traded below $52 a barrel on Monday.The mine would have produced about 260,000 barrels of crude a day, more than the daily oil consumption of Norway. It also would have emitted the equivalent of about 4.1 million tons of carbon-dioxide a year, making it harder for Canada to meet its greenhouse-gas reduction targets.But for Alberta, which has struggled with the downturn in oil prices since 2014, Frontier would have been a boon, creating a projected 7,000 jobs during construction and as many as 2,500 operating positions during its four-decade life. It also would have contributed about $70 billion to federal, provincial and municipal governments through taxes and royalties.Teck said in its earnings statement Friday that it would need to take an impairment charge if Trudeau rejected the mine. The Liberal caucus was divided on the project and cabinet hadn’t made a decision yet, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Bloomberg.com"

In the fourth quarter, Buffett bought shares every month, and has no plans to slow down, if the price is right.“Shareholders having at least $20 million in value of A or B shares and an inclination to sell shares to Berkshire may wish to have their broker contact Berkshire’s Mark Millard,” Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders Saturday. “We request that you phone Mark between 8:00-8:30 a.m. or 3:00-3:30 p.m. Central Time, calling only if you are ready to sell.”Even as Buffett ramped up his repurchases, Berkshire’s massive pile of cash hovered close to a record, totaling $128 billion at the end of 2019.
