The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who’s argued the extradition was politically motivated.“The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,” the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize “the highly political nature of the arrest,” the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn’t attend Meng’s arrest “in an effort to avoid perception of influence.”In filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of “coordinated state misconduct,” describing the handling of her arrest as “so serious” that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting “a political persecution” against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng’s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained“This planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,” the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng’s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — who’ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged. China-Canada relations are in their darkest period in decades after China also halted billions of dollars in Canadian imports and put two other Canadians on death row.Meng is seeking an unredacted version of the memo, along with further documents that Canada is withholding on national security grounds. She plans to appoint a lawyer with security clearance to argue on her behalf in closed proceedings at the Federal Court in Ottawa.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they’re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola’s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.“We had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, ‘You know what, it’s not worth people thinking that we’re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that’s using people’s money,’” Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.“People started bashing us because they said, ‘Oh you don’t have deposits.’ It’s like, good hell, you can’t win with these people,” Milton said. “No matter what you do, you can’t win.”Of course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola’s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model — bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront — has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola’s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola — a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week — says he doesn’t care.“It’s really part of the noise,” Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can’t sell any shares for the next 12 months. “I don’t really have any emotion to those numbers because they’re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.”Nikola’s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn’t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.’s pickup franchise that’s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn’t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola’s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.“You can’t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,” said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.”Milton, who’s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola’s listing, saw Citron’s post.“He never even bothered reaching out,” Milton said of Left. “He doesn’t give a s— about the facts.”Milton’s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit “laughable” and said the claims were “absurd” on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola’s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was “time to go all out” and put Tesla’s Semi into volume production.“He doesn’t like us, and that’s OK,” Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums “a humbling experience.”He then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture — an alarm-system company — for about $1.5 million. “I thought I was on top of the world,” he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that’s part of the billionaire Agnelli family’s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola’s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company’s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.“Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s done,” Milton said. “I’m an innovator, I’ll let the haters hate. I’m here to create, I’m not here to destroy.”Bloomberg.com"

Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.The car renter wants to take advantage of the quixotic rally in its stock by offering as many as 246.78 million common shares, according to a court filing. The proceeds would provide some much-needed working capital while Hertz tries to dig out from massive debts that forced it into court protection. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for later today to consider the idea.“This is what I love about bankruptcy — there’s never a dull moment,” said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with the law firm Otterbourg, who said she hasn’t seen a financing like this.Hertz gained 41 per cent to US$2.90 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and rose as high as US$3.47. Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.“The recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz’s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,” the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that “the common stock could ultimately be worthless” and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.“As odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,” said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University’s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there’s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That’s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt — including Hertz’ bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value — would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.“A lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?” Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling “given the volatile state of trading in Hertz’s stock.” Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.“It is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn’t buy those shares,” said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV’s William S. Boyd School of Law, who said she has never seen a bankruptcy funded this way. “I guess they’re trying to catch whatever the opposite of a falling knife is.”The case is The Hertz Corporation, 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.Bloomberg.com"

For a company that’s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale’s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first — and won’t be the last. Its self-inflicted wounds have sapped confidence across the entire industry, leaving many smaller operators teetering on the edge of catastrophe.As the remnants of shale’s turn-of-the-century heyday turn to dust, it’s unclear who — if anyone — will step into the void. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake’s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. “Extreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,” Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that’s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable — and therefore, worthless — by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company’s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon’s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC’s decades-long grip on the world’s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.“They were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,” said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Right now we’re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.”Gordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move — intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas — occurred just in time to expand the company’s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn’t find buyers.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

U.S. jobless claims remained high, underscoring the longer-term challenges caused by the pandemic. The report came out a day after the Federal Reserve provided a dour economic outlook. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn’t shut down the economy again even if there is another surge in coronavirus cases.“The move from the bottom in terms of the rally has been so mind boggling.

That could be extended past the planned June 21 expiry, the CBC and Reuters reported this week.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has enacted a mandatory 14-day quarantine on anyone returning to the country, even if they have no symptoms. Some provinces have even barred entry by Canadians living in other provinces.“These emergency measures need to be introduced with a certain sense of proportionality,” Rovinescu said Thursday on a webcast with Aviation Week.The growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths has slowed in most of Canada and provinces have lifted many pandemic restrictions on businesses.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world’s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU’s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the “buy box” on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer — whether from Amazon’s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant — is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It’s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products — prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon’s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants “expect the EU to clearly punish” Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.“All merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants’ data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,” he said in an email. “Amazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked” without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to “cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.” Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission’s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven’t always opened the way to more competition. Google’s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn’t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"

Tesla produced less than 103,000 cars in the first quarter to Toyota’s 2.4 million.On Thursday, another one of Musk’s followers referred to his May 1 tweet in which he wrote that Tesla’s stock price was, in his opinion, too high. The billionaire wrote back with a link to a web address he bought early last year, stankmemes.com.The website features a “stonks” meme image in which a character is standing in front of stock prices and next to an upward pointing arrow.Bloomberg.com"

The Treasury curve steepened sharply after the central bank said it will at least maintain the current rate of bond purchases.Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 282.86 points, or 1.04 per cent, to 26,989.44, the S&P 500 lost 17.12 points, or 0.53 per cent, to 3,190.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.59 points, or 0.67 per cent, to 10,020.35.“It seems like profit-taking is underway after the Fed didn’t deliver any new measures,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “It’s not as easy to take risk at this point.”U.S. equities have rallied more than 40 per cent from their March lows as central-bank asset purchases and unprecedented stimulus sparked demand for risk assets. Earlier Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that the U.S. “definitely” needs additional fiscal stimulus.Stocks may be the ultimate beneficiary of trillions of dollars in economic stimulus from the Fed, according to Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Corp.’s chief U.S. equity strategist. “Liquidity looking for a home” is bolstering the FANG stocks — Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google’s owner, Alphabet Inc. — along with their technology-driven peers, she wrote in a report this week.The danger, though, is that any complication in the economic recovery could see market gains swiftly reverse — at a time when there’s less room for additional support. The pandemic is splintering the world economy, and policy makers can’t risk a premature withdrawal of lifelines to businesses and the most vulnerable people, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned.

Musk didn’t give a time frame for when he expects mass output to actually happen. Just six weeks ago, Tesla said that initial deliveries would be postponed to 2021, roughly two years later than initially planned.If Musk was looking to regain the attention of any investors whose eyes had wandered toward Nikola Corp., the market got the memo. Tesla’s stock surged past US$1,000 for the first time, while shares of newly listed Nikola sold off following days of hype about its plans to bring battery-electric and fuel cell-powered haulers to market in the coming years.“Given some of the other news flow in the past month to two months on the Class 8 truck market, I think he’s probably trying to keep Tesla in the marketing cycle just for all the mega trends going on in trucking,” Jeff Osborne, a Cowen & Co. analyst, said of Musk.

Operating income will decline as much as US$2.2 billion in the period, the company said in a statement.The guidance underscores the depth of the challenges for consumer-facing businesses from the coronavirus outbreak and worldwide lockdowns. The coffee seller, which is exploring new store formats to stimulate demand, is being closely watched as a barometer of customers’ willingness to leave their homes and open their wallets as the pandemic subsides.“These numbers are a lot worse than the Street was expecting,” said Michael Halen, senior restaurant analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “People expect some sort of crazy snapback but it’s not going to materialize in restaurants.”Starbucks plans to accelerate the rollout of its “pickup” store concept, with smaller-format locations that don’t have customer seating. “While we had originally planned to execute this strategy over a three- to five-year timeframe, rapidly evolving customer preferences hasten the need for this concept.”The pandemic has forced Starbucks to rethink its central concept of being a “third place” away from work and home for customers to relax, it said.The company expects to open 300 net new stores this fiscal year in the Americas, half of its earlier estimate. That includes the closure of 400 company-operated ones over the next 18 months alongside the opening of a “greater number of new, repositioned stores in different locations and with innovative store formats.”Starbucks is also examining its Canada operations and plans to restructure its business there over the next two years. The company said it will potentially close 200 additional stores there, with some of these changing locations.In China, the company says it is on track to add at least 500 net new stores this fiscal year, despite the virus impact.Chains dependent on breakfast sales, like Starbucks, have gotten hit disproportionately hard because there are so many fewer commuters on the road these days. Starbucks’ price point is also higher than rivals like Dunkin’, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Halen said, making it less well positioned heading into a pandemic-related recession.On top of that, a smaller share of its stores have drive-thrus than rivals. Lingering in the café enjoying a coffee was a key part of the “third place” experience, but that concept is “toast right now,” Halen said.“They’re really behind here. I don’t blame the management team, the management team is excellent — it’s just the impact of coronavirus is going to hurt them that much more because it’s a café,” he said.The shares fell as much as 4.7 per cent on Wednesday, the most intraday in more than a month. Starbucks had declined 6.3 per cent this year through Tuesday’s close.The company’s comments also dragged down peers, with an S&P index of restaurant stocks falling as much as 2.7 per cent, the most in almost a month. Starbucks, due to its size and propensity to give regular updates, is seen as a proxy for the industry.In the U.S., its critical home market, comparable sales were down 43 per cent in May, though things have been improving with each passing week, Starbucks said. About 95 per cent of the company’s U.S. stores are operating currently, even as many New York City sites remain shuttered. That’s a contrast to China, its other key market and a country further along the road to post-pandemic recovery, where 99 per cent of stores are open and same-store sales were down just 21 per cent in May.While sales have fallen, customers that do go to Starbucks are spending more during the pandemic, with the average order including more items, the company said. This is expected to normalize over time.Bloomberg.com"

Ives maintained his neutral rating but boosted his price target to US$1,000 from US$800 and said his new bull case implies shares could be worth US$1,500 from US$1,350 previously.Further demand for electric vehicles in China paired with the easing of lockdowns in both the U.S. and much of Europe and the potential for “game-changing” battery developments at a company event planned for this month signal shares can move higher, Ives wrote.Shares of the Palo Alto, California-based electric-vehicle maker rallied as much as 6.8 per cent Wednesday to touch a record US$1,005. The shares have nearly quintupled in the past year as its market value ballooned to US$185 billion.Tesla’s highly anticipated “Battery Day” will provide the next setting for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk to announce a number of new potential developments, according to Ives.

With the pandemic ebbing, the exhibitor has begun reopening in Europe and is planning to restart at home, too.AMC on Tuesday recorded an adjusted first-quarter loss of US$2.22 a share, after announcing preliminary results announced on June 3. Revenue slumped to US$941.5 million. The outlook this period looks worse: The chain has been closed since March 17, meaning most of the second quarter has been lost. While California is allowing theatres to reopen this weekend, AMC has said it expects to be fully open globally next month.During the quarter, AMC also wrote down the value of its assets, including acquisitions, leading to a charge of US$1.85 billion and the large net loss.All of AMC’s thousands of screens around the world have been dark for months amid the coronavirus lockdowns, and they will reopen under severe restrictions. In California, where AMC has more than 50 locations, cinemas can reopen June 12, but may only fill a quarter of the seats in order to maintain social distancing.The chain is also embroiled in a dispute with Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures after the studio, one of Hollywood’s largest, released “Trolls World Tour” to online audiences the same day the picture opened in theatres. AMC said it would stop showing Universal movies, and demanded the studio respect theatre owners’ traditional exclusive rights to show new movies for about 90 days.The Leawood, Kansas-based chain warned last week it won’t be able to stay in business if theatres can’t reopen, and is negotiating with lenders, asking them to accept a steep haircut on existing debt.

The number of users holding Whiting Petroleum Corp. grew roughly 10,000 in the last 24 hours.Two things the companies have in common: They’ve filed for bankruptcy protection. And each saw their shares double to start the week.It’s the same thing for Chesapeake Energy, as it prepares a potential filing. In the past, the court process usually wiped out equity shareholders. In this day and age, as small day traders salivate at any opportunity to get rich quick, a filing has apparently become a buy signal for many of them. There’s evidence retail investor actions have become a decisive driver of price.“Retail has a lot to do with it and I don’t think you’ve seen institutional investors buying those kinds of stocks,” said Christopher Grisanti, chief equity strategist at MAI Capital Management. “It’s too much risk. I would call it catching a falling knife.”The 2020 stock market has been full of peculiarities that nobody saw coming. The fastest drop for the S&P 500 into a bear market, followed by the fastest 50-day rebound in nine decades. Mom and pop scrambling to the right side of the recovery trade, while the advice of Wall Street legends falls flat. A health-care crisis forcing one of the deepest recessions, and in the midst of it, equities emerging unscathed.In a market as bizarre as this, it seems only fitting that the next step would be a growing affinity for companies that can’t pay their debts.According to website Robintrack, which uses Robinhood’s data to show trends in positioning but isn’t affiliated with it, individual investors on the app have been flocking to bankruptcy-protected companies in droves. (The site says it downloads popularity data each hour for every stock directly from Robinhood via a public application programming interface, or API. A Robinhood spokesperson declined to comment for this story.)Of course, interest in these stocks isn’t flowing solely from Robinhood clients. But the app is a lens into retail interest, particularly among younger investors, because unlike other popular brokerages, it’s possible to see holdings of its users in real-time. Some of the rallies in these shares may also be due to short covering.Robintrack’s data show 159,000 users now hold Hertz stock in some form. That’s a record high, and up from 37,000 users a month ago. Over the last three days, the car rental firm has seen the largest surge in popularity on the platform. Right now, more users on the investing app hold bankrupt Hertz than do Netflix Inc.Call it crazy, but don’t call it dumb. In the three sessions through Monday, Hertz shares surged 577%, just weeks after the company filed for bankruptcy. Trading volume in the stock has surged to an average of 197 million shares a day in June — more than 60 times what was typical in 2019.Chesapeake Energy has seen a similar turn. The oil company jumped 182 per cent on Monday, and after markets closed, news broke that the firm was said to be preparing to file for bankruptcy. More than 20 million shares changed hands, the most turnover on record for the stock in a single day, Bloomberg data show. In recent days, Chesapeake’s popularity with users of Robinhood ballooned to 38,000 — a gain of 9,000.Same with Whiting Petroleum, a shale driller that went bankrupt in April. The number of users holding shares of the company rose to a record 50,000 this week. On Monday, the stock surged 152 per cent, and more than 104 million shares traded.“It’s great that Vegas is open again, but who needs it when you have the stock market instead,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer for Bleakley Financial Group. “After an incredible run since March, we now have clear froth in parts of the market. We know this level of speculation has coincided with a sharp increase in the activity of retail investors.”Boockvar added the activity has been encouraged by a “zero rate” and “unlimited QE” environment, referring to the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing measures. Ahead of the central bank’s decision Wednesday, he’s not the only one laying blame.“In this tape, bankruptcies have become the flavour of the day,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “At what point will Jay Powell and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve realize they have broken the market’s pricing mechanism? The bankruptcies are only a small part of the story.”Bloomberg.com"

That compares with US$31 billion during the 2008-2009 recession.The grim forecast comes as airlines seek to gradually restart operations with the pandemic beginning to recede. Industry debt has jumped by about US$120 billion, a level many carriers will be unable to sustain without governments stepping in to convert borrowing into equity, the trade body said. The alternative to a rise in state ownership would be mass bankruptcies, it said.“Losses this year will be the biggest in aviation history,” IATA Chief Executive Officer Alexandre de Juniac said on a call with reporters. “There is no comparison for the dimensions of this crisis.”While IATA hasn’t previously estimated losses, it said the anticipated decline in passenger revenue this year has widened to US$371 billion from the US$314 billion forecast in April. The drop including non-passenger sales may be US$419 billion.Losses will amount to between 15 per cent and 30 per cent of revenue depending on the region, with no prospect of a return to profitability until 2022 at the earliest even if there’s no second wave of coronavirus infections.Airlines are set to end the year with about US$550 billion in total debt, IATA forecast. That means the sector’s borrowings next year will be 16 times earnings even on an Ebitdar basis, stretching from 4.6 times in 2019.There is no comparison for the dimensions of this crisisWhile some carriers may be able to cope by raising fresh equity themselves, stretched balance sheets are likely to lead to many states buying stakes, it said. Only US$11 billion of the US$123 billion in various forms of aid provided so far has been in the form of direct investment.Global connectivity will also be reduced, with the number of city-pair links down by about 25 per cent by the end of the year even after operations resume, the trade body said. Yields, a measure of fares, are likely to be down by around 20 per cent as airlines cut prices to attract passengers back to travel.Bloomberg.com"

The 42 per cent surge from a March low is the best advance over an equivalent time-frame since 2009 for the MSCI ACWI Index that includes stocks in both the emerging and developed world. The gauge is now trading at 20 times next year’s profits, the most expensive since 2002.“This rally is a function of government support being thrown behind the economy,” said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions and client advisory for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “There are key risks that could lead to more volatility ahead over the short term, which is why we continue to hedge our portfolios on the downside while still looking for opportunities to add risk for the medium to long term.”So far bulls are in charge. U.S. stocks just crossed an important psychological milestone of recouping this year’s losses. Asia’s equity benchmark just posted its seventh straight day of gains, the longest streak in more than two years. And euro-area shares are on course for their best monthly gain since 2015.Factors including a wall of money from the guardians of global economies, the easing of lockdowns and the shockingly positive employment numbers in the U.S. are drawing more buyers to participate, picking up cheaper sectors and adding more fuel to the rally. Yet caution still abounds with some investors increasing hedges for potential volatility ahead.“The risk of a correction will rise if investors continue to price in a rapid recovery, especially for sectors that are vulnerable to another wave of infections or an escalation of tensions between the U.S. and China,” said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.In another sign that the rally is stretched, global share-price gains in the past month have purely come from multiple expansion as earnings forecasts have barely budged since May. Adding to that is the fact the MSCI world measure has been in overbought territory since the start of the month, with the relative strength gauge on the index reaching the highest since January, which is considered a bearish signal by some.Meanwhile, speculative excess has surged to the highest in at least 20 years among U.S. options traders, a negative for stocks over the medium term, according to Sundial Capital Research Inc. And a time-honored strategy of hedging stocks with government bonds has become questionable now that bond yields have plummeted thanks to policy easing across the world.“If everyone is holding stocks just to pass on to the next greater fool, and if the greatest fool is a central bank with infinite liquidity to buy them, then, yes, prices will keep going up,” according to a note from Rabobank on Tuesday.With files from ReutersBloomberg.com"

Bobo’s, a Boulder, Colorado-based producer of snack bars and toaster pastries, has stocked up on organic oats, sugar and coconut oil, Chief Executive Officer TJ McIntyre said in an interview.“We just wanted to have an insurance plan for our business. If we ran out of oats, we’d be in trouble,” he said. “In a first-time situation like this pandemic, there’s a lot of questions we can’t answer.”His company is currently buying about 50 per cent more of its main ingredients. This affords it an extra 90 days to solve any potential supply-chain hiccups.This is a striking shift in strategy for food companies that for years built up just-in-time inventories, which minimize storage costs. It also underscores the lessons that were learned after the coronavirus pandemic upended supply chains and sparked concerns over shortages of some ingredients.Robert Moskow, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said that food companies are bringing in more raw materials and packaging to help guarantee they can meet demand from retailers, where stocks of goods have fallen.“Retail has below average inventory, they’re trying to get as much as they can from producers,” Moskow said.More money tied up in physical goods may also mean fewer new products — referred to as “innovation” in the industry. Saffron Road, for example, recently cut two ramen bowls because they didn’t sell as well as other items and it’s cheaper to focus on core offerings. This represents another big change for food companies, which had prior to COVID-19 resorted to new, experimental products — like Kraft Heinz Co.’s mayochup — to create buzz.One of the things weighing on the minds’ of consumers and scientists alike is whether cooler weather will cause coronavirus infections to spike again — potentially creating another boom in grocery demand. Second waves of the virus have been reported in China, South Korea and Hong Kong.Saffron Road, which makes frozen beef bulgogi meals and chickpea masala meal pouches, is buying 50 per cent more inventory than before — and has plans to boost purchases even more later in the year, CEO Adnan Durrani said. It’s a risk to cash flow, he said, but one that’s worth taking amid a surge in demand.The company will double its inventory heading into September, in case there’s another spike in demand tied to rising COVID-19 cases again. He hopes, of course, this isn’t the case.“We saw frozen foods go up dramatically during COVID,” Durrani said. “Hopefully we flatten the curve.”Taika, a canned coffee startup in San Francisco, has loaded up on ashwagandha powder — a plant-derived ingredient used in its coffee that’s seen limited supply recently because it’s sourced from India. With lockdowns there limiting the producer’s ability to ship, Taika is now holding about six months of supply instead of just three months before the pandemic hit, founder Kal Freese said.“For small business, you end up having more capital tied up in inventory,” he said.Campbell, which has seen a surge in demand for pantry staples including Prego pasta sauce and Kettle potato chips, has stocked up on certain ingredients to make sure it doesn’t run out, CEO Mark Clouse said in an interview on June 3. The company is betting consumer demand will remain high — it now sees sales from continuing operations rising as much as 6.5 per cent this year, a big jump from its previous range.“Demand has remained very elevated,” Clouse said. “So our production and supply chain is really running flat out. We are working non-stop in a way that’s practical and safe to create some cushion as it relates to inventory.”Gokhan Egilmez, an associate professor at the University of New Haven, agrees that higher demand is likely to persist. He predicted the pandemic will “continue to cause radical transformations” across industries until a vaccine or treatment is found.“As we all know, the pandemic already shifted consumption habits,” Egilmez said. “People may still find it not appealing to dine out or order from outside.”Bloomberg.com"

The county, a hub of agricultural activity where workers jam into often crowded factories to package apples and other foods, has the highest per capita infection rate on the West Coast.It’s a grim reality that’s playing out across the country as COVID-19 spreads beyond the meat plants that have captured the national spotlight. At least 60 food-processing facilities outside the meatpacking industry have seen outbreaks, with more than 1,000 workers diagnosed with the virus, according to a new study from Environmental Working Group.These are the first national numbers of their kind. The advocacy group compiled its figures using local media reports because there are no federal agencies reporting the data. The true total is almost certainly higher. Fruit and vegetable packers, bakers and dairy workers are risking infection as the virus spreads through processing plants where employees deemed essential have mostly remained on the job during the pandemic, sometimes labouring in close quarters.“At our workplace, we were not ready for this virus. We didn’t talk about it. We didn’t know about it,” said Paula Zambrano, a 61-year-old who works part time as a fruit sorter for Borton & Sons in Yakima. She was so concerned by an outbreak at the plant in April that the she didn’t come in for three weeks, but then she had to return to support herself.“People are infected and they come to work. They keep quiet about it,” she said. “We live from our work. We are surviving from our wages. If we have children, how will we feed them?”Borton & Sons didn’t respond to voicemail messages left for John Borton, an owner and director of business operation, and Eric Borton, director of business development.People are infected and they come to work. They keep quiet about itAmerica’s food suppliers have seen some of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks of any industry outside health care. Dozens of meatpacking workers have died, with thousands falling sick. The virus has also spread among employees at farms, where in all likelihood cases will keep climbing as more than half a million seasonal migrants spread out across the nation as the summer harvesting season ramps up.In addition to the human tragedy, the outbreaks also expose the vulnerability of America’s food supply. The meat industry was already plunged into crisis with plant shutdowns that sparked grocery-store shortages. Even as that situation eases, more shortfalls of individual food items and ingredients are likely in the months ahead unless the virus’s spread is slowed at food-processing plants, said Kevin Kenny, chief operating officer of Decernis, an expert in global food safety and supply chains.There are about 1.7 million workers at food and beverage manufacturing facilities, of which roughly 500,000 are at meat processors, according to a 2018 U.S. Census Bureau survey.Unions, advocacy groups and experts have said that employers haven’t done enough to keep workers safe, with protective gear including face masks and gloves not being widely distributed until infections had already started to spread. Conditions inside plants can be crowded, and fast-moving processing lines may not allow enough space for social distancing. The largely immigrant labour-force also faces tough living conditions, with cramped housing — sometimes in employer provided bunkhouse-style dormitories that can sleep four to 10 to a room.About 35 per cent of food processing and dairy facilities have had at least one confirmed COVID-19 case, according to an International Brotherhood of Teamsters survey in May of union locals representing 79 plants. Roughly 80 per cent of employers weren’t testing for the virus and more than a quarter of the workplaces didn’t allow employees to physically distance themselves 6 feet apart, the survey showed.The Teamsters union is planning a national “call to action” on Wednesday with demonstrations in almost 30 cities for better protection of food supply-chain workers.Still, the Teamsters have seen a “marked decline” in reports of outbreaks at union-represented food processing facilities in the past several weeks as employers have established more robust safety procedures, said Rome Aloise, director of the union’s dairy and food processing divisions. Union-represented employers are doing more no-touch temperature testing, strict adherence to safety protocols, including use of protective gear, and placing portable sanitation stations in workspaces, Aloise said.“Non-union counterparts aren’t doing the same things,” he said.Zambrano, the fruit worker in Washington, said her employer was initially slow to implement measures but now takes temperatures as employees enter work, provides masks and maintains social distancing.Industry trade groups say that employers have invested heavily in measures to protect workers against infection risk while continuing to operate to maintain the nation’s food supply.But employers have also run into issues because of shifting direction from authorities on proper protective measures. For example, fruit packers were initially told masks were unnecessary and were encouraged to donate inventories for use by health care workers, said Jon DeVaney, president of the Washington State Tree Fruit Association. Employers were then confronted with short supplies of protective equipment when the advice changed, he said.“We have to stay open to supply essential goods for the American people,” said Geoff Freeman, president of the Consumer Brands Association. Companies have taken many steps to protect workers, including providing protective equipment and by implementing “aggressive” measures to make sure sick employees who stay home are compensated, he said.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration included food-processing facilities in jointly issued industry-specific guidance for manufacturing. Freeman said more protocols are needed, including, as one example, direction on what portion of positive cases in a workforce should trigger a plant shutdown.“Make no mistake: We cannot eliminate the risk. The challenge for us is to mitigate the risk,” Freeman said. “You have different companies approaching this in different ways. The more we have federal clarity, the more we can have consistency.”Labour advocates are pressing for stronger action to protect workers. Scott Faber, the Environmental Working Group’s senior vice president for government affairs, called on the Trump administration to impose mandatory safety standards to protect food industry workers, help procure protective equipment and provide federal aid to help retrofit plants to protect workers.“Food processing workers, who are disproportionately people of colour, are taking enormous and largely avoidable risks to keep the rest of us fed, but the Trump Administration has failed to ensure they are safe,” Faber said.Food processing workers, who are disproportionately people of colour, are taking enormous and largely avoidable risks to keep the rest of us fedIn Washington, workers at the company where Cruz had worked, Allan Bros. Inc., held a strike starting on May 7 to demand better protections. Cruz participated in a demonstration May 8, but was sick by the next day, according to Edgar Franks, political director of Familias Unidas por la Justicia, the local union.After three weeks, a deal was reached between workers and Allan Bros. The company — located in Naches, just outside of Yakima — agreed to provide masks to employees and to follow CDC guidance on coronavirus. It also said it would, where possible, require social distancing of at least 6 feet, and where not, it would provide face shields and plexiglass barriers, according to Franks. The company also pledged a temporary US$1 an hour raise through June 26, he said.The strike ended May 28. Cruz died on May 31.Allan Bros. confirmed it received a request for comment through its outside public relations firm but didn’t immediately respond further.Cases in Yakima help to illustrate why the figures from Environmental Working Group are almost certainly an undercount.Columbia Legal Services, a non-profit legal aid program in Washington state, filed a public records law request for confirmed COVID cases by employer from Yakima County health authorities. It showed 470 cases at 23 fruit facilities as of June 2. The Environmental Working Group’s list shows only 31 cases at one facility from the county. At one Yakima facility, 19% of the workforce had a confirmed coronavirus diagnosis, according to the county list.“Workers at these packing houses started to get sick in large numbers,” said Franks, whose group helped to organize the memorial caravan for Cruz. “It’s always on the minds of people, that it could be one of them or their friends of family. That’s a real concern.”Bloomberg.com"

The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who’s argued the extradition was politically motivated.“The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,” the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize “the highly political nature of the arrest,” the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn’t attend Meng’s arrest “in an effort to avoid perception of influence.”In filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of “coordinated state misconduct,” describing the handling of her arrest as “so serious” that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting “a political persecution” against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng’s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained“This planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,” the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng’s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — who’ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged. China-Canada relations are in their darkest period in decades after China also halted billions of dollars in Canadian imports and put two other Canadians on death row.Meng is seeking an unredacted version of the memo, along with further documents that Canada is withholding on national security grounds. She plans to appoint a lawyer with security clearance to argue on her behalf in closed proceedings at the Federal Court in Ottawa.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they’re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola’s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.“We had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, ‘You know what, it’s not worth people thinking that we’re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that’s using people’s money,’” Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.“People started bashing us because they said, ‘Oh you don’t have deposits.’ It’s like, good hell, you can’t win with these people,” Milton said. “No matter what you do, you can’t win.”Of course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola’s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model — bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront — has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola’s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola — a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week — says he doesn’t care.“It’s really part of the noise,” Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can’t sell any shares for the next 12 months. “I don’t really have any emotion to those numbers because they’re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.”Nikola’s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn’t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.’s pickup franchise that’s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn’t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola’s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.“You can’t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,” said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.”Milton, who’s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola’s listing, saw Citron’s post.“He never even bothered reaching out,” Milton said of Left. “He doesn’t give a s— about the facts.”Milton’s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit “laughable” and said the claims were “absurd” on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola’s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was “time to go all out” and put Tesla’s Semi into volume production.“He doesn’t like us, and that’s OK,” Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums “a humbling experience.”He then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture — an alarm-system company — for about $1.5 million. “I thought I was on top of the world,” he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that’s part of the billionaire Agnelli family’s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola’s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company’s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.“Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s done,” Milton said. “I’m an innovator, I’ll let the haters hate. I’m here to create, I’m not here to destroy.”Bloomberg.com"

Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.The car renter wants to take advantage of the quixotic rally in its stock by offering as many as 246.78 million common shares, according to a court filing. The proceeds would provide some much-needed working capital while Hertz tries to dig out from massive debts that forced it into court protection. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for later today to consider the idea.“This is what I love about bankruptcy — there’s never a dull moment,” said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with the law firm Otterbourg, who said she hasn’t seen a financing like this.Hertz gained 41 per cent to US$2.90 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and rose as high as US$3.47. Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.“The recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz’s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,” the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that “the common stock could ultimately be worthless” and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.“As odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,” said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University’s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there’s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That’s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt — including Hertz’ bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value — would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.“A lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?” Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling “given the volatile state of trading in Hertz’s stock.” Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.“It is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn’t buy those shares,” said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV’s William S. Boyd School of Law, who said she has never seen a bankruptcy funded this way. “I guess they’re trying to catch whatever the opposite of a falling knife is.”The case is The Hertz Corporation, 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.Bloomberg.com"

For a company that’s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale’s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first — and won’t be the last. Its self-inflicted wounds have sapped confidence across the entire industry, leaving many smaller operators teetering on the edge of catastrophe.As the remnants of shale’s turn-of-the-century heyday turn to dust, it’s unclear who — if anyone — will step into the void. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake’s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. “Extreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,” Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that’s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable — and therefore, worthless — by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company’s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon’s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC’s decades-long grip on the world’s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.“They were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,” said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Right now we’re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.”Gordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move — intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas — occurred just in time to expand the company’s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn’t find buyers.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

The KBW Bank Index of financial heavyweights plunged 9%, and energy shares joined a rout in oil.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,861.82 points, or 6.9 per cent, to 25,128.17. The S&P 500 lost 188.04 points, or 5.89 per cent, to 3,002.1 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 527.62 points, or 5.27 per cent, to 9,492.73.The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 650.41, or 4.14 per cent, to 15,050.92.While much of the equity selling owed to the frantic pace of the recent rally, sentiment did sour as signs mounted that a possible second wave of the pandemic could be taking hold in some states. U.S. jobless claims remained high, underscoring the longer-term challenges caused by the pandemic. The report came out a day after the Federal Reserve provided a dour economic outlook. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn’t shut down the economy again even if there is another surge in coronavirus cases.“The move from the bottom in terms of the rally has been so mind boggling. Over the new few weeks, we could see some pullback,” said Solita Marcelli, deputy Americas chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. “That’s mostly the fears of second wave concerns going higher, also we had the Fed yesterday. Their assessment of the economy was a little bit weaker than what the market expected.”As restrictions are lifted across the country, signs of a second wave of cases have been raising alarms. More than 2 million people in the U.S. have been infected so far. The localized surges have raised concerns among experts even as the nation’s overall case count early this week rose just under 1%, the smallest increase since March.“Sentiment has become much more cautious,” said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade. “We actually started to get data that indicated reopenings are going extremely well, and now we’re starting to get some of the headlines that maybe the reopenings are going to at least pause.”These are some of the main moves in markets:With a file from Reuters Bloomberg.com"

That could be extended past the planned June 21 expiry, the CBC and Reuters reported this week.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has enacted a mandatory 14-day quarantine on anyone returning to the country, even if they have no symptoms. Some provinces have even barred entry by Canadians living in other provinces.“These emergency measures need to be introduced with a certain sense of proportionality,” Rovinescu said Thursday on a webcast with Aviation Week.The growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths has slowed in most of Canada and provinces have lifted many pandemic restrictions on businesses. Canada is closing in on 100,000 cases with almost 8,000 deaths.Transport Minister Marc Garneau’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Airlines are pushing back after months of limitations on travel. A move by the U.K. government to force a quarantine rule on incoming travellers sparked an uproar, with carriers including British Airways parent IAG SA saying they’ll mount a legal challenge.Air Canada has cut 20,000 jobs and said it does not see a return to 2019 levels of revenue and capacity for at least three years — an outlook Rovinescu reiterated on Thursday. To weather the storm, it has raised new equity and debt and expanded cargo services, but it has not tapped into an emergency loan program from Ottawa.The airline said last month it expects capacity in the third quarter to be 75 per cent lower than in the same period last year. Bookings reached a bottom in April and the first two weeks of May and have been improving since then, Rovinescu said Thursday.The company’s shares were down 9.4 per cent to $17.67 at 12:20 p.m. in Toronto as global markets tumbled on concerns about a second wave of the pandemic, bringing their decline to about 63 per cent this year.In response to a comment that the border restrictions have worked out reasonably well, Rovinescu said: “I can tell you one thing.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world’s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU’s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the “buy box” on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer — whether from Amazon’s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant — is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It’s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products — prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon’s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants “expect the EU to clearly punish” Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.“All merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants’ data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,” he said in an email. “Amazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked” without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to “cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.” Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission’s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven’t always opened the way to more competition. Google’s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn’t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"

The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who’s argued the extradition was politically motivated.“The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,” the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize “the highly political nature of the arrest,” the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn’t attend Meng’s arrest “in an effort to avoid perception of influence.”In filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of “coordinated state misconduct,” describing the handling of her arrest as “so serious” that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting “a political persecution” against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng’s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained“This planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,” the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng’s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — who’ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged. China-Canada relations are in their darkest period in decades after China also halted billions of dollars in Canadian imports and put two other Canadians on death row.Meng is seeking an unredacted version of the memo, along with further documents that Canada is withholding on national security grounds. She plans to appoint a lawyer with security clearance to argue on her behalf in closed proceedings at the Federal Court in Ottawa.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they’re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola’s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.“We had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, ‘You know what, it’s not worth people thinking that we’re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that’s using people’s money,’” Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.“People started bashing us because they said, ‘Oh you don’t have deposits.’ It’s like, good hell, you can’t win with these people,” Milton said. “No matter what you do, you can’t win.”Of course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola’s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model — bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront — has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola’s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola — a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week — says he doesn’t care.“It’s really part of the noise,” Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can’t sell any shares for the next 12 months. “I don’t really have any emotion to those numbers because they’re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.”Nikola’s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn’t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.’s pickup franchise that’s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn’t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola’s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.“You can’t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,” said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.”Milton, who’s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola’s listing, saw Citron’s post.“He never even bothered reaching out,” Milton said of Left. “He doesn’t give a s— about the facts.”Milton’s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit “laughable” and said the claims were “absurd” on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola’s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was “time to go all out” and put Tesla’s Semi into volume production.“He doesn’t like us, and that’s OK,” Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums “a humbling experience.”He then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture — an alarm-system company — for about $1.5 million. “I thought I was on top of the world,” he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that’s part of the billionaire Agnelli family’s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola’s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company’s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.“Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s done,” Milton said. “I’m an innovator, I’ll let the haters hate. I’m here to create, I’m not here to destroy.”Bloomberg.com"

Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.The car renter wants to take advantage of the quixotic rally in its stock by offering as many as 246.78 million common shares, according to a court filing. The proceeds would provide some much-needed working capital while Hertz tries to dig out from massive debts that forced it into court protection. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for later today to consider the idea.“This is what I love about bankruptcy — there’s never a dull moment,” said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with the law firm Otterbourg, who said she hasn’t seen a financing like this.Hertz gained 41 per cent to US$2.90 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and rose as high as US$3.47. Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.“The recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz’s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,” the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that “the common stock could ultimately be worthless” and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.“As odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,” said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University’s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there’s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That’s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt — including Hertz’ bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value — would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.“A lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?” Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling “given the volatile state of trading in Hertz’s stock.” Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.“It is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn’t buy those shares,” said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV’s William S. Boyd School of Law, who said she has never seen a bankruptcy funded this way. “I guess they’re trying to catch whatever the opposite of a falling knife is.”The case is The Hertz Corporation, 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.Bloomberg.com"

For a company that’s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale’s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first — and won’t be the last. Its self-inflicted wounds have sapped confidence across the entire industry, leaving many smaller operators teetering on the edge of catastrophe.As the remnants of shale’s turn-of-the-century heyday turn to dust, it’s unclear who — if anyone — will step into the void. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake’s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. “Extreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,” Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that’s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable — and therefore, worthless — by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company’s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon’s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC’s decades-long grip on the world’s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.“They were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,” said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Right now we’re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.”Gordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move — intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas — occurred just in time to expand the company’s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn’t find buyers.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

The dollar rose.Real-estate, financial and energy companies led gains in the S&P 500. Cruise operators and airlines that were among the hardest-hit during the rout soared. Earlier Friday, the gauge fell as the World Health Organization said the risk of a second wave of coronavirus is present for any country exiting lockdowns. States and cities might have to resume shutdowns if cases surge dramatically, top officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.A rally of more than 40 per centthat carried equity benchmarks well off their March lows stumbled this week on pessimism about the pace of recovery following months of lockdown. Arizona and Oklahoma were among U.S. states to report record one-day increases in new coronavirus cases, a month after easing restrictions. Florida had the biggest daily jump since May 1. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said a new wave of cases hasn’t appeared.“I don’t think that much has really changed.

Only one company in the gauge — supermarket operator Kroger Co. — finished higher. Losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were even deeper, with the blue-chip gauge dropping as much as 7.1 per cent.

U.S. jobless claims remained high, underscoring the longer-term challenges caused by the pandemic. The report came out a day after the Federal Reserve provided a dour economic outlook. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn’t shut down the economy again even if there is another surge in coronavirus cases.“The move from the bottom in terms of the rally has been so mind boggling. Over the new few weeks, we could see some pullback,” said Solita Marcelli, deputy Americas chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. “That’s mostly the fears of second wave concerns going higher, also we had the Fed yesterday. Their assessment of the economy was a little bit weaker than what the market expected.”As restrictions are lifted across the country, signs of a second wave of cases have been raising alarms. More than 2 million people in the U.S. have been infected so far. The localized surges have raised concerns among experts even as the nation’s overall case count early this week rose just under 1%, the smallest increase since March.“Sentiment has become much more cautious,” said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade. “We actually started to get data that indicated reopenings are going extremely well, and now we’re starting to get some of the headlines that maybe the reopenings are going to at least pause.”These are some of the main moves in markets:With a file from Reuters Bloomberg.com"

That could be extended past the planned June 21 expiry, the CBC and Reuters reported this week.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has enacted a mandatory 14-day quarantine on anyone returning to the country, even if they have no symptoms. Some provinces have even barred entry by Canadians living in other provinces.“These emergency measures need to be introduced with a certain sense of proportionality,” Rovinescu said Thursday on a webcast with Aviation Week.The growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths has slowed in most of Canada and provinces have lifted many pandemic restrictions on businesses. Canada is closing in on 100,000 cases with almost 8,000 deaths.Transport Minister Marc Garneau’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Airlines are pushing back after months of limitations on travel. A move by the U.K. government to force a quarantine rule on incoming travellers sparked an uproar, with carriers including British Airways parent IAG SA saying they’ll mount a legal challenge.Air Canada has cut 20,000 jobs and said it does not see a return to 2019 levels of revenue and capacity for at least three years — an outlook Rovinescu reiterated on Thursday. To weather the storm, it has raised new equity and debt and expanded cargo services, but it has not tapped into an emergency loan program from Ottawa.The airline said last month it expects capacity in the third quarter to be 75 per cent lower than in the same period last year.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world’s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU’s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the “buy box” on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer — whether from Amazon’s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant — is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It’s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products — prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon’s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants “expect the EU to clearly punish” Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.“All merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants’ data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,” he said in an email. “Amazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked” without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to “cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.” Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission’s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven’t always opened the way to more competition. Google’s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn’t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"

The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who’s argued the extradition was politically motivated.“The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,” the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize “the highly political nature of the arrest,” the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn’t attend Meng’s arrest “in an effort to avoid perception of influence.”In filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of “coordinated state misconduct,” describing the handling of her arrest as “so serious” that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting “a political persecution” against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng’s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained“This planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,” the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng’s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — who’ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged. China-Canada relations are in their darkest period in decades after China also halted billions of dollars in Canadian imports and put two other Canadians on death row.Meng is seeking an unredacted version of the memo, along with further documents that Canada is withholding on national security grounds. She plans to appoint a lawyer with security clearance to argue on her behalf in closed proceedings at the Federal Court in Ottawa.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they’re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola’s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.“We had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, ‘You know what, it’s not worth people thinking that we’re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that’s using people’s money,’” Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.“People started bashing us because they said, ‘Oh you don’t have deposits.’ It’s like, good hell, you can’t win with these people,” Milton said. “No matter what you do, you can’t win.”Of course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola’s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model — bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront — has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola’s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola — a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week — says he doesn’t care.“It’s really part of the noise,” Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can’t sell any shares for the next 12 months. “I don’t really have any emotion to those numbers because they’re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.”Nikola’s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn’t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.’s pickup franchise that’s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn’t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola’s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.“You can’t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,” said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.”Milton, who’s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola’s listing, saw Citron’s post.“He never even bothered reaching out,” Milton said of Left. “He doesn’t give a s— about the facts.”Milton’s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit “laughable” and said the claims were “absurd” on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola’s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was “time to go all out” and put Tesla’s Semi into volume production.“He doesn’t like us, and that’s OK,” Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums “a humbling experience.”He then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture — an alarm-system company — for about $1.5 million. “I thought I was on top of the world,” he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that’s part of the billionaire Agnelli family’s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola’s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company’s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.“Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s done,” Milton said. “I’m an innovator, I’ll let the haters hate. I’m here to create, I’m not here to destroy.”Bloomberg.com"

Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.The car renter wants to take advantage of the quixotic rally in its stock by offering as many as 246.78 million common shares, according to a court filing. The proceeds would provide some much-needed working capital while Hertz tries to dig out from massive debts that forced it into court protection. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for later today to consider the idea.“This is what I love about bankruptcy — there’s never a dull moment,” said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with the law firm Otterbourg, who said she hasn’t seen a financing like this.Hertz gained 41 per cent to US$2.90 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and rose as high as US$3.47. Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.“The recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz’s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,” the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that “the common stock could ultimately be worthless” and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.“As odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,” said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University’s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there’s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That’s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt — including Hertz’ bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value — would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.“A lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?” Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling “given the volatile state of trading in Hertz’s stock.” Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.“It is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn’t buy those shares,” said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV’s William S. Boyd School of Law, who said she has never seen a bankruptcy funded this way. “I guess they’re trying to catch whatever the opposite of a falling knife is.”The case is The Hertz Corporation, 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.Bloomberg.com"

For a company that’s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale’s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first — and won’t be the last.

Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake’s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. “Extreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,” Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that’s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable — and therefore, worthless — by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company’s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon’s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC’s decades-long grip on the world’s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.“They were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,” said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Right now we’re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.”Gordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move — intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas — occurred just in time to expand the company’s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn’t find buyers.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

The dollar rose.Real-estate, financial and energy companies led gains in the S&P 500. Cruise operators and airlines that were among the hardest-hit during the rout soared. Earlier Friday, the gauge fell as the World Health Organization said the risk of a second wave of coronavirus is present for any country exiting lockdowns. States and cities might have to resume shutdowns if cases surge dramatically, top officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.A rally of more than 40 per centthat carried equity benchmarks well off their March lows stumbled this week on pessimism about the pace of recovery following months of lockdown.

Only one company in the gauge — supermarket operator Kroger Co. — finished higher. Losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were even deeper, with the blue-chip gauge dropping as much as 7.1 per cent. Airlines, cruise and travel shares that soared in recent weeks bore the brunt of the selling.

U.S. jobless claims remained high, underscoring the longer-term challenges caused by the pandemic. The report came out a day after the Federal Reserve provided a dour economic outlook. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn’t shut down the economy again even if there is another surge in coronavirus cases.“The move from the bottom in terms of the rally has been so mind boggling. Over the new few weeks, we could see some pullback,” said Solita Marcelli, deputy Americas chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. “That’s mostly the fears of second wave concerns going higher, also we had the Fed yesterday. Their assessment of the economy was a little bit weaker than what the market expected.”As restrictions are lifted across the country, signs of a second wave of cases have been raising alarms. More than 2 million people in the U.S. have been infected so far. The localized surges have raised concerns among experts even as the nation’s overall case count early this week rose just under 1%, the smallest increase since March.“Sentiment has become much more cautious,” said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade. “We actually started to get data that indicated reopenings are going extremely well, and now we’re starting to get some of the headlines that maybe the reopenings are going to at least pause.”These are some of the main moves in markets:With a file from Reuters Bloomberg.com"

That could be extended past the planned June 21 expiry, the CBC and Reuters reported this week.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has enacted a mandatory 14-day quarantine on anyone returning to the country, even if they have no symptoms. Some provinces have even barred entry by Canadians living in other provinces.“These emergency measures need to be introduced with a certain sense of proportionality,” Rovinescu said Thursday on a webcast with Aviation Week.The growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths has slowed in most of Canada and provinces have lifted many pandemic restrictions on businesses. Canada is closing in on 100,000 cases with almost 8,000 deaths.Transport Minister Marc Garneau’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Airlines are pushing back after months of limitations on travel. A move by the U.K. government to force a quarantine rule on incoming travellers sparked an uproar, with carriers including British Airways parent IAG SA saying they’ll mount a legal challenge.Air Canada has cut 20,000 jobs and said it does not see a return to 2019 levels of revenue and capacity for at least three years — an outlook Rovinescu reiterated on Thursday. To weather the storm, it has raised new equity and debt and expanded cargo services, but it has not tapped into an emergency loan program from Ottawa.The airline said last month it expects capacity in the third quarter to be 75 per cent lower than in the same period last year.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world’s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU’s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the “buy box” on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer — whether from Amazon’s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant — is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It’s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products — prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon’s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants “expect the EU to clearly punish” Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.“All merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants’ data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,” he said in an email. “Amazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked” without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to “cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.” Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission’s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven’t always opened the way to more competition. Google’s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn’t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"

The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who’s argued the extradition was politically motivated.“The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,” the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize “the highly political nature of the arrest,” the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn’t attend Meng’s arrest “in an effort to avoid perception of influence.”In filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of “coordinated state misconduct,” describing the handling of her arrest as “so serious” that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting “a political persecution” against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng’s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained“This planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,” the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng’s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — who’ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged. China-Canada relations are in their darkest period in decades after China also halted billions of dollars in Canadian imports and put two other Canadians on death row.Meng is seeking an unredacted version of the memo, along with further documents that Canada is withholding on national security grounds. She plans to appoint a lawyer with security clearance to argue on her behalf in closed proceedings at the Federal Court in Ottawa.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they’re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola’s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.“We had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, ‘You know what, it’s not worth people thinking that we’re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that’s using people’s money,’” Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.“People started bashing us because they said, ‘Oh you don’t have deposits.’ It’s like, good hell, you can’t win with these people,” Milton said. “No matter what you do, you can’t win.”Of course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola’s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model — bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront — has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola’s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola — a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week — says he doesn’t care.“It’s really part of the noise,” Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can’t sell any shares for the next 12 months. “I don’t really have any emotion to those numbers because they’re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.”Nikola’s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn’t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.’s pickup franchise that’s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn’t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola’s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.“You can’t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,” said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.”Milton, who’s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola’s listing, saw Citron’s post.“He never even bothered reaching out,” Milton said of Left. “He doesn’t give a s— about the facts.”Milton’s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit “laughable” and said the claims were “absurd” on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola’s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was “time to go all out” and put Tesla’s Semi into volume production.“He doesn’t like us, and that’s OK,” Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums “a humbling experience.”He then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture — an alarm-system company — for about $1.5 million. “I thought I was on top of the world,” he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that’s part of the billionaire Agnelli family’s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola’s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company’s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.“Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s done,” Milton said. “I’m an innovator, I’ll let the haters hate. I’m here to create, I’m not here to destroy.”Bloomberg.com"

Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.“The recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz’s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,” the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that “the common stock could ultimately be worthless” and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.“As odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,” said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University’s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there’s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That’s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt — including Hertz’ bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value — would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.“A lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?” Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling “given the volatile state of trading in Hertz’s stock.” Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.“It is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn’t buy those shares,” said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV’s William S. Boyd School of Law, who said she has never seen a bankruptcy funded this way. “I guess they’re trying to catch whatever the opposite of a falling knife is.”The case is The Hertz Corporation, 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",David Wethe and Joe Carroll,Chesapeake's demise marks end of shale model that changed the world,Financial reality has at long last caught up with Chesapeake Energy Corp.,https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/chesapeakes-demise-marks-end-of-shale-model-that-changed-the-world,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/chesapeake-energy-corp..jpg,"June 12, 2020 7:03 AM EDT","It will go down as wildest of the shale wildcatters, the overreaching pioneer of fracking techniques that minted vast fortunes and, now, has left behind ruin.At long last, financial reality has caught up with Chesapeake Energy Corp., avatar of the boom and subsequent bust of North American shale.Chesapeake’s spiral toward oblivion accelerated this week with executives said to be preparing for a potential bankruptcy filing, signaling the imminent end of Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler’s 7-year campaign to turn around the troubled gas explorer. For a company that’s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale’s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first — and won’t be the last. Its self-inflicted wounds have sapped confidence across the entire industry, leaving many smaller operators teetering on the edge of catastrophe.As the remnants of shale’s turn-of-the-century heyday turn to dust, it’s unclear who — if anyone — will step into the void. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake’s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. “Extreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,” Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that’s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable — and therefore, worthless — by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company’s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon’s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC’s decades-long grip on the world’s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.“They were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,” said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Right now we’re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.”Gordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move — intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas — occurred just in time to expand the company’s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn’t find buyers.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Earlier Friday, the gauge fell as the World Health Organization said the risk of a second wave of coronavirus is present for any country exiting lockdowns. States and cities might have to resume shutdowns if cases surge dramatically, top officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.A rally of more than 40 per centthat carried equity benchmarks well off their March lows stumbled this week on pessimism about the pace of recovery following months of lockdown. Arizona and Oklahoma were among U.S. states to report record one-day increases in new coronavirus cases, a month after easing restrictions. Florida had the biggest daily jump since May 1.

Only one company in the gauge — supermarket operator Kroger Co. — finished higher. Losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were even deeper, with the blue-chip gauge dropping as much as 7.1 per cent. Airlines, cruise and travel shares that soared in recent weeks bore the brunt of the selling.

U.S. jobless claims remained high, underscoring the longer-term challenges caused by the pandemic. The report came out a day after the Federal Reserve provided a dour economic outlook. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn’t shut down the economy again even if there is another surge in coronavirus cases.“The move from the bottom in terms of the rally has been so mind boggling. Over the new few weeks, we could see some pullback,” said Solita Marcelli, deputy Americas chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. “That’s mostly the fears of second wave concerns going higher, also we had the Fed yesterday. Their assessment of the economy was a little bit weaker than what the market expected.”As restrictions are lifted across the country, signs of a second wave of cases have been raising alarms. More than 2 million people in the U.S. have been infected so far. The localized surges have raised concerns among experts even as the nation’s overall case count early this week rose just under 1%, the smallest increase since March.“Sentiment has become much more cautious,” said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade. “We actually started to get data that indicated reopenings are going extremely well, and now we’re starting to get some of the headlines that maybe the reopenings are going to at least pause.”These are some of the main moves in markets:With a file from Reuters Bloomberg.com"

That could be extended past the planned June 21 expiry, the CBC and Reuters reported this week.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has enacted a mandatory 14-day quarantine on anyone returning to the country, even if they have no symptoms. Some provinces have even barred entry by Canadians living in other provinces.“These emergency measures need to be introduced with a certain sense of proportionality,” Rovinescu said Thursday on a webcast with Aviation Week.The growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths has slowed in most of Canada and provinces have lifted many pandemic restrictions on businesses.

To weather the storm, it has raised new equity and debt and expanded cargo services, but it has not tapped into an emergency loan program from Ottawa.The airline said last month it expects capacity in the third quarter to be 75 per cent lower than in the same period last year.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world’s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU’s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the “buy box” on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer — whether from Amazon’s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant — is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It’s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products — prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon’s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants “expect the EU to clearly punish” Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.“All merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants’ data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,” he said in an email. “Amazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked” without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to “cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.” Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission’s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven’t always opened the way to more competition. Google’s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn’t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"

The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who’s argued the extradition was politically motivated.“The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,” the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize “the highly political nature of the arrest,” the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn’t attend Meng’s arrest “in an effort to avoid perception of influence.”In filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of “coordinated state misconduct,” describing the handling of her arrest as “so serious” that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting “a political persecution” against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng’s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained“This planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,” the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng’s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — who’ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged. China-Canada relations are in their darkest period in decades after China also halted billions of dollars in Canadian imports and put two other Canadians on death row.Meng is seeking an unredacted version of the memo, along with further documents that Canada is withholding on national security grounds. She plans to appoint a lawyer with security clearance to argue on her behalf in closed proceedings at the Federal Court in Ottawa.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they’re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola’s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.“We had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, ‘You know what, it’s not worth people thinking that we’re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that’s using people’s money,’” Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.“People started bashing us because they said, ‘Oh you don’t have deposits.’ It’s like, good hell, you can’t win with these people,” Milton said. “No matter what you do, you can’t win.”Of course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola’s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model — bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront — has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola’s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola — a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week — says he doesn’t care.“It’s really part of the noise,” Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can’t sell any shares for the next 12 months. “I don’t really have any emotion to those numbers because they’re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.”Nikola’s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn’t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.’s pickup franchise that’s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn’t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola’s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.“You can’t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,” said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.”Milton, who’s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola’s listing, saw Citron’s post.“He never even bothered reaching out,” Milton said of Left. “He doesn’t give a s— about the facts.”Milton’s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit “laughable” and said the claims were “absurd” on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola’s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was “time to go all out” and put Tesla’s Semi into volume production.“He doesn’t like us, and that’s OK,” Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums “a humbling experience.”He then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture — an alarm-system company — for about $1.5 million. “I thought I was on top of the world,” he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that’s part of the billionaire Agnelli family’s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola’s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company’s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.“Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s done,” Milton said. “I’m an innovator, I’ll let the haters hate. I’m here to create, I’m not here to destroy.”Bloomberg.com"

Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.The car renter wants to take advantage of the quixotic rally in its stock by offering as many as 246.78 million common shares, according to a court filing. The proceeds would provide some much-needed working capital while Hertz tries to dig out from massive debts that forced it into court protection. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for later today to consider the idea.“This is what I love about bankruptcy — there’s never a dull moment,” said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with the law firm Otterbourg, who said she hasn’t seen a financing like this.Hertz gained 41 per cent to US$2.90 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and rose as high as US$3.47. Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.“The recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz’s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,” the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that “the common stock could ultimately be worthless” and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.“As odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,” said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University’s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there’s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That’s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt — including Hertz’ bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value — would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.“A lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?” Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling “given the volatile state of trading in Hertz’s stock.” Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.“It is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn’t buy those shares,” said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV’s William S. Boyd School of Law, who said she has never seen a bankruptcy funded this way. “I guess they’re trying to catch whatever the opposite of a falling knife is.”The case is The Hertz Corporation, 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.Bloomberg.com"

For a company that’s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale’s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first — and won’t be the last. Its self-inflicted wounds have sapped confidence across the entire industry, leaving many smaller operators teetering on the edge of catastrophe.As the remnants of shale’s turn-of-the-century heyday turn to dust, it’s unclear who — if anyone — will step into the void. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake’s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. “Extreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,” Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that’s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable — and therefore, worthless — by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company’s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon’s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC’s decades-long grip on the world’s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.“They were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,” said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Right now we’re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.”Gordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move — intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas — occurred just in time to expand the company’s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn’t find buyers.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Only one company in the gauge — supermarket operator Kroger Co. — finished higher. Losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were even deeper, with the blue-chip gauge dropping as much as 7.1 per cent.

U.S. jobless claims remained high, underscoring the longer-term challenges caused by the pandemic. The report came out a day after the Federal Reserve provided a dour economic outlook. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn’t shut down the economy again even if there is another surge in coronavirus cases.“The move from the bottom in terms of the rally has been so mind boggling. Over the new few weeks, we could see some pullback,” said Solita Marcelli, deputy Americas chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. “That’s mostly the fears of second wave concerns going higher, also we had the Fed yesterday. Their assessment of the economy was a little bit weaker than what the market expected.”As restrictions are lifted across the country, signs of a second wave of cases have been raising alarms. More than 2 million people in the U.S. have been infected so far. The localized surges have raised concerns among experts even as the nation’s overall case count early this week rose just under 1%, the smallest increase since March.“Sentiment has become much more cautious,” said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade. “We actually started to get data that indicated reopenings are going extremely well, and now we’re starting to get some of the headlines that maybe the reopenings are going to at least pause.”These are some of the main moves in markets:With a file from Reuters Bloomberg.com"

That could be extended past the planned June 21 expiry, the CBC and Reuters reported this week.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has enacted a mandatory 14-day quarantine on anyone returning to the country, even if they have no symptoms. Some provinces have even barred entry by Canadians living in other provinces.“These emergency measures need to be introduced with a certain sense of proportionality,” Rovinescu said Thursday on a webcast with Aviation Week.The growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths has slowed in most of Canada and provinces have lifted many pandemic restrictions on businesses.

To weather the storm, it has raised new equity and debt and expanded cargo services, but it has not tapped into an emergency loan program from Ottawa.The airline said last month it expects capacity in the third quarter to be 75 per cent lower than in the same period last year.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world’s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU’s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the “buy box” on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer — whether from Amazon’s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant — is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It’s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products — prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon’s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants “expect the EU to clearly punish” Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.“All merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants’ data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,” he said in an email. “Amazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked” without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to “cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.” Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission’s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven’t always opened the way to more competition. Google’s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn’t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"

The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who’s argued the extradition was politically motivated.“The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,” the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize “the highly political nature of the arrest,” the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn’t attend Meng’s arrest “in an effort to avoid perception of influence.”In filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of “coordinated state misconduct,” describing the handling of her arrest as “so serious” that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting “a political persecution” against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng’s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained“This planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,” the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng’s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians — Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig — who’ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged.

The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they’re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola’s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.“We had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, ‘You know what, it’s not worth people thinking that we’re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that’s using people’s money,’” Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.“People started bashing us because they said, ‘Oh you don’t have deposits.’ It’s like, good hell, you can’t win with these people,” Milton said. “No matter what you do, you can’t win.”Of course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola’s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model — bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront — has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola’s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola — a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week — says he doesn’t care.“It’s really part of the noise,” Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can’t sell any shares for the next 12 months. “I don’t really have any emotion to those numbers because they’re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.”Nikola’s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn’t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.’s pickup franchise that’s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn’t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola’s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.“You can’t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,” said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.”Milton, who’s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola’s listing, saw Citron’s post.“He never even bothered reaching out,” Milton said of Left. “He doesn’t give a s— about the facts.”Milton’s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit “laughable” and said the claims were “absurd” on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola’s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was “time to go all out” and put Tesla’s Semi into volume production.“He doesn’t like us, and that’s OK,” Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums “a humbling experience.”He then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture — an alarm-system company — for about $1.5 million. “I thought I was on top of the world,” he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that’s part of the billionaire Agnelli family’s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola’s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company’s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.“Come back in 12 months and watch how it’s done,” Milton said. “I’m an innovator, I’ll let the haters hate. I’m here to create, I’m not here to destroy.”Bloomberg.com"

Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.The car renter wants to take advantage of the quixotic rally in its stock by offering as many as 246.78 million common shares, according to a court filing. The proceeds would provide some much-needed working capital while Hertz tries to dig out from massive debts that forced it into court protection. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for later today to consider the idea.“This is what I love about bankruptcy — there’s never a dull moment,” said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with the law firm Otterbourg, who said she hasn’t seen a financing like this.Hertz gained 41 per cent to US$2.90 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and rose as high as US$3.47. Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.“The recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz’s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,” the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that “the common stock could ultimately be worthless” and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.“As odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,” said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University’s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there’s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That’s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt — including Hertz’ bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value — would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.“A lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?” Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling “given the volatile state of trading in Hertz’s stock.” Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.“It is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn’t buy those shares,” said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV’s William S. Boyd School of Law, who said she has never seen a bankruptcy funded this way. “I guess they’re trying to catch whatever the opposite of a falling knife is.”The case is The Hertz Corporation, 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.Bloomberg.com"

For a company that’s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale’s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first — and won’t be the last. Its self-inflicted wounds have sapped confidence across the entire industry, leaving many smaller operators teetering on the edge of catastrophe.As the remnants of shale’s turn-of-the-century heyday turn to dust, it’s unclear who — if anyone — will step into the void. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake’s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. “Extreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,” Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that’s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable — and therefore, worthless — by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company’s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon’s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC’s decades-long grip on the world’s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.“They were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,” said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. “Right now we’re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.”Gordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move — intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas — occurred just in time to expand the company’s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn’t find buyers.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Only one company in the gauge — supermarket operator Kroger Co. — finished higher. Losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were even deeper, with the blue-chip gauge dropping as much as 7.1 per cent. Airlines, cruise and travel shares that soared in recent weeks bore the brunt of the selling.

U.S. jobless claims remained high, underscoring the longer-term challenges caused by the pandemic. The report came out a day after the Federal Reserve provided a dour economic outlook. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn’t shut down the economy again even if there is another surge in coronavirus cases.“The move from the bottom in terms of the rally has been so mind boggling. Over the new few weeks, we could see some pullback,” said Solita Marcelli, deputy Americas chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. “That’s mostly the fears of second wave concerns going higher, also we had the Fed yesterday. Their assessment of the economy was a little bit weaker than what the market expected.”As restrictions are lifted across the country, signs of a second wave of cases have been raising alarms. More than 2 million people in the U.S. have been infected so far. The localized surges have raised concerns among experts even as the nation’s overall case count early this week rose just under 1%, the smallest increase since March.“Sentiment has become much more cautious,” said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade. “We actually started to get data that indicated reopenings are going extremely well, and now we’re starting to get some of the headlines that maybe the reopenings are going to at least pause.”These are some of the main moves in markets:With a file from Reuters Bloomberg.com"

That could be extended past the planned June 21 expiry, the CBC and Reuters reported this week.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has enacted a mandatory 14-day quarantine on anyone returning to the country, even if they have no symptoms. Some provinces have even barred entry by Canadians living in other provinces.“These emergency measures need to be introduced with a certain sense of proportionality,” Rovinescu said Thursday on a webcast with Aviation Week.The growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths has slowed in most of Canada and provinces have lifted many pandemic restrictions on businesses.

To weather the storm, it has raised new equity and debt and expanded cargo services, but it has not tapped into an emergency loan program from Ottawa.The airline said last month it expects capacity in the third quarter to be 75 per cent lower than in the same period last year.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world’s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU’s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the “buy box” on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer — whether from Amazon’s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant — is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It’s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products — prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon’s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants “expect the EU to clearly punish” Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.“All merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants’ data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,” he said in an email. “Amazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked” without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to “cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.” Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission’s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven’t always opened the way to more competition. Google’s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn’t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"
